The project area comprises 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands within the Clear Creek drainage, located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho. The Clear Creek watershed lies within the Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) area. The proposed action was advertised for public scoping in January 2012. The Notice of Intent to prepare this document was published in the Federal Register on February 17, 2012. The Notice of Availability for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was published in the Federal Register on April 19, 2013. Comments that were received, including the names and addresses of those who commented, are part of the public record for this project and are available for public inspection. Comments were used to develop the alternative array presented in the FEIS. The alternatives respond to a broad range of public sentiment regarding vegetation management, and frame the significant issues related to the decision. This project proposes timber harvest, commercial thinning, precommercial thinning, prescribed fire, reforestation, native grass restoration, and road system improvements to achieve desired age class and species distributions and to improve watershed health. The original FEIS was published in April 2015, and was accompanied by a Draft Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The 45-day objection period for the Draft ROD began February 26, 2015. In response to objections received for the Draft ROD, the FEIS was updated and republished in September 2015. The Forest Supervisor plans to issue a Final ROD in October 2015.  Table of Contents LIST OF TABLES ..............................................................................................................................................

Road decommissioning, culvert replacements, and road improvements are proposed to improve watershed health, and the restoration of 41 acres of bunchgrass communities through revegetation with native grasses and forbs is proposed to improve vegetative diversity. The project area comprises 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands within the Clear Creek drainage, located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho. The purpose of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project (Project) is to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; improve elk habitat effectiveness; improve habitat for early seral species; and maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs, support the economic structure of local communities, and provide for regional and national needs. Desired conditions for the Project area were identified after careful consideration of the existing condition of the area; applicable Forest Plan management direction, recommendations in the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001); and the needs, opportunities, and issues identified by a site-specific interdisciplinary watershed assessment and pre-National Environmental Policy Act (pre-NEPA) analysis conducted in 2011 for the Project area. Completing the Project will move the area toward a Desired Future Condition as defined in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan1 (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-1 and II-2). 1 Forest Plan direction for this project is found in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987b) since the project area lies within the administrative boundaries of the Nez Perce National Forest. The Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests were administratively combined in February 2013, but the existing Forest Plans for each Forest will continue to guide management actions until the Forest Plans are revised. Revision of the 1987 Forest Plans is currently ongoing. The Clear Creek Project is part of the larger Selway-Middle Fork Clearwater Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project. In 2010, the Clearwater Basin Collaborative (CBC) in partnership with the Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests produced a comprehensive restoration strategy that was submitted for funding through the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP). This science-based proposal was designed to restore and maintain ecological conditions within the 1.4-million-acre Selway–Middle Fork ecosystem in Idaho. The Selway-Middle Fork Clearwater CFLRP proposal includes the following goals: • Protect communities, private lands, and Wild and Scenic River corridors from uncharacteristic wildland fires • Reestablish and perpetuate landscapes that are diverse and resilient • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote aquatic health • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote habitat for big game and other terrestrial species • Contain or eliminate noxious weeds • Promote landscape conditions that allow fire to function as the primary restoration agent • Contribute to the economy and sustainability of rural communities Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of this EIS. To accelerate watershed recovery, some watershed improvement activities were authorized under separate decision documents. The effects of those projects have been incorporated into the existing condition of this EIS or have been addressed in the cumulative effects analysis for this project. Watershed improvement projects associated with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project include: 10 miles of system road decommissioning, 73 miles of non-system road decommissioning, 4 miles of road reconstruction, 49 culvert replacements, and 22 culvert removals. Most of these projects have already been implemented. Future projects include the Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project, which proposes decommissioning 65 miles of nonsystem roads and removing 15 culverts (see Appendix J of FEIS for a more detailed outline). The Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater area is identified as a top priority for restoration in national, regional, state, and county plans and in a subbasin assessment. The 43,731 acres of National Forest System lands in the Clear Creek watershed lies within the Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater CFLRP area. A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012, extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that are included in this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), was advertised on February 7, 2013. The original FEIS was published in April 2015, and was accompanied by a Draft Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The 45-day objection period for the Draft ROD began February 26, 2015. In response to objections received for the Draft ROD, the FEIS was updated and republished in September 2015. The Forest Supervisor plans to issue a Final ROD in October 2015. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project has been presented at quarterly meetings with the Nez Perce Tribe since April 2012. The project was presented for public scoping in January 2012. The following issues related to the project proposal were raised during scoping: • Increasing patch sizes and reducing fragmentation • Improving the availability and distribution of foraging habitat relative to hiding cover • Increasing the amount of early successional stands and wildlife foraging habitats • Improving forest structure • Providing jobs in Idaho County • Reducing planning and implementation costs by managing on a large scale • Reducing total road mileages and densities in the Clear Creek watershed • Reducing sediment input to stream channels • Reducing cumulative impacts of past timber harvest and road building on fisheries habitat, water quality, and soil productivity • Reducing effects of the road network on elk security habitat • Meeting Desired Future Conditions for watersheds, fish, and wildlife habitats These issues led the interdisciplinary team to develop alternatives to the proposed action. This FEIS analyzes a total of four alternatives, including a No Action Alternative. The alternatives are briefly summarized below. The issues and alternatives are described in greater detail in Chapter 2. These activities are common to all action alternatives: 41 acres of grass restoration, 1,371 acres of prescribed fire, 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 119.8 miles of system road reconstruction, 48.8 miles of system road reconditioning, 13.2 miles of system road decommissioning, and two site-specific Forest Plan amendments adopting the Region 1 soil standard of 15% for detrimentally disturbed soils, and clarifying the definition of old growth found in Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Alternative A (No Action) This alternative provides a baseline for comparing the environmental consequences of the other alternatives. Under the No Action alternative, no project activities would be implemented. Alternative B (Proposed Action, as Modified in Response to Scoping Comments) This alternative was developed in response to the purpose and need for action identified during the pre-NEPA phase of project development. It was presented for public scoping in January 2012. Alternative B would move the project area toward the desired future conditions (DFCs) that were identified for the project during the pre-NEPA phase. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative B proposes 2,609 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 5,606 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. Alternative C (Maximal Species Conversion) This alternative would address vegetative restoration needs described in the purpose and need for action but to a greater degree than Alternative B. Alternative C would regenerate as many stands as possible while meeting objectives for other resources. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative C would include 4,156 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 331 acres of improvement harvest; 4,220 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 27.6 miles of new temporary road construction. Alternative D (Minimal Road Construction) Alternative D would address the need for vegetative rehabilitation in the Clear Creek watershed but to a lesser degree than Alternative B. Alternative D would use existing road templates as much as possible while still meeting the need for vegetative restoration. In addition to the activities common to all action alternatives, Alternative D would include 2,178 acres of regeneration harvest, site preparation, and reforestation; 211 acres of improvement harvest; 5,141 acres of commercial thinning; 8.7 miles of temporary road construction on existing templates; and 8.8 miles of new temporary road construction. To help describe the environmental effects of each alternative as they pertain to the identified issues, the interdisciplinary team developed “indicators” that help measure the differences between the alternatives. The effects of the alternatives, as measured by these indicators, are summarized in Table S-1. Table S-1.

Road decommissioning, culvert replacements, and road improvements are proposed to improve watershed health, and the restoration of 41 acres of bunchgrass communities through revegetation with native grasses and forbs is proposed to improve vegetative diversity and reduce the spread of noxious weeds. 1.1 PROJECT HISTORY Congress established the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) with Title IV of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. In addition to encouraging the collaborative, science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes, the CFLRP has the following program goals: • Encourage ecological, economic, and social sustainability • Leverage local resources with national and private resources • Facilitate the reduction of wildfire management costs, including through re-establishing natural fire regimes and reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire • Demonstrate the degree to which various ecological restoration techniques achieve ecological and watershed health objectives • Encourage utilization of forest restoration by-products to offset treatment costs, benefit local rural economies, and improve forest health The CFLRP established a fund to be used for restoration work on priority landscapes. Up to $4 million annually can be requested by selected projects. The Clearwater Basin Collaborative (CBC), in partnership with the Nez Perce-Clearwater Forests, developed and submitted a comprehensive restoration proposal, the Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater project, in 2010. The proposal outlined an ambitious strategy to plan and implement a number of projects, such as aquatic restoration, weed treatments, road decommissioning, fuel reductions, and forest restoration, across the 1.4-million-acre Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater ecosystem in Idaho. The Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater area is identified as a top priority for restoration in national, regional, State, and County plans and in a forest subbasin assessment. The Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater CFLRP proposal included the following goals: • Protect communities, private lands, and Wild and Scenic River corridors from uncharacteristic wildland fires • Reestablish and perpetuate landscapes that are diverse and resilient • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote aquatic health • Restore forest structure, function, and ecologic processes that promote habitat for big game and other terrestrial species • Contain or eliminate noxious weeds • Promote landscape conditions that allow fire to function as the primary restoration agent • Contribute to the economy and sustainability of rural communities Proposals were reviewed in Washington, D.C., by the CFLRP Advisory Committee and 10 recommendations were forwarded to the Secretary of Agriculture for funding. The Selway–Middle Fork Clearwater project was selected for funding by the Secretary of Agriculture in August 2010. At the heart of the proposal was the Clear Creek landscape, selected as a priority for treatment by the Forests and the CBC. In August 2010, Clear Creek was selected for an assessment to determine the types, locations, and amounts of appropriate management actions that would address CFLRP goals and objectives. The Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) prepared this assessment of the Clear Creek watershed in 2011; the assessment summarized Nez Perce Forest Plan direction appropriate to the Clear Creek area, compared existing landscape conditions to desired conditions described in the Forest Plan, and identified projects that would implement the CFLRP intent, while meeting, or progressing toward, desired conditions. Projects recommended through the 2011 assessment would promote forest conditions that are resistant to forest pathogens and invasive species and resilient to wildfire and climate change; reduce wildfire risks on National Forest System (NFS)–managed lands that are adjacent to private property; promote healthy riparian and stream habitats important for fish and wildlife species; promote forest habitats that support productive populations of elk, moose, goshawk, pileated woodpecker, fisher, flammulated owl, and old forest habitats; develop a road system that provides administrative, recreational, and industrial uses while protecting sensitive habitats, minimizing sediment delivery to streams, and minimizing road construction and maintenance costs; and provide social and economic benefits to local communities. Desired conditions for the Clear Creek watershed were developed using Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) (USDA Forest Service 1987a) direction; broad-scale assessments (e.g., Integrated Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia Basin [USDA Forest Service 1997] and Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment [USDA Forest Service 2001]); and the best science currently available. The development of desired conditions for the Clear Creek project was periodically reviewed by the CBC for consistency with the CFLRP and to ensure that the project proposal was socially, ecologically, and economically robust. In the spirit of transparency, these same desired conditions were also shared with and input solicited from other routine Forest planning participants (e.g., Friends of the Clearwater and Alliance for the Wild Rockies). During the pre-National Environmental Policy Act (pre-NEPA) phase of Project development, the IDT identified large polygons or patches within the Project area referred to as “Focus Areas.” The Focus Areas were identified based on a need to promote similar age classes by connecting recently regenerated stands (preferably within the last 20 years). The intent was to establish breaks in continuous fuels, favor areas with known or developing forest health issues, and target over-represented mid seral and mature age classes. The IDT also attempted to bound these areas with identifiable features, such as forest type breaks, topographic breaks, and administrative boundaries. The Focus Areas served as the basis for developing the Proposed Action. A new Focus Area, developed after the Proposed Action was presented for scoping, has been added to all of the action alternatives in this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS). It includes about 420 acres of regeneration harvest and some commercial thin and precommercial thin units lying outside of the original configuration of the Focus Areas. The new Focus Area includes 1.2 miles of temporary roads, some of which would be on existing templates. A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012, extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that are included in this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), was advertised on February 7, 2013. The original FEIS was published in April 2015, and was accompanied by a Draft Record of Decision (ROD) identifying the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The 45-day objection period for the Draft ROD began February 26, 2015. In response to objections received for the Draft ROD, the FEIS was updated and republished in September 2015. The Forest Supervisor plans to issue a Final ROD in October 2015. 1.2 PROJECT AREA The Clear Creek drainage lies within the Middle Fork Clearwater River drainage near Kooskia, Idaho. The Clear Creek drainage totals 65,000 acres, with 33% (21,269 acres) in private or State ownership and the remaining 67% (43,731 acres) under the management of the Moose Creek Ranger District. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project area includes all 43,731 acres of NFS lands within the Clear Creek drainage (Figure 1-1). All of the project area lies within the upper two-thirds of the drainage. The project area is located approximately 5 air miles southeast of Kooskia, Idaho, within Townships 30, 31, and 32 N, Ranges 5 and 6 E, Boise Meridian. Black and white map of northern Idaho that shows the location of the Clearwater National Forest, Nez Perce National Forest, and cities in the area. Figure 1-1. Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Vicinity Map 1.3 PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION The purpose of the project is to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; improve early seral wildlife habitat; and maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity. These actions are needed to move resource conditions in the project area from existing conditions toward desired conditions. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs, support the economic structure of local communities, and provide for regional and national needs. The following resource management opportunities were identified for the Project area based on the existing condition of the area, applicable Forest Plan management direction; recommendations in the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001); and the needs, opportunities, and issues identified by an interdisciplinary watershed assessment and National Forest Management Act (NFMA) analysis conducted in 2011.  Vegetation and Wildlife Habitat Improvement 1.3.11.3.1.1 Existing Condition Historic logging practices and fire suppression have affected the diversity of tree species in the Project area. Ladder fuels have increased, and a shift to more shade-tolerant species has occurred. Currently, a higher percentage of grand fir and Douglas-fir exist than natural long-term disturbances patterns would have created and that would have dominated these habitat types in the absence of historic logging and fire suppression. Grand fir and Douglas-fir are more susceptible to insects and disease and grand fir is less likely to survive intense wildfires than early seral species (e.g., ponderosa pine, western larch, and western white pine). In addition to affecting species composition, young forest habitat is lacking on this landscape. Patches of young forest that do exist are smaller with edges that are straighter and more even than natural disturbances would have created. 1.3.1.2 Desired Condition The desired condition is a forest structure with a range of age and size classes with species diversity that is resistant and resilient to change agents such as insects, diseases, and wildfires. Early seral species should represent a greater percentage of the species mix. 1.3.1.3 Need for Action Vegetation in this area needs to be managed to create a more diverse and resilient forest structure by creating a range of age and size classes, species diversity, and disturbance patterns that more closely emulate the results of natural disturbance. A need exists to shift tree species composition away from shade-tolerant species toward more resistant and resilient early seral species. A need also exists to increase diversity within previously harvested areas to restore long-term habitat quality for sensitive and old growth-associated species and to manage vegetation to increase young forest habitat.  Goods and Services 1.3.21.3.2.1 Existing Condition Much of the Project area consists of grand fir-dominated stands. Insect and disease infestations are contributing to increased tree mortality, while decreasing timber volume and value. 1.3.2.2 Desired Condition The desired condition is to provide a sustained yield of resource outputs as directed by the Nez Perce Forest Plan. 1.3.2.3 Need for Action Stands that are infested with insects and diseases need to be treated so that the harvested timber can provide materials for local industries.  Watershed Improvement 1.3.31.3.3.1 Existing Condition Gravel and native surface roads could contribute sediment to stream channels, which can affect water quality and fish habitat. The road system in the Clear Creek watershed has already been substantially reduced. The West Fork-South Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Decision Notice/Finding of No Significant Impact (DN/FONSI) (USDA Forest Service 2011c) project decommissioned 85 miles of roads. However, additional road decommissioning opportunities are available in the Clear Creek watershed. 1.3.3.2 Desired Condition The desired condition is a well-maintained road system in the Clear Creek watershed that is disconnected from stream networks and adequate to provide for the goals and objectives described in the Nez Perce Forest Plan (primarily timber harvest, recreation, fire suppression, and administrative use). 1.3.3.3 Need for Action Improving watershed function and stream conditions by reducing road densities and repairing existing roads and culverts to reduce sediment and improve drainage is needed. Watershed function can also be improved by restoring compacted soils and adding organic material on old skid trails and landings. 1.4 PROPOSED ACTION The action that was proposed by the Forest Service for scoping in January 2012 is briefly described below. The Proposed Action was modified slightly in response to scoping comments that were received; the modified proposed action is described as Alternative B in this FEIS in Chapter 2. Improve forest health, provide goods and services, reduce fuels, and improve wildlife habitat: • Conduct “variable retention” regeneration harvest and post-harvest burning activities on up to 2,500 to create early successional plant communities and improve wildlife habitat while reestablishing long-lived early seral tree species. Variable retention harvest would include areas of full retention (clumps) with irregular edges. Snags and legacy trees would be retained to provide structure and a future source of woody debris. Openings would probably exceed 40 acres. • Commercially thin approximately 7,810 acres to reduce stand densities, improve forest health, and reduce the chance of crown fire. • Apply improvement harvest (thin from below) to approximately 311 acres to remove encroachment and ladder fuels from ponderosa pine–dominated stands. • Construct a minimum temporary road system to carry out the proposed action. Roads would be decommissioned after use. • Precommercially thin approximately 1,865 acres to reduce stand densities, improve forest health, and reduce fuels. • Restore approximately 42 acres of bunchgrass communities through prescribed burning and revegetation with native grasses and forbs to improve vegetative diversity and reduce the spread of noxious weeds. • Apply approximately 1,400 acres of low and mixed severity prescribed fire within the Clear Creek Roadless Area to restore natural fire regimes, reduce fuels, improve wildlife habitat, and create mosaic forest conditions. Proposed activities would be consistent with the Idaho Roadless Rule and no timber cutting is proposed within the Clear Creek Roadless area. Reduce sediment production and address transportation needs: • Maintain or improve approximately 100–130 miles of system roads. Maintenance and improvement could include culvert installation or replacement, ditch cleaning, riprap placement for drainage improvement, gravel placement, road grading, or dust abatement. • Conduct additional site-specific maintenance or improvements on up to 20 miles of roads outside of proposed treatment areas to improve watershed conditions • Remove from the system between 2–5 miles of system roads no longer considered necessary for transportation needs by decommissioning. Amend the Soils section of the Nez Perce Forest Plan: • A site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment adopting Region 1 soils standards would be included. The current Nez Perce Forest Plan standard specifies that there can be no new activities in areas where detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) is over 20%. Currently, Region 1 soil quality standards (USDA Forest Service 2014) specify that at least 85% of an activity area (defined as a land area affected by a management activity) must have soil that is in satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, and mass wasting) shall be <15% of an activity area. In areas where >15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from proposed activities, including restoration, shall not exceed the conditions prior to the proposed activity and should move toward a net improvement in soil quality. The proposed amendment would change Forest Plan Soil Standard #2 and allow activities to occur on areas with >20% DSD, as long as soil improvement activities are implemented. Amend Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan (1987): • A site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment clarifying the Forest’s interpretation of Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan would be included. The purpose of this amendment would be to replace the Forest Plan Appendix N definitions of old growth with the definitions found in Old Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region (Green, et al., 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11). The Green et al. definitions are regarded as the “best available science” for the classification of old growth at the site-specific level. This nonsignificant amendment is site-specific, and would apply only to the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project action alternatives. This amendment would not apply to any activities or projects outside the project area. 1.5 DECISION FRAMEWORK The Responsible Official for this project is Forest Supervisor, Cheryl Probert. In making her decision, the Responsible Official will review the purpose and need, the Proposed Action and other alternatives, the environmental consequences, and public comment to make the following decisions: • Should vegetation restoration in the Project area be completed, and if so, which forested stands should be treated and what silvicultural treatments should be applied? • Should temporary roads be constructed, and if so, how many miles of road should be constructed and where should they be constructed? • What design features, mitigation measures, and/or monitoring should be applied to the Project? 1.6 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT A Notice of Intent (NOI) advertising the scoping period was published in the Federal Register on January 6, 2012. A corrected NOI was published on February 9, 2012, updating the contact information that was published in the original notice. A second corrected NOI was published on February 13, 2012 extending the comment due date to March 1, 2012. A third corrected NOI, advertising two proposed site-specific Forest Plan amendments that were included in the DEIS, was advertised on February 7, 2013. As part of the public involvement process, the agency also listed the proposal in the quarterly Schedule of Proposed Actions beginning April 2012. The Project has been presented to the Nez Perce Tribe at quarterly staff-to-staff meetings since April 2012. The CBC has been involved in project development since 2010 when the Clear Creek watershed was selected for assessment to determine the types, locations, and amount of appropriate management actions that would address CFLRP goals and objectives. The Proposed Action was initially developed from preliminary issues, concerns, and existing conditions that were identified by the IDT. The IDT used issues raised by the public, other agencies, and the Nez Perce Tribe to develop the scope of the actions, alternatives, and effects to consider in the DEIS. Many of the issues were addressed through project design criteria and resource protection measures. The DEIS was advertised for public comment in April 2013. Forty-one comment documents were received, containing more than 525 individual comments. Those comments have been addressed in the FEIS through design criteria, project design, and alternative development. During 2013, the District Ranger and the IDT hosted field trips to the project area that were attended by the Nez Perce Tribe, the Clearwater Basin Collaborative, and other interested groups.  Changes between Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statement 1.6.1The IDT considered developing several additional alternatives in response to comments that were received for the DEIS. However, additional alternatives were not added to the array analyzed in the DEIS. Please see the “Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study” section in Chapter 2 for a description of the additional alternatives that were considered, and the reasons why they were not analyzed in detail. The Design Criteria described in Chapter 2 have been updated and more clearly described. Additional Design Criteria for soils, wildlife, aquatics, and recreation (trails) were developed by the IDT. Appendix E has been added to the FEIS, describing the Design Criteria for soils in detail. Supplementary information and additional maps have been added to the Appendices for the FEIS. The new appendices are as follows: • Appendix E, Soil Design Criteria Summary • Appendix F, Wildlife • Appendix G, Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests Target Stands for Multiple Objectives • Appendix H, Unit Summary • Appendix I, Past Activities • Appendix J, Upward Trend Chapter 3 has been relabeled Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences. Chapter 3 of the FEIS has been updated to include a discussion about threatened, endangered, sensitive, rare, and invasive plants. A discussion about the cost savings associated with treating vegetation in larger areas has been added to the Economics section. A detailed discussion of Upward Trend has been added to the aquatics section of the FEIS. Additional information about fisheries habitat was added to the FEIS to address comments received for the DEIS about stream conditions. The FEIS includes clarifying information regarding upward trend for Pine Knob, Middle Fork Clear Creek, and the mainstem of Clear Creek. Appendix J of the FEIS includes a more detailed discussion of watershed improvement actions that were included in other projects. Effects analyses for Visual Quality and Cultural Resources have been added to the FEIS. The effects analyses for Aquatics, Vegetation, Watershed, and Wildlife have been updated in response to objections that were received for the Draft Record of Decision. The References section of the FEIS has been updated in response to comments that were received for the DEIS. Many documents have been added to the project file supporting the analysis in this FEIS. Maps displaying harvest activities by decade and the Wildland User Interface (WUI) have been added to Appendix A. 1.7 ISSUES The Forest Service separated the issues into two groups: significant and nonsignificant. Significant issues were defined as those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the Proposed Action. Nonsignificant issues were identified as those outside the scope of the proposed action; already decided by law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; irrelevant to the decision to be made; or conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations explain this delineation in Section 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…” A list of nonsignificant issues and reasons regarding their categorization as nonsignificant may be found in the project record.  Issues Used to Develop Alternatives to the Proposed Action 1.7.1Several concerns raised during scoping were used to develop alternatives to the Proposed Action. To address these concerns, the Proposed Action was modified slightly and renamed Alternative B. Two additional action alternatives, Alternatives C and D, were also developed to respond to the concerns raised by scoping commenters. 1.7.1.1 Commercial Thinning Stands Where Root Disease is Present Some commenters were concerned that commercially thinning stands with root disease could cause the disease to spread, increasing stand mortality. The IDT created Alternative C to address these concerns. Under Alternative B, treatment would be deferred in stands proposed for commercial thinning that are found to have root disease. Thinning would not be an appropriate treatment in these stands because root disease would be likely to spread. However, without treatment, these stands are unlikely to remain on the landscape as long as desired; the stands available for management could be substantially reduced, and deferring treatment in commercially thinned stands with root disease would not move these stands toward Desired Future Conditions (DFCs). Under Alternative C, commercially thinned stands that are found to have root disease would be regenerated. Regenerating these stands would help create larger patch sizes, while increasing the amount of high-quality, early seral wildlife habitat and moving the area toward DFCs for young and old forest. ISSUE INDICATORS • Percent of the area with forest cover type dominated by long-lived early seral species compared to grand fir and Douglas-fir. • Patch sizes 1.7.1.2 Patch Sizes and Fragmentation Some commenters were concerned that past management has reduced patch sizes and increased fragmentation in the Clear Creek watershed. Since the 1980s, there has been a trend toward small, isolated harvest units that resulted in patch sizes that are smaller than would have been created through natural disturbance. The resulting forest now includes a fragmented landscape, isolated patches of young forest, and dissected large patches of older forest. During the pre-NEPA phase of project development, the IDT identified large polygons or patches within the Project area, referred to as “Focus Areas.” The Focus Areas were identified based on a need to promote similar age classes by connecting recently regenerated stands, or by retaining existing large patches of unfragmented forest. The Focus Areas served as the basis for developing the proposed action. Since Forest managers cannot plan an activity to “create” larger patches of older forest, the IDT chose to focus on reducing landscape fragmentation by treating areas near or adjacent to existing young forest. The resulting large patches of young forest will more closely resemble the disturbance regime and patch size expected from natural disturbances. At the same time, the IDT has not disregarded the importance of patch sizes in older age classes. Retaining existing large patches of unfragmented forest weighed heavily in the development of the Proposed Action. The IDT chose treatment areas that would avoid fragmenting existing patches that currently meet desired patch size conditions according to the DFCs for each Vegetative Response Unit (VRU). It was a priority to “reconnect” areas of young forest that have become fragmented due to past management activities. Other objectives the IDT considered during development of the proposed action were to establish breaks in areas with continuous fuels in probable fire pathways, target areas with known or developing forest health issues, and to target over-represented mid seral and mature age classes. The IDT also attempted to bound Focus Areas with identifiable features, such as forest type breaks, topographic breaks, and administrative boundaries. The regeneration harvest proposed for all of the action alternatives would address this issue by increasing patch sizes and reducing fragmentation. Of the three action alternatives, Alternative C would do the most to address this issue because it would regenerate the most stands within the Focus Area configurations. ISSUE INDICATORS • Patch size • Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) 1.7.1.3 Early Successional Stands/Young Forest/Wildlife Habitat Some commenters were concerned that the amount of young forest in the Project area should be increased to improve wildlife foraging habitat. The regeneration harvest proposed for all of the action alternatives would address this issue by increasing the amount of young forest across the landscape. Of the three action alternatives, Alternative C would do the most to address this issue because it would regenerate the most stands. ISSUE INDICATORS • Percent of the area with forest cover type dominated by long-lived, early seral species compared to Grand fir and Douglas-fir • Percent of the area in each age class • Vertical structure • Acres treated in potential suitable habitat for sensitive species (SS) • Acres treated in Nez Perce Forest Plan Management Area (MA) 16 (Elk Winter Range) • Acres treated in Nez Perce Forest Plan MA 21 (Moose Winter Range) 1.7.1.4 Forest Structure Some commenters were concerned that the Forest Service should do more to move vegetation in the Clear Creek watershed toward the desired conditions identified for this area. The desired condition is a forest structure with a range of age classes, size classes, and species diversity that is resistant and resilient to change agents such as insects, diseases, and wildfires. Early seral species should represent a greater percentage of the species mix. The regeneration harvest proposed for all of the action alternatives would address this issue by increasing the amount of young forest across the landscape, while reducing the amount of mid-seral and mature forest. Of the three action alternatives, Alternative C would do the most to address this issue because it would regenerate more acres. ISSUE INDICATORS • Percent of Project area that could support a crown fire • Percent of the area with forest cover type dominated by long-lived early seral species compared to shade intolerant species • Percent of the area in each age class • Vertical structure 1.7.1.5 Economics Some commenters were concerned that the Project should provide jobs for the local economy. Other commenters suggested that planning and implementation costs should be reduced by managing on a large scale. The IDT considered the entire Clear Creek watershed during the pre-NEPA assessment phase and when developing the Proposed Action. Timber harvested under any of the action alternatives would meet the goals and objectives of the Forest Plan to provide a sustained yield of resource outputs. Timber outputs from the Proposed Action would be used to offset treatment costs and support the economic structure of local communities and would provide for regional and national needs. Many of the stands proposed for treatment are currently losing volume and value due to insects and diseases. Harvesting the timber would provide materials for local industries. ISSUE INDICATORS • Timber harvest–related jobs and income • Sale feasibility 1.7.1.6 Road Densities Some commenters were concerned about the total road mileages and road densities in the Clear Creek watershed. No permanent road construction is proposed under any alternative. Alternative D was developed to address these concerns by minimizing the amount of temporary road construction. New temporary road construction would be minimized by using existing road templates as much as possible. Units would be harvested as described for Alternative B; some units would be dropped if they were not accessible by the more limited road system proposed for Alternative D. ISSUE INDICATORS • Riparian Habitat Conservation Area (RHCA) road densities • Number of undersized culverts replaced and cross drains added • Reduction in watershed road miles 1.7.1.7 Elk Security Habitat Some commenters were concerned about the effects of the road network on elk security habitat. No permanent road construction is proposed under any alternative. Alternative D was developed to address these concerns by minimizing the amount of temporary road construction. The road system in the Clear Creek watershed has already been substantially reduced. The South Fork–West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning DN/FONSI (2011) decommissioned 85 miles of roads. Temporary roads constructed for the Project would be decommissioned and recontoured after use. ISSUE INDICATORS • Percent of each Elk Analysis Area qualifying as secure habitat • Elk Habitat Effectiveness Areas meeting Forest Plan standards using Leege (1984)  Concerns Raised in Response to Scoping 1.7.2The Responsible Official reviewed the concerns below that were raised during the scoping. These concerns are valuable, but they do not raise unresolved conflicts with the Proposed Action and therefore are not treated as issues. Typically, these concerns have been addressed by incorporating additional design features 1.7.2.1 Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Plan Consistency Because the project proposal is based on the CBC’s Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Plan (CFLRP) proposal, some commenters were concerned that the project should be consistent with the requirements of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Act (CFLRA). Project implementation will be consistent with requirements of the CFLRA, as well as all Nez Perce Forest Plan standards and other laws and regulations. The expenditure of CFLRA funds that will be used to implement and monitor this project will be reviewed for consistency by the CFLRP strategy group, composed of Forest Service and CBC members. The EIS will analyze potential effects on old growth. The CFLRA requires that landscape restoration strategies “contribute to the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands according to the pre-fire suppression old growth conditions of the forest type...”, which will be accomplished through project design, unit delineations, silvicultural prescriptions, and marking guidelines. The current, best available science will be used, as required by NEPA and CFLRA. The CFLRA does not allow the construction of permanent roads, thus, permanent road construction is not proposed for this Project. Any new temporary roads constructed will be decommissioned after use. 1.7.2.2 Old Growth Some commenters asked that the IDT develop an alternative that would not harvest any old growth meeting Nez Perce Forest Plan or Green et al. (1992, errata corrected 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011) old growth criteria. Other commenters suggested that treatments in old growth stands should be considered if they would improve old growth habitat. No old growth would be harvested under any alternative, although improvement cuts would be conducted in some stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics to help keep them on the landscape longer. Appendix D describes a site-specific Forest Plan amendment common to all action alternatives in this FEIS that clarifies the definition of old growth found in Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics may be treated with improvement harvest to maintain or improve the vigor/resiliency of preferred trees. Improvement harvest in stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics would not change old-growth status per Green et al. (1992 as amended) old growth criteria. This "fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands…" per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 1.8 REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIRED COORDINATION As part of the analysis for this project, the IDT evaluated various alternatives under the laws, regulations, and requirements relating to federal natural resource management. Several of the design features presented in Chapter 2 were developed and incorporated to ensure these requirements would be met. The following sections summarize the results of the analysis for those concerns most often noted. Additional details can be found in Chapters 2, 3, and/or the Project Record.  Forest Plan Direction 1.8.1Although the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests were administratively combined in February 2013, management of the lands formerly within the boundary of the Nez Perce National Forest will continue to be guided by direction found in the Nez Perce Forest Plan until the plan is revised. The Nez Perce Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, as amended) includes goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines that direct management of forest resources. Forest Plan direction is established at 2 scales: Forest-wide direction is applicable throughout the Forest and management area direction ties specific goals, objectives, and standards to the unique capabilities of given parcels of land. Nez Perce Forest Plan standards apply to NFS lands within the Nez Perce National Forest boundary. They are intended to supplement, not replace, National and Regional policies, standards, and guidelines found in Forest Service Manuals (FSM) and Handbooks. The project analysis was guided by the goals, objectives, standards, guidelines, and management area direction within the Nez Perce Forest Plan. This Project would help move the Forest toward desired conditions as described in the Forest Plan and other relevant planning direction.  Clean Air Act 1.8.2The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 and amended numerous times since then, is the primary legal authority governing air quality management. This Act provides the framework for national, State, and local efforts to protect air quality. The Montana/Idaho State Airshed Group was formed to coordinate all prescribed burning activities in order to minimize or prevent impacts from smoke emissions and ensure compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the federal agency charged with enforcing the Clean Air Act. The Forest Service, including the Moose Creek Ranger District, is a member of this Airshed Group. The Project area is in North Idaho Airshed Unit 12A. All post-harvest site preparation and prescribed fire treatments would be conducted according to the requirements of the Montana/North Idaho Smoke Management Unit guidelines.  Clean Water Act 1.8.3Section 313 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, State, interstate, and local requirements; administrative authorities; and process and sanctions with respect to control and abatement of water pollution. Executive Order (EO) 12088 requires the Forest Service to meet the requirements of this Act. Therefore, all State and federal laws and regulations applicable to water quality would be applied, including 36 CFR 219.27; the Clean Water Act; EOs 11988 and 11990; Idaho Water Quality Standards; the Nez Perce Forest Plan, including PACFISH Riparian Management Objectives (RMOs) and RHCA buffers; Idaho State Best Management Practices (BMPs); Idaho Forest Practices Act, and Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act.  Region 1 Soil Quality Standards 1.8.4Region 1 soil quality standards (USDA Forest Service 2014) specify that at least 85% of an activity area (defined as a land area affected by a management activity) must have soil that is in satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, and mass wasting) shall be less than 15% of an activity area. In areas where more than 15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from proposed activities, including restoration, shall not exceed the conditions prior to the proposed activity and should move toward a net improvement in soil quality. Project design criteria were developed to better meet soil quality standards. Appendix C describes in detail a site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment adopting Region 1 soils standards that would be included in all action alternatives in the FEIS. A Forest Plan Amendment is needed because the Regional and Forest Plan Standards are different with regards to extent of disturbance area: • The Nez Perce National Forest Plan soil standard #2 states: “A minimum of 80% of an activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled upon completion of activities.” Once the unit exceeds the 20% disturbance threshold, no further entry is allowed. • The Regional Standard limits disturbance to 15%, but allows entry into units that already exceed the 15% standard as long as the treatment and soil restoration shows an improvement of soil quality at the end of activities. Therefore, in order to enter these units that currently exceed the Regional and Forest Plan Standard, we must amend the Forest Plan to allow for entry and show improvement to the soil resource by the activities.  The National Fire Plan and the Healthy Forest Restoration Act 1.8.5The National Fire Plan (NFP) was developed in August 2000 following a landmark wildfire season with the intent of actively responding to severe wildland fires and their impacts to communities while ensuring sufficient firefighting capabilities. The NFP addresses 5 key points: firefighting, rehabilitation, hazardous fuels reduction, community assistance, and accountability. With regard to jurisdiction, direction in the NFP allows for the Forest Service to take NFP action on NFS lands, and for States to take and coordinate action on State and private lands. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (HFRA) (P.L. 108-148) contains a variety of provisions to address hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on specific types of federal lands that are at risk of wildland fire and/or insect and disease epidemics. The HFRA helps all landowners and managers restore healthy forest and rangeland conditions on those lands, regardless of ownership. Both the NFP and HFRA provide overarching direction to reduce the threat of wildfire and restore ecosystems. Management actions proposed within the Project area are designed to be consistent with this direction. Particularly, proposed management activities would trend the general landscape condition toward desired fuel profiles and would optimize opportunities to treat hazardous fuels in identified Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) lands and across the project area landscape.  Endangered Species Act 1.8.6FSM 2670 directs the Forest Service to conserve endangered and threatened species and to utilize its authorities in furtherance of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and to avoid actions that may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. FSM 2670 also requires the Forest Service to maintain viable populations of all native and desirable non-native wildlife, fish, and plant species in habitats distributed throughout their geographic range on NFS lands. As directed by the ESA, biological assessments and consultation under section 7 of the ESA will be completed for this decision. The action alternatives are not expected to result in a jeopardy biological opinion for any listed species.  Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 1.8.7These federal Executive Orders (EOs) provide for the protection and management of floodplains and wetlands. Numerous floodplains and wetlands exist within the analysis area. Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project activities have been designed to be consistent with the requirements of EO 11988 and EO 11990. EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) requires federal agencies to evaluate the potential effects of actions it may take in a floodplain to avoid adversely impacting floodplains wherever possible, to ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and floodplain management, including restoring and preserving such land areas as natural undeveloped floodplains, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO. EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires federal agencies to take action to avoid adversely impacting wetlands wherever possible, to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values of wetlands, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO.  Executive Order 12898 1.8.8EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs each federal agency to make environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. An associated memorandum emphasizes the need to consider these types of effects during NEPA analysis. The Proposed Action and alternatives would not disproportionately adversely affect minority or low-income populations, including American Indian tribal members.  Executive Order 13112 1.8.9EO 13112 (Invasive Species) was issued on February 3, 1999, to enhance federal coordination and response to the complex and accelerating problem of invasive species. EO 13112 directs federal agencies to work together [as stated in the Preamble] to “…prevent the introduction of invasive species and provide for their control and to minimize the economic, ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause.” Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the requirements of EO 13112.  Idaho Forest Practices Act 1.8.10The Idaho Forest Practices Act regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01). The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Forest Practices Act.  Idaho Roadless Rule 1.8.11The Idaho Roadless Rule, promulgated on October 16, 2008 (73 FR 61456), identified a system of lands called “Idaho Roadless Areas” and established 5 management themes. These 5 themes protect roadless areas and their important characteristics by assigning various permissions and prohibitions regarding road building, timber cutting, and discretionary mineral activities. The final Rule also allows the Forest Service to reduce the risk of wildland fires to at-risk communities and municipal water supply systems. The final Rule supersedes the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule for NFS lands in the State of Idaho. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Roadless Rule. The State of Idaho, Idaho Roadless Commission reviewed the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project’s proposed activities on March 14, 2013.  Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act 1.8.12The Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act regulates stream channel alterations between mean and high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho (IDAPA 37.03.07). Instream activities on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Act. The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act.  National Environmental Policy Act, Sections 101 and 106 1.8.13The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) was signed into law on January 1, 1970. NEPA establishes national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within the federal agencies. NEPA also established the CEQ. Title I of NEPA contains a Declaration of National Environmental Policy that requires the federal government to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony. Section 102 requires federal agencies to incorporate environmental considerations in their planning and decision-making through a systematic interdisciplinary approach. Specifically, all federal agencies are to prepare detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of and alternatives to major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. These statements are commonly referred to as environmental impact statements (EISs). The public has an important role in the NEPA process, particularly during scoping, to provide input on what issues should be addressed in an EIS and to comment on the findings in an agency's NEPA documents. The public can participate in the NEPA process by attending NEPA-related hearings or public meetings and by submitting comments directly to the lead agency. The lead agency must consider all comments received from the public and other parties on NEPA documents during the comment period.  National Forest Management Act 1.8.14The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) (16 U.S.C. 1600–1614, August 1974, as amended 1976, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1990) reorganized, expanded, and otherwise amended the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974, which called for the management of renewable resources on NFS lands. NFMA requires the Secretary of Agriculture to assess forest lands; develop a management program based on multiple-use, sustained-yield principles; and implement a resource management plan for each unit of the NFS. It is the primary statute governing the administration of national forests. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the NFMA.  National Historic Preservation Act 1.8.15Section 101 of the National Environmental Policy Act requires federal agencies to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage. The legal processes associated with the protection and preservation of these resources is outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA) (36 CFR 800) and subsequent amendments. Passed by Congress two years before NEPA, the NHPA sets forth a framework for determining if a project is an “undertaking” that has the potential to effect cultural resources. The implementing regulations also outline the processes for identifying, evaluating, assessing effects, and protecting such properties. The coordination or linkage between the Section 106 process of the NHPA and the mandate to preserve our national heritage under NEPA is well understood and is formally established in 36 CFR 800.3b and 800.8. The terminology of “…important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage” found in NEPA includes those resources defined as “historic properties” under the NHPA (36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)). It is thus the Section 106 process that agencies utilize to consider, manage, and protect historic properties during the planning and implementing stages of federal projects. The Forest meets its responsibilities under NHPA through compliance with the terms of a Programmatic Agreement (PA) signed between Region 1, the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.  Tribal Treaty Rights 1.8.16American Indian tribes are afforded special rights under various federal statutes: NHPA; NFMA; Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) (43 CFR Part 7); Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) (43 CFR Part 10); Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (P.L. 103141); and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (AIRFA). Federal guidelines direct federal agencies to consult with tribal representatives who may have concerns about federal actions that may affect religious practices, other traditional cultural uses, or cultural resource sites and remains associated with tribal ancestors. Any tribe whose aboriginal territory occurs within a project area is afforded the opportunity to voice concerns for issues governed by NHPA, NAGPRA, or AIRFA. Federal responsibilities to consult with tribes are included in the NFMA; Interior Secretarial Order 3175 of 1993; and EOs 12875, 13007, 12866, and 13084. EO 12875 (Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership) calls for regular consultation with tribal governments. EO 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites) requires consultation with tribes and religious representatives on the access, use, and protection of sacred sites. EO 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) requires that federal agencies seek views of tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might affect them. EO 13084 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) provides direction regarding consultation and coordination with tribes relative to fee waivers. EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs federal agencies to focus on the human health and environmental conditions in minority and low-income communities, especially in instances where decisions may adversely impact these populations (see “Executive Order 12898” above). NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500–1508) invite tribes to participate in forest management projects and activities that may affect them. Portions of the Forest are located within ceded lands of the Nez Perce Tribe. Ceded lands are federal lands on which the federal government recognizes that a tribe has certain inherent rights conferred by treaty. In Article 3 of the Nez Perce Treaty of 1855, the United States of America and the Nez Perce Tribe mutually agreed that the Nez Perce retain the following rights: …taking fish at all usual and accustomed places in common with citizens of the Territory [of Idaho]; and of creating temporary buildings for curing, together with the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and pasturing horses and cattle… The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project has been presented to the Nez Perce Tribe at quarterly staff-to-staff meetings since April 2012. The project was presented to the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Council (NPTEC) for formal consultation on February 24, 2015, and was discussed during a government-to-government meeting with Tribal representatives on May 21, 2015. The Regional Forester’s May 28, 2015 objection response letter included instructions for updating the analysis in the FEIS. The updated analysis was discussed with Tribal representatives on July 9, 2015.Chapter 2–Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action 2.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project, including alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study. Maps of each alternative considered are included in Appendix A. This section also presents the alternatives in comparative form, sharply defining the differences between each alternative and providing a clear basis for options available to the Responsible Official. Some of the information used to compare the alternatives is based on the design of each alternative (such as regenerating versus deferring stands that have root disease), and some of the information is based upon the environmental, social, and economic effects of implementing each alternative (such as building new temporary roads versus deferring treatment in inaccessible stands). 2.2 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED IN DETAIL The Forest Service developed the No Action Alternative (Alternative A), the Proposed Action as modified in response to scoping comments (Alternative B), and two additional action alternatives (Alternatives C and D) in response to issues raised by the public.  Actions Common to All Action Alternatives 2.2.1The following actions would be included in all of the action alternatives. • 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 41 acres of grass restoration, and 1,371 acres of prescribed fire • 119.8 miles of system road reconstruction (Appendix B) • 48.8 miles of system road reconditioning (Appendix B) • 13.2 miles of system road decommissioning (Appendix B) • A site-specific nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment adopting the Region 1 soil standard of 15% for detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled soils (Appendix C) • A site-specific, nonsignificant Forest Plan amendment clarifying the Forest’s interpretation of Appendix N of the Nez Perce Forest Plan (Appendix D) • The Design Criteria described later in this chapter  Alternative A: No Action 2.2.2Under the No Action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of the project area. No timber harvest, improvement cutting, temporary road construction, prescribed burning, grass restoration, road reconstruction, road reconditioning, or road decommissioning would be implemented to accomplish project goals.  Alternative B: Proposed Action (as Modified in Response to Scoping 2.2.3Comments) This alternative was developed in response to comments about the Proposed Action that was presented for public scoping in January 2012 (see Chapter 1 for a detailed description of the Proposed Action that was used for scoping). Alternative B would move the project area toward the desired conditions identified for the project during the pre-NEPA phase. During the pre-NEPA phase of project development, the IDT identified large polygons or patches within the Project area referred to as “Focus Areas.” The Focus Areas were identified based on a need to promote similar age classes by connecting recently regenerated stands (preferably those regenerated within the last 20 years). The intent was to establish breaks in continuous fuels, favor areas with known or developing forest health issues, and target over-represented mid-seral and mature age classes. The IDT also attempted to delineate these areas with identifiable features, such as forest type breaks, topographic breaks, and administrative boundaries. The Focus Areas served as the basis for developing the proposed action. A new Focus Area, developed after the Proposed Action was presented for scoping, was added to all of the action alternatives. It includes about 420 acres of regeneration harvest and some commercial and precommercial thin units. This new Focus Area also includes 1.2 miles of temporary roads, some of which would be on existing templates. Within the Focus Areas, stands identified for regeneration would be regenerated to improve patch sizes, increase the amount of early seral forest across the landscape, and allow replanting with a mix of species that would improve the long-term resilience of these stands. Healthy grand fir/Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and other early seral stands would be commercially thinned. If root disease were detected in younger Douglas-fir/grand fir stands proposed for commercial thinning, treatment of these stands would be deferred. Outside of the Focus Areas, healthy grand fir/Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and other early seral stands would be commercially thinned. If root disease were detected in younger Douglas-fir/grand fir stands proposed for commercial thinning, treatment of these stands would be deferred. Stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics may be treated with improvement harvest to maintain or improve the vigor/resiliency of preferred trees. Improvement harvest in stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics would not change old-growth status per Green et al. (1992 as amended) old growth criteria. This "fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands…" per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). All prescribed fire treatments would occur within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Table 2-1 summarizes the activities to be undertaken under Alternative B, and Appendix A contains a map of the proposed activities.  Table 2-1.

Desired conditions developed for this project indicate that young forest, particularly the 0–10 year age class, is well below desired conditions. Alternative C would move the project area toward the desired conditions by regenerating as many stands as possible, while still meeting objectives for other resources. This alternative was developed in response to scoping comments about the following resource concerns: • Patch size and fragmentation • Improvement of the distribution of foraging habitat relative to hiding cover • Increase in the amount of early successional stands and wildlife foraging habitats • Forest structure • Economics • Increase in stand mortality, by spreading root disease by commercially thinning stands infected • Increase distribution of early seral species across the landscape Alternative C would include 3,366 acres of commercial thin outside of the original Focus Areas. Within the Focus Areas, stands identified for regeneration would be regenerated to improve patch sizes, increase the amount of early seral forest across the landscape, and allow replanting with a mix of species that would improve the long-term resilience of these stands. Stands proposed for commercial thinning that are not comprised of early seral species would be regenerated. Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 2409.17 allows the Forest Service to regenerate young stands based on specific ecological, resource, and management criteria to meet the purpose and need of a specific project. Outside of the Focus Areas, healthy grand fir/Douglas-fir, pine, and other early seral stands would be commercially thinned. If root disease were detected in younger Douglas-fir/grand fir stands proposed for commercial thinning, treatment of these stands would be deferred. Stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics may be treated with improvement harvest to maintain or improve the vigor/resiliency of preferred trees. Improvement harvest in stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics would not change old-growth status per Green et al. (1992 as amended) old growth criteria. This "fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands…" per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). Table 2-2 summarizes the activities to be undertaken under Alternative C, and Appendix A contains a map that displays the proposed activities. Table 2-2.

This alternative would use existing road templates as much as possible. It was developed in response to scoping comments about the following resource concerns: • Road densities/cumulative impacts of past management • Sediment input to stream channels • Cumulative impacts of past timber harvest and road building on fisheries habitat, water quality, and soil productivity • Effects of the road network on elk security habitat • Meeting desired conditions for watersheds, fish, and wildlife habitats A total of 8.7 miles of previously decommissioned roads that have existing templates (were not physically obliterated) would be reopened and 8.8 miles of new temporary roads would be constructed. Existing road templates were identified through photo interpretation, including aerial photos from 1970 and subsequent years, the LIDAR layer, and field reviews. The average length of new temporary road construction would be 375 feet; the average length of the existing template is 820 feet. New temporary construction would be added to the existing templates. Units would be harvested as described for Alternative B, except that some units would be dropped if they were not accessible by the more limited road system proposed for Alternative D. Other units would utilize longer skidding or yarding distances where possible, along with skidding logs from skyline landings down shorter skid trails to truck loading sites, instead of building roads to the skyline landing. Stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics may be treated with improvement harvest to maintain or improve the vigor/resiliency of preferred trees. Improvement harvest in stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics would not change old-growth status per Green et al. (1992 as amended) old growth criteria. This "fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands…" per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). Table 2-3 summarizes the activities to be undertaken under Alternative D, and Appendix A contains a map that displays the proposed activities. Table 2-3.

Appendix E displays cause for design criteria for each harvest unit, including landslide prone, temporary road, Regional 15% DSD standard, subsurface erosion hazard, and down wood material. 1) When machine piling, existing duff/litter would be retained (as much as possible and not included in the activity slash piling. No material greater than 4 inches would be added to slash piles. 2) Skid trails, landings, and yarding corridors would be located and designated to minimize the area of increased detrimental soil effects. This would not preclude the use of feller bunchers off skid trails if soil impacts can remain within standards. Winter logging could be utilized in the implementation of this project, as long as frozen ground or depths of snow conditions are met but would not be required. 3) Landslide prone areas have been mapped and field verified in the harvest units. These landslide prone areas would be further delineated in the field, would be excluded during unit layout, and would receive a PACFISH buffer. Indicators of landslide prone areas include: steep (over 60%) concave slopes; hydrophytic vegetation (i.e. sedges, moist site ferns); slumps, draws, and basins; past landslide locations; and obvious soil movement areas (typically indicated by curved and/or buttressed tree boles, soil creep, tension cracks, etc.). No harvest activities would occur in these areas. 4) For prescribed fire units, there would be no fire ignition in GIS mapped landslide prone areas (following PACFISH guidelines). Fire would be allowed to back through these areas. 5) For units with high subsurface erosion potential, the amount of excavated skid trails and landings would be limited to the extent possible, and all excavated skid trails and landings on these landtypes would be decommissioned (full recontour) and large woody material would be placed over the slope for soil stabilization. While in use or over-wintering, an increased number of water bars or addition of slash material to road bed would be used as necessary to reduce erosion. 6) For all Units including those designated in the reuse, trending positive, and Forest Plan amendment design categories (see section 3.8.6): A logging system layout design would be developed to use as many of the existing skid trails and landings as possible and limit the amount of new detrimental disturbance. All skid trails and landings used would be decommissioned after use. Actions would include scarifying/decompacting soils and placement of slash, woody material, and/or duff over exposed soil. Equipment used for machine piling or mastication of activity slash would remain on designated skid trail or would be required to rehabilitate (decompact or recontour) any detrimental disturbance they cause. 7) For Units designated in the special design category (see section 3.8.6), special attention would be needed for these units to remain at or below 15% Detrimental Soil Disturbance (DSD) following project implementation. Methods to ensure this might include locating main skid trails only on existing disturbed areas, with few “one-pass” trails occurring on undisturbed ground; using a cut-to-length forwarder system; requiring equipment used for machine piling or mastication of activity slash to remain on designated skid trails; and developing a logging system layout design that limits the amount of new detrimental disturbance. Portions of the unit could be dropped if the layout plan cannot reach the entire unit while staying under the 15% standard. The estimated amount of acres of new disturbance has been calculated for each unit and can be found in the project file. In addition, all skid trails and landings and temporary roads (see item 10 for temporary road decommissioning) would be decommissioned (includes soil decompaction). 8) For all harvest units, decompaction would be required on skid trails where excavation or ground disturbance has occurred or where successive passes have taken place over the same trail. Decompaction would be conducted to improve soil productivity and meet Regional soil quality standards. Decompaction would span the width of the compacted areas and extend to a depth of 10–18 inches, to effectively loosen the ground to allow water penetration and revegetation and to prevent the rocky sub-surface soils from mixing with the topsoil. The depth of decompaction should be adjusted to avoid turning up large rocks, roots, or stumps. Equipment would not be permitted to operate outside the clearing limits of the skid trail. Decompaction should be done from June 15 to October 15, unless otherwise approved. No decompaction work should be done during wet weather or when the ground is frozen or otherwise unsuitable. 9) In all units, to reduce ground disturbance, no ground based skidding would be allowed on slopes over 35%, unless operating on adequately compacted snow or only over short distances. 10) All temporary roads would be decommissioned (all new construction would be decompacted and recontoured; existing prisms would be placed in a stable condition through decompaction). Cut/fill slopes and crossings would be reshaped to natural contours. Available slash and large wood material (>3 inches) would be applied to the recontour surface (slash is considered “available” where the equipment can reach it from the working area where the decommissioning is occurring). Temporary road rehabilitation work shall begin as soon as possible after the timber harvest operations have been completed. They are not intended to be left open for post –harvest treatment activities, such as site preparation burning or planting. 11) Activities would be restricted when soils are wet to prevent resource damage (indicators include excessive rutting, soil displacement, and erosion). 12) For all harvest units, coarse woody material appropriate to the site would be retained for maintaining soil moisture, soil stability, and other soil physical and biological properties after all unit activities. Regional guidance for organic matter recommends the following guidelines, such as retaining coarse (> 3 inches diameter) woody material to maintain soil productivity (Graham et al. 1994). Drier habitat types have wood retention requirements of 7–15 tons/acre for Douglas-fir, grand fir, and ponderosa pine types. Moister habitat types require 17–33 tons/acre. Approximately 14–28 standing trees would be retained for future down wood recruitment. Retention levels on the higher end of the range would be used for proposed regeneration harvest units 107, 117, 142, and 148, because of low existing woody material. Snags or other designated retention trees felled for safety reasons would be left in the unit. 13) Burning of activity generated slash would be designed in the project burn plan to provide a low-severity mosaic burn that has been shown to cause little-to-no detrimental disturbance of soil resources (Neary et al. 2008). 14) Twenty-five harvest and burn units would be monitored 1 to 3 years after treatment to determine extent of detrimental soil disturbance and effectiveness of skid trail and temporary road decommissioning. Table 2-4 displays the Soil and Water Conservation Practices (FSH 2509.22) that will also be incorporated as design criteria. These are also referred to as Best Management Practices (BMPs) throughout the document. Table 2-4.

Improvement harvest in Stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics would not change old-growth status per Green et al. (1992 as amended) old growth criteria. This "fully maintains, or contributes toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands…" per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 3) Large snags would be retained. Each post-treated area, on average, would comply with mean snag retention values displayed in Table 12 of Estimates of Snag Densities for Northern Idaho Forests in the Northern Region (Bollenbacher et al. 2009) for low and mid elevation moist habitat types in early seral conditions (at least 6 snags per). Preferred species (ponderosa pine, western larch, Douglas-fir) of large, legacy snags would be selected for retention. Alternate tree species would be retained where preferred species do not exist in quantities to meet Regional guidance. Large snags would be retained with green trees in groups of 7–10 trees or larger retention patches. Preference would be given to the largest available snags or damaged trees, generally greater than 21 inches in diameter and greater than 40 feet tall. A combination of clumps (groups of live and dead trees) and lone snags that have little potential to cause safety issues would be retained. Snag retention within one tree length of open motorized roads would be avoided. Snag or live retention trees felled for safety purposes would be left on site or traded with a comparable tree. 4) In treatment areas, all legacy trees (large diameter trees that survived the last stand replacing event) would be retained. In Clear Creek, these trees frequently are over 30 inches dbh. Legacy trees may be unevenly distributed and retained in clumps as well as individual trees. This design measure allows hazardous fuels reduction while “…maximizing the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type…” per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 5) Green tree retention in all regeneration and improvement harvest areas would consist of an average of 14–28 of the largest trees per acre (generally over 21 inches dbh) distributed in clumps (7–10+ trees plus snags) and individuals, with no area greater than 2 acres without retained trees. Tree retention would focus on ponderosa pine, western larch, and healthy Douglas-fir, and large tree retention would be maximized, as appropriate for the forest type per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 6) Regeneration Harvest Leave Tree Survival: The Clear Creek project would strive for a variable tree survival objective for the project as a whole, with the objective of having almost all legacy trees (large diameter trees that survived the last stand replacing fire) survive the prescribed burns. See Target Stand discussion in Chapter 3 vegetation analysis. Fuel reduction measures (limb/top removal or slash reduction around these trees) would be implemented where needed to ensure tree survival for the legacy larch, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir. For the non-legacy trees, the objective would be for a majority (>50%) of the leave trees to survive the prescribed burn. Prescribed fire might be allowed to back into RHCAs and retained clumps; however, no ignitions would be allowed within them. These measures allow hazardous fuel reduction while “…maximizing the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type…” per PL 111-11 Title IV (2009). 7) Maintain a minimum 40-acre yearlong no-treatment buffer around occupied goshawk nest trees. No ground disturbing activities would be allowed inside occupied post-fledgling goshawk areas (300–600 acres around the nest stand) from April 15 to August 15. 8) If a den, nest sites, or other important habitat feature of any threatened, endangered, or sensitive species were to be discovered within or in close proximity to any treatment unit, project activities would be coordinated with a wildlife biologist so that appropriate conservation measures could be developed. 9) Invasive plants displace indigenous plants that provide forage or cover for wildlife. The spread of noxious weeds and invasive plants would be minimized by chemically treating any noxious weed populations along the existing road systems before and after project implementation; monitoring and cleaning any equipment of loose debris prior entering the Project area to prevent “new invader” weed establishment; and revegetating project-related exposed soils (i.e., landings, skid trails, road sides, etc.) using certified noxious weed free native seed mix and fertilizer (as necessary) upon project completion. All seeding would follow Region 1 guidelines. 10) In moose winter range (MA 21), silvicultural prescriptions that comply with Forest Plan standards would be developed for commercial thin and regeneration harvest areas and incorporated into marking or layout guidelines. The Forest Plan identifies the following guidelines: a) For those lands that are scheduled for harvest, harvest a maximum of 5% of Pacific yew stands per decade on a 210-year rotation, b) Maintain at least 50% of the live Pacific yew components scattered throughout the unit in patches 1/4 to 1/2 acre in size, c) The preferred harvest type includes patch clearcuts, individual tree selection, group selection, or shelterwood. Patch clearcuts should be no larger than 20 acres in size (5–10 acres preferred), d) Maintain leave-strips between yew stands sufficient to provide travel corridors for moose, and e) Reforest to desired stocking levels either through planting or through natural regeneration to achieve 30% crown closure over 20 years for conifers, and 30% crown closure over 20-30 years for Pacific yew. The following commercial thin units occur in MA 21: 228, 230, 231, 234, 238, 335, 349–351, and 356–358. The following regeneration harvest units occur in MA 21: 136–139, 145, and 146. 11) Retained large down logs would be evenly distributed in regeneration and improvement units to support small animal habitats. 12) Landscape burning prescriptions, especially in MA 16 (winter range), would be developed to maintain the duff layer to prevent invasive species germination. Burn units 701–715 occur in MA 16. 13) Regeneration harvest units that have a large component of yew in the understory would be marked to “clump” green tree retention around yew concentrations, where feasible and while still meeting silvicultural needs. 14) To support the availability, distribution, and sustainability of quality browse species (particularly redstem ceanothus, serviceberry, willow, and mountain maple), prescribed fire prescriptions would be developed for implementation during summer or fall. Spring burns would be appropriate only to prepare fuel breaks for summer/fall burns. 2.2.6.3 Aquatics 1) PACFISH default RHCAs would be used to define timber sale unit boundaries. No timber harvest would occur within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams, 150 feet of perennial non-fish bearing water, 100 feet of intermittent streams, and 150-foot slope distance from the edge of wetlands larger than one acre. 2) Prescribed fire would not be ignited in areas requiring 100% live canopy retention (RHCAs and landslide prone areas). The burn objective would be to prevent fire entry into these areas. Low-intensity fire may be allowed to back into the edges of some of these sensitive areas and would result in no less than 90% live-canopy retention for the area. 3) BMPs, as found in Rules Pertaining to the Idaho Forest Practices Act, would be applied to prevent non-channelized sediment delivery from harvest units to streams in the Project area. 4) Contractors would have spill prevention and containment materials available at the Lochsa Ranger District Office to minimize the risk of an accidental spill of petroleum products, as well as to protect water courses and aquatic biota from adverse effects in the event of a spill. 5) During road decommissioning or culvert replacements, measures to prevent damaging levels of sediment from entering streams would be undertaken, such as: (a) placing removable sediment traps below work areas to trap fines; (b) when working instream, removing all fill around pipes prior to bypass and pipe removal (where this is not possible, use non-eroding diversion); (c) revegetating scarified and disturbed soils with weed-free grasses for short-term erosion protection and with shrubs and trees for long-term soil stability; (d) utilizing erosion control mats on stream channel slopes and slides; (e) mulching with native materials, where available, or using weed-free straw to ensure coverage of exposed soils; (f) dissipating energy in the newly constructed stream channels using log or rock weirs; and (g) armoring channel banks and dissipating energy with large rock whenever possible. 6) Temporary roads would be constructed on or near ridge tops with no stream crossings. All temporary roads would be constructed and then obliterated within 2 years. Obliteration includes de-compaction, re-contouring where needed, and the application of woody material onto the de-compacted surface to provide for soil productivity and limit erosion potential. 7) Cross drain culverts would be installed near stream crossings in order to divert ditchline sediment away from stream crossings and onto the forest floor, and where needed to achieve spacing to reduce sediment delivery from road surfaces and ditches. 8) Reconstructed road segments would receive an application of surface aggregate to reduce current and future erosion, particularly at road/stream crossings. 9) Dust abatement would be used on major haul routes to minimize sediment input to streams from log hauling activities. 10) Instream work on 6 culvert replacements (3 sites on Upper Clear Creek and 3 on South Fork Clear Creek) would occur after July 15 to protect steelhead designated critical habitat downstream. 2.2.6.4 Heritage Resources Table 2-5 describes mitigation measures/design criteria that would be implemented to protect Heritage Resources in the project area. Table 2-5.

Following harvest activities, any impacted trail would be restored to a useable condition as it was prior to the activity taking place. One mile of Trail 723 occurs within a commercial thin unit, and the trail would be used as a temporary road. Light thinning would be done adjacent to the trail and the trail would be cleaned up and reestablished after harvest. No access would be allowed during prescribed burning, and hazardous trees within a tree length of the trail would be felled for public safety. • No-harvest buffers would be implemented around dispersed camp sites, especially in Unit 123. 2.2.6.6 Visuals Design features used to reduce the visual impact of the harvest areas include retention of vertical structure within the harvest units and edge treatment that emulates natural openings. Leave trees, that provide vertical structure within the harvest area, may be both live and dead trees emulating the same structure that would remain after a natural mixed severity wildfire. These leave areas would range from . to 3 acres in size and may include leave areas adjacent to unit boundaries. Unit boundaries for units visible in the foreground would be shaped and feathered to reduce any unnaturally shaped edges and would reduce the hard edges that appear as a man-made features on the landscape. 2.3 ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED STUDY Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives would have modified the proposed action to the point where the purpose and need for action would not be met, would have been duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or were determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm. Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration for reasons summarized below. See the “Issues” section in Chapter 1 for a more detailed discussion of the alternative-driving issues that were raised during scoping. Old Growth: The IDT considered an alternative that would harvest old growth stands, but did not study it in detail, although improvement cuts would be done in some stands over 150 years old that do not have old growth characteristics to help keep them on the landscape longer. Although the amount of old growth in the project area exceeds the Forest Plan minimum standard, CFLRA goals and objectives require that large diameter trees be retained as much as possible to the extent they promote fire resiliency. Appendix D describes a site-specific Forest Plan amendment clarifying how Forest Plan standards for old growth would be interpreted for this project. Watershed Rehabilitation (Road Decommissioning) Only; No Timber Harvest or Prescribed Burning: Some commenters asked that the IDT consider an alternative that would focus only on watershed rehabilitation activities, such as road decommissioning, with no timber harvest or prescribed burning. The IDT analyzed this alternative, but did not study it in detail because it would not meet the purpose and need for this project. Also, in effect, this “alternative” was previously analyzed in the South Fork–West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Environmental Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2011), which decommissioned 10 miles of system roads and 75 miles of nonsystem roads in the Clear Creek watershed. An additional 13.2 miles of NFS road decommissioning are proposed for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project as actions common to all alternatives. The future Clear Ridge Nonsystem Road Decommissioning project proposes to decommission 65 miles of nonsystem road in the northern portion of the Clear Creek watershed Prescribed Burning-Only Alternative: The IDT analyzed an alternative that would use prescribed burning alone to manage vegetation, but did not study it in detail because it would not meet the purpose and need for this project, and because of economic concerns. Timber outputs from the proposed action would be used to offset treatment costs and support the economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs. Also, burning commercial timber would not be consistent with the Forest Plan. No Prescribed Burning: Some commenters asked that the IDT develop an alternative that would not include any prescribed burning. The IDT analyzed this alternative, but did not study it in detail because prescribed burning is the only viable tool available to manage vegetation within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Prescribed fire is also an important and effective tool for reducing post activity fuels in treatment units as well as stimulating grass, forb, and shrub regrowth. No Temporary Road Construction/Use Existing Roads Only/Helicopter Logging: Some commenters were concerned about existing road densities in the Clear Creek watershed and the effects of the road system on fisheries and wildlife habitat. An alternative that would not build any temporary roads was considered but not analyzed in detail by the IDT because it would reduce the managed area to the point where the purpose and need to manage vegetation would not be met. The road system in the Clear Creek watershed has already been substantially reduced. The South Fork–West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning DN/FONSI (2011) decommissioned 85 miles of system and nonsystem roads. Temporary roads constructed for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project would be decommissioned and recontoured after use. Watershed rehabilitation is better achieved by decommissioning old roads in poor locations (unstable, midslope or stream-adjacent). Building new temporary roads in more stable locations away from streams, and then recontouring them after use, creates less chance of erosion and subsequent sediment delivery. The IDT considered an alternative that would build temporary roads only on existing or former road templates. This alternative was not analyzed in detail because it would not provide enough access or access in the appropriate locations to meet the purpose and need to manage vegetation in the project area. The IDT also considered an alternative that would use helicopter logging instead of building temporary roads. This alternative was not analyzed in detail because a timber sale based on helicopter logging alone would not be economically viable. Do Not Use Vegetation Response Unit Desired Future Conditions Developed for this Project: Some commenters did not want the DFCs that were developed specifically for this Project to be used and asked that the IDT use Forest Plan goals and objectives alone to guide management activities. The IDT considered this alternative, but did not analyze it in detail because project-specific desired conditions that were developed during the pre-NEPA stage of project were based on Forest Plan direction and refined by the best available science. Site-specific, VRU-based desired conditions that were based on Forest Plan goals, objectives, and standards, were used to develop the alternatives analyzed in detail. Analyze an Alternative with Opening Sizes 40 Acres or Less: Some commenters were concerned that past management has reduced patch sizes and increased fragmentation in the Clear Creek watershed. Conversely, some commenters expressed concern about exceeding the 40-acre opening limitation. In response to the expressed concerns, the interdisciplinary team considered an alternative that would not create openings greater than 40 acres; however, this alternative was eliminated from detailed consideration after an analysis of the effects on fragmentation and fire spread (Figure 2-1). An under-40-acre-alternative would not trend the area toward desired future conditions, and it would prevent treatment activities from meeting the purpose and need for the project. There is also a need to trend the landscape toward a more desirable pattern of forest structure and patch sizes. The scale of treatments should be matched to the scale of the widespread and increasing root disease and bark beetle (Douglas-fir beetle, fir engraver beetle, and mountain pine beetle) mortality in order to restore resilient tree species. The large majority of the resource area is classified as mature forest (i.e., mature forest is the matrix). Previous regeneration harvesting created the majority of the existing openings within the resource area but left untreated, mature forested stands between and around the openings. Extensive areas of mature forest in the resource area have been severely affected by root disease and bark beetles. Within the resource area there is currently very little diversity in patch sizes within the young structure class. Creating openings in excess of 40 acres would increase the diversity of patch sizes within the young structure class and eventually in the medium structure class as the young stands grow. This increased diversity in patch sizes would also translate to the long-lived early seral species forest cover types because most of these forest cover types are directly associated with regeneration harvests in the resource area. Developing large patches of resilient forest now may eventually lead to development of large patches of future old growth that have greater representation of resilient species. The effects that an under-40-acre-alternative would have on patch sizes are displayed in Table 2-6. Although there is not a marked reduction in patch size, it does show that this alternative would continue to trend the resource area toward a fragmented landscape. Table 2-6.

Fire research results show that larger treatment blocks are more effective than scattered smaller treatment blocks at altering fire spread rates and severities within a given treatment block. Research also shows that strategic placement of treatment blocks is important to alter fire spread rates and severities across a given landscape. It is important to match the scale of treatments to the scale of the insect and disease-driven fuel accumulations, and to match the scale of historic ecological processes within the resource area to create “fences and corridors” on the landscape (McKenzie et al. 2011, Chapter 3). Limiting opening sizes to less than 40 acres would limit their effectiveness at slowing the spread of large fires, and would limit their effectiveness at reducing fire severity. Smaller fuel treatment areas would not have as many significant beneficial effects on the spread, intensity, and severity of large fires, especially if placed randomly on the landscape. Color mapColor map Figure 2-1. The estimated effects of an under-40-acre alternative on fire spread are displayed adjacent to the effects of fire spread in alternative C 2.4 COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES This section provides a summary of the effects of implementing each alternative. Information in the Table 2-7 and Table 2-8 are focused on activities and effects where different levels of effects or outputs can be distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively among alternatives.

Monitoring would be conducted on randomly selected treatment units throughout the Forest and results would be made publicly available on the Forest’s website. Both implementation and effectiveness of treatments would be monitored. Additional RHCA monitoring would be conducted. The focus would be on whether or not sediment travels from harvested and burned units into RHCAs, and also how far the sediment travels and whether or not it reaches a stream. It would be funded and conducted pursuant to PL111-11 Title IV Sec. 4003(g)(4). This monitoring would be conducted on portions of the following regeneration harvest units: #109, 122, 127,128, 150,155, 160, 214, 218, 235, and 236. See Figure 2-2 for locations. Turbidity monitoring at 3 culvert replacement sites on or within 600 feet of steelhead designated critical habitat would occur during implementation. There are 2 on Clear Creek and 1 on the South Fork Clear Creek. The site locations are shown in Figure 2-2. Five channel cross sections would be monitored in within the project area (Figure 2-2). Monitoring would be conducted to determine if harvest and/or road improvement activities are contributing enough sediment to the stream to cause changes to channel morphology and or degradation of habitat quality for steelhead trout. Other monitoring collected at these sites includes Wolman pebble counts (stream bed surface substrates), cobble embeddedness, air and water temperature, and relative fish densities by species. Wolman pebble counts and cobble embeddedness are used to monitor potential changes in substrate composition, particularly sand-sized or smaller fines which can negatively affect the quality of fish spawning and rearing habitat. Initial cross section measurements would be taken in 2014 or 2015 prior to the proposed activities. The sites would be monitored 1, 2, and 5 years after project activities commence. Adjustments could be made to the activities if monitoring shows statistically significant changes in stream channel aggradation/degradation, widening of the channel, or increases in substrate fines. If a large natural flow event were to occur during the monitoring period, or unacceptable channel changes were observed at the monitoring sites, a survey of the streams, logging units and roads would be conducted to determine the location of sediment additions. Adjustments may or may not be required to proposed activities depending on this assessment. Project monitoring will help to ensure that BMPs are sufficient at minimizing adverse effects to ESA-listed species.  Black and white map with circles at the channel cross section sites and triangles at the culvert turbidity monitoring sites Figure 2-2. Aquatic Monitoring Locations for the Clear Creek project  Chapter 3–Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences This section summarizes the physical, biological, social, and economic environments of the project area and the potential changes to those environments due to implementation of the alternatives. It also presents the scientific and analytical basis for comparison of the alternatives presented in Table 2-7, Table 2-8, and Table 2-9. This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the aquatic resource, which includes water quality and fisheries. The section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Aquatics Report,” available in the project record. 3.1 AQUATICS  Analysis Area 3.1.1The project area is about 43,700 acres and encompasses the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage and all of its tributaries. Clear Creek flows into the Middle Fork Clearwater River. This same area is considered the analysis area and was selected because it includes all Forest Service–managed lands—and all the streams therein—that could be affected by project activities.  Regulatory Framework 3.1.2Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) direction and all federal and State laws and regulations applicable to watershed and fisheries resources would be applied to the project, including the Clean Water Act, the ESA, Idaho Water Quality Standards, and the Idaho Forest Practices Act. 3.1.2.1 Nez Perce National Forest Plan Forest standards for water resources are found within the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pages II-18 through II-22). The Forest Plan directs that forest management activities minimize sediment input to streams, meet beneficial uses, apply BMPs to ensure water quality standards are met or exceeded, and manage all water under the designated standards found in Forest Plan Appendix A. The project complies with this direction through the implementation of project design features and road improvement and decommissioning activities. The Forest Plan was amended in 1995, following a joint decision (commonly called PACFISH) by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) for managing anadromous fish-producing watersheds on federal lands, including streams within the project area. The standards and guides from PACFISH would be applied to the project. The interim direction provided by PACFISH identifies and defines RHCAs, establishes RMOs, and applies standards and guidelines to meet the RMOs. RHCAs include those areas within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams, within 150 feet of non-fish-bearing streams, and 100 feet on intermittent streams and wetlands of 1 acre or less. RHCA widths exceed state BMP standards. All management activities must be designed to cause no adverse effect to the designated RMOs, which dictate certain standards for large, instream woody material, stream temperature, width-to-depth ratios, bank stability, and pool frequency. The project would comply with PACFISH. 36 CFR 219.20—These regulations require projects to achieve the following objectives: conserve the soil and water resource; protect streams, streambanks, and wetlands; provide for adequate fish habitat; and give special attention to riparian areas in regard to topography, vegetation type, soils, climate, and management objectives. 3.1.2.2 Endangered Species Act The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists bull trout as threatened under the ESA (www.fws.gov Feb. 6 2013). Steelhead trout and fall chinook salmon are also listed as threatened (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] www.nwr.noaa.gov). Consultation with the USFWS and NOAA is required for projects affecting these species. The project would be designed to have no long term adverse effects on listed species. The project would provide long term positive effects to listed species and their habitat. Regional Forester Sensitive Species—Since the Forest Plan was published in 1987, the Regional Forester has approved an updated list for the Forest (February 2011). This list includes 4 fish species: westslope cutthroat trout, interior redband trout, Snake River spring chinook salmon, and Pacific lamprey. The western pearlshell mussel was added in 2010. A Biological Evaluation is required to determine the effects of the project on these species. The project may impact individuals but would not lead to the listing of species under ESA. 3.1.2.3 Idaho Forest Practices Act This act regulates forest practices on all land ownerships in Idaho. Forest practices on National Forest lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the act (IDAPA 20.02.01). The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in Idaho’s Water Quality Standards. The project would comply with the Idaho Forest Practices Act by implementing BMPs to protect and maintain water quality standards.  Analysis Methodology 3.1.33.1.3.1 Stream and Habitat Surveys Past (1988, 1993) and recent stream survey data (2010-2012) were used to determine if instream conditions meet Forest Plan direction. Some of the recent field surveys assessed road and culvert conditions, as well as fish presence at road crossings. General stream conditions were also noted. Focused road surveys were conducted by the fish biologist in order to review stream crossings and drainage needs along roads near streams. The majority of road proposed for reconstruction were surveyed while only a few proposed for reconditioning were surveyed. General road conditions between crossings were noted and any problems with drainage or potential failure were identified. The road survey data were used to develop proposed project activities associated with roads. Google Earth (and other photo imagery), in combination with field surveys, was used to assess vegetative cover over project area streams and the availability of future woody material to those streams. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to assess a variety of information, including road and stream miles within the project area. Habitat and fish surveys on anadromous fish streams conducted by the Nez Perce Tribe in 1984 were reviewed. They also conducted habitat-only surveys on Lower Clear Creek below the Forest Boundary in 1986. Stream habitat and fish surveys were also conducted by the Forest for Clear, South Fork, Kay, West Fork, Hoodoo, Lost Mule, and West Branch in 1988; for the Middle Fork Clear Creek, Solo Creek, and Pine Knob Creek in 1993; and in Clear, Pine Knob, Brown Springs, Solo and Middle Fork in 1998. Information collected included physical data (stream type, habitat types, substrate, woody material, and sediment levels) and biological data (fish species, distribution, and densities); however some of the surveys did not collect all of the physical or biological data mentioned above. Where fish data was collected in Clear Creek, anhy species that was observed by the Forest Service or Nez Perce Tribe was recorded. Stream habitat surveys were also conducted in 2007 and 2010 in the mainstem, West Fork, and South Fork of Clear Creek and in Kay Creek as part of the PACFISH/INFISH Biological Opinion (PIBO) monitoring effort. Cobble embeddedness surveys were conducted by Forest personnel in 2011 and 2012 to determine compliance with Forest Plan water quality objectives. The USFWS Dworshak Fisheries Assistance Office was also contacted in 2012 and 2013 in regard to past surveys they conducted in Clear Creek. Their spawning ground and juvenile surveys were focused on chinook salmon only. 3.1.3.2 FISHSED Modeling The Forest Plan requires the use of the cobble embeddedness indicator.in an analysis that considers project effects on aquatic habitat as it relates to fish productivity (i.e. habitat capacity). Cobble embeddedness is a measure of how the rocks in a stream are surrounded, or embedded, by small materials such as silt or sand. Estimates of existing cobble embeddedness in project area streams, combined with NEZSED outputs for peak sediment yield (see Watershed section), were used to predict potential changes in summer and winter rearing/carrying capacities for trout and salmon, using the FISHSED model (Stowell et al. 1983). The model is run at the Forest Plan prescription watershed level only. The basic model assumes that an inverse relationship exists between the amount of fine sediment in spawning and rearing habitats and fish survival and abundance. In general, when sediment yields are increased over natural rates, especially on a sustained basis, fish biomass decreases (Bjornn et al. 1977). FISHSED is most appropriately used to assess the effects of changes in habitat quality when cobble embeddedness changes are greater than 10% (Stowell et al. 1983). The FISHSED model is only useful for comparing alternatives (Conroy and Thompson 2011) and is not designed to predict actual sediment levels. FISHSED calculations and additional information about the model, including assumptions, are in the project file.  Resource Indicators 3.1.4The following resource indicators were developed in response to public comments and internal concerns and are associated with proposed activities. Timber harvest was not considered as an issue indicator, because monitoring indicates that retaining RHCAs are adequate to prevent harvest-related sediment from reaching streams stability (USDA Forest Service unpublished data, 2014; Sugden et al. 2012; USDA Forest Service 2009b; USDA Forest Service 2006b; Sridhar et al. 2004; Lee, et al. 2004; Ott et al. 2005; USDA Forest Service and USDI BLM 1995; FEMAT, 1993; Belt 1992). The Watershed Condition Framework (USDA 2011) was reviewed. It assessed watershed condition based on a variety of factors including forest health, soil, water, and roads. Watershed ratings reflect the level of watershed health or integrity. A watershed in good condition is one that is functioning in a manner similar to natural wildland conditions. The South Fork Clear Creek was rated as having high integrity or functionality. The Upper and Lower Clear Creek subwatersheds received moderate ratings and have been targeted for integrated restoration efforts through road-related and vegetative restoration activities. The road related projects are expected to provide the most direct long term benefits to water quality and aquatic habitats. These include recently completed projects as noted in Appendix J and those proposed in the Clear Creek IR project. For the purpose of the aquatics analysis, roads were the primary issue indicator, particularly those within RHCAs. 3.1.4.1 Roads in RHCAs Many miles of system and nonsystem roads exist within PACFISH RHCAs. Many of these roads are not needed for future land management activities. Unneeded roads should be decommissioned to reduce potential sediment input into streams from road surface runoff and potential stream-crossing failures.  Resource indicator: RHCA road density 3.1.4.1.1The roads needed for management should minimize the contribution of sediment to streams from road surface runoff. Installing culverts that drain onto the forest floor from roadside ditches instead of into stream channels would minimize direct sediment contributions. Installing culverts designed to handle 100-year flow events on all streams would minimize the potential for plugging of the structure by debris. Surfacing roads could also reduce sediment runoff.  Resource indicator: Number of undersized culverts replaced and 3.1.4.1.2cross drains added Deposited Sediment: Excessive amounts of fine sediment, particularly sand, can reduce fish reproduction success by plugging spawning gravels and affecting egg development and/or larval fish emergence (Meehan 1991; Waters 1995). Sand bedload can also decrease food production by scouring or burying gravel substrates and can decrease the amount of fish cover by filling in pools and burying logs (Alexander and Hansen 1983, 1986). The Forest Plan requires that projects that increase sediment yield in a prescription watershed (to the extent that the activity would be considered an “entry”) be modeled in both NEZSED and FISHSED. Activities included in the modeling include timber harvest, temporary road construction, road decommissioning, road reconstruction, road reconditioning, and prescribed fire.  Resource Indicator: FISHSED results for modeled changes in 3.1.4.1.3cobble embeddedness  Affected Environment 3.1.53.1.5.1 Aquatic Habitats Three bedrock falls act as natural barriers to upstream fish passage in the drainage. One is located 0.6 miles up from the mouth of Hoodoo Creek, the second is located on the West Fork Clear Creek, 2.8 miles up from the mouth, and the third is on the Middle Fork Clear Creek just above the mouth of Solo Creek. Surveys in 2010 and 2011 found no fish above the Hoodoo and West Fork barriers; however they were found in the Middle Fork above the barrier. One 15-foot bedrock falls barrier to steelhead and salmon was noted in 1988 surveys of South Fork Clear Creek. It was subsequently removed in 1990 to provide access to 7 miles of additional habitat. Stream substrates through the drainage vary from sand in the low gradient channels to boulders, rubble and gravel in the remaining channels. The highest quality and quantity of salmon and steelhead spawning substrate was observed in the South Fork Clear Creek above the barrier that was removed in 1990. Lower quality habitat was noted below the barrier and in the mainstem of Clear Creek. Overhead cover and wood was noted as limited in the South Fork, Middle Fork, and mainstems of Clear Creek. These are naturally occurring levels are not related to land management activities since timber harvest did not occur in those areas (see effects of management activities discussion below). Stream surveys conducted on private lands in lower Clear Creek indicate high levels of sediment and higher-than-preferred stream temperatures (Nez Perce Tribe 1987). Sediment levels and temperatures were lower on NFS lands (Nez Perce Tribe 1987). Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted as issues affecting fish production in the middle and upper reaches of Clear Creek. Surveys conducted in 1993 also noted the same sediment, wood, and pool limitations. The low number of pools is directly related to low wood levels, because wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in these stream types. Low wood levels are mostly a result of large wildfires that occurred in the area. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent throughout the drainage due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation and large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armor the banks against the erosive power of the streams. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations. Water temperature criteria that currently apply to the Nez Perce National Forest come from four sources: Idaho Water Quality Standards (IDAPA 58.01.02); Forest Plan Desired Future Condition (DFC) Tables (USDA 1992); PACFISH Interim Riparian Management Objectives (RMOs) (USDA Forest Service 1987a); and the local Matrix of Pathways and Indicators of Watershed Condition (NOAA 1998). State and Federal water quality criteria for temperature range from 9 °C to 19 °C, depending on the guidance source and aquatic species being protected. These criteria are commonly exceeded in the mainstem of Clear Creek and several of the tributaries. Natural climatic and physical factors (such as channel width and depth, geologic formations, and natural fire influences) account for some of the standards being exceeded. Temperatures in the lower 10 miles of Clear Creek, all of which are on private/state lands, exceed standards as a result of both natural causes and human-relate activities such as shade removal, riparian species conversion to Japanese knotweed, and channel straightening or simplification. Although temperatures may exceed standards, there are no water quality limited streams within the Clear Creek drainage (IDEQ Integrated Report 2014). Pine Knob, Brown Springs, Solo, Middle Fork Clear and the mainstem of Clear Creek meet their beneficial uses. The remaining streams were not assessed. Optimal stream temperatures for juvenile chinook salmon and steelhead trout rearing is 14–19 °C (US EPA 2003). Lethal temperatures for juveniles occur if they constantly exceed 21–23 °C for 1 week or longer. Optimal stream temperatures for juvenile bull trout rearing is 9-14°C (IDEQ, 2003; Rieman et al, 2007) which is considerably colder than for other salmonids. Streams on Forest Service managed lands stayed below or at 19 °C maximum temperatures for all of the measured sites for all of the measured years (see Table 3-1, below). All streams for all years measured had maximum stream temperatures that were within the optimal range for salmon and steelhead juvenile rearing as noted by EPA. They rarely met optimal requirements for juvenile bull trout rearing during the summer months. Temperatures fluctuated greatly between years and were dependent on weather trends. The data reviewed for streams with 6 or more years of data showed, for example, that 1992 and 1998 were very warm years while 1993 was a cool year (data can be found in the project file). Table 3-1.

Exceedance of the Idaho salmonid spawning criteria of not-to-exceed 13 °C were noted at all sites at certain times of the year. Stream temperatures at the subwatershed level were rated using the PACFISH/NOAA (1998) indicators for steelhead and bull trout with the results listed in Table 3-2. Table 3-2.

This data was used to compare temperatures leaving the Forest Boundary to those near the mouth of Clear Creek in order to determine the amount of increase in the lower reach of stream on private lands. Only the hottest period (July–Aug) was used as this would be the most critical period for chinook salmon migration and spawning, steelhead rearing, and bull trout migration. Average maximum temperatures in 2007 at the Forest boundary were 19 °C and were 24 °C at the hatchery. Data compared for August of 1991 and 1992 had temperatures of 20 °C at the boundary and 27 °C at the hatchery. Temperatures in 1993 were 17 °C at the boundary and 19 °C at the hatchery. Temperatures at the boundary were below lethal levels for salmon and trout but consistently increased toward lethal temperatures downstream. Temperature increases are natural in the downstream direction due to channel widening, reductions in stream depth because of widening, and the increased exposure of the stream to direct solar radiation and convective heating (Rayne et al. 2008). The increase on private lands is also associated with the presence of the main Clear Creek road and limited overhead riparian vegetation in some areas along the stream. Stream temperatures are naturally high at the mouth of Clear Creek and have been since before timber harvest on federal lands started in earnest. The USGS maintained a gaging station in at the mouth of Clear Creek in 1962 and collected both flow and temperature data. Maximum temperatures during July and August ranged from 17 °C to 28 °C with 90% and 80% of the days, respectively, exceeding 20 °C. These temperatures are similar to those found in more recent monitoring efforts mentioned above. Prior to 1962, a total of 1,032 acres (2%) of timber harvest occurred on Forest Service lands, all of it within the Hoodoo prescription watershed. The majority of units either retained a small buffer or avoided water altogether. Minimal effects to temperature would have been expected to due to these design features and the fact that the riparian areas were well vegetated with older trees throughout the prescription watershed (Figure 3-1). There was no other federal harvest in the drainage that would have affected stream temperature. The 1962 data is therefore considered the baseline for assessing temperature affects from Forest Service lands. Since temperatures at the mouth of Clear Creek are similar to what they were in 1962 before widespread harvest, it can be assumed that Forest Service management has had little effect on stream temperatures.  Aquatic Species 3.1.5.1.1Habitat for cutthroat trout, a Region 1 sensitive species, occurs in all fish-bearing streams. Cutthroat trout were observed between 2010 and 2012 well into the headwaters of most of the streams, but densities were not measured. Surveys conducted by the Forest in 1993 found very high densities of cutthroat trout in Solo Creek and Middle Fork Clear Creek below Solo Creek. High concentrations were also found in upper Clear Creek, West Fork Clear Creek, and upper Pine Knob Creek during Nez Perce Tribe surveys (Nez Perce Tribe 1984). The majority of timber harvest and road building occurred between 1960 and 1990. The high densities and wide distribution of fish would indicate that cutthroat have not been greatly affected by these activities. Clear Creek includes 45 miles of designated critical habitat for ESA-listed steelhead trout on private and federal lands (ESA listed as threatened). A total of 35 miles occurs on federal lands. In past surveys, steelhead were found in moderate densities in Pine Knob Creek and lower Middle Fork Clear Creek, but none were found in Solo Creek (USDA Forest Service 1993) or West Fork Clear Creek (Nez Perce Tribe 1987). Low densities were found in South Fork Clear Creek (USFS 1988; Nez Perce Tribe 1987). Prior to the 1990 removal of the South Fork Clear Creek barrier, steelhead had access to 28 miles of habitat. NFS lands along Clear Creek include 13 miles of spring chinook (a Region 1 sensitive species) habitat. Prior to the South Fork Clear barrier removal, NFS lands provided only 6 miles of habitat for chinook. There are 7 miles of potential, but low to fair quality habitat on private lands below the Forest boundary. Several adult and juvenile chinook salmon were observed during 1988 habitat surveys in Clear Creek and the lower South Fork of Clear Creek below the barriers. Habitat for chinook tends to occur in the middle and lower reaches of large streams such as the South Fork and mainstem of Clear Creek. Compared to cutthroat trout, these species require larger streams and substrate for spawning and rearing. The Kooskia National Fish Hatchery, near the mouth of Clear Creek, annually released 20–30 adult chinook above their trapping weir from 2006 to 2008. These fish likely spawned on the lower reaches of National Forest lands or on private lands. Bull trout were not found during fish surveys conducted by the Forest Service in1988 or 1993 or by the Nez Perce Tribe in 1984. One adult bull trout was observed at the Kooskia Hatchery weir in 1997 and another adult again in 2012 (C. Bretz, pers. comm). No others were observed between those years. The absence of bull trout is expected, as water temperatures are not conducive for juvenile rearing of this species, or for adults during the summer or the fall spawning migration period. Bull trout prefer cold temperatures (below 14 °C) in the summer and are generally found in higher-elevation streams such as those in the upper Lochsa River (well upstream of the project area). Summer stream temperatures were measured in the project area between 2007 and 2011. Daily maximum temperatures during the summer months averaged 13–20 °C depending on the stream and the year. Bull trout typically move from mainstream rivers into spawning tributaries from late spring through mid-summer. High summer stream temperatures near the mouth of the stream likely act as a thermal deterrent to upstream migrating bull trout. Temperatures for juvenile summer rearing bull trout are considered unsuitable because the measured seven day maximum averages about 15oC in representative fish bearing reaches measured in Clear Creek tributaries. In addition to survey and stream temperature data, modeling results for predicted bull trout occupancy produced by the Rocky Mountain Research Station (http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/ClimateShield.html) was considered. Modeling is based on Climate Shield research (Isaak, 2012). The model uses stream temperature data from across the Columbia basin to develop accurate temperature predictions for continuous stream reaches in drainage, just not the immediate location of temperature sensors. Some of the data used in the research comes from numerous locations on Nez Perce- Clearwater National Forests. Modeled temperature data is then combined with known bull trout stream habitat preferences to assess the probabilities of bull trout occupancy (Isaak et al, 2015). The model also predicts effects of climate change on bull trout by modelling stream climate changes for a future time period and then comparing temperatures for current conditions. Model run results for tributaries in the project area are: • Upper Brown Springs- 8% probability- 0.6 miles occurs on known fish bearing and 1.4 miles occurs on known non-fish bearing streams • Upper Clear Creek- 9% probability- 1.6 miles occurs on fish bearing and 1.1 miles occurs on non-fish bearing streams • Upper Middle Fork- 14% probability- 1.4 miles occurs on fish bearing and 1.2 miles occurs on non-fish bearing streams • Upper Kay- 12% probability- 1.5 miles occurs on fish bearing and 2.4 miles occurs on non-fish bearing streams • Upper West Branch- 12% probability- all in non-fish bearing streams • Hoodoo- 9% probability- all in non-fish bearing streams The model was also run for climate change predictions for the year 2040. The probability of bull trout presence dropped to zero in all tributaries in Clear Creek due to modeled warmer than preferred stream temperatures. The USFWS did not designate Clear Creek drainage as critical habitat for bull trout. When considering past biological surveys, published bull trout juvenile rearing requirements, and modeling results for occupancy, bull trout spawning and rearing is not considered to occur in tributary streams in the project area now, nor is it expected to occur in the future. No surveys for pearlshell mussels or Pacific lamprey, both Region 1 sensitive species, have been conducted in the Clear Creek drainage, and neither of these species was mentioned during habitat surveys. While mussels may be present, none were observed during field surveys between 2010 and 2012. They prefer stable habitats near banks with coarse sand, and cobble or boulder substrates. Lampreys are not likely to occur in Clear Creek due to low numbers of returning adults in the Snake River. Counts of returning lamprey were conducted over Lower Granite Dam between 2000 and 2011. The data shows a low of 12 returning in 2009 to a high of 282 in 2003 (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). The 12-year average totaled just 70 adult lampreys. Lamprey prefer habitat dominated by sandy substrates and lesser amounts of cobble or gravel. Habitat is likely available, although sporadic, for both species in the mainstems of the South Fork, Middle Fork and Clear Creeks where low gradients (<3%) and coarse and sandy substrates occur. No redband trout, a Region 1 sensitive species, were identified during past or recent surveys. This is in part due to their physical similarities to steelhead trout which often make them difficult to separate from steelhead. Redband trout typically occupy similar habitats as westslope cutthroat trout. Brook trout were observed in Kay Creek in good numbers but were not noted in other streams. Brook trout can adversely affect cutthroat trout through competitive exclusion. It is expected that they may be isolated and did not expand into other tributaries based on survey observations. 3.1.5.2 Water Quality Objectives and the Forest Plan The Forest Plan contains water quality objectives for streams in the project area (USDA Forest Service 1987a, Appendix A). These objectives are assessed using the DFC Analysis developed by Espinosa (1992) and are based on sediment levels as directed by the Forest Plan Appendix A Guidance document (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Specifically, the guidance document states the following: Of the basinwide stream survey data collected over the years, the habitat components that appear to be the most repeatable and most reliably differentiate between reference and managed watersheds are measures or estimates of substrate condition, including cobble embeddedness and percent surface fines. In addition, fish/water quality objectives in Appendix A were originally established based on substrate sediment only (Stowell 1986). …The portion of the DFC analysis that provides objectives for cobble embeddedness and percent fines by depth would be retained. Collection of measured substrate data, combined with existing legacy data and current PIBO data, where available, would be used to describe the existing condition. Substrate data would be the primary determinant in assessing whether Appendix A fish/water quality objectives are met. Appendix A states that an upward trend (improvement) is required for streams that do not currently meet the water quality objectives. Timber management can occur in watersheds not currently meeting their water quality objectives concurrent with improvement efforts as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. Data shows that all streams except Pine Knob, and the mainstem and Middle Fork of Clear Creek meet their Forest Plan water quality objectives based on cobble embeddedness monitoring (Table 3-3). Cobble embeddedness and percent fines by depth were the parameters used to determine whether or not the objectives were being met (as directed by the Forest Plan and Appendix A Guidance). Embeddedness was measured at the mouth of the streams in B or C channel types.  Table 3-3.

Existing cobble embeddedness levels are compared to a DFC graph to obtain the Fishery Habitat Potential percentages. . If the Fishery Habitat Potential is greater than or equal to the Forest Water Quality Objective, the objective is being met. The actual % cobble embeddedness level is not equivalent to the Forest Plan Water Quality Objective. c Desired conditions for surface fines from the NOAA Matrix (1998) are <10% for High (good) condition, 11-20% for moderate condition and >21% for low condition. The PIBO data, which is the most recent data available, was used to assess substrate conditions. Surface fines were not assessed in Espinosa (1992) however given that current conditions have a moderate Matrix rating, they are estimated to be meeting the Forest Plan water quality objective using the following: If the 90% Forest Plan objective is equal to or less than the low condition for cobble embeddedness (i.e. <30%), then the 90% objective would be met if % surface fines were equal to or less than the low Matrix condition (i.e. <21%). The categories are similar for % fines by depth where the 80% water quality objective from Espinosa falls within the Moderate matrix category. Give that % surface fines for the two watersheds both lay within the Moderate matrix category; it suggests that the watersheds meet their 80% water quality objectives.  Pine Knob, Clear Creek, and Middle Fork Clear Creek do not meet their Forest Plan water quality objectives; however IDEQ has determined that they do meet their beneficial uses (2014). DEQ determines whether a water body fully supports its designated and existing beneficial uses by evaluating whether the applicable water quality standards and criteria are being achieved and whether a healthy, balanced biological community is present (http://www.deq.idaho.gov/water-quality/surface-water/beneficial-uses.aspx). Beneficial uses are determined using both physical habitat data and biological data (insect and fish presence in varying levels). It should be noted that even streams in unmanaged areas (roadless,wilderness) often do not meet their DFCs (IDEQ 1999; various stream habitat surveys from the Clearwater NF) due to natural processes and the fact that streams systems are not static. 3.1.5.3 Management Activities Affecting Streams PACFISH was designed to halt degradation and begin recovery of streams where listed fish species occur in the Columbia River drainage. It accomplishes this through streamside RHCA retention and other guidance for management activities within RHCAs. RHCAwidths are 300 feet on each side of a fish-bearing stream, 150 feet on perennial non-fish-bearing streams, and 100 feet on intermittent stream channels. At least 10,700 acres (24%) of the analysis area are within PACFISH buffers. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on approximately 22% of NFS-managed lands since the 1930s with an associated 190 miles of road building. An assessment of aerial photos shows that no-harvest buffers were retained since the 1960s on all but about 8% (700 acres) of the units. On the majority of the units (92%), buffers were a minimum of 50 to 100 feet wide. A total of 440 acres of regeneration harvest have occurred in the project area since PACFISH was implemented and appropriate-sized buffers were retained. A review of vegetation successional stages within the RHCAs is presented in Figure 3-1. This data indicates that 9% are early successional (<40 years old), 34% are mid-seral (41–100 years old), 18% are mature (101–149 years old), and 39% are late successional (>150 years old). The majority of mid-seral stands are located in the Clear Creek Roadless Area, lower Hoodoo Creek, and lower West Fork Clear Creek and are a result of the 1931 wildfire that burned in the area. Successional stage information, combined with field reviews of the streams from 2010 to 2012, indicates that RHCAs are well vegetated and only minimally (9%) affected by past timber harvest activities. Roads near streams are the primary land management–related activity that affects stream conditions in the project area. Roads within riparian zones confine channels, which can negatively affect sediment and stream flow movement (Meehan 1991). Culverts under the roads are often undersized, impeding the passage of water and woody material during high flows. The small culvert size increases the risk that the pipe will plug with material and fail during high-flow events. Plugging of pipes can lead to an unwanted sediment pulse in streams. Crossing failures are costly to fix, and the sediment delivered to streams can take decades to flush out of the system. Road failures disturb existing vegetation and expose bare soil to potential erosion until the site heals. Riparian roads reduce stream shading and disrupt large, woody material recruitment through tree removal. Ditchlines that drain roads can direct flow and road surface sediment into perennial streams at crossings. These roads can be a chronic (ongoing) source of sediment and can increase water yield in streams. Roads located further away from streams with adequate cross drain structures limit the delivery of runoff and sediments to the streams. The placement of additional drains close to stream crossings can significantly reduce the volume of runoff delivered at stream crossings (Takken et al. 2008). Black and white map that shows the age groups of vegetation in the Clear Creek project area Figure 3-1. Vegetation Successional Stages within Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas in the Clear Creek Project Area The local Forest Service, BLM, USFWS, and NOAA use the Matrix of Pathway Indicators (NOAA 1998) to describe a variety of stream habitat and watershed conditions. They are considered “good” when streamside road densities are <1 mile per square mile (mi/mi2), “moderate” at 1–2 mi/mi2, or “poor” at >2 mi/mi2. A total of 20 miles of NFS system roads exist within RCHAs, contributing to an overall road density of 1.2 mi/mi2. Takken et al. (2008) observed that the potential impact of roads cannot be measured accurately using a simple index of road density. Although road density is clearly important, primarily through the obvious impact upon the number of direct stream crossings, factors such as contributing area to a road drain, landscape position, and distance to streams are also significant factors. MacDonald (2005) found that only 25% of the 285 road segments he studied delivered sediment to streams. A recent study using GRAIP monitoring showed that 7% of all drainage points in the study area delivered 90% of the road related sediment, and 2% delivered 50% of sediment (Black 2013). Roughly 11% of the Forest roads (all roads in RHCAs) in Clear Creek have the potential to contribute, and are likely contributing some sediment to streams. All but portions of three roads in Clear Creek have been constructed perpendicular to streams instead of running along their length. This design limits the negative effects from roads on streams by minimizing the interaction and connectivity between the two. In addition, 85 miles of system and nonsystem roads have been decommissioned since 2012 (USDA Forest Service 2011b,c). The roadwork included 3.5 miles of roads in RHCAs and at least 22 stream crossing removals. Stream/road crossing surveys have been conducted on 90% of the NFS roads from 2010 through 2011. Only those roads proposed for retention were reviewed, since all crossings on roads proposed for decommissioning would be removed. A total of 200 crossings were assessed for condition, aquatic passage, potential failure risk, and level of work needed. Culverts or bridges were in place at 168 crossings; at 14 crossings, roads were in place, but culverts had been removed. A total of 10 culverts were cleared through previous NEPA for replacement (Clear Creek Culvert Replacement Project, 2011). Four of these were replaced in 2012; two were replaced in 2013. The remaining 4 culverts will be replaced in 2014 and beyond. A total of 4 culverts were cleared for removal in 2011, with all being removed in 2012 and 2013. The road reviews found 58 culverts (“pipes”) that were adequately sized and had no need for work; 26 pipes in need of cleaning; 2 moderate-priority and 6 low priority pipes needing removal; and 69 culverts in need of replacement (32 moderate-priority, and 37 low-priority). Roughly 40 of the pipes (62%) drain very small streams or seeps and would be replaced with 24- to 36-inch-diameter structures. The remaining 29 pipes would be replaced with structures ranging from 4 to 9 feet in diameter. The general overall conditions of roads and their surfaces were noted during culvert inventories. There were very few drainage, erosion or potential failure issues identified along the roads. Graveled roads showed little to no rutting or visible erosion. Ditchlines along the roads were vegetated with grasses, shrubs or very small trees and most were functioning. A total of 48 sites were noted as needing the following repairs: add pipe for drainage or fix existing drainage (29 sites), clean ditch to provide drainage (4 sites), fix fill slope due to cracking (3 sites), fill holes in road (1 site), decommission road (11 sites). The Clear Creek project proposes to decommission 6 of the sites that would have required new or improved drainage in addition to the 11 sites proposed for decommissioning. Native surface roads were mostly low gradient with some having a layer of base rock and most being vegetated by mosses, grasses and forbs. Very few of the roads had trees growing on the driving surface but most closed roads had small trees growing along their outer margins. NFS system roads within the project area total 190 miles, of which 147 miles (77%) are graveled roads and 43 miles (23%) are native surfaced (dirt). Placing gravel on roads has been shown to reduce sediment runoff from the road surface (Meehan 1991). Burroughs and King (1985) also conducted a study on the Nez Perce Forest using simulated rainfall to generate runoff and sediment yield from forest roads, ditchlines, and fill slopes. The reduction in sediment production by graveling the road was 79% and remained effective for several years. They also found that where dense grass cover was present on the fill slopes of the road, sediment yield was reduced by 99%. The cut and fill slopes of roads within the Clear Creek project area are densely vegetated with grasses, shrubs, and trees. The majority of ditchlines also contain grasses, which can trap sediment. These conditions, along with the perpendicular stream/road crossings mentioned previously, minimize the risk of roads contributing large amounts of sediment to streams. Road use by motorized traffic disturbs the road surface, with some of the soil being deposited into ditchlines, where it can be delivered to streams (Meehan 1991). Within the project area, 106 miles of roads are open seasonally or year-round to motorized use. A total of 66 miles (62%) of these are graveled, and 40 miles (38%) have a native surface. Within the 20 miles of roads located in RHCAs there are a total of 8 miles of gravel roads open year round to all vehicles, 3 miles of graveled roads open seasonally to all, and 2 miles open year round to some (1 mile gravel, 1 mile native surface). The remaining 7 miles are closed to all traffic. The combination of minimal road/stream crossings, gravel surfacing, and restricting traffic on the roads within RHCAs has helped to minimize sediment input to streams. Roads on landslide prone landscapes have the potential to fail and contribute large quantities of sediment to streams. These roads may remain unstable over time and may contribute to chronic sediment erosion if not stabilized. Watersheds are in a high condition when landslide prone road densities are <1 mi/mi2 (NOAA, 1998). Landslide prone road densities are <1 mi/mi2 and in a high (good) condition on federal lands. Only one road-related landslide was observed during the road surveys. The majority of roads in Clear Creek occur on stable ridgetops with minimal risk of failure. No past road-related slides were evident during surveys; however fill cracks and other issues were noted and incorporated into the project design (road decommission or improvement). The overall risk of roads contributing sediment to streams is considered low on 170 miles of road. The low risk is associated with restricted-use roads, roads with gravel surfacing, and roads where live stream crossings are limited or nonexistent or not located on landslide prone areas. The risk is moderate on the remaining 20 miles of road (all in RHCAs), as these roads include multiple live stream crossings and some form of motorized use. 3.1.5.4 Upward Trend Determination Appendix A of the Forest Plan states that where streams do not meet their water quality objectives, timber management can occur concurrent with improvement efforts as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. The Forest Plan water quality objectives were not met in Pine Knob, and the mainstem and Middle Fork of Clear Creek prescription watersheds as previously discussed. The remaining watersheds meet their Forest Plan water quality objectives and are not subject to the upward trend discussion. The water quality objectives make up only a small part of the upward trend determination. The guidance for implementing Appendix A (Conroy and Thompson 2011) states the following: “Upward trend means that stream conditions that are below the Forest Plan objective will move toward the objective over time. Stream specific determination of existing condition and present or future improving trend should be done through a convergence of evidence using stream surveys, monitoring results, watershed condition inventories, literature reviews, predictive modeling, and professional judgment. It must be demonstrable that an improving trend is either in place and will continue, or that an improving trend will be initiated as a result of past, present and future management activities. The Forest Plan did not specifically intend that the improving trend be in place prior to initiation of new activities. It also did not specify a time factor for achieving fish/water quality objectives in below objective watersheds.” It goes on to say that, “It was assumed in the Forest Plan that implementation of instream restoration and other watershed restoration activities would result in an upward trend in carrying capacity. Where these activities have been implemented, it could be stated that an upward trend in the habitat conditions has been accomplished. In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving. If any watershed restoration has been implemented, or if a change in management (e.g. grazing and roads management) has resulted in fewer potential adverse effects to streams, an upward trend could be assumed in these cases as well. The presence, absence, or densities of fish species can aid in the determination of overall stream health, however densities can be highly variable and are difficult to tie specifically to land management activities or upward trend. This is especially true for salmon, steelhead, and lamprey which migrate to the ocean then return to spawn in local streams. These species are heavily influenced by factors that occur outside of the Clear Creek watershed (i.e., dams, fishing, and ocean conditions). If adults return in low numbers, then juvenile densities would also be low and not necessarily associated with watershed conditions in Clear Creek. The Forest Plan upward trend is associated with habitat conditions and not fish densities in part due to these influencing factors. Trends in fish populations would be useful, if available, but are not required for determining whether or not an upward trend exists (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Timber harvest has occurred in the Clear Creek drainage in the last 20 years (4,922 acres or 11% of the drainage). Streamside buffers were retained on the majority of units in order to protect aquatic habitats by limiting sediment input and providing for shade and future woody material. Since 1995, significant management changes to protect riparian areas were made through the adoption of RHCAs. Roughly 24% of the project area lies within these areas. Only 9% of the vegetation within designated RHCAs is less than 40 years old and 57% is older than 100 years. This indicates relatively minor potential effects to streams from harvest because the vast majority of riparian areas are intact. Timber harvest can affect water yield in a stream system (see detailed discussion in the Watershed section). Water yield refers to stream flow quantity and timing and is a function of water, soil, and vegetation interactions. Changes in amount or distribution of vegetation can affect water yield and ultimately alter stream channel conditions. Determining the Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA), which represents the extent of forest canopy openings from fire, harvest, and roads, can assess changes in amount and distribution of vegetation. A measurement of 20%–25% equivalent clear-cut area (ECA) is generally recognized as the threshold for when peak flow increases become detectable (Gerhardt 2000). ECA for Clear Creek is currently 4%. High quality habitat is associated with ECA of less than 15% in a 5th code watershed. Clear Creek is currently in a high condition for ECA. There are 190 miles of Forest Service roads within the watershed, 20 of which are within RHCAs. As previously discussed they occur in low risk areas for failures and are mostly graveled which limits the potential input of sediment to streams. In addition Forest Service road decommissioning has, and continues to occur in the watershed. Fourteen culverts were identified for replacement/removal to allow for aquatic organism passage and to reduce the risk of failure in 2010. Six of those pipes have been installed as of 2013, four pipes were removed, and the remaining pipes are expected to be installed within the next 4 years. See Appendix J for a detailed discussion of past and proposed aquatic restoration activities that have occurred in Clear Creek and contribute to upward trend in the drainage. Relatively little timber harvest activity has occurred in the Clear Creek watershed, roads are graveled and positioned to reduce their effects on streams, and watershed restoration activities have, and are occurring (road decommissioning, culvert replacement). In addition, the majority of riparian areas are intact with minimal effects from management. The riparian areas and RHCAs contain all of the components necessary contribute to a recovering trend. All these factors combine to indicate that there is an overall upward trend in aquatic habitat carrying capacity on Forest managed lands in Clear Creek  Pine Knob Creek Prescription Watershed 3.1.5.4.1 The 2,622 acre Pine Knob Forest Plan prescription watershed does not meet its water quality objective of 80% for fishery habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 44% in 2012. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 65% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend based on fishery habitat potential.  There are about 3 miles of fish-bearing and 7 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Pine Knob Creek. The stream is mostly suitable for steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout. The lower 0.5 miles may be used by juvenile chinook salmon for rearing. The substrate is generally too small for chinook salmon spawning. Steelhead trout and cutthroat have been found in in the stream during 1984 and 1993 surveys.  Stream temperatures were measured in Pine Knob Creek in the summer of 2011. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning and rearing (10.7°C and 13.8°C respectively). Cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.8°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.5°C). This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2015) which showed a zero probability of bull trout presence based on warmer than preferred summer water temperatures.  Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted in the 1993 surveys. The low number of pools and lack of depth is directly related to low wood levels (6 pieces/100m). Wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in this stream type. Low wood levels appear to be natural as streamside buffers of 100’ to 120+’ were retained during previous timber harvest (see management actions discussion below). FEMAT (1993) showed that the probability that a falling tree will enter the stream is a function of slope distance from the channel in relation to the tree height. The analysis showed that 100% of wood delivered to streams comes from within one site potential tree height of the stream (150’ in Clear Creek). Roughly 95% of the wood subsequently comes from within 120’ therefore wood levels in Pine Knob are considered mostly natural. The low wood levels may be due to the dominance of western redcedar that dominates the riparian areas. Redcedar is a long lived species and remains standing for long periods even when dead. Water depths and pool habitat availability are considered to be trending upward trend since buffers were retained and would provide both the short and long term wood necessary to create pools as trees die and fall into the stream. Previously harvested areas that occur within current RHCAs are forested. Standard RHCAs are expected to be retained during the next harvest rotation which would maintain the necessary wood component over time, thus maintaining the upward trend.  Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in both the1988 and 1993 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations which showed the same heavily vegetated banks and riparian areas as well as a dominance of cobble substrate.  Stream substrate composition in Pine Knob in 1988 was composed of 38% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 20% gravel and 42% large material (rubble to boulders). Surveys in 1993 showed a decrease in fine material to 27%, an increase in gravel to 30%, and the same amount of large substrate at 43%. This would indicate an improving trend in larger substrate size and decrease in fine substrate. Although there was an improvement in composition, the cobble embeddedness levels are static as they were measured at 44% in both 1993 and in 2012. Embeddedness was measured in the same stream reach during both surveys. There was one road related failure that was deposited in Pine Knob Creek; however it occurred prior to the 1993 survey. No other obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews nor were any other potential management-related sources. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within the drainage so determining a trend for embeddedness based on two surveys may not be appropriate.  Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 36% of the watershed between the 1960’s and 1988. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 11% of the area between the 1970’s and 2005. As a result ECA is currently at 3%, or a high condition. Streamside buffers were retained on all but 0.5 miles of stream in the upper portion of the drainage. Forested stands within what are now RHCAs are aged as follows: 6% are < 40 years old, 19% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 75% older than 100 years. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and bank stability in Pine Knob Creek.  There are almost 20 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 0.5 miles of the RHCA roads are graveled and opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. Gravel helps to minimize sediment production from roads (Swift, 1984: Burroughs and King, 1989) as does minimizing motorized use on roads. There were no obvious signs of road surface erosion (no rilling or gullying) during culvert inventories in Pine Knob Creek. Many roads were dominated by a base rock surface topped with grasses/mosses and small trees growing along their margins. The overall watershed road density is 4.8 mi/mi2 and the RHCA road density is 2.2 mi/mi2. This is an 11% reduction from densities in 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. Prior to 2014, there were 11.5 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissions all but 0.5 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 44 acres (4 acres/mile) of road back into productive forested habitats.  There are 9 stream crossings within the watershed with 8 occurring on very small seeps or streams. Two of the crossings were identified as needing cross drain additions and 3 need to be replaced as they are undersized or are in poor condition. Ditchlines in the drainage were well vegetated which help to filter out sediment to streams. There are no human caused barriers to upstream aquatic organism migration in the watershed. In summary, Appendix A Guidance (Conroy an Thompson, 2011) states that “…In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving.” A total of 10 acres of commercial thinning occurred in Pine Knob in the last 10 years (2005) and full PACFISH RHCAs were retained. It has been 27 years since any regeneration harvest has occurred. The lack of recent timber harvest combined with few stream crossings, past road decommissioning projects, mostly closed roads and no obvious sources of sediment other than a pre-1993 road failure would indicate that Pine Knob Creek is experiencing an upward trend. The stream has an excellent and fully functioning riparian vegetation component, stable banks, cool stream temperatures, and increasing amounts of gravel which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time.  Clear Creek Prescription Watershed 3.1.5.4.2 The 7,234 acre Clear Creek Forest Plan prescription watershed does not meet its water quality objective of 90% for fishery habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 38% in 2012. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA, 1992), the watershed currently is at 75% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend based on fishery habitat potential.  There are about 11 miles of fish-bearing and 17 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Clear Creek. The stream is suitable for chinook salmon, steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout. All three species have been found in in the stream during 1984 and 1993 surveys.  Stream temperatures were measured in Clear Creek near Pine Knob in the summer of 2011and 2012. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning and rearing (11°C and 13.1°C respectively). Relatively cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.1°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.1°C). This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed only a 9% probability of bull trout presence on 1.6 miles of headwater stream in 1980 and a zero percent probability in 2040. Summer water temperatures are considered to be warmer than preferred for bull trout.  Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in the1988 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations which showed the same heavily vegetated banks and riparian areas as well as a dominance of cobble substrate.  Stream substrate composition in Clear Creek in 1988 was composed of 12% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 2% gravel and 86% large material (rubble to boulders). Cobble embeddedness was 38% in 1988 below the Middle Fork and was 38% near Pine Knob Creek in 2012. No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within the drainage and surveys were not conducted in the same location between years. Determining a trend for embeddedness is therefore not possible given available data.  Pool-to-riffle ratios were noted as good (52:48) in the 1988 surveys of the mainstem below the Middle Fork. Surveys also noted low wood levels that were a result of the 1931 fire in that area. Surveys were not conducted in the upper reaches of the watershed. More recent observations in 2012 showed well vegetated riparian areas and buffer retention along streams adjacent to harvest units (see harvest discussion below). Riparian areas, and therefore wood levels, are trending up and would continue over time as intact riparian areas would provide the necessary wood component to streams over time.  Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 15% of the watershed between the 1970s and 1990s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 11% of the area between the 1980s and 1990s. Buffers of 150’+ along the mainstem of Clear Creek, and 50+’ on the smaller tributaries were retained during harvest beginning in the 1970s. As a result ECA is currently at 3%, or a high condition. Forested stands within what are now RHCAs are aged as follows: 13% are < 40 years old, 20% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 67% older than 100 years. The middle age classes are partly a result of a wildfire which occurred in 1931 and burned roughly 23% of the area. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the large percentage of older age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and stable banks in Clear Creek.  There are 26 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 0.5 miles of the RHCA roads are graveled and opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. The overall watershed road density is 2.3 mi/mi2 which is a 16% reduction in roads since 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. The RHCA and landslide prone road densities are 0.8 mi/mi2 and 0.04 mi/mi2, respectively. Prior to 2014, there were 16.5 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissioned all but 0.2 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 65 acres of road back into productive forested habitats.  There are 27 stream crossings within the watershed, 3 of which occur on fish bearing streams and which are not barriers to aquatic organism passage since they were replaced in 2012/2013. A total of 17 culverts are appropriately sized and the remaining 10 crossings are undersized for the area they drain. All roads also cross perpendicular to the stream channels which limit their effects to riparian vegetation; however portions of the ditchlines leading to those crossings are draining directly into the streams. These may be acting as a chronic sediment source of sediment to streams. Ditchlines leading to the 3 fish bearing crossings currently have cross drain pipes installed and are no longer adding sediment to streams at those sites.  In summary, no harvest has occurred in the Clear Creek prescription watershed in the last 21 years. The lack of recent timber harvest combined with intact RHCAs, low RHCA road densities, no fish passage barriers, mostly closed roads, and past road decommissioning and culvert replacement projects would indicate that Clear Creek is experiencing an upward trend. The stream has an excellent riparian vegetation component, stable banks, and cool stream temperatures which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time.  Middle Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed 3.1.5.4.3 The 4,025 acre Middle Fork Clear Creek Forest Plan prescription watershed does not meet its water quality objective of 90% for fishery habitat potential. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 50% in 2014. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA, 1992), the watershed currently is at 59% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend in fishery habitat potential.  There are about 7 miles of fish-bearing and 13 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Middle Fork Clear Creek. The stream is mostly suitable for steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout which were both observed during 1984 and 1993 surveys. The stream provides limited habitat for steelhead trout due to moderate to high stream gradients and limited areas of suitable spawning substrate.  Stream temperatures were measured in Clear Creek in the summer of 2011. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High (good) for steelhead spawning and rearing (10.7°C and 13.6°C respectively). Relatively cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.6°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.2°C) based on Matrix ratings. This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed only a 14% probability of bull trout presence on 1.4 miles of headwater stream in 1980 and a zero percent probability in 2040. Summer water temperatures are considered warmer than preferred for bull trout.  Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted in the 1993 surveys. The low number of pools and lack of depth is directly related to low wood levels (28 pieces/100m). Low wood levels appear to be natural as streamside buffers were retained during previous timber harvest (see regeneration harvest discussion below). Water depths and pool habitat availability are trending upward since buffers were retained and would provide both the short and long term wood necessary to create pools as trees die and fall into the stream. Previously harvested areas that occur within current RHCAs are forested. Standard RHCAs are expected to be retained during the next harvest rotation which would maintain the necessary wood component over time, thus maintaining the upward trend.  Stream bank stability was noted excellent in 1993. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream.  Stream substrate composition in Middle Fork Clear Creek in 1993 was composed of 26% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 25% gravel and 49% large material (rubble to boulders) using Wolman pebble counts. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 55% in 1993 and 50% in 2014. This would indicate a slight improvement in cobble embeddedness. No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within the drainage so determining a trend for embeddedness based on two surveys may not be appropriate.  Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 18% of the watershed between the 1970’s and 1980s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 9% of the area between the 1970’s and 1990s. As a result ECA is currently at 2%, or a high condition. About 6% of what are now RHCAs were affected by past timber harvest. Streamside buffers were retained on all units with the exception 2 small headwater streams. Forested stands within the RHCAs are aged as follows: 7% are < 40 years old, 54% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 39% older than 100 years. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood and bank stability in Middle Fork Clear Creek.  There are almost 15 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. All RHCA roads are graveled and are open to either seasonal or year round motorized traffic. The overall watershed road density is 2.4 mi/mi2 which is a 12% reduction in roads since 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. RHCA road density is 0.9 mi/mi2 and landslide prone density is 0.08 mi/mi2. Prior to 2014, there were 7.2 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissioned all but 0.3 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 28 acres of road back into productive forested habitats.  There are 13 stream crossings within the watershed, 2 of which are on fish bearing streams and are passable to aquatic organisms. Four other crossings have been identified for replacement and these plus an additional 2 require cross drain additions. Roads are expected to be contributing very little sediment to streams due to an overall low number of crossings, low RHCA densities, and the need for the replacement of only 4 crossings. In summary, no harvest has occurred in the last 23 years. The lack of recent timber harvest combined with relatively few stream crossings, low RHCA road densities, intact RCHAs, stable banks, and cool temperatures would indicate that Middle Fork Clear Creek is experiencing an upward trend. These combine to allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Effectiveness of Design Features As noted in Chapter 2, several design features have been proposed to reduce the potential effects of activities on the aquatic resource. These design features have been demonstrated as effective as described below. PACFISH RHCAs All management activities since 1995 have implemented PACFISH buffers in order to eliminate or reduce impacts to riparian areas and streams. With no new large disturbances in RHCAs, no long term negative changes to the measured habitat parameters are expected to result from more recent management activities. Various field reviews and monitoring activities support the conclusion that the habitat conditions have improved since the writing of the Forest Plan in 1987 (see Existing Condition section). Much of the recovery is likely a result of fewer land-disturbing activities, better application of BMPs, RHCA retention, and better road design (USDA Forest Service 2009a, p. 91). Preliminary monitoring results from the PIBO monitoring across the Upper Columbia River Basin indicate improving trends in pool depth, bank stability, large wood frequency and volume, and the presence of spawning substrate (<3 inches in diameter) as a result of PACFISH implementation (USDA Forest Service 2009a). Significant decreases in the percent of fine substrates in pool tailouts has also been observed in managed watersheds. Local monitoring of 23 miles of RHCAs and 5.5 miles of temporary road after timber harvest and burning of the units was completed on the Lochsa District in 2014 (USDA Forest Service, unpublished data). There was no evidence of sediment moving from harvest units into RHCAs or sediment moving from temporary roads into harvest units or buffers. The thick vegetation that makes up RHCAs acts as an excellent, virtually impenetrable, filtering source for overland sediment flow. Retaining downed woody debris within the harvest units also provides structures that capture sediment and slow or stop its movement down the slope. No-harvest buffers of 100–150 feet adjacent to timber sales have been shown to be adequate in protecting the riparian vegetation necessary to maintain natural stream temperature levels (Anderson and Poage, 2014; Ott et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2004; Sridhar 2004; FEMAT 1993). PACFISH buffers greatly exceed these guides on fish bearing streams and meet the guides on non-fish bearing and intermittent streams. Best Management Practices (BMPs) would be followed for all action alternatives as stipulated by the Idaho Forest Practices Act. Idaho water quality standards regulate nonpoint source pollution from timber management and road reconstruction activities through the application of BMPs. The adjacent Clearwater National Forest has an excellent record of successful implementation of BMPs. Between 1990 and 2002, the Forest had a BMP implementation rate of 98% and a 97.8% rate of effectiveness (USDA Forest Service 2003). Survey results from 2004 through 2008 indicate implementation and effectiveness rates of 98% or greater. These reports can be found in the project file. The same BMPs would be applied to the project and are expected to have similar results. Road Work Road reconditioning includes brushing, blading, and spot surfacing roads with gravel where needed. Blading and rocking is done to provide an even and reinforced running surface that can withstand truck traffic. Cleaning ditches and adding cross drains can also occur to maintain or improve drainage. Overall these activities are considered beneficial to water quality (Burroughs 1990; Grace and Clinton 2006; Switalski et al. 2004; Swift and Burns 1999). NOAA stated that surface graveling has been shown to be effective at reducing erosion from road surfaces, especially at road/stream crossings. Foltz (2008) showed that the use of high quality aggregate (gravel) produced 3 to 17 times less sediment than marginal quality aggregate. The basalt aggregate used for the Clear Creek project roads is composed of basalt which is considered high quality as it does not easily break down into smaller, dust forming particles. A study by Swift (1984) showed that placement of a 6-inch lift of 1.5-inch minus crushed rock reduced sediment production by 70% from the unsurfaced condition over a 5-month period. The gravel achieved this amount of protection even though this period included 6.46 inches of rainfall in 5 days. In 13.3 months, the gravel with established grass at the margins of the traveled way reduced sediment production by over 84% compared to 9.5 months when the road was unsurfaced; [cited in Burroughs and King 1989]. Road reconstruction includes adding cross drain culverts near flowing streams in order to divert ditch water and its associated sediment onto the forest floor instead of into the stream. Damian (2003) found that installation of cross drains at optimum sites reduced sediment delivery by 76%. The most important location for a cross drain was within 100–200 feet from a stream crossing. A number of studies have also shown that roads can affect the volume and distribution of overland flow and alter channel network extent, pattern, and processes (Harr et al. 1975; King and Tennyson 1984; Montgomery 1994; Jones and Grant 1996; Wemple et al. 1996, 2001 [cited in Croke, et al., 2005]). Water control structures, such as ditches with relief culverts, broad based dips, water bars, and turnouts, are used to drain insloped road surfaces and minimize the travel length of overland flow (Keller and Sherar 2003); such that, increasing number of cross-drains reduces drainage area that collect water, reduces erosion, and hydrologic connectivity of road segments to streams [cited in Brown, et al., 2013]. Road reconstruction also includes the replacement of existing culverts at live stream crossings that are sized for a 100-year flow event. Culverts sized to handle these events are less likely to plug with debris and fail when compared to smaller pipes. Dust abatement on log haul roads is designed to minimize the amount of road related sediment (via fugitive dust and road surface erosion) added to streams. A 1993 study by Sanders and Addo showed that dust abatement produced half the amount or less of dust as untreated graveled roads. They also showed that traffic speeds affect the amount of dust produced. Slower traffic speeds (20–30 mph) produce half as much dust as higher speeds (40+ mph). Log haul traffic speed is not expected to exceed 30 mph and would be closer to 20 mph due to the narrow, twisty road network in Clear Creek.  Environmental Consequences 3.1.63.1.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects As noted above, the analysis area for the direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area. Alternative A—No Action No logging, no road decommissioning, and no culvert replacements, additions, or removals would occur under the No Action Alternative. Any watershed improvement activities (culvert replacements/removals through road reconditioning/reconstruction and decommissioning) would require additional NEPA analysis prior to implementation. No direct effects to streams would result from the No Action Alternative, since no stream channels or streamside areas would be disturbed. The indirect effects include the following: • Roads needed for future management that may be contributing sediment to streams would continue to do so until further NEPA is completed and funding is obtained to improve them. Culverts would remain undersized, and ditchlines would remain connected to streams. Twenty miles of roads, all within RHCAs, would be maintained in the moderate-risk category for sediment entering streams from ditchlines. Roughly 69 crossings would remain at risk for failure due to retention of undersized culverts. An estimated minimum of 140 tons (equivalent of 10 dump truck loads) of soil could be delivered to a stream in the event of one crossing failure. Crossing failures and the lack of additional cross drains on the roads in in Pine Knob, Middle Fork, and mainstem Clear Creeks could result in a Forest Plan downward trend in sediment. The risk is low in Pine Knob Creek and mainstem Clear Creek due to few stream crossings and limited access. The risk is moderate in Middle Fork Clear Creek due to a higher number of stream crossings and year round access on Forest Road 286. • The 3.2 miles of NFS system roads proposed for decommissioning within RHCAs could continue to deliver sediment to streams through road surface erosion or future failure. A total of 17 stream crossings are associated with these roads. The risk is considered low for all but 1 mile of road. The 1 mile of NFS road 77781 at the head of Big Cedar Creek has the highest risk of effects because it runs adjacent to the stream and occurs within 150 feet of it on average. Overall RHCA road densities on National Forest lands would remain at 1.4 mi/mi2. • No management-related changes, either positive or negative, would occur in the existing aquatic habitat condition. Instream and riparian processes of habitat development and wood recruitment would continue in the project area. Riparian habitat conditions would continue to improve as growing, aging trees gradually provide shade and large, woody debris to streams. Alternative A would inhibit the ability of the Forest to further limit or reduce sediment delivery to streams from roads in order to meet or maintain Forest Plan water quality objectives. Roadside ditches would continue to deliver sediment to streams indefinitely due to a lack of cross drains. In the event of stream crossing failures, this alternative has the potential to affect the Idaho state standard for cold water aquatic life and salmonid spawning (i.e., beneficial uses). The risk of crossing failures increases as culverts age and their conditions deteriorate. Alternatives B, C, and D Design features would be used to minimize direct input of sediment to streams from management activities. RHCAs would be retained on perennial and intermittent streams adjacent to timber harvest units. Temporary roads would be built along or near ridgetops with no stream crossings. Road reconstruction and reconditioning would install cross-drain culverts or drivable dips to divert roadside ditch flow onto the forest floor instead of into streams. Road surfacing with gravel on both reconditioned and reconstructed roads would also occur where needed to minimize sediment production and delivery to streams. Road decommissioning would remove all perennial and intermittent stream channel crossings and would recontour roads within RHCAs. No prescribed fire would be ignited within RHCAs, though low-intensity fire would be allowed to back into them. Grassland improvement activities would occur outside of RHCAs. Few direct effects would occur to fish or their habitat from implementing the action alternatives, due to the following: • RHCA retention would prevent any direct effects to fish or their habitat from timber harvest, precommercial thinning, or prescribed fire activities taking place under the action alternatives. All vegetation would be retained within the RHCAs. Data have shown that buffers are adequate to prevent sediment input into streams (USDA Forest Service 2006b; Ott et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2004; Sridhar 2004; FEMAT 1993; Clearwater National Forest Annual Monitoring Reports 1998–2009; K. Smith, personal observations; USDA Forest Service, unpublished data, 2014). All potential instream and riparian woody debris would be retained, and no streamside vegetation would be removed. No disturbance would occur in riparian areas or stream channels during timber harvest, and past monitoring indicates that little disturbance would be expected from prescribed fire. The lack of effects would allow for the continued upward trend in Pine Knob, Middle Fork, and mainstem Clear Creek which do not currently meet their Forest Plan water quality sediment objectives. • Road decommissioning in all the action alternatives would remove 3.2 miles of roads from RHCAs, and all affected areas would be fully recontoured. This decommissioning would result in a 16% reduction in RHCA road miles and the removal of an estimated 8 stream crossings. Decommissioning would return 13 acres of RHCA back into a forested state over time. Road densities in RHCAs on National Forest lands would be reduced to 1.0 mi/mi2, which would move the watershed condition category from moderate to good, as defined by NOAA (1998). • Road reconstruction would replace 69 undersized culverts with culverts sized for a 100-year flow event. Cross-drain culverts would also be installed in ditchlines in order to divert ditchline flow away from the streams. Road reconditioning would only add or replace cross drain culverts. No live water is involved in the cross drain work. • Road decommissioning and replacement of undersized culverts are the only activities that would directly affect streams. Instream activities during culvert removals and replacements would introduce locally measurable amounts of sediments immediately downstream of the sites. The sediments and increased turbidity levels would settle out downstream; the distance is expected to be less than 600 feet (based on past monitoring) due to small stream size and low flow during the dry season, when work would occur. On very small streams (<18”) or seeps the distance is expected to be less due to very low stream flows and therefore a very low downstream delivery potential. This disturbance may degrade substrate conditions, as fine sediments deposit over existing gravels. However, sediment input would occur over a short time frame (1 day or less per site). The estimated amount of sediment potentially added to a stream from culvert removal is less than 20 pounds (0.01 tons) per site (Foltz et al. 2008). The majority of turbidity associated with culvert removals/replacements is associated with the disturbance of existing instream sediment. Very limited amounts of new sediment are added to the stream due to design feature (BMP) implementation. No direct effects to threatened or sensitive aquatic species would occur, as none of these species are known to reside within a minimum of 1,000 feet of any of the removal/replacement sites. Culvert removals would provide a direct benefit to all aquatic species by eliminating the risk of future crossing failures. • Culvert removal and replacement would remove about 0.1 acres of riparian vegetation at each site. Removing primarily shrubs and small trees is unlikely to cause stream temperature increases, because the area affected is small (estimated to be <10 acres for all sites combined). Streams are small (<24 inches wide) at all but one site and have very low flows during the summer when work would occur. No measurable changes to stream temperatures are expected at these sites because all are well shaded by dense vegetation (shrubs/trees) above and below the sites. The only wide site occurs on a tributary to Brown Springs Creek and is 9 feet wide. Temperature could increase but it is unlikely due to a well vegetated stream both above and below the removal site. • No direct effects to streams would occur from road reconditioning where culverts are not replaced, no culverts ext, or during cross-drain culvert installation activities since no stream channels would be disturbed. Cross-drain culverts would be installed an average of 50 to 100 feet away from stream channels, and no mechanism is present to deliver sediment to streams from this activity. • No direct effects to streams and threatened or sensitive aquatic species would occur from temporary road construction activities since all roads would be located on or near ridgetops where there are no stream crossings and would be decommissioned after use. There are no delivery mechanisms for sediment from temporary roads to be delivered to streams. Decommissioning results in a bumpy texture in the road with woody material spread over it. Based on recent monitoring of temporary roads on the Clearwater NF (USDA Forest Service, unpublished data from 2014) no mechanisms are present that could deliver sediment into stream channels from these roads; PACFISH buffers and vegetation and woody debris left within harvest units act as barriers to potential sediment delivery. The action alternatives would not directly affect Idaho State standards for cold water aquatic life, secondary contact recreation, or salmonid spawning. The indirect effects to fish or their habitat from implementing the action alternatives would be minimal to beneficial because of the following: • No indirect effects to streams or fish species would occur from timber harvest or temporary road construction. RHCAs are effective at preventing sediment delivery to streams from these activities. They are also effective at maintaining stream temperatures (see Effectiveness of Design Features previously discussed). • Detectable effects to stream channel stability at the prescription watershed level are not expected as a result of increased water yield (see Regulatory Compliance Section below and the Biological Assessment ROD Attachment 2 Errata). Stream channel stability is rated as good in the majority of project area streams due to large stream size, large substrates and well vegetated streambanks. The combination of these stream conditions combined with BMP implementation are expected to minimize the risk of effects to stream channel stability. • Monitoring of other projects indicates that no indirect effects should be expected from low-intensity prescribed fire that would be allowed to back into RHCAs. This type of fire does not typically make its way to riparian areas or streams due to dense tree canopies and high relative humidities, which slow fire movement. • No indirect effects to (pool frequency, water temperature, large woody debris, bank stability, lower bank angle, and width-to-depth ratio; i.e., PACFISH RMOs) are expected, because riparian areas would not be disturbed. As noted in the Watershed section, water yield is not expected to increase to the point where it would decrease bank stability, and sediment yield would not increase sediment delivery to the point where it would affect width-to-depth ratios. • Road decommissioning would remove 8 crossings and the fill material associated with them. The removals could add 160 pounds (0.08 tons) of new sediment to streams (Foltz et al. 2008). These amounts are considered minimal when compared to the 40 stream miles over which the sediment may be deposited. The sediment would be expected to flush out of the system within 1 to 2 years (Cissel et al. 2013; Luce and Black 2001; MacDonald 2005). The removals would eliminate the risk of crossing failures at these sites and subsequent input of a minimum of 1,120 tons of soil into streams. Decommissioning would provide for long-term indirect beneficial effects to streams and fish species. Decommissioning RHCA roads would contribute to the upward requirement as required by the Forest Plan for Pine Knob, Middle Fork, and mainstem Clear Creek. • Road reconstruction under all action alternatives would reduce the risk of sediment delivery to streams. Culverts would be replaced and cross-drain culverts installed at 69 stream crossings under all the action alternatives. These activities would add about 0.7 tons (1,380 pounds) of sediment to the watershed. The amounts are considered minimal when compared to the 65 miles of stream over which the sediment may be deposited. The replacements would greatly reduce the risk of future crossing failures and subsequent input of a minimum of 9,660 tons of soil into the watershed. After project activities are complete, no undersized culverts would remain on NFS lands. New cross-drain culverts would intercept ditchline flow and route sediment away from stream channels. Preliminary monitoring of similar pipes in the Fan Creek drainage on the Lochsa Ranger District indicates that the risk of sediment entering streams after the work is complete would be almost nonexistent (K. Smith, personal observation, 2008). Monitoring showed that only 1 out of 37 pipes routed ditchline flow down the forested slope and into a stream channel. A different design on that one pipe would have prevented any routing to the stream. The remaining pipes routed sediment for an average of 40 feet downslope from the culvert outlet, with no delivery to streams. Road reconstruction activities would allow for a continued improving trend that could help to meet or maintain Forest Plan desired sediment conditions in Clear Creek and its tributaries. Road reconditioning could indirectly add sediment to streams through surface erosion after blading and delivery via roadside ditches. The factors affecting the amount include the roads slope, surfacing materials, the amount of traffic, and contributing road area when combined with rainfall intensity/duration and snowfall (MacDonald and Coe, 2008). The risk of delivery is expected to be low due to the location of the roads mostly near ridgetops, very few streams with very low flows and BMP implementation including cross-drain culvert or drivable dip installation. The zone where erosion could enter streams typically lays between the cross drain on each side of the stream and the live stream crossing itself. This equates to about 200’ of road length for each crossing. There are an estimated 50 crossings over which blading could occur on reconditioned roads. This equates to about 2 miles of road over the entire project area where sediment could be added to streams. Effects from sediment delivery to the crossings on reconditioned roads are expected to be localized and short-term due to the minor amounts of sediment that could be added to these very small streams/seeps. Dust abatement over the crossings is expected to further reduce the sediment delivery potential during log haul as previously discussed. After logging operations are complete, 4 miles of road would remain opened yearlong to motorized use, 16 miles would only be opened seasonally, and 34 miles would be closed to use. The drainage improvements are expected to minimize sediment delivery over the long term, especially when combined with either limited or no motorized used after the project is complete on the majority (93%) of roads. The expected effects to fish habitat are expected to be minimal due to the distance away from fish bearing streams (minimum 300’ but most are 1,000 feet or more). The long term effects of cross drain additions would be beneficial when compared to the existing condition. • Forest Plan required FISHSED modeling indicates minor effects to deposited sediment. Modeled changes for cobble embeddedness increase by 1% to 3% under all alternatives for all prescription watersheds except Kay Creek. No changes in cobble embeddedness occurred for Kay Creek. • FISHSED modeling indicates a 1% decrease in summer rearing capacity in all prescription watersheds for all action alternatives. Summer rearing remains above 90% for all watersheds except for Pine Knob (86%), and Middle Fork Clear Creek (79%). Adequate summer rearing would be provided for in all subwatersheds. • FISHSED modeling shows a 1%–3% decrease in winter rearing capacity for all prescription watersheds under all action alternatives except for Middle Fork Clear Creek which remains unchanged at 15%. Winter rearing capacity ranges from 15% to 50% depending on the watershed. • Lower Clear Creek Face and Big Cedar Creek prescription watersheds were not assigned fish/water quality objectives or sediment yield guidelines, primarily because most of the area is on private lands; subsequently, no FISHSED models were run for these two prescription watersheds. • In summary, FISHSED modeling predicts a 0%–3% change in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing in B channel types for the action alternatives. FISHSED is most appropriately used to assess the effects of changes in habitat quality when cobble embeddedness changes are greater than 10% (Stowell et al. 1983). Predicted changes for the proposed actions are less than 10%. No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on PACFISH effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009a, 2014) Having no substantial effects to cobble embeddedness would allow for the continued upward trend for fish habitat carrying capacity in Pine Knob, Middle Fork, and mainstem Clear Creek. • The action alternatives would indirectly result in minor, short-term localized negative effects to cold water aquatic life during culvert removals, replacements, and road blading and ditch pulling. Because these activities are designed to improve conditions over the long term, all state designated beneficial uses would be maintained over the long term. • There would be long-term (>50 years) positive indirect effects to listed and sensitive fish species as a result of the road-related sediment reduction activities previously discussed. No indirect effects from timber harvest, temporary roads, or prescribed fire are expected. Cobble embeddedness is not expected to measurably increase from management related activities and riparian areas would continue to function naturally from a lack of activities within them. This would allow for improved large wood levels over time that would create pool habitat for salmon and trout species. Stream temperatures would also not be affected due to only minimal activities within RHCAs (culvert removal/replacement). 3.1.6.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis area is the entire 58,990-acre Clear Creek drainage. It includes all federal, State, and private lands in the watershed. This analysis area was selected since activities outside of the drainage would have no effects on aquatic habitats within the drainage. Quantitative information was available for roads only. Google Earth was used to assess riparian conditions and the analysis is presented in qualitative form. The time frame considered for cumulative effects is 2015 to 2022. This period covers all road reconditioning/reconstruction and decommissioning activities from the beginning of the project until 2 years after these activities are expected to be completed. The additional 2 years after project completion is the expected amount of time it would take for shrubs and ground cover to respond after culvert replacement or decommissioning activities occur. The growth of shrubs and other ground cover limits overland flow of sediment after these activities. This analysis considers only those activities that affect road densities, culvert size, or cobble embeddedness levels (as modeled by FISHSED) during the cumulative effects time frame as these are directly related to the issue indicators assessed above. Grazing on federal lands was not considered due to the limited effects to streams observed since 2010. There are 175 cow/calf pairs allowed in the area (average 250 acres per pair) with seasons of use between June 1 and October 30. Field observations by the project Fisheries Biologist and Hydrologist noted limited trampling and forage of grasses in very few riparian areas. Most were associated with small flat areas in headwater streams adjacent to roads or at road crossings. There was very little streambank damage observed except at culverts where they obtain drinking water. Out of the 200 culvert sites reviewed, less than 10 had evidence of cow use. Trampling and foraging was light and total vegetation removal was not observed. Reporting by the Range specialists indicate <5% bank disturbance from 2009-2012 (the allotment standard is <10%). Post-season riparian use did not exceed the standard of <35% in all years monitored. Grazing does not appear to be contributing measurable sediment to streams on federal lands as a result. Grazing was not considered on private/state lands as there is limited riparian related and cattle stocking level information available for privately grazed lands. Effects cannot be determined from Google Earth images. Recreation on trails was not considered since most are non-motorized. All motorized trails are associated with existing roads and considered in the roads portion of this analysis. A review of foot/stock trails at several steam crossings showed little-to-no erosion. Timber harvest was conducted on 300 acres of state lands in 2013 and an unknown amount of acres on one small privately owned property. These activities were not considered for cumulative effects since harvest in either location would require the retention of Forest Practices Act buffers. This would provide for stream protection and minimize the amount of sediment entering streams from harvest activities. The proposed harvest is on state lands would not be measurable since it occurs on only 0.005% of the watershed. Harvest on private lands is not expected to be measurable since most private properties appear to be owned by non-timber production oriented individuals and acreages tend to be small. Riparian areas within 100 feet of streams on private/State lands in lower Clear Creek are well vegetated along most major stream courses; however Google Earth reveals that the mainstem of Clear Creek lacks overhead cover. This is due to a combination of the 1931 fire which consumed most riparian trees and a wide (35–50 feet) stream channel that is difficult to fully shade. Less than 10% of the mainstem of lower Clear Creek has vegetation on both sides of the stream tall enough to shade it during the hot summer months. Also as the stream drops in elevation, large non-forested openings appear adjacent to the stream. The north and east sides of Leitch Creek and the east side of Clear Creek are constrained by naturally occurring steep, grass-dominated hillslopes and basalt outcrops. The outcrops do not grow trees and therefore cannot provide for stream shading. The streambanks on the lower mainstem of Clear Creek are dominated by willow, alder, Japanese knotweed, grass and are very stable. The overstory, where it occurs, is comprised of cottonwood and mixed coniferous tree species. Japanese knotweed occurs extensively along the banks of the mainstem of Clear Creek. Its thick growing pattern restricts the establishment of large trees which in turn prevents shading opportunities for the creek. While it provides for bank stability, the knotweed itself is not tall enough to provide shade. It is also difficult to eradicate once established therefore riparian shade conditions are not expected to improve where it occurs. Smaller, non-mainstem streams are dominated by shrub understories and mixed conifer overstories that provide some shade to the streams. The reduced vegetation along portions of Leitch and Clear Creeks contributes to warm stream temperatures as noted by past surveys (Nez Perce Tribe 1987) and current data. As previously discussed, stream temperatures in lower Clear Creek exceed those preferred by salmon and trout which in turn affects temperatures at the Kooskia Hatchery. The lower mainstem of Clear Creek exceeds desired temperatures as a result of both natural warming (Groom et al. 2011) and the removal of riparian vegetation (in this case the replacement of trees with knotweed). There is an estimated 20 miles of road within 100 feet of streams on private/State lands with an associated 23 stream crossings. The Leitch Creek and Clear Creek Roads lie adjacent to these streams and both are paved limiting potential sediment input to streams. Of the stream crossings, 3 on mainstem Clear Creek are known to be bridges. There is no information regarding the remaining culverts or any proposed road work in RHCAs on state or private lands. It is assumed that the culverts are undersized. Past activities on state/private lands include the replacement of 1 culvert on Leitch Creek and 1 on Clear Creek in 2011. Both plugged as a result of flood flows and were replaced with larger, appropriately sized culverts. The existing condition previously discussed includes all past road building, fish passage culvert replacement, and decommissioning activities through 2013. The activities considered for cumulative effects are proposed project road decommissioning and road reconstruction activities in combination with the Browns Spring Creek Culvert Replacement Project (2013/2014) and the proposed Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project (2015 and beyond). Culvert inventories found the Browns Spring culverts to be undersized but contain no fish. One was a moderate priority for replacement and the other a low priority. Both will be replaced with structures sized for a 100-year flow event. The Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project would remove about 15 crossings and 8 miles of roads within RHCAs. Decommissioning nonsystem roads would reestablish vegetation on 32 acres of RHCAs. These projects could add locally measurable amounts of sediments to streams, as discussed above under the road decommissioning portion of this analysis. Sediment is not expected to travel more than 600 feet downstream, due to the timing of installation (i.e., during low-flow periods) and BMP implementation to control sediment. Crossing removals are beneficial but are not included in the calculation for stream crossings, because the streams were not surveyed and it is not known if the crossings currently exist. A long-term beneficial effect would be associated with crossing removals. Alternative A Lower Clear Creek (on private lands) has 5 appropriately sized stream crossings (3 bridges and 2 culverts) on county roads. Ongoing and future foreseeable federal actions that could increase instream sediment or turbidity levels include the Browns Spring Creek Culvert Replacement Project and the Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project. Under this alternative, those two projects could contribute 340 pounds (0.2 tons) of sediment to Clear Creek or its tributaries. This alternative would cumulatively retain 87 undersized culverts in the watershed. The potential failure risk for these crossings would increase with age. There would be a potential for the addition of 12,180 tons of sediment to be added to the drainage if all 87 culverts failed. The Clear Ridge project would decommission 8 miles of roads in RHCAs; however, road densities would not be affected since nonsystem roads are not included in road density calculations. However, both of these projects would provide a minor beneficial effect from potential sediment reductions to project area streams. No measurable negative cumulative effects to cobble embeddedness are expected based on NEZSED or FISHSED modeling; however effects could occur in the event of multiple culvert failures. The level of effects cannot be determined since it is not possible to determine when culverts could fail. Stream temperatures would not be affected by ongoing or future foreseeable road decommissioning and culvert replacement activities (see Direct Effects previous discussion above). Stream temperatures would increase naturally in the downstream direction and would continue to warm on private lands where the stream is wide and overhead cover limited. There is a chance that temperatures could decrease slightly as streamside trees in previously burned riparian areas grow to maturity. Alternatives B, C, and D The proposed project activities, when combined with past, ongoing and future foreseeable federal activities would cumulatively reduce RHCA road density from 2.7 mi/mi2 to 2.6 mi/mi2 at the watershed scale. This improvement would maintain the Clear Creek watershed in the moderate condition class (NOAA 1998). The action alternatives would cumulatively retain 18 undersized culverts in the watershed. Road decommissioning would cumulatively return 45 acres of RHCAs to a forested condition. No cumulative effects to cobble embeddedness, summer rearing, or winter rearing capacity are expected as FISHSED-modeled changes indicated no measurable (>10%) change in these factors. Culvert replacement, road reconstruction, road reconditioning, and decommissioning activities were modeled in NEZSED and FISHSED and were assessed for cumulative effects related to sediment that may be produced from these activities. Sediment yield would increase to 17% but would not exceed the Forest Plan standard of 30% at the Forest boundary and would drop to below existing levels within 6 years (see “Watershed” section of this document). There would be no long term sediment yield increase as a result. No substantial changes to cobble embeddedness from FISHSED modeling were indicated therefore no cumulative sediment increases to downstream areas of Clear Creek, including the Kooskia Hatchery, are expected. Road decommissioning, reconditioning, and reconstruction activities would provide for long term (>50 years) instream sediment reduction by reducing the risk of road failures where crossings are replaced or removed and cross drain culverts are installed. Undersized culverts on private lands would still pose a failure risk and could contribute sediment to Clear Creek. Culvert replacement, road decommissioning, road reconditioning, road reconstruction and reconditioning activities would produce short term (less than 5 years) negative effects from sediment input to streams and would have an overall positive cumulative effect to aquatic habitat and species in the project area related to sediment. As noted by NOAA (2005), keeping roads hydrologically disconnected from streams and unstable slopes will reduce water yield effects and delivery of fine sediments to streams. No measurable negative cumulative effects to instream sediment are expected as a result of any of the action alternatives when combined with State/private lands and other projects on federal lands. No cumulative effects to stream temperatures are expected. Groom et al. (2011) showed that timber harvest on Oregon State managed lands using State forest management standards had a low (8.6%) probability of post-harvest temperatures increases. The state standards required a 25-foot no-harvest zone from the stream and a limited-harvest area from 25 to 170 feet out from the stream. The Clear Creek project would not harvest within 150 feet of non-fish bearing perennial streams and 300 feet of fish-bearing streams. Given that no riparian vegetation would be harvested, no stream temperature increases are expected, therefore there would be no cumulative effects to temperatures downstream on private or state lands, and there would be no temperature effect on the Kooksia Fish Hatchery. Temperatures in lower Clear Creek are expected to continue to exceed desired conditions due to natural warming, a wide stream channel, and the lack of shading vegetation (trees) along much of the stream.  Regulatory Compliance 3.1.73.1.7.1 Endangered Species Act Listed steelhead trout are known to occur in the mainstem, West, South, and Middle Forks of Clear Creek as well as Pine Knob Creek. Densities ranged from low to moderate. There are a total of 35 miles of designated critical habitat within Pine Knob, Brown Springs, and Kay Creeks as well as the mainstem, West, South, and Middle Forks of Clear Creek. The retention of RHCAs adjacent to timber harvest units are designed to protect both the fish and their designated critical habitat through the retention of all vegetation. A detailed analysis of effects to listed fish species (steelhead and bull trout, as well as essential fish habitat for salmon) was completed and can be found in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Biological Assessment and July 2015 errata found in the ROD, Attachment 2.  Sediment 3.1.7.1.1Potential effects to steelhead or Essential Fish Habitat (EFH—i.e., spring chinook/coho salmon habitat) would result from the addition of sediment into streams from road decommissioning, reconstruction or reconditioning activities. These activities would add pulses of sediment to streams in the short term while culverts are removed/replaced and runoff occurs from ground disturbed areas; however, they would reduce existing sediment delivery in the short and long terms. Road reconditioning and reconstruction are expected to reduce a high percentage of existing road sediment sources and in that way reduce sediment delivery, but at the same time would create newly disturbed roadbeds and ditches and potential for increased sediment delivery. Minimization of that potential increased delivery from reconstruction and reconditioning and road use relies on design features and BMPs including gravelling, cross drains, and dust abatement. No steelhead trout or EFH occurs within 1,000 feet of the culvert replacement or removal sites; however two culvert replacement sites are within 600 feet of steelhead designated critical habitat on upper Clear Creek. No fish were observed at either site during culvert inventories due to the very small stream size; however they could still be present.The expected net reduction in sediment delivery from roads should allow stream substrates to become less embedded over time. Stream substrate function may thereby improve for steelhead spawning, incubation, emergence, and rearing; and survival and production of steelhead in Clear Creek could generally increase due to the proposed action. Small localized and short-lived decreases in substrate condition caused by culvert work, and by reconstructed/reconditioned sections of road and road use near streams are expected. Those site specific sediment additions may temporarily decrease habitat use and possibly an increment of steelhead production in small portions of the project area for 1-4 years. Short term, localized sediment deposits are expected to dissipate quickly in the presence of fewer chronic sources. Reduction in chronic sources will occur through past and proposed road decommissioning, and through the elimination or reduction of existing sediment sources.  Water Yield 3.1.7.1.2The following summarizes the potential effects to water yield from proposed activities. Please see the Watershed Section of this document for more detailed information. Canopy removal from timber harvest and road building has the potential to cause changes to streamflow and water yield. An analysis of effects to streamflow from timber harvest based on equivalent clearcut acres (ECA) was conducted because they have concentrations of regeneration harvest, high intrinsic spawning, and rearing potential, and steelhead presence. This analysis was conducted on Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Hoodoo Creek subwatersheds. These are the same HUC6 watersheds as those identified in the 1998 Biological Opinion for Steelhead and Salmon in the Upper Columbia and Snake River Basins (NOAA, 1998). The results of the analysis were compared against the Matrix of Pathways and Indicator (NOAA, 1998) for each of the subwatersheds. The Matrix identifies the following condition: High (good) is defined as ECAs for the entire watershed (HUC5) and all of its subwatersheds (HUC6) being <15%. Moderate conditions are 15-20% for the entire watershed or 15-30% for one or more subwatersheds. Low conditions have ECAs >20% for the watershed and one or more subwatersheds >30%. ECA for the Clear Creek watershed (HUC5) is 12% for Alternative B, 13% for Alternative C, and 11% for Alternative D. All alternatives maintain the Clear Creek watershed in a high condition based on the Matrix indicator. Under Alternatives B and D ECA would decrease to pre-project levels (4%) after 12 years and under Alternative C it would take 14 years. For the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed ECA is predicted to increase to 15%, 16% and 14% in under Alternative B, C and D, respectively. Alternative B and C moves the subwatershed from a high to moderate condition based on the NOAA Matrix (1998). ECA increases to 7%, 8%, and 6% in the South Fork of Clear Creek maintaining it in a high condition for all alternatives. ECA increases to 20%, 26%, and 19% in the Hoodoo subwatershed moving it from a high to a moderate category based on ECA. ECA has the potential to affect water yield. Forest Hydrology, Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1974) describes that most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of timber harvest before increases are detectable. Calculations and graphs (from USDA FS 1974) were used to analyze the allowable ECA that would maintain average annual runoff below a 10% increase. These calculations indicate that an ECA of 25% would maintain the runoff to below 10% and therefore any ECA below this amount would maintain water yield below detectable amounts. ECA remains below 25% for the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed and the expected percent increase in average annual water yield for Alternative C is 6%. Proposed activities are not likely to result in detectable changes to average annual flow or stream bank stability. ECA for Hoodoo was calculated at 26% for Alternative C which is above the 25% recommended ECA. The percent increase in average annual water yield for Hoodoo was calculated at 10% which is at the threshold of potential channel changes (Grant et al. 2008). An increase over the recommended 10% in average annual runoff is generally allowed when stream banks are more than 60% stable. Stream habitat surveys from 1988, when combined with field observations from 2010-2012, indicate banks are very stable in the West Fork Clear/Hoodoo Creek subwatershed. About 90% of the surveyed reaches in the subwatershed had well vegetated (90%+) streambanks, substrates dominated by boulders and rubble with some sand (mostly behind debris jams) and large amounts of woody debris (average 23 pieces/100 meters) with many debris jams noted. It is likely that no detectable changes would be noted or would be very minor in this subwatershed due to the stable nature of the banks and the presence of large woody debris which would aid in moderating flows. In addition, as discussed in Grant et al. (2008) water yield effects on channel morphology are generally limited to stream reaches where channel gradients are less than approximately 2% and in which streambeds are composed of gravel and finer substrate material. Gradients in the mainstems ofWest Fork/Hoodoo range between 3 and 10%. The tributaries range from 10% to 82%. Stream substrates are dominated by cobbles, rubble and boulders. Peak flow effects on channel morphology are generally not found on high-gradient (>10%) streams and are minor in most step-pool systems (Grant et al. 2008). It is unlikely that channel morphology changes would be expected in the West Fork/Hoodoo subwatershed as a result of Alternative C. Because the final ECA or percent increase in average annual water yield percentages are at or below those where detectable changes to peak or baseflow are likely, or channels are well armored with vegetation, rock and wood, steelhead spawning and rearing habitats downstream of proposed activities are unlikely to undergo detectable changes due to harvest related changes in streamflow. NOAA (2005) conducted a literature review of potential changes in flow from a watershed following timber harvest. This can be summarized as follows: (1) It is difficult to separate streamflow effects of timber harvest from roads but the major influence appears to be from roads; (2) effects from timber harvest are most pronounced in small basins (< a few square kilometers) and in relatively small floods (<1- to 2-year recurrence interval); (3) effects of water yield increases with percent of basin clearcut with detectable changes in yield when over 25% is harvested; (4) forest buffers serve to reduce harvest area and maintain bank stability and resilience to floods; and (5) it is unclear if changes to peak or baseflow from timber harvest alone has significant effects on habitat or salmon populations. Their review suggests that the effects of changes in stream flow from harvest will have negligible effects on salmon as long as (1) roads are kept hydrologically disconnected from the stream system and (2) riparian and floodplain forest functions are preserved. The Clear Creek project would accomplish these through cross drain installation and RHCA retention. Six of the culvert removal or replacement sites (three in upper Clear Creek and three in South Fork Clear Creek) have or potentially have steelhead present. Fish removal and salvage prior to dewatering the sites could result in harassment, injury, and potential mortality to steelhead at the site. Work would occur during the low streamflow period and blocknets would be used to keep fish out of the work area and to minimize the potential effects to steelhead trout. The potential effects to steelhead are a result of the culvert replacement work. As previously discussed, effects from timber harvest and potential increases in water yield are not expected. An “adverse effect” is any action that has an apparent direct or indirect adverse effect on the conservation and recovery of a species listed as threatened or endangered. Such actions include, but are not limited to: actions that directly alters, modifies, or destroys critical or essential habitats or renders occupied habitat unsuitable for use by a listed species, or that otherwise affects its productivity, survival, or mortality; or actions that directly results in the taking of a listed species. See Title 50 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 17.3 for an explanation of what constitutes a taking. Take is defined as “harass, harm…wound…or to attempt to engage in any such conduct” (FSH 2670.5). Harass is an act that creates the likelihood of injury by annoying a species to the extent that it significantly disrupts normal behavior patterns including breeding, feeding, or sheltering. Harm is an act that actually injures or kills an individual listed species. Harm also includes actions that modify or degrade environmental conditions that result in direct death or injury. The project would have long term beneficial effects to steelhead and their designated critical habitat as well as EFH from road removal, culvert replacement, and road reconstruction/reconditioning activities. The risk for potential effects to steelhead trout, designated critical habitat or EFH from road-related project activitiescould occur, therefore the ESA effects determination for the project is may affect, likely to adversely affect steelhead trout, their designated critical habitat, and EFH. Any adverse effects to steelhead, their designated critical habitat, or EFH are expected to be minimal due to BMP implementation. The Clear Creek IR Project is consistent with the 1998 Biological Opinion for Salmon and Steelhead in the Upper Columbia and Snake River Basins in that it applies PACFISH direction and does not prevent the attainment of PACFISH RMOs, conducted a watershed analysis that identified needs to improve habitat for listed steelhead in Clear Creek, and conducted project level Section 7 consultation. The project may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect bull trout since they were only sporadically found in the lower drainage. Temperature regimes are not within desired ranges for bull trout during the spawning migration period. Temperatures at the mouth of the streams create a thermal deterrent during this time. The proposed activities are not expected to directly or indirectly affect the species as a result. The project would allow for the maintenance of natural temperature ranges through PACFISH buffer retention. Modeled sediment yield and cobble embeddedness levels increased from harvest but not to measurable levels. There would be no effect to bull trout designated critical habitat since none exists in the drainage.  Region One Sensitive Species 3.1.7.1.3There would be potential effects to westslope cutthroat trout, redband trout, and spring chinook as a result of road improvement or decommissioning activities. The effects are similar to those discussed for steelhead. The project may therefore impact individuals, but would not lead to their listing under ESA. This is due to the short term increase in sediment as modeled by NEZSED and temporary increases in suspended sediment associated with culvert removals and replacements. The project would have long-term beneficial effects to these species from reduced road-related sediment input to streams. The project would have no impact on Pacific lamprey or pearlshell mussel as they are not known to occur within the watershed, within close proximity of proposed activities, or would not result in effects to preferred habitats. 3.1.7.2 PACFISH The project complies with PACFISH in that the project would not retard the attainment of Riparian Management Objectives for bank stability, width to depth ratio, instream large woody debris, pool frequency, or water temperature. Project activities would allow for improvement in large wood, pool frequency, and water temperature overtime as no riparian areas would be harvested. Bank stability would be maintained throughout the drainage as a result of RHCA retention and limited increases in modeled water yield. Road decommissioning and culvert replacements would help to maintain bank stability over the long term by eliminating or greatly reducing the potential for future crossing failures. Stream crossings can destabilize banks downstream for thousands of feet if they fail. Adding cross drain culverts would reduce the potential amount of sediment reaching streams from ditchlines. This would be beneficial over the long term (decades). The project complies with PACFISH standards and guidelines for timber harvest and road-related activities by not conducting timber harvest in RHCAs (Guideline TM-1), minimizing roads in RHCAs (RF-2b), reconstructing road and drainage features to control sediment delivery (RF-3a), obliterating roads not needed for future management (RF-3c), and improving culverts at stream crossings to accommodate a 100-year flow event (RF-4). It also complies with designing burn projects to contribute to the attainment of RMOs (FM-4) and implements watershed restoration that promotes the long-term ecological integrity of ecosystems (WR-1) and contributes to the attainment of RMOs (FW-1). 3.1.7.3 Forest Plan All action alternatives comply with the Forest Plan Water Quality Objectives and the upward trend requirement. FISHED modeling indicates no measurable changes in cobble embeddedness, summer or winter rearing capacity in any of the prescription watersheds. In addition, road decommissioning and reconditioning/reconstruction activities would reduce potential sediment input and allow streams to continue to trend toward meeting desired conditions for cobble embeddedness, summer rearing and winter rearing capacity. The following discusses the effects of the actions on upward trend in the 3 prescription watersheds that do not currently meet their water quality objectives.  Upward Trend 3.1.7.3.1All alternatives propose the same actions related to roads including reconditioning, reconstruction and decommissioning as well as culvert replacements. All alternatives would maintain an upward trend therefore Alternative C was the only alternative assessed as it proposes the most harvest and temporary road building.  Pine Knob Prescription Watershed 3.1.7.3.2The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 1.8 miles of road, 0.1 miles of which is within RHCAs. This would reduce watershed road densities to 4.3 mi/mi2 (9% reduction) and RHCA densities to 2.0 mi/mi2 (a 6% reduction). The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.5 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 2 acres of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 8.5 miles of system road (48% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 2 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All 8 crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 5.8 miles of road (69% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of Pine Knob to 18% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 45%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 2% increase in cobble embeddedness and decrease in summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is well below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on PACFISH and local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009b and 2014). ECAs would increase to 14% under all alternatives and would remain within the High (good) condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The current upward trend is expected to continue in the Pine Knob prescription watershed because of road improvements associated with the project, the relatively intact RHCAs, the expected minimal effects of modeled sediment to streams, water yields that would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs.  Clear Creek Prescription Watershed 3.1.7.3.3The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 0.6 miles of road in the prescription watershed. This would reduce watershed road densities to 2.3 mi/mi2, or a 2% reduction. RHCA densities would remain at 0.8 mi/mi2. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.2 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 1 acre of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 2.7 miles of system road (18% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 10 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 2.7 miles of road (18% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results indicate sediment yield increases in Clear Creek near the confluence with the South Fork to 18% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 30%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 1% increase in cobble embeddedness and 1% decrease in summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is well below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009b and 2014). ECAs would increase to between 12% and 15% depending on the alternative and would remain within the High condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The current upward trend in streams is expected to continue in Clear Creek because of mostly intact riparian areas, road related activities that are expected to decrease sediment input, water yields would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs.  Middle Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed 3.1.7.3.4The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 1.3 miles of road in the prescription watershed, 0.1 of which is in RHCAs. This would reduce watershed road densities to 2.2 mi/mi2 (a 9% reduction) and RHCA densities to 0.9 mi/mi2 (or a 6% reduction). The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.3 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 1 acre of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 6.9 miles of system road (51% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 4 existing and remove 1 undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 3.2 miles of road (24% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of Middle Fork to 11% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 30%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 1% increase in cobble embeddedness and 1% decrease in summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is well below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009b and 2014). ECAs would increase to between 7% and 9% depending on the alternative and would remain within the High condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The current upward trend in streams is expected to continue in Middle Fork Clear Creek because of the mostly intact riparian areas, road related activities that are expected to decrease sediment input, and the implementation of design features and BMPs. 3.2 CULTURAL RESOURCES  Analysis Area 3.2.1The scope of the analysis for cultural resources includes the entire project area and considers the effects of all proposed activities for their potential effects to cultural resources. The cumulative effects area includes the entire proposed project area.  Regulatory Framework 3.2.2The USDA Forest Service is mandated to comply with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 [Public Law 89-665] and its amendments. Section 106 of the NHPA requires that Federal agencies with direct or indirect jurisdiction over Federal, federally assisted, or federally licensed undertakings afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity for comment on such undertakings that affect properties included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) prior to the agency’s approval of any such undertaking: [36 CFR 800.1]. Historic properties are identified by a cultural resource inventory and are determined to be either eligible or not eligible by the cultural resource specialist in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). Sites that are determined to be eligible are then either protected in-place or adverse impacts must be mitigated. Each cultural property is evaluated against four strict standards in a process to determine that properties historical significance for possible inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. These criteria address specific elements that may be contained within that specific property. These criteria are found in the Code of Federal Regulations, 36 Part 60. Criteria A: The quality of significance is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or Criteria B: … That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or Criteria C: … That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or Criteria D: … That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.  Analysis Methodology 3.2.3The data presented are a result of reviewing existing information available for the proposed project located on Forest Service Managed Lands on the Moose Creek Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests. Documents reviewed include previously completed cultural resource inventory reports, historic property site records, historical forest maps, and other historic documents. In accordance with National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, a cultural resource inventory of the proposed project was completed in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The findings of the inventory would be submitted to the Idaho State Historic preservation Officer (SHPO) for review and concurrence.  Resource Indicators 3.2.4The indicator used for cultural resources is the number of sites affected by proposed project activities.  Affected Environment 3.2.5The project area has seen numerous changes in human land use patterns. From its earliest Native American inhabitants who lived in and traveled through the area utilizing its resources, to the families who homesteaded and settled in the area, to the minerals exploration from the mid-1800s into the early 1900s, the region witnessed several waves of occupation through time. Each group interacted with the environment in their own way, extracting various products and manipulating it to their benefit when possible. There have been four previous cultural resource surveys conducted in the proposed project area. There are thirteen previously documented cultural resource properties located within the boundary of the analysis area. Three of these properties are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), seven sites are not eligible for the NRHP, and three sites are unevaluated for their NRHP eligibility.  Environmental Consequences 3.2.6The 4 alternatives would have varying effects on the 13 known cultural properties. 3.2.6.1 Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects  Alternative A 3.2.6.1.1Alternative A would have no effect to historic properties. Historic properties would continue to degrade naturally. There would be no change in effects from the current condition.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.2.6.1.2Under Alternatives B, C, and D five cultural resource sites are located within proposed project activity areas. Of these five sites, three sites have been determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) while two sites are unevaluated. For the three sites eligible for the NRHP and two unevaluated sites, mitigation measures would be developed in consultation with the Idaho State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in order to achieve a no adverse effect determination prior to project implementation (see Table 3-4). Cultural resource surveys have been completed for the project area and would be submitted to the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for concurrence prior to project implementation per 36 CFR 800.4 (b) (2). Table 3-4.

Thus, there is little potential for project activities to produce or contribute to negative effects that would be cumulative with other actions.  An appropriate cultural resource survey has been conducted for the project area and would be submitted to the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for concurrence prior to project implementation. Table 3-5.

The economic analysis area includes local towns and communities influenced by the timber sale activities. These towns include Grangeville, Elk City, Kamiah, Kooskia, Harpster, Stites, Clearwater, Orofino, Pierce, Weippe, and Lewiston. The timber sale influence on these towns depends on their proximity to the watershed, their economic dependence on it, and their historic use of the watershed dating to settlement more than 100 years ago. The Nez Perce National Forest has provided wood to local mills since the 1930s. The Forest’s output, along with BLM timber outputs, accounted for half the total timber harvested in Idaho County in the mid-1990s. Most of the Forest timber output was processed in mills located in or near the towns mentioned previously.  Regulatory Framework 3.3.2The project complies with Forest Plan direction to develop cost-effective projects, and it complies with the NFMA by emphasizing resource management over timber volume output. The Clear Creek project is being considered at least partially as a Land Stewardship Project under Section 347 of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY 1999. This Act allows flexibility in combining traditional service and timber sale contract activities to more effectively accomplish ecosystem restoration through forest management. It also allows more flexibility in funding projects by using the timber stumpage value generated from selling the trees to pay for doing the other resource actitivies. One drawback to stewardship contracting is that those projects would not contribute any revenue to the Treasury or to the 25% Fund for counties with acreage within the Forest. All the proposed activities other than the actual timber harvesting, such as precommercial thinning, road decommissioning, and grass restoration, would be considered for inclusion as stewardship projects. 3.3.2.1 National Forest Management Act The NFMA requires that a sale “consider the economic stability of communities whose economies are dependent on such national forest materials, or achieve such other objectives as the Secretary deems necessary” (NFMA, Sec. 14e1c). The NFMA also requires that “the harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output of timber” (NFMA, Sec. 6, g,3,E,IV). The project meets the requirements of the NFMA by using the IMPLAN model to evaluate how each alternative would affect economic stability in local communities. The project also uses harvest systems that are based on ground-truthed silvicultural practices, not on the highest dollar return, to achieve the desired long-term forest and access needs. 3.3.2.2 Forest Service Manual The FSM directs that economic feasibility be considered in project design during the early planning and NEPA documentation. A sale feasibility analysis was done at Gate 1, which led to consideration of treatments providing cost-reducing economic benefits. One major adjustment was the use of mechanical site preparation versus burning site preparation methods where possible. The mechanical methods provide better leave tree survival and utilize cheaper purchaser-supplied equipment. 3.3.2.3 Forest Plan The Forest Plan requires that the project provide a sustained yield of resource outputs at a level that will help support the economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs (USDA Forest Service 1987a, Goal A.1, p. II-1). Alternative A would not contribute toward the Forest Timber sale program or support the economic timber harvesting structure of the local communities, while Alternatives B, C, and D would. Alternative C would best meet this goal. 3.3.2.4 Executive Order 12898; Environmental Justice EO 12898 requires that each federal agency make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States and its territories. The Clear Creek analysis did not reveal any disproportionately high and adverse impacts to Nez Perce Tribal members, minority populations, or low-income populations. None of the action alternatives are expected to negatively affect Tribal members, minority or low-income populations or any United States citizen. No environmental health hazards or adverse impacts to the fishery or wildlife population are expected to result from implementation of any alternative. This project would not disproportionately affect income level in the economic analysis area.  Resource Indicators 3.3.33.3.3.1 Timber Harvest–related Jobs and Income Jobs and income generated from the project contribute to community stability. 3.3.3.2 Sale Feasibility Sale feasibility is represented by the Present Net Value (PNV). A project with a positive PNV would be a sellable project. A project with a negative PNV would either not sell or require supplemental funding to make it sellable. The PNV is also an indicator of the amount of timber generated funding that would be available for stewardship projects or returned to the Treasury Analysis Methodology The Nez Perce National Forest Plan Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (USDA Forest Service 1987b) describes the economic impacts of implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan addresses the economic analysis process and values placed on nonconsumptive items such as recreation opportunities, community stability, cultural resources, habitats, and populations. This economic analysis will not revisit the information presented in the Forest Plan and will focus only on those costs and revenues associated with implementing the proposed activities in the project area. The Forest Service Micro IMPLAN model was used to derive the indirect and induced economic effects. Direct economic effects were derived from mill surveys conducted by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana. The following response coefficients found in the table were developed for the 1997 Clearwater National Forest Timber Sale Program Information Reporting System (TSPIRS). TSPIRS, a reporting system developed jointly with the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Forest Service, has been reviewed and approved by Congress. The coefficients from the Forest Service Micro IMPLAN model to derive the indirect and induced economic effects are as follows: • Harvest-Related Jobs Generated: 13.5 per 100,000 cubic feet (MCCF) • Harvest Income to Communities: $383,406 per MCCF • Federal Income Tax Generated: $57,511 per MCCF The Region 1 Gate 1 and 2 spreadsheets and the Quicksilver model with Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests area factors were used to determine sale feasibility and appraised value. The Quicksilver model uses recent transactional evidence based on local timber sales to determine sale value. The timber stand database and extensive field reviews were used to determine timber volume and species composition; these are the two primary factors determining gross value of a timber sale. Net value depends on costs for logging system, haul distance, slash disposal, planting, and mitigation activities. The cost estimates for this sale are based on recent similar sales in the vicinity.  Affected Environment 3.3.4In a report for the Interior Columbia River Basin Ecosystem Management Project (Columbia Basin Assessment), titled “Rural Communities in the Inland Northwest,” communities are characterized in terms of their ability to manage change and adapt to it in positive, constructive ways. The report emphasizes community resiliency, which is a function of community conditions such as economic structure, infrastructure, civic leadership, cohesiveness, and amenities. The Columbia Basin Assessment resiliency ratings for Lewis County (Kamiah), Idaho County (Kooskia and Grangeville) and Clearwater County (Orofino, Pierce, and Weippe) are low. However, preliminary findings from a study recently completed by University of Idaho sociologists working on the Columbia River Basin Assessment show that many timber-dependent communities tend to be more resilient and able to tolerate change than is commonly assumed. The resiliency rating for Nez Perce County (Lewiston) is high. The towns of Kamiah, Grangeville, Orofino, Weippe, Pierce, and Lewiston all show high to very high historic employment in the wood products manufacturing industry per the Columbia Basin Assessment. As of July 2013, Lewis County had an unemployment rate of 6.4%, Idaho County had a rate of 9.3%, and the rate in Clearwater County was 12.7% (4th highest in Idaho). The average unemployment rate in Idaho is 6.6%, and the national average is 7.4%. In addition, counties dependent on federal timber receipts to help fund schools and highways find that this source of funding is drying up, so they have relied more heavily on taxes to bolster their income, to the detriment of low-income families and the unemployed who feel that timber harvest should contribute more. Idaho has always been a natural resource–based state, although as natural resource extraction declines, the state has moved toward diversification. Many communities have made impressive strides in achieving Idaho Gem Community status and working to diversify their economies. (The Gem Community program was established by the Idaho Department of Commerce to encourage communities to plan their futures.) As reported by the Idaho Department of Labor, the timber products industry went through hard times in the early 1980s, but the firms that survived were streamlined and modernized with the hope to have a consistent supply of timber from National Forest System lands.  Environmental Consequences 3.3.53.3.5.1 Direct and Indirect Effects  Alternatives A, B, C, and D 3.3.5.1.1Table 3-8 displays the job and income consequences of implementing the timber harvest alternatives. The Forest Service Micro IMPLAN model was used to derive the indirect and induced economic effects of the timber harvesting; the model does not reflect additional jobs and income related to implementation of the non-timber harvest stewardship activities, such as precommercial thinning and road decommissioning, which are the same for all the action alternatives. These stewardship activities would generate some additional jobs, but not to a level like the timber harvest and would not point to any alternative as generating more than the other because they would be the same between alternatives, except for the no action alternative. Alternative A (No Action) would not generate any timber harvest jobs. Alternative C would generate the most jobs and revenue, because it generates the most timber volume, followed by Alternatives B and D. The other activities being proposed along with timber management, such as road decommissioning, precommercial thinning, broadcast burning, and reforestation, also provide jobs and income to the local economy. For example, in addition to providing jobs for heavy equipment operators required to decommission the roads, the project will create jobs for laborers performing erosion control and project inspection. Table 3-8.

This part of the economic analysis compares the differences in benefits and costs by examining the timber’s appraised value and PNV for each alternative. The appraised value is the timber value based on recent bidding; that is, the amount the Nez Perce National Forest anticipates the timber would sell for minus costs for logging, road reconstruction, site preparation/fuel abatement, and mitigation. The PNV is the anticipated selling value minus the costs to implement the sale and reforest the land. An alternative with a positive PNV has stumpage values exceeding costs, whereas an alternative with a negative PNV has costs in excess of stumpage values and may require supplemental funding to complete all activities. The PNV money is an indicator of funding that could be available to fund stewardship projects on sales designated for stewardship contracting. Information provided by the economic models is used as a tool to understand the relative monetary differences between alternatives rather than to predict exact values for each alternative, since the variables may change between now and the time the timber sells. Alternative A (No Action) does not generate any value or accrue any costs associated with the NEPA decision, so its PNV is zero. However, Alternative A would not be able to offset the $175,000 cost of doing the NEPA analysis. Tree mortality is occurring in many of the areas planned for regeneration. If a large wildfire (100+ acres) were to start as a result of fuel buildup from the anticipated tree mortality, fire suppression costs would likely exceed $300,000 (for comparison, the 350-acre Granite Fire of 2011 cost $2.2 million). Alternatives B, C, and D are all predicted to generate enough stumpage value to cover all of the sale costs, plus reforestation, while also capturing the timber value before it deteriorates from tree mortality. All of these alternatives should generate revenue, with Alternative B being the most economically feasible and generating the highest revenue (Table 3-9). An item that contributes to these Alternatives’ efficiency is that the harvest units are large in size and focused in a localized area, which reduces mobilization costs. In addition, completing the vegetation treatments in larger areas, such as in Alternative C which regenerates larger patches, allows for areas to be completed, and is then closed for an extended period of time while the new trees grow. This reduces road maintenance costs and the continued costs of multiple entries. All the action alternatives would use a combination of Forest Service burning and/or machine piling for the reforestation site preparation. Site preparation and tree planting are the two largest single-cost activities associated with implementing the different alternatives, but since each action alternative has the same costs per acre, the economic effect is proportional to the amount of acres needing site preparation and planting. To reduce reforestation costs, natural regeneration should be implemented where possible and where it meets the project purpose and need. Table 3-9 displays the predicted appraised total and PNV for each alternative. As noted in the Table 3-9, Alternative C produces the most volume, but Alternative B provides the greatest revenue, because Alternative B requires less site preparation and involves lower planting costs than Alternative C. Alternative B has higher site preparation and planting costs than Alternative D, but Alternative B generates enough commercial thin volume, which doesn’t require reforestation costs, to offset the other costs (Alternative B thus produces a higher overall economic return). The economic impact of using fewer roads in Alternative D equates to an 18% to 28% reduction in volume outputs, an 11% to 13% reduction in acres treated, and a $1.5 million to $2.4 million reduction in revenue generated. Alternative D would utilize longer skidding distances to bring logs to a landing, which can result in undesirable soil impacts due to logs dragging on the ground for a longer distance verse being carried on a truck.  Table 3-9.

NEPA costs, which total about $277,000, are not included in this cost total. d Stewardship costs include precommercial thinning, road decommissioning, grass restoration, and landscape prescribed burning.  3.3.5.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area includes Clearwater, Idaho, Lewis, and Nez Perce counties in Idaho. The timber volume is scheduled to be sold through 5 different sales over a 5-year period, starting in 2015. Typical sale duration would be 4 years each; the last sale would be completed in 2025 (harvest activities usually do not start on the first year a sale is sold), for a total of about 10 years of harvest activities. Post-harvest reforestation and site preparation work could continue for up to 5 years following harvest on the last sale, creating a potential end date of 2030, for a total of 15 years of harvest plus post-harvest activities. Economic impacts for activities such as logging and sawmilling lumber are shown in the section above. These impacts are described as direct and indirect effects, but they are also considered cumulative effects due to the additional jobs, taxes, and income they provide. When impacts from additional jobs and income are taken into account, this project contributes to the Forest’s 5-year timber sale plan and may boost the Forest’s output by 10 million board feet per year. Current sold sales and foreseeable local sales, as shown on the Forest’s Five Year Action Plan, would also affect the same communities and contribute to the long-term timber flow to these communities.  Alternative A—No Action 3.3.5.2.1Since this alternative does not propose any timber harvest or other stewardship activities, it would not contribute cumulatively to local community jobs and income. Alternative A would maintain current unmanaged use and related income. It could potentially increase future firefighting costs and locally generated income as trees die and create excessive fuel loadings susceptible to wildfire ignitions.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.3.5.2.2Added to the Forest’s 5-year timber sale plan, these alternatives would sustain jobs (ranging from 1,571 to 2,133 jobs). However, Alternatives B, C, and D are not expected to generate a large number of jobs or significant amounts of income from timber harvest or roadwork; therefore, these alternatives would not be likely to cumulatively affect local communities beyond the past 3-year employment averages. The mills tend to adjust their annual production to sustain long-term outputs (instead of boom-and-bust cycles) by purchasing private and State timber along with National Forest sales. Prescribed burning is planned in association with the previously mentioned timber sale projects. Prescribed burning is mostly handled internally by the Forest Service. Forest Service employees are supported by local community services. The prescribed burning proposed under other projects in the area can be handled with the normal Forest Service workforce and therefore would not have a cumulative effect on the local communities. Additional stewardship items including road decommissioning, precommercial thinning, and grass restoration would also contribute money to the local communities. If additional forestry activities are implemented within the counties by the State or by private industry, additional forestry workers may be needed. 3.4 FUELS  Analysis Area 3.4.1The fuels analysis area encompasses the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage and all of its tributaries. This area was selected because it includes all Forest NFS managed lands that could be affected by project activities.  Regulatory Framework 3.4.2Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) direction and all federal and State laws and regulations applicable to fuels would be applied to the project. Nez Perce National Forest Plan—The project meets the Nez Perce National Forest Plan’s specific fire management goal for this area, which is to “protect resource values through cost effective fire and fuels treatment through the utilization of material and using prescribed fire” (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-2). The modified fuel bed would decrease the probability of stand-replacing crown fire and increase firefighter effectiveness, reducing the probability of resource damage at a lower cost while utilizing wood fiber. Smoke Management—The Forest Service is a member of the Idaho/Montana Airshed Group. This airshed group is composed of State, federal, tribal, and private organizations that are dedicated to the preservation of air quality in Idaho and Montana. Its members are prescribed burners and the public health and regulatory agencies that regulate the burning cooperatively to prevent smoke impacts from fires designed to accomplish land management objectives. The analysis area falls within Airshed 12B. Project-related prescribed fire activities would be approved by the airshed group; approval would be contingent on prevailing weather conditions, other planned ignitions in the airshed, and the resultant smoke impacts, including impacts to the Selway–Bitterroot Wilderness (a Class 1 airshed).  Resource Indicators 3.4.3Issue: From a fuels perspective, the vegetation includes little variation. Variations can create barriers that can slow a fire or alter its behavior (such as dropping the fire from the crowns to the ground). Existing areas of past harvest and other vegetation types such as shrubfields could act as barriers; however, they are too small to affect fire behavior at the landscape scale. The current homogeneous fuels support a risk of crown fire that could pose a threat to life, property, and other resource values. Approximately 94% of the project area is in the WUI as defined by the Idaho County Wildfire Mitigation Plan Committee (Idaho County 2009). Indicator: Percentage of project area that could support a crown fire (active, passive, or conditional). Issue: Existing landscape health is not consistent with a landscape that operates with a natural disturbance cycle. In this case, fire was the dominant disturbance agent. Mean fire return intervals in some of the landscape are above historical conditions. Age classes are trending toward larger size classes and lacking in early seral size classes. In a healthy landscape, disturbance would create larger patch sizes in a mosaic. In the analysis area, timber harvest has created a smaller, more uniform, linear-edged series of patches; fire exclusion has eliminated any new sizable disturbance-created patches since the early 20th century. Indicator: Fire Regime Condition Class (FRCC) is a measure of landscape health based on fire return interval and age class distribution. It describes the degree of departure between the current vegetation and a simulated historical reference condition. Patch size accounts for the spatial distribution across the landscape.  Analysis Methodology 3.4.4Field Sampled Vegetation (FSVeg) stand exam data were collected for the treatment units and other stands within the project area in 2011. This information was processed through the Forest Vegetation Simulator and Fire and Fuels Extension (FVS/FFE) model (Reinhardt and Crookston 2003). Outputs from this model include surface fuel loadings, fire behavior fuel models, canopy base height, and aerial fuel loadings that determine whether a fire is a surface fire or crown fire. Techniques to reduce crown fire occurrence and severity include the following: increase canopy base height; reduce canopy bulk density; reduce forest canopy continuity; and reduce surface fuels (Scott and Burgan 2005). With the exception of Alternative A, the proposed treatments accomplish some or all of the techniques. The FSVeg Spatial Data Analyzer v2.3.0 was used to collectively grow the stands through 10-year timesteps to visually show the changes through space and time. Fire type (surface or crown) was modeled in FVS/FFE under 97th-percentile weather conditions, representing extreme fire weather. Weather data from June 1 through September 30 were selected to represent the entire summer fire season. Percentile weather was computed using Fire Family Plus (Main et al. 1990). Twenty years (1990–2010) of weather data from the most representative weather station were analyzed to determine weather conditions. Two different analyses of landscape health using FRCC were conducted. One used the FRCC software and direction outlined in the Interagency FRCC Guidebook. The silviculturist developed a crosswalk between LANDFIRE Biophysical settings and VRUs; tree size class was determined by using the R1 Vmap vegetation layer. The second analysis was used only for describing the existing condition and utilized the FRCC Mapping Tool software and LANDFIRE vegetation layers. The patch size analysis (FRAGSTATS, see Silviculture report in the project record) indicates whether the area will trend toward desired conditions after treatments are completed.  Affected Environment 3.4.53.4.5.1 Fire Occurrence, History and Risks Historically, fire was the primary disturbance factor that shaped the composition and structure of forests in the Clear Creek drainage. The largest wildfires burned 27,245 acres between 1870 and the 1931 fire, which burned approximately 11,000 acres. Only 155 acres have burned since then. Overlaps in fires occurred mostly on the South Fork Clear Creek area between the late 1800s and 1931, with other minor overlaps occurring later. The overlap in all fires totals about 7,900 acres. The total area burned was therefore approximately 19,490 acres, or 45% of the drainage. Fires burned mostly on dry-to-moist habitat types of the South Fork, mainstem, and Middle Fork of Clear Creek. Stand-replacement fire occurred in the South Fork, while mixed-severity fires occurred in the upper Clear Creek and Solo Creek areas. The determination of severity was based on the overall age class distribution of trees in the area. No large fires have been documented in the moist habitat types in the headwaters of the drainage within the last 150 years. As the forests in these habitat types begin to age, they become more susceptible to mortality from insects and disease, which increases the risk of crown fire. This weakness was observed in the upper South Fork Clear Creek area in the summer of 2011, when an infestation of the Douglas-fir tussock moth (a defoliator) began occurring. Damage to trees was noticeable over about 3,000 acres. A second outbreak in 2013 would have led to heavy tree mortality; however no outbreak occurred. A review in 2013 showed that the tops were killed in many of the older trees but the younger trees showed no signs of damage. Since tracking began in the 1970s, a total of 285 fire starts have occurred in Clear Creek. The number of starts per decade ranges from 53 to 90. The total acreage burned ranges from 19 to 80 acres per decade since 1932. Effective wildfire suppression since the early 1900s has greatly reduced fire frequency in the area. Fires that occur in the area are suppressed due to the proximity to private property adjacent to the forest boundary and the timber management areas. Current fuel profiles would allow crown fires to establish in over 50% of the area. Once established, these fires are virtually impossible to stop without the fire running into a barrier (such as a change in fuel type) or the weather variables changing (such as relative humidity rising overnight). Indirect suppression strategies would need to be employed for a crown fire. Conditions like these can lead to large amounts of burned acreage, high costs, and adverse impacts to resources including soils, wildlife, water resources, and infrastructure. Approximately 94% of the project area lies within the rural Salmon-Clearwater WUI. The WUI designation was determined by Idaho County and a group of collaborators in 2005 and revised in 2009 as mandated by the National Fire Plan of 2001 (USDI and USDA 2001). This mandate allowed each County to determine its own definition of WUI. Idaho County adopted this philosophy: “The wildland-urban interface refers to areas where wildland vegetation meets urban developments. These areas encompass not only the interface (areas immediately adjacent to urban development), but also the continuous slopes that lead directly to a risk to urban developments.” In addition, the County identified the protection of structures and private property and protection of “the biological resources of the management area” as concerns (Idaho County 2009). The Nez Perce National Forest Plan direction requires fire suppression (control, contain, confine) in about 70% of the drainage. Fires for resource benefit could be allowed to burn in the Clear Creek Roadless Area, the upper South Fork, and a portion of the West Fork of Clear Creek if sufficient fuel modifications are implemented. 3.4.5.2 Vegetation and Fuels A distinct moisture gradient occurs from west to east in the project area; this gradient is reflected in the range of habitat types in the area. The western portion of the drainage contains drier habitats that begin with bunchgrasses (which do not support trees) and move into the dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir/ninebark habitat types. Historically, fire played an important role in maintaining these habitat types, with low-severity fires occurring every 5–50 years and severe-intensity fire occurring every 90–200 years. Patch sizes ranged from 50 to 1,500 acres. Current patch sizes created by timber harvest range from 6 to 282 acres. Moving east, the habitats quickly transition to moister types dominated by grand fir and western redcedar. Historically, these habitat types were dominated by mixed species with sizable representation of white pine and western larch. White pine and western larch are long-lived tree species typically established after major forms of disturbance (fire windthrow) and have the potential to occupy a site for 200–300 years. Patch sizes for these species ranged from 40 to 1,000 acres historically. Current patch sizes range from 1 acre to 282 acres. The last habitat types found in the drainage are the cooler habitat types located in the headwaters of Clear Creek. These are dominated by subalpine fir and lodgepole pine and typically have stand-replacing disturbances every 90–150 years. Historically, patch sizes ranged from 40 to 1,000 acres. Current patch sizes range from 1 acre to 282 acres. Barriers to large fire spread are limited in the project area. A compilation of studies has shown that recent regeneration units or fresh fire scars are effective at stopping crown fires or reducing their effects if they are over 400 feet wide (Hudack et al. 2011). 3.4.5.3 Fire Regime and Condition Class A natural fire regime is a general classification of the role fire would play across a landscape in the absence of modern human mechanical intervention, but includes aboriginal burning (Agee 1993). Coarse-scale definitions for natural (historical) fire regimes were developed by Hardy et al. (2001) and Schmidt et al. (2002) and interpreted for fire and fuels management by Hann and Bunnell (2001). The 5 natural fire regime classifications are based on the average number of years between fires (fire frequency) and the severity (amount of replacement) of the fire on the dominant overstory vegetation. Historically, the drier mixed-conifer sites best fit a Fire Regime I, while the wetter sites best fit a Fire Regime III. However, with the unnatural effects of fire suppression, the drier sites are trending toward a Fire Regime II due to increases in ladder fuels; these conditions would increase fire severity. The same is occurring in the wetter sites, which are trending toward Fire Regime IV. Fire behavior effects and other associated disturbances for the low-departure class (FRCC 1) are similar to those that occurred prior to fire exclusion and other vegetative management activities. Ecosystems with a moderate departure from historic rates (33%–66%) have an increased risk of the loss of species composition, structural stage, and canopy closure from noncharacteristic fire. Class 3 ecosystems with a high departure from historic rates (>66%) feature vegetative composition and fuel characteristics that are highly altered from the natural regime; in these ecosystems, the risk of loss of key components is high. The FRCC in the project area, based on the vegetation attributes, is moderate (FRCC 2), with ranges from 41% in the West Fork drainage, 47% in the upper Clear Creek drainage, and 53% in the South Fork drainage. The overall FRCC, using the LANDFIRE/Vegetation Response Units (VRU) crosswalk and incorporating the fire frequency, yields a score of 39%, or a rating of moderate. A moderate rating means that the fire cycle is trending away from its natural ranges and is being affected by fire suppression or other land management activities. Over time, the drainage will trend toward the high-departure class. Estimates indicate that the area will move from moderate departure to high departure within 30 years if no disturbances occur, because the majority of the area will fall outside of the fire return interval of 30–100 years. Surface fuel loadings (downed wood) are increasing due to ongoing tree mortality and fire suppression. The benefits to soil productivity increase as more downed wood decomposes; therefore, more nutrients are available for plant growth. Ladder fuels are also increasing due to understory tree growth. Larger amounts of surface and ladder fuels increase the risk of high-severity, stand-replacing fire. This type of fire could lead to reduced soil productivity and moisture-holding capacity. From a fuels perspective, the vegetation includes little variation. Variations in vegetation patterns create barriers that can slow a fire or alter its behavior (such as dropping the fire from the crowns to the ground). Existing areas of past harvest and other vegetation types, such as shrubfields, could act as barriers; however, they are too small to affect fire behavior at the landscape scale. 3.4.5.4 Potential Fire Behavior Fire type (e.g., surface and crown) was modeled for the project area for extreme (97th percentile) weather conditions for visual display. The percent of fire type was quantified for the actual treatment units, and all crown fire activity (active, passive, or conditional) was grouped. Currently, 51% of the project area is susceptible to crown fire.  Environmental Consequences 3.4.6As noted above, the analysis area for direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area. 3.4.6.1 Alternative A—No Action  Direct and Indirect Effects 3.4.6.1.1Under this alternative, no treatments are planned; therefore, fuels would persist as discussed under the existing condition and accumulate further over time. Alternative A would cause no direct effects to fire type or FRCC rating, because no vegetation treatment would take place under this alternative. The indirect effect would be the trending of the landscape toward a FRCC 3 rating within 30 years. There would continue to be a lack of stands of young trees as existing stands continue on with succession. The landscape would also continue to trend toward to a more uniform forest dominated by non-early seral species. Canopy base height would remain low, crown bulk density would remain high, tree density would remain high, and the surface fuels would remain the same. The amount of the project area that could experience crown fire would increase as time passes. Therefore, direct control would be difficult, fires would be large, and costs would be high. Barriers to large fire spread would remain minimal. Direct Effects If Alternative A is selected, 51% of the proposed treatment area would continue to be susceptible to crown fire in 2022. FRCC remains in a moderate category at 39%. The patch sizes associated with these types of landscapes remain below desired conditions. Indirect Effects Factors favoring crown fire remain and increase over time. The project area becomes less diverse. Barriers to fire remain low, fire containment opportunities are limited, and fire size and costs are expected to increase. The landscape will trend toward a homogeneous forest dominated by large nonseral trees as the remaining smaller, younger patches continue with succession. No biomass removal opportunities or smoke emissions from logging slash will occur. 3.4.6.2 Alternatives B, C, and D  Direct Effects 3.4.6.2.1The direct effect of these alternatives is a reduction in potential crown fire acreage, a slight improvement in FRCC, and a marked improvement in patch size. Potential crown fire area is reduced by 7% in all alternatives, moving the area from 51% to 44% by the year 2022. The regeneration treatments would influence FRCC ratings by changing seral classes from mature to young stands. However, approximately 50% of current early seral patches change seral class within 10 years, so the effect of the regeneration treatments is lessened. The project area remains at a FRCC 2 rating even after treatments, due to relatively low amounts of proposed regeneration harvest. Alternatives B, C, and D regenerate 6%, 10%, and 5% of the project area respectively. All the action alternatives use prescribed fire on up to 3% of the area. Alternatives B and D reduce the overall landscape departure rating from 39% to 38%, and Alternative C reduces it to 37%, which is a slight improvement on the landscape but still maintains the area in the moderate category. Patch size increases across all action alternatives (Table 3-10), driven by the varying amount of regeneration harvest. Mean patch sizes are not as large as historically occurred; however, the trend is positive. Given the distribution across the landscape, these patches emulate a mixed-severity fire regime. Treatment units range in size, which is important to landscape and fuel variability. Discontinuities in surface, ladder, and crown fuels interrupt fire spread, but relatively small patches may not have a substantial effect on large fires. Treatments of individual stands under a given prescription would probably be irrelevant to fire behavior and effects at the landscape scale, because wildfires are often larger than individual treatment units (Finney and Cohen 2003). Many of the treatments in the proposed action span several stands and therefore should be large enough to affect a large fire. Canopy base heights would be raised, crown bulk density would be substantially lowered, tree density would be decreased, and surface fuels would be treated, all of which would lower fire intensity in the treatment units. Direct control options in the event of a fire would increase across the landscape as the fuel profile is interrupted, which should reduce fire size and cost. All the action alternatives affect similar acreage, and the reduction in acreage susceptible to crown fire is the same for each alternative: 7%. Acreage susceptible to crown fire will drop from the current 51% to 44% by 2022. Table 3-10.

The overall FRCC remains a 2 across all alternatives (Table 3-11). Table 3-11.

Slash treatments would either result in biomass to be hauled away or piles to be burned. Biomass is measured in dry tons; smoke production in particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) is measured in pounds. Table 3-12 and Table 3-13 show the amounts of biomass and smoke that would be produced as a result of the action alternatives.  Table 3-12.

The amount and arrangement of fuels directly affects fire type. The project area is sufficient to display effects. The time frame for cumulative effects is 10 years. The only activities considered for cumulative effects to fuels are management activities that may increase or decrease fuels over the next 10 years. The only activity considered for cumulative effects is fire suppression/exclusion. No current activities and no foreseeable future activities would affect fuels in the cumulative effects area. Fire suppression has been effective in the project area for nearly 100 years. The incremental effect of suppressing each small fire in the watershed has promoted late seral species (rather than early seral species) and changed the forest structure, which in turn has changed the way the forest responds to fires. Alternative A—No Action When combined with fire suppression, this alternative would cause a cumulative effect. Fire exclusion has created the current condition of contiguous fuels. Crown fire potential would continue to increase across the project area without treatments, FRCC ratings would move to the higher end of the moderate category in 10 years, and patch size would not be changed, which could affect future fire behavior. Alternatives B, C, and D A minor positive cumulative effect would be associated with the action alternatives. Fuel modifications across the landscape and in key locations along the Forest boundary could allow for natural ignitions to burn freely in portions of the project area. Fire suppression would continue on lands managed for timber; however, treatments would reduce fuels, help to improve FRCC ratings, and reduce crown fire potential in these areas. 3.5 NOXIOUS WEEDS  Analysis Area 3.5.1The analysis area for this assessment includes only the 43,731 acres of NFS lands, all of which lie within the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage.  Regulatory Framework 3.5.2Analysis and evaluation of noxious weeds in this project is based on direction contained in the Federal Noxious Weed Law (1974) as amended (1975), Executive Order 13112 for Invasive Species. Forest Service Policy (FSM 2080.5), Nez Perce National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, II-7, II-20, II-26, III-6), and Idaho State Noxious Weed Code (Title 22, Chapter 24). In general, the Forest is directed to implement an effective weed management program with the objectives of preventing the introduction and establishment of noxious weeds; containing and suppressing existing weed infestations; and cooperating with local, state, and other Federal Agencies in the management of noxious weeds.  Analysis Methodology 3.5.3This assessment addresses the presence of noxious weeds relative to expansion risk, susceptible habitats, and spread vectors. The effects are considered within the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. 3.5.3.1 Susceptible Habitats Habitats were classified as having low, moderate, or high susceptibility based on habitat type group (HTG) characteristics and known ability of weeds to colonize in these habitat types. Highly susceptible habitats can be colonized and dominated with exotic plants even in the absence of intense and frequent disturbances. HTGs with a low rating are only slightly susceptible to weed colonization. 3.5.3.2 Weed Expansion Risk The risk of weed expansion was determined by assessing the following factors; susceptibility of HTGs, the presence of weed infestations (seed source), the amount of fire and harvest activity (site disturbance), and the density of roads (spread vectors). Weed risk is the indicator of weed expansion in the project area. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data were used to display and calculate acres of activities occurring in each weed expansion risk zone. While it is well known that risk of weed invasion increases with disturbance and is variable depending on specific habitats, management activities and variable seasonal climate, making exact determinations of weed response would be extremely difficult if not impossible. In any scenario, the best predictions of weed response would be based upon local parameters of the particular project area. The weed risk model used by the Nez Perce National Forest is based upon local habitats, weed occurrences, disturbance levels, and available vectors. The logic and framework that this model has been based upon has been widely respected and adapted for a broader regional-level prediction model sanctioned by the Region One office of the U.S. Forest Service. 3.5.3.3 Exotic Plant Inventory Data Knowledge of existing vegetation populations is limited in the project area. Some surveys have been conducted, but generally these have been of limited scope. Where noxious weed populations have been documented and/or treatments have occurred the data is accurate and reliable.  Affected Environment 3.5.4Idaho’s noxious weeds are plant species that have been designated “noxious” by law in the Idaho code (Title 22, Chapter 24, “Noxious Weeds”). There are currently 64 Noxious Weeds on the state List. These 64 weeds are separated into three Categories based on the level of concern, which affects how they are managed. Statewide Early Detection Rapid Response (EDRR) category is top priority, as these are the new invaders and pose the greatest risk. No weeds in this category are in the project area. The next level is Statewide Control, these plants can be eradicated, but in most cases they are managed to reduce the infestations within 5 years. No weeds in this category are known to exist in the project area. The last category is Statewide Containment, most plants in this category are established populations and managed locally depending on the size and density of the infestation. Current noxious weed inventories in the analysis area identify 2 species from the Statewide Containment Category, Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) and Canada thistle, (Cirsium arvense) as the most widespread. These two weed species can be found primarily along roads and in the open, drier habitats within the project area. Two other weed species on the Statewide Containment Category, Houndstongue (Cynoglossum officinale) and Oxeye Daisy (Leuxanthemum vulgare), also exist in small numbers within the analysis area, but are not inventoried. These last 2 species are sporadically dispersed throughout the district, mostly by animals, and rarely occupy continuous areas, which makes mapping almost impossible. Currently the Moose Creek Ranger District conducts integrated weed management strategies that deal with weed infestations within the project area based on priorities outlined in the Annual Operating Plan for the Clearwater Basin Weed Management Area, a community based cooperative (CBWMA). The area has and will continue to receive high priority for invasive weed control work prior to and throughout the life of the proposed project. Noxious weed treatments are currently conducted with crews from the Forest Service, County, Private Contractors, and Idaho Backcountry Horseman. Monitoring and inventory of these weed populations would occur in conjunction with these treatments. Weed expansion in the analysis area is greatly influenced by habitat susceptibility, seed availability, seed or propagule dispersal, and habitat disturbance. The probability that weeds will expand in the project area depends on the interaction of these four factors. Weed expansion begins with the dispersal of seed from existing weed infestations adjacent to uninfested areas. Roads and trails are the primary means by which people and animals interact with the environment and therefore are an important spread vector. These linear corridors act as dispersal networks for exotic plants. The majority of documented infestations within the analysis area are along the transportation corridors. Disturbance creates spatial and temporal openings where sites become suitable for plant establishment, and where usable light, space, water, and nutrients are available to meet the specific growing requirements of the plant. Disturbance may increase the susceptibility of an otherwise intact plant community to weed invasion by increasing the availability of a limited resource. Natural or human caused fires along with timber harvest and grazing are broad scale disturbances that influence the amount of available habitat for weed establishment. Weed expansion risk in the analysis area was determined by assessing the susceptibility of habitat type groups, the presence of weed infestations (seed source), the amount of recently burned or harvested areas (site disturbance), and the density of roads or trails (spread vectors). The southern portion of the analysis area in VRU 3 (Breaklands) is characterized by Douglas-fir and dry grand fir habitat types. These habitat types are highly susceptible to weed colonization. Cooler grand-fir and mixed conifer habitats which occur over the rest of the Breaklands and all of the Uplands tend to be moderate to low with regard to weed expansion risk. Areas at risk to expanding weed populations were calculated using GIS data and the following results were given for the Clear Creek Analysis Area. Expansion Risk Probability: High—2,878 acres/7% Moderate—35,784 acres/81% Low to closed—5,160 acres/12% Approximately 12% of the project area habitat can be characterized as having a low or closed susceptibility to invasive plants. Moderately susceptibly habitats encompass about 81% of the project area, while highly susceptible habitats make up only 7%. Overall, the project areas can be characterized as having a mostly moderate to low susceptibility to invasive plants, with moderate areas making up the large majority.  Environmental Consequences 3.5.53.5.5.1 Direct and Indirect Effects  Alternative A 3.5.5.1.1Under this alternative, management practices and use of the project area will continue under current management, with no further actions proposed. The risk of noxious weed expansion will continue at current levels.  Alternatives B, C, D 3.5.5.1.2All of the action alternatives have the potential to spread weeds to some degree because of ground disturbing activities associated with Timber Harvest, Temporary Road Construction, and Prescribed Burning. The risk of noxious weed introduction is greater when the proposed project activities are within close proximity to existing infestations and a seed source. The level of expansion depends directly on how well design criteria are followed. Pioneering weeds such as thistles can be initially expected to occur in any burned areas with bare soil. Accurate data on exactly how fast each weed species would spread in response to ground disturbing actions is not available as weed models do not distinguish between differing categories of disturbance. It is estimated, however, that 1% to 10% of the activity acres would experience weed establishment following treatments. With rigorous application of design criteria and monitoring, the expansion would be closer to 1%. With poorly implemented design criteria, expansion would be closer to 10%. Of the action alternatives, Alternative C would result in the most disturbed acres (11,965) and the greatest potential for weed expansion. Alternative D at 10,788 acres would have the least potential to spread weeds, and Alternative B would be somewhere in between at 11,804 acres. The difference between the 3 action alternatives is minor when it comes to total acres of disturbance, therefore the relative risk of weed expansion in the proposed project area would be somewhat similar for all three. This is a relative ranking of alternatives based on total acres of disturbance. It is recognized that the actual treatment acres or actual amount of ground disturbing activity would likely be less than the gross acres displayed. Levels of herbicide application would be expected to increase initially under all action alternatives as existing weed populations are treated and design criteria for other activities are developed and implemented. Alternative C would carry the highest levels of potential herbicide application. Assuming weed management actions are effective, herbicide application levels would taper off over time. Complete eradication of all weeds would not be attainable under any alternative. Weeds such as spotted knapweed and Canada thistle would be contained and managed locally. 3.5.5.2 Cumulative Effects The no action alternative would continue some ground disturbing activities common to all Alternatives. Weeds would continue to invade and spread across the landscape. The cumulative effect of these activities combined with ongoing human and natural disturbances create the existing rate of weed spread. Additionally, the level of weed colonization currently observed would be expected under the No Action Alternative A. Activities proposed under the Action Alternatives B, C, and D, when combined with ongoing disturbances associated with livestock grazing, recreation use, and road maintenance have the potential to increase the rate of noxious weed spread more so than the No Action Alternative A. Past and present disturbances associated with vegetation treatments added to reasonably foreseeable actions would create a cumulative effect on weed expansion by the combination of distribution of weed seed, ground disturbance, and creation of spread vectors. The degree of the cumulative effect would vary depending upon the number of entrances over time, distribution of disturbance across the analysis area and acres disturbed. The impacts of cumulative effects incurred by the Action Alternatives B, C, and D to the risk of weed expansion would be eased with the implementation of the design criteria. With increased disturbance within and outside of the analysis area, opportunities for the spread of new invaders increase. As vehicles, equipment, animals, and humans move through the landscape, each has the potential to carry weed seed to new and currently uninfested areas. This spread really has no limit other than the susceptibility of receiving habitats. Though proposed activities from this project will increase overall weed risk for a short time, habitat readily available for weed invasion in the long term should decline due to overall trends in habitat management, increase in landscape restoration, advancement of succession and progressive weed management. Effects from past actions are represented within the existing condition. Reasonably foreseeable activities include: • Proposed Clear Ridge Nonsystem Road Decommissioning and Reconstruction (2014 & beyond) • Proposed Browns Spring Culvert Replacements and Road Decommissioning & Reconstruction (2013/2014) • Proposed Eastside Grazing Allotment (2014/2015) 3.6 RARE PLANTS  Analysis Area 3.6.1The analysis area for this assessment includes only the 43,731 acres of NFS lands, all of which lie within the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage.  Regulatory Framework 3.6.2Forest Plan direction and all Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to the management of rare plants on the Forest would be applied to the project, including the NFMA of 1976 and the Endangered Species Act. Threatened and endangered species are designated under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The four plants listed as threatened that occur in Idaho are Macfarlane’s four-o’clock (mirabilis macfarlanei), water howellia (Howellia aquatilis), Ute ladies’-tresses (Spiranthes diluvialis) and Spalding’s catchfly (Silene spaldingii). According to the USFWS, water howellia (Howellia aquatilis) and Ute ladies’-tresses orchid and their habitat are not found on the Nez Perce National Forest and will not be further addressed. The project area does not contain landscape characteristics, plant community composition, or community structure that would suggest suitable habitat for Spalding’s catchfly or Macfarlane’s four-o’clock, based on current knowledge of existing habitat for these species. According to the latest USFWS Species List Update 09/17/2012, no federally listed plant species or proposed critical habitat occurs on the Moose Creek Ranger District, therefore these species will not be considered further. Slickspot peppergrass (Lepidium papilliferum) has been recently listed as Proposed for Idaho, but this southern Idaho Species does not occur on the Nez Perce National Forest. Sensitive species are those plant and animal species identified by the Regional Forester for which population viability is a concern, as evidenced by substantial current or predicted downward trends in population numbers, density, or habitat capability that reduce a species existing distribution. Management direction for sensitive species is to ensure that species do not become threatened or endangered because of Forest Service actions and to maintain viable populations of all native species. The most recent update to the sensitive species list was published on September 17, 2012. The Forest Service must evaluate impacts to sensitive species through a biological evaluation. All 30 sensitive plant species have been evaluated as to their presence, presence of their habitat, and whether the species or habitat may be potentially affected.  Analysis Methodology 3.6.3Species information is based upon existing information, Idaho Conservation Data Center (CDC) data, GIS modeling of habitat parameters, photo interpretation, and field surveys. Individual species requirements were reviewed and appropriate modeling criteria selected to determine which species or corresponding habitat would be expected to occur in the project area. A participating agreement between the Forest Service and the Idaho Natural Heritage Program resulted in rare plant surveys being conducted in the Clear Creek drainage during the summer of 2012. Botanists surveyed for rare plants and targeted coastal disjunct species. No Federally Proposed, Threatened, or Endangered Plant Species, or potential habitats were found during the surveys; therefore they will not be discussed further in this analysis. There would be no effects to these species from project activities. An Interim Report was published on September 28, 2012 (see project record). A site visit and plant survey was conducted in August, 2012 by a Forest Service Botanist. The field survey was a spot check of various habitats and proposed “focus areas” that are being considered for treatments within the Clear Creek Drainage. Understory plant species included: Ninebark (Physocarpus malvaceus), ocean spray (Holodiscus discolor), wild ginger (Asarum caudatum), sitka alder (Alnus sinuate), western goldenthread (Coptis occidentalis), pearly everlasting (Anaphalis margaritaceae), common yarrow (Achillea millefolium), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), queen cup beadlilly (Clintonia uniflora), Montana golden pea (Thermopsis montana), common snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), mountain maple (Acer glabrum), grouse whortleberry (Vaccinium caespitosum), prince’s pine (Chimaphila umbellate), beargrass (Xerophyllum tenax), western wintergreen (Gaultheria humifusa), fools huckleberry (Menziesia ferruginea), and mountain ash (Sorbus scopulina).  Resource Indicators 3.6.4Vegetation management, temporary road construction or restoration activities could directly affect some plant species. Indirect effects may include the expansion of weeds and the mitigating treatments of these infestations or changes to the forest canopy that may affect light and temperature regimes. Cumulative effects are the overall effects to species from past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects. Historically such effects on individual species was not measured or noted. However, the past effects on general habitat condition can be qualified and matched to species dependent on a particular habitat. For this reason, local landtype classifications as described in the Vegetation section in Chapter 3 of the EIS (3.6.5.2 Ecological Settings and Vegetation Response Units) are used for the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects discussions. The primary settings within the analysis area are Idaho Batholith Breaklands, Idaho Batholith Uplands, and Idaho Batholith Subalpine. Since there are only 160 acres of Idaho Batholith Subalpine in the analysis area and none are proposed for treatment, the analysis will focus only on the Breaklands and Uplands settings. The effect on potentially suitable habitat is the primary indicator used in the analysis.  Affected Environment 3.6.5Habitat within the Clear Creek project area vary from the moist uplands with stands dominated by mixed occurrences of grand fir (Abies Grandis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), western larch (Larix occidentalis), Englemann spruce (Piceea engelmannii), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), to the coastal disjunct habitats dominated by Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) with grand fir and Douglas-fir, to the dryer ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir along the lower elevation breaklands. Ninety percent plus of the analysis area is currently in a closed canopy condition of various age classes of 40-plus years of age. Structural stages differ by the respective Vegetation Response Units (VRUs) but in general the Breaklands and Uplands trend low in the 0–40 age class and are overabundant in the 41–100 year age class. Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas (RHCAs) designated as PACFISH buffers constitute approximately 24% of the analysis area and approximately 15% of the analysis is verified old growth (11%).(Also see EIS Vegetation sections 3.6.5.1 and 3.6.5.2). 3.6.5.1 Sensitive Species Habitat does exist for 10 Sensitive Plant Species found on the Nez Perce National Forest, however only five of these sensitive species; Pacific dogwood (Cornus nuttallii), clustered ladyslipper (Cypripedium fasciculatum), light hookeria (Hookeria lucens), naked-stem (rhizomnium nudum), and evergreen kittentail (Synthyris platycarpa), are known to exist in the analysis area. During a survey of the site, no Forest Sensitive Plant species were found growing in any of the proposed “Focus Areas,” or areas proposed for treatment. Most of the known Sensitive Plant Species growing in the Clear Creek drainage are located in the upper reaches, where no treatments are planned, and along riparian areas of the watershed where habitat would be protected by implementation of PACFISH Riparian Habitat Conservation buffers. According to records from the Idaho Conservation Data Center (ICDC) and field surveys (2012), potential habitat exists in the project area for 10 sensitive plant species. One of those species, evergreen kittentail was found to be much more abundant that previously thought, with estimates of over 1,000 individuals. Table 3-14 lists those plant species or their habitats that are present or potentially occur within the Clear Creek project. Sensitive species not included in the Table 3-14 are not known or suspected to occur in the project area, nor is suitable habitat present based upon existing information or habitat modeling. These species are accounted for in the Biological Evaluation. There are no occurrences or suitable habitat for Threatened or Endangered plant species in the project area. Table 3-14.

Indirectly changes in stand structure would be expected through time, some of which would alter suitable habitats for some sensitive plant species. In mixed-conifer forest types, especially with grand fir and Douglas-fir, root disease and insects would continue increased tree mortality as the stands age and potentially create a higher degree of fire risk to the stands. In general, species requiring late successional forests would see an improvement in habitat quality, while those requiring conditions that are more open would decline barring the absence of substantial fire or other forest disturbance agents such as severe wind or insect and disease epidemics. The increased severity of wildfire is possible due to the increased fuel build up in these areas from increasing insect and disease mortality.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.6.6.1.2No Forest Service Sensitive species were found during spot checks within proposed treatment areas. Of the sensitive species known to be present within the Clear Creek project area, only one, Evergreen kittentail was determined to be potentially affected. It was determined that the action alternatives may impact individuals but not likely to cause trend toward federal listing or reduced viability for the population or species because large numbers were found to be present within the Clear Creek drainage making it much more common than previously thought. Some of these plants occur on old road beds and the possibility exists that during proposed project activities, isolated individuals could be potentially affected by road reconstruction or culvert replacement (See botanical biological evaluation, available in Project Record). The variable retention regeneration harvest is the primary harvest treatment that will appreciably change habitats from a primarily closed crown condition to openings with vertical retention of individual and clumps of leave trees. This harvest method will alter light and temperature regimes that will favor more early successional, shade intolerant plant and tree species and incur the most mechanical ground disturbance from harvest operations. The implementation of the Shelterwood harvest system, including commercial thinning and improvement cuts, has potential for moderate mechanical ground disturbance and increasing light and temperature dynamics but the overall habitat conditions likely would not change enough to affect most later successional, shade tolerant plant species. The prescribed fire in the western portion of the project area is located primarily in the breaklands with the objective of reducing ground and ladder fuels with a low-mixed severity fire and similarly will not likely change light and temperature dynamics substantially enough post burn to alter the existing potential plant habitat and existing species representation. Habitats preferred by late successional, closed canopy dependent species are generally associated with Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas (RHCAs) which are excluded from harvest under PACFISH guidelines. Additionally, all alternatives exclude harvest of verified old growth. Idaho Batholith Breaklands comprise 33% of the analysis area (14,420 acres) and Idaho Batholith Uplands comprise 65% of the analysis area (28,225 acres). Variable retention regeneration harvest will appreciably alter the habitat for later successional and shade tolerant sensitive plant species by approximately 6% under Alternative B, 10% under Alternative C, and 5% under Alternative D within the analysis area as a whole. Under all action alternatives approximately 66% of the variable retention regeneration harvest acres will occur within the Idaho Batholith Upland classification and 34% of the acres within the Idaho Batholith Breaklands classification; 45% are in the 41–100 (years) age class and 30% are within the 101–149 (years) age class. Approximately three-quarters of the regeneration harvest occur in the grand fir/Douglas fir cover type (EIS, Vegetation, 3.6.6.2.1). Potential habitat for ten sensitive plant species could be affected by the proposed variable retention regeneration harvest. Impacts range from detrimental to beneficial depending upon individual species biology and response. Due to the lack of known occurrences, low levels of potential habitat negatively affected, the relative abundance of the respective habitats remaining post-harvest, and the design criteria listed below, there are no threats to the viability of any sensitive plant species. The following project design criteria would limit negative effects to sensitive and rare plant species: • No harvest will occur within PACFISH buffers (24% of the analysis area) • No harvest will occur within verified old growth • Pre-sale personnel will report any occurrences or suspected occurrences of sensitive plant species to the Zone Botanist to evaluate the need for mitigation measures. Road decommissioning and reconstruction would maintain current conditions for rare and sensitive plants. Generally, old roads that are candidates for decommissioning do not provide habitat for these species. Temporary roads are a direct disturbance to suitable habitats. Temporary road segments were sorted by potential habitats for sensitive plant species, and it is assumed that for each mile of road constructed approximately 2.5 acres of habitat would be reduced over the short term. A total of 69 acres of habitat could be affected under Alternatives B and C and 22 acres could be affected under Alternative D. Sites for proposed soil restoration or stabilization generally are not considered suitable habitat, thus are not considered when determining the effects of this project. Several watershed improvements are proposed where roads currently cross streams. These riparian areas provide habitat for several sensitive plant species. There is a possibility for negative mechanical effects to species in the immediate vicinity of the road. However, such effects would be anticipated to be rare and negligible because the work would be almost entirely limited to the road crossing itself with little or no impact to the adjacent grounds.  Sensitive Plant Effects Determinations 3.6.6.1.3Determination of effects on sensitive plant species by management activities are summarized below by alternative. Only plant species that have potential habitat in the project area are included in Table 3-15. Table 3-15.

The forest plan supports this direction but does not set specific standards and guides for sensitive plants. The alternatives are consistent with this direction to the extent that proposed management actions would not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive plant populations. 3.6.6.2 Cumulative Effects Discussion of cumulative effects for rare plants is addressed through the general trend of the suitable habitat required by these species as a result of past, present and future management actions.  Geographic Boundary 3.6.6.2.1The cumulative effects boundary includes all lands within the proposed treatment area and the roads used for access. The rationale for this is that the effects are site specific to treatment areas and would not extend beyond the boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area would likewise not affect the resource within.  Time Frame 3.6.6.2.2It is not possible to quantify effects of specific activities that are several years or decades old. The status and occurrence of sensitive and rare plants was completely unknown for much of the management history of the watershed. The historic changes in condition and abundance of specific habitats are also largely unknown. Therefore, the effects of these past projects can only be qualified through general discussions.  Past, Present and Foreseeable Future Actions 3.6.6.2.3Past and present timber harvest, grazing, road construction, exotic plant treatment, wildfire suppression, and prescribed fire have influenced rare plants in the project area. Timber harvest began in the 1960s and averaged approximately 3,900 acres per decade up until 2000 through 2009 when only 1,400 acres were harvested. In addition, advancement in harvest operations, logging technology, best management practices, including retention of PACFISH buffers has significantly reduced timber harvest resource impacts. Regeneration timber harvest has occurred on approximately 22% of the project area with an associated 190 miles of roads. No-harvest buffers appear to have been retained since the 1960s on all but about 8% of the units. On the majority of the units (92%), buffers were a minimum of 50 feet wide. A total of 440 acres of regeneration harvest have occurred in the project area since PACFISH was implemented and appropriate-sized buffers were retained. All of the past regeneration harvests have been regenerated and most (>70%) have reached a crown closure condition. Roads within the project area constructed to support past timber sales are generally well located on the upper third of slopes or on ridge tops. 77% of these roads are graveled to reduce sediment. There are no reasonably foreseeable future timber sales identified within the analysis area. Past timber harvest and associated road construction are considered part of the existing condition. Road decommissioning started in the 1990s and has increased since, including a recent 2011 decision to decommission 85 miles of system and non-system roads within the watershed. The decommissioning includes 3.5 miles of roads in RHCAs and at least 11 stream crossing removals. Thus far approximately 60 miles have been decommissioned and the rest will occur in 2014 prior to on the ground implementation of this decision. The existing condition includes all past road building, fish passage culvert replacement, and decommissioning activities through 2012. The activities considered for cumulative effects are proposed project road decommissioning and road reconstruction activities in combination with the Brown Spring Creek Culvert Replacement Project (2013/2014), the proposed Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project (2014 and beyond), and 2 culvert replacements on county roads in lower Clear Creek that occurred in 2011.These activities will require NEPA decisions and Rare and TES plant species will be evaluated at the project scale at that time. Grazing is occurring in the project area however it is relatively small in scale and consists primarily of transitional range and there are currently no issues in regard to riparian impacts associated with grazing. There is very little if any effect from livestock grazing within the late successional, closed canopy habitats because of access and lack of desirable forage. There are two grazing allotments within the project area, Corral Hill and Tahoe/Clear Creek. Each allotment is authorized 110 cow/calf pairs, with 843 Animal Unit Months (AUMs) for Corral Hill and 583 AUM’s assigned to Tahoe/Clear Creek. An Adaptive Management Environmental Impact Statement is currently being developed for these two allotments as part of a larger landscape assessment of grazing that includes 15 grazing allotments covering 350,000 acres. A decision is expected in 2014 or 2015. Past and current grazing impacts are considered as part of the existing condition. Wildfire is aggressively suppressed as 94% of the project area is within the Wildland Urban Interface. The largest wildfires burned 27,245 acres between 1870 and the 1931 fire, which burned approximately 11,000 acres, primarily within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Only 155 acres have burned since then because of the emphasis on fire suppression. All fires are aggressively suppressed within the project area, therefore fire suppression effects have been minor as most are extinguished at less than 0.25 acres. All past wild and prescribed fire effects are considered as part of the existing condition. Other than the prescribed fire associated with this analysis, there are no reasonably foreseeable management prescribed fire planned for the future. Noxious weed spraying in the project area has been primarily associated with open roads as they represent the highest weed susceptibility in the project area. Noxious weed control or containment has primarily occurred during the past two decades and has generally consisted of spot spraying targeting specific noxious weeds including the common weeds of thistle, hounds tongue, and knapweed. Noxious weed management will continue into the future focusing on high susceptibility areas under current Forest direction. Past noxious weed treatment are considered part of the existing condition. Some activities such as trail maintenance, road maintenance, recreation site maintenance, access management, and others are considered routine and ongoing and collectively would have negligible impacts on species or habitats of concern. Most potential habitat for sensitive species occurs in the moister forests in the uplands and riparian areas. Moonworts, green bug-on-a-stick, clustered lady’s slipper, naked-stem rhizomnium, light hookeria, and evergreen kittentail could potentially occur in these habitats. Moderately moist, cool habitats comprise 66% of the project area and are characterized by moderately cool temperatures and a variety of moisture regimes. There would be little to no cumulative effects to these species and the overall habitat trend would be static. Bug-on-a-stick occurs on open ground in a variety of habitats, many of which could be affected by management. However, the preferred open conditions would generally preclude disturbance activities such as timber harvest. The warmer Grand Fir habitats comprise 33% of the project area, primarily in the lower, warmer elevations associated with the mid-reaches of Clear Creek. Much of this zone has seen substantial management activity in the past. Mid-seral forest structure is increased due to even-aged management. Road densities are relatively high in portions of the zone. These disturbances have declined dramatically in recent years and road density has been decreased.  Alternative A—No Action 3.6.6.2.4Alternative A would produce no additional effects on potential rare plant habitat as compared to past activity levels. The progression of forest succession would improve habitat for most sensitive plant species. However, the decline of successional tree species due to insect-caused mortality may cause localized openings and increases in light and fuel loads, which could lead to more intense wildfires and damage to rare plants.  Alternatives B, C, D 3.6.6.2.5Approximately 35% of the project area has been affected by timber harvest activities in the past sixty years. Proposed Activities under the action alternatives would temporally affect between 5% and 10% of the potential habitat for several sensitive plant species. Alternatives B, C, or D adds short-term disturbance associated with variable retention regeneration harvest and temporary road construction to approximately 5%–10% of the landscape which has not previously been harvested. 14% to 17% of the acres proposed under the action alternatives includes commercial and pre-commercial thinning and occurs on previously harvested acres with the objective of improving growth with stocking control. The commercially thinned acres will continue to provide potential habitat for sensitive plant species requiring partial to full shading now and into the future. Retention of PACFISH buffers and all verified old growth will continue to provide critical potential habitat for sensitive plant species. The concept of designing larger patch sizes, both young and old, across the landscape under all of the action alternatives will reduce habitat fragmentation into the future and improve habitat conditions for sensitive plant species by connecting older forest with riparian areas to create larger, connected patches of older forest preferable to many sensitive species. Openings created by the variable retention regeneration harvest under all action alternatives, while detrimental to some sensitive plant species habitat requirements could be beneficial to others with early seral habitat requirements. The proposed activities under the action alternatives along with ongoing and reasonably foreseeable future management activities would result in a slight decrease in potentially suitable sensitive plant habitat. Long-term trends would be static to slightly downward. A slight downward trend in habitat quality would not lead to concerns for population viability since these habitats are common across the project area. 3.6.6.3 Irreversible or Irretrievable Effects None of the alternatives would implement actions or activities that would result in an irreversible commitment of resources as related to sensitive plants. 3.7 ROADLESS AREAS The purpose of this analysis of the Idaho Roadless Areas and unroaded resource is to disclose the project’s potential effects to roadless and wilderness attributes and determine whether it might affect future consideration for wilderness recommendations. This analysis focuses on the potential effects of project activities on wilderness characteristics as defined in the FSH 1909.12 (72.1). The analysis for the effects on other roadless resource attributes such as water resources, soils, and wildlife habitat can be found in other sections of this EIS. The 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule (36 CFR 294, subpart C) integrated local management concerns and the need to protect these areas in concert with the national objectives for protecting roadless area values and characteristics. The final Idaho Roadless Area rule designated 250 Idaho Roadless Areas and established 5 management themes: Wild Land Recreation, Special Areas of Historical and Tribal Significance, Primitive, Backcountry Restoration, and General Forest, Rangeland, Grassland. Allocation of an area to a specific theme does not mandate or direct the Forest Service to propose or implement any action in that area; however, management theme designations do determine permitted and prohibited activities. Certain activities, such as road building, mineral development, and timber cutting, are permitted in some themes and prohibited in others; other activities, such as motorized travel, grazing, and motorized and mechanized use, are not changed by this rule. Nez Perce National Forest Plan management direction states that roadless areas will not be managed for wilderness. The term “roadless area” refers to an area of at least 5,000 acres that does not have developed and maintained roads and is substantially natural in condition. A roadless area is specifically defined as an area that meets the minimum criteria for wilderness. Unroaded lands have natural characteristics similar to those of roadless areas but occupy less acreage. Wilderness characteristics include natural integrity, undeveloped characteristics, outstanding opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation, special features and values, and manageability. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the environmental consequences of the proposed alternatives on the wilderness characteristics of the Clear Creek Roadless Area.  Analysis Area 3.7.1The analysis area is the 9,200-acre Clear Creek Roadless Area. The Clear Creek Roadless Area is designated as a backcountry restoration theme under the 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule. The Clear Creek Roadless Area is located at the head of Clear Creek along the western boundary of the Nez Perce National Forest. Private property adjoins this area on the northwestern boundary. The nearest roads are spurs of Road 1842 on the north, Road 650 on the west, and Road 286 on the east, but some of these roads are closed during the general hunting season to mitigate impacts on big game. Elevation ranges from 2,000 feet on Clear Creek at the forest boundary to 4,600 feet at China Point Ridge and the headwaters of Solo and Kay creeks. Topography is mountainous with steep slopes (commonly over 70%) paralleling the drainages. Ridgetops are relatively flat. The Clear Creek drainage has been a significant part of the Nez Perce Forest timber sale program since the late 1950s. Most of the acreage remaining in the Clear Creek Roadless Area has burned twice, once in 1870 and again in 1931, leaving about 7,000 acres covered with brushfields in the South Fork and Middle Fork drainages of Clear Creek. Previous conifer forests have never reestablished themselves. Vegetation in the area ranges from very moist, warm cedar habitat types to drier, warm Douglas-fir habitat types. Shrub coverage in the brushfields is primarily maple, willow, serviceberry, and various other shrubs. Bordering the brushfields are patches of young (approximately 70-year-old) timber, a mix of grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar. Understories are sparse but contain a variety of moist-site plants. Some natural meadows exist in upper Kay Creek in Section 28. The brushfields have been important big game (elk and moose) winter range, but the preferred browse species—redstem, willow, mountain maple, and serviceberry— have in recent years grown out of reach of the animals. Prescribed fire has been used in an attempt to increase the value of the range. Current uses of the area include livestock grazing, big game winter and summer range, fishing, hunting, and mining.  Resource Indicators 3.7.2Issue: A commenter expressed concern that the impacts on the Roadless Area must be evaluated in relation to its designation as proposed Wilderness in the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. Indicator: Wilderness values, impacts of the project on future wilderness designations The following resource indicators were used to compare the effect of the alternatives: • Natural Integrity—The extent to which long-term ecological processes are intact and operating • Undeveloped characteristics—The degree to which developments and uses are apparent to most visitors • Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation—Solitude is a personal, subjective value defined as the isolation from sights, sounds, and presence of others and from developments and evidence of humans. Primitive recreation is characterized by meeting nature on its terms, without the comfort and convenience of facilities. • Special features and values—Unique ecological, geographical, scenic, and historical features of an area • Manageability—The ability to manage an area for wilderness consideration and maintain wilderness attributes  Affected Environment 3.7.33.7.3.1 Natural Integrity Past wildfires in the Clear Creek area and the resulting vegetative succession are some of the natural processes that have occurred. The landscape is prone to fire, and numerous natural ignitions occur every year. Fire management strategies for the area dictate full suppression, however, due to the Roadless Area’s proximity to private property and location within a Community Protection Zone. Opportunities for management of naturally occurring wildfire are limited. 3.7.3.2 Undeveloped Characteristics Past road building and timber harvest along the southern and eastern portions of the Roadless Area are readily apparent. The private property interface on the westernmost boundaries is highly segmented with numerous corners. The area has several grazing permits, and cows are a common occurrence. 3.7.3.3 Special Features and Values No special features or values have been identified for the Clear Creek Roadless Area. 3.7.3.4 Opportunities for Solitude and Primitive Unconfined Recreation This small area, with nearby logging activity, offers limited opportunity for solitude. Vegetative screening is high, however. The main opportunities here are bushwhacking and following game trails through dense brushfields. 3.7.3.5 Manageability This area has been reduced by at least 14,800 acres since 1979, almost entirely because of timber sales. The area boundary is imprecise except where it coincides with the forest boundary. The area boundary has been drawn to exclude existing roads from the remainder of the area.  Environmental Consequences 3.7.43.7.4.1 Direct and Indirect Effects  Alternative A 3.7.4.1.1No activities are proposed under Alternative A; therefore, under this alternative, the Clear Creek Roadless Area would remain in its current condition. No direct effects would occur to the wilderness characteristics of the area (i.e., the area’s natural integrity, undeveloped characteristics, opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation, or manageability). Continued fire suppression and lack of disturbance may indirectly cause the area to trend away from desired conditions and may affect the natural quality of the area over time. Shrubfields would continue to become decadent and would be unusable by wintering wildlife. Timber stands could become more susceptible to large-scale stand-replacing wildfire because mosaic conditions would not exist on the landscape.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.7.4.1.2Alternatives B, C, and D would implement low-mixed severity prescribed fire on approximately 1,400 acres within the Clear Creek Roadless Area over a period of several years. Other activities proposed in Alternatives B, C, and D fall outside the Roadless Area and do not infringe on potential wilderness values; therefore, they are not discussed in this analysis. Implementation of prescribed fire would likely be accomplished using aerial (helicopter) and hand ignitions. Extensive pumps, hoselays, and hand-constructed control lines would probably be needed to control the fire along the private property interface on the westernmost portion of the Roadless Area. Natural Integrity Implementation of the action alternatives would have a beneficial effect to the natural qualities of the area because disturbance would be sustained, although the mechanism of disturbance would be human caused and not natural. Where prescribed fire coincides with decadent shrubfields, species such as maple, willow, and serviceberry would be rejuvenated and become more available as browse for wintering wildlife. In timbered areas, the mixed-severity mosaic caused by burn would create patches of early successional forest that would ensure a balanced range of age classes distributed across the Clear Creek watershed. Undeveloped Characteristics Implementing Alternatives B, C, or D would cause little effect to the undeveloped characteristics of the Roadless Area. Low- to mixed-severity prescribed fire closely emulates the effects of wildfire under a wide range of climate and environmental conditions. Visitors would not likely be able to distinguish whether the fire was human caused or natural. A site-specific burn plan would be developed for the project and would document the desired effects and the environmental variables necessary for implementing the prescribed fire to meet objectives. Handline construction along the private property interface may temporarily alter the undeveloped characteristics of the Roadless Area, although property/boundary line location and establishment—including limbed trees and painted boundaries—has already altered this area. Fuels along the boundary are generally light and include open ponderosa pine, shrubs, and harvested private grounds. Handline construction (including limbing trees, removing brush, and light ground scalping in combination with pumps and hoselays to control the burn) is expected to be minimal. Rehabilitation of the handlines following implementation would further reduce the evidence of development, and no evidence is expected to be visible several years after rehabilitation. Special Features or Values Since no special features or values have been identified for the Clear Creek Roadless Area, implementing Alternatives B, C, or D would cause no effect to this category of wilderness characteristics. Opportunities for Solitude and Primitive Unconfined Recreation Opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation would be temporarily affected during implementation of the prescribed fire. Trails 130 and 728 would likely be temporarily closed to allow for safe implementation of the burn. During ignition, sights and sounds of helicopters would likely be heard throughout the Roadless Area, although these disturbances would be expected to last only a short time. Crews operating pumps, hoses, and chainsaws would have less effect on solitude and unconfined recreation, since their activities would be confined to a small area immediately adjacent to the private property boundary in the westernmost portion of the Roadless Area. After implementation, the opportunities for solitude and primitive unconfined recreation would remain unchanged from their current state. Manageability No effect to the manageability of the Roadless Area would result from implementation of Alternatives B, C, or D. None of the activities proposed in any of these alternatives would have an effect on the current or future location of the Roadless Area boundary. 3.7.4.2 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects boundary for this analysis is the Clear Creek Roadless Area. This boundary was selected because roadless areas are generally the pool from which future wilderness designations occur. The Clear Creek Roadless Area was proposed for wilderness designation in the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. A forward-looking timeline to measure cumulative effects is difficult to establish, as wilderness designations can be a lengthy political process. However, if the area were designated as Wilderness, it might reasonably be expected to receive higher than ordinary use, given its close proximity to towns and relative ease of access. As pointed out above, the Clear Creek Roadless Area has shrunk by almost 15,000 acres since 1979 as a result of timber sales. The current Roadless Area boundary is imprecise and drawn to exclude timber sale areas. With the exception of prescribed fire, none of the activities proposed in Alternatives B, C, or D would affect, alter, or infringe upon the current Roadless Area boundary or have an effect on the wilderness values inside the Roadless Area. Management of naturally occurring wildfire to benefit resources in this Roadless Area is not likely due to the area’s close proximity to private lands and managed timberlands. Fire suppression is likely to continue. The prescribed fire proposed within the Clear Creek Roadless Area would sustain disturbance in a disturbance-dependent landscape, resulting in a beneficial cumulative effect to the natural qualities of the area. Because the implementation of Alternatives B, C, or D will have no effect, limited temporary effects, or beneficial effects to the wilderness characteristics of the area, the project will not alter the area’s potential to be considered for future wilderness designation. 3.8 SOILS This report summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the soils resource. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Soils Report,” located in the project record.  Analysis Area 3.8.1The areas assessed for soils concerns are the individual treatment units (variable acres) and associated skid trails, landings, and temporary roads within the 43,700-acre project area.  Regulatory Framework 3.8.2Forest Plan direction and the following federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the management of soil resources would be applied to the project: • FSM 2500 Watershed and Air Management – Washington Office (WO) Amendments 2500-2010-1 and 2500-2010-2 and Northern Region (R1) Supplement 2500-14-1 (Regional Soil Quality Standards) • Soil and Water Conservation Practices (SWCPs) Handbook - FSH 2509.22 • Idaho Forest Practices Act (1974) • National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(i) • 36 CFR 219.20 3.8.2.1 Nez Perce Forest Plan  Forest Plan Amendment 3.8.2.1.1The Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a) determined that for any project, soil productivity will have been maintained and any irreversible impacts to the soil resource will have been minimized (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-2, Goal 18). Forest Plan Soil Quality Standard #2 (II-22) would be amended for Alternatives B, C, and D (See Appendix C). This site-specific amendment for lands within the project area would replace the Forest Plan standard of 20% DSD with the more restrictive Region 1 Soil Quality Standards limiting detrimental disturbance to 15% (see below). The amendment would also allow the project to proceed with the treatment of 3 units that currently exceed the 20% Forest Plan standard with the concurrent implementation of soil improvement activities. Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (FSM 2500 Supplement 2500-14-1) specify: “Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect 15 percent or less of the activity area, a cumulative minimum of 85 percent of the activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddle upon completion of activities. Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15 percent of the activity area, the cumulative detrimental soil disturbance from project implementation and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a net improvement in soil quality.” The detrimental disturbance that was created in the three units over 20% occurred in 1964 and 1970. These activities occurred prior to the 1987 Nez Perce Forest Plan standards, which limit extent detrimental disturbance to 20%. Both the current Forest Plan standards and Regional soil quality guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. The amendment would better align Forest Plan standards with the Regional soil quality standards. The Regional standards are more restrictive—stipulating that detrimental disturbance stay below 15% as opposed to the 20% currently prescribed in the current Nez Perce Forest Plan. The proposed amendment would change the Forest Plan standards, and allow activities to occur and provide for concurrent soil restoration in detrimentally disturbed areas. Soil improvement activities would help the soil to recover at a faster rate; establishing healthier, more productive soils.  Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Law 3.8.2.1.2The Clear Creek project was designed to meet the standards set forth in the Idaho Forest Practices Act, FSM 2500—Watershed and Air Management and Northern Region (R1) Supplement 2500-99-1 (Regional Soil Quality Standards), and FSH of Soil and Water Conservation Practices (FSH 2509.22). The project complies with 36 CFR 219.20, which requires conservation and protection of soil and water resources and NFMA 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i), which states “Soil, slope or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.” Nez Perce Forest Plan standards listed on page II-22 of the Plan would also be met, including the Forest Plan amendment for the project (Table 3-16). Table 3-16.

Removal of vegetation and/or ground disturbance associated with timber harvest or fire can increase erosion on certain landtypes. Indicator: Acres of proposed skid trail/landings and miles of proposed temporary roads on landtypes with a high subsurface erosion hazard 3.8.3.2 Soil Productivity Past management activities in the project area have caused Detrimental Soil Disturbance (DSD) and decreased soil productivity. According to the Region 1 Soil Quality Standards, detrimental disturbance (e.g., compaction, displacement, erosion, loss of organic matter) from management activities should not exceed 15% of an Activity Area and coarse woody material retention should be appropriate to the habitat type. In areas that exceed 15% detrimental disturbance, the combined detrimental disturbance effects of the current project (implementation and restoration) should not exceed the disturbance levels present before the activity, and activities should be directed toward a net improvement in soil quality. Indicator: Number of commercial harvest units requiring specialized project design measures to meet Regional soil standards  Analysis Methodology 3.8.4Reports and maps generated by GIS, aerial photos, and field reviews were used to analyze effects to the soil resource from the project’s proposed activities. Field sampled vegetation database (FSVeg) queries were conducted to identify past harvest activities and their time frames (see project file). All proposed harvest units were examined in the field to assess past management impacts and to evaluate potential effects to soils. Surveys following protocols outlined in the Region 1 Approach to Soils NEPA Analysis Regarding Detrimental Soil Disturbance in Forested Areas (USDA Forest Service 2009b) were conducted to determine the percentage of DSD in each of the proposed harvest units (Activity Areas). An erosion hazard assessment was used to summarize erosional characteristics based on landtype properties. This assessment described overall erosion hazards in the project area and at the unit scale to aid in the development of project design measures. Potential soil restoration opportunities throughout the project area were assessed, with a focus on old skid trails, landings, and roads. Project design features describe methods for minimizing impacts to the soil and techniques for restoring soil biophysical integrity. 3.8.4.1 Data Assumption and Limitations The methodology outlined in the Region 1 Approach to Soils NEPA Analysis Regarding Detrimental Soil Disturbance in Forested Areas (USDA Forest Service 2009b) provides a conservative assessment of existing soil conditions (Page-Dumroese et al. 2006a), given its inherent assumptions (ocular data and soil pits). Informal comparisons found that both for single observers and between observers, category calls in this methodology have a variability of 5%. This level of survey leads to a 90%–95% confidence with error bars from 5% to 8%, depending on the amount of disturbance found. The surveys achieve statistical inference for units with either low disturbance (<7%) or moderately high disturbance (>23%) (Page-Dumroese et al. 2009). Field soil survey methodology based on visual observations can produce variable results among observers, and the confidence of results is dependent on the number of observations made in an area (Page-Dumroese et al. 2006a). The existing and estimated values for DSD are not absolute and are best used to describe the existing soil condition. The calculation of the percentage of additional DSD from a given activity is an estimate, since DSD is a combination of such factors as existing ground cover, soil texture, timing of operations, equipment used, skill of the equipment operator, the amount of wood to be removed, and sale administration. The DSD estimates for proposed project activities are mostly based on local monitoring and research results (Archer 2008; Reeves et al. 2011). The DSD estimates of proposed activities also assume that BMPs would be implemented and that soil recovery occurs over time. 3.8.4.2 Scientific Uncertainty and Controversy Site and soil productivity relies on complex chemical, physical, and climatic factors that interact within a biological framework. For any given site and soil, a change in a key soil variable (e.g., bulk density, soil loss, and nutrient availability) can lead to changes in potential soil productivity. Defining the threshold at which productivity is detrimentally disturbed is controversial. The rationale for the 15% limit of change in soil bulk density was largely based on the collective judgment of soil researchers, academics, and field practitioners, and the accepted inability to detect changes in productivity less than 15% using current monitoring methods (Powers 1990). Powers (1990) states that the soil quality guidelines are set to detect a decline in potential productivity of at least 15%. This statement does not mean that the Forest Service tolerates productivity declines at this level, but that it recognizes problems with detection limits. Soil quality standards are being studied by a cooperative research project called the North American Long-Term Soil Productivity Study (LTSP). The 5- and 10-year results were recently published (Page-Dumroese et al. 2006b; Fleming et al. 2006; Sanchez et al. 2006). The LTSP study is ongoing and provides the best available science to resource professionals. In a 10-year study, no observed reduction in tree growth occurred as a result of compaction or organic matter removal in plots with soils generally similar to those found in the project area (silt loam) (Powers et al. 2005). These results are relatively short-term and involve many site- and soil-specific factors. Future results from the ongoing study should be helpful for assessing harvest practices on soil productivity. Additional controversy surrounds the use of the term “irreversible” in the NFMA. The NFMA has guidelines that “insure that timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.” The DSD described in this analysis does not necessarily result in substantial and permanent impairment. DSD is reversible if the processes (organic matter accumulation, moisture, topsoil retention, and soil biota) are in place and if time is allowed for recovery. Irreversible damage to soils in the project area could result from the loss of the volcanic ash cap through erosion or removal by excavation for temporary roads and/or skid trails. Soil recovery could still occur in remaining subsurface soils, yet the exceptionally high porosity and water-holding properties of the Mazama ash cap would likely be irrecoverable.  Affected Environment 3.8.53.8.5.1 Landforms and Geology Soil characteristics in the project area vary according to slope gradient, slope aspect, parent material, texture, depth, vegetative cover, and microclimate. Landforms in the project area are mostly dissected mountain breaklands (58%) and low- and moderate-relief rolling uplands (33%). The geologic substrate is primarily Belt Zone and Border Zone metamorphics (45%), followed by Idaho Batholith Border Zone granitics (35%) and Columbia River basalt (15%). Soil parent material is primarily granitic (85%), with inclusions of basalt (8%) and sedimentary rock (3%). Surface soils are generally silty or sandy loams. The coarse fragment content in the soils is very low, generally between 5% and 10%, increasing the susceptibility of the soil to compaction and rutting from ground-based machine harvesting. More than half of the ground cover is litter; approximately 35% of the units have vegetative cover, and only 2% have bare soil. Much of the area is overlain by a mixed to intact layer of Mazama volcanic ash, ranging from 7 to 20 inches in thickness. The ash cap is thin or missing in the steeper breaklands. Ash material is physically highly favorable to root growth, being very permeable and possessing a high ability to hold moisture and nutrients. Its presence as an intact layer with little mixing is an indication of relatively stable slopes over the past 6,700 years since the ash deposition. 3.8.5.2 Landslide and Erosion Hazard Potential Landtypes are ecological land units categorized by similarities in soils, landforms, geologic substrate, geomorphic processes, and plant associations (Cleland et al. 1997). These land units have been mapped for the entire Nez Perce National Forest. Landtypes were identified for the project area to help focus field evaluations and to pinpoint any erosion hazard concerns. Landslides are the dominant natural erosion process in the project area. Landslide-prone (LSP) areas mapped on the Nez Perce National Forest are located on slopes over 60% and landtypes 50EUU and 50CUU. Areas considered highly prone to landslides comprise approximately 11% of the project area. 3.8.5.3 Soil Productivity Soils in the project area are generally silt loams, formed from loess and overlain with a moderately deep volcanic ash layer. Past natural and management activities have impacted the productivity of these soils. During the summer of 2012, field surveys were conducted on each of the proposed harvest and burn units to assess the extent of compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic matter, and soil mass movements. Existing detrimental soil conditions within the units range from 0% to 22% (see project file). Soil disturbances found during the surveys included old benched roads, skid trails, dozer piling, soil displacement, rutting, and compaction. Three units exceed the 20% Forest Plan Standard; therefore, a Forest Plan amendment is needed to proceed with project activities, including concurrent soil restoration, so the units will be trending positive. The project area also includes 19 units that are currently over the 15% Regional Soil Quality Standard. Although not specifically addressed by a Forest Plan standard, the presence of aboveground organic matter or woody material is an important component of soil health. The retention of coarse (>3 inches in diameter) woody material is essential to maintaining soil productivity (Graham et al. 1994). Regional direction (Forest Service Manual) for organic material recommends following guidelines such as those contained in Graham et al. (1994) if more-specific local guidelines have not been developed. Graham et al. (1994) recommend 7–33 tons/acre of coarse woody material (depending on habitat type, moisture regime, and aspect). This amount should provide sufficient nutrients and organic material for soil productivity in the long term (100–300 years). Retaining existing coarse wood levels and allowing for recruitment through the natural addition of snags and/or standing trees would facilitate these benefits. Existing down woody material ranged between 0 and 43 tons/acre in units proposed for project activities, with an average of 11 tons/acre (visual observation). Litter and duff layers throughout the project area average 6 centimeters in depth.  Environmental Consequences 3.8.6The spatial scope for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects is the individual commercial units (variable acres) and associated temporary roads. The temporal scope for direct and indirect effects is several decades (30–50 years), covering both pre- and post-project activities. The only activities analyzed in detail are commercial harvest units and associated temporary road construction and prescribed burning. 3.8.6.1 Activities Not Analyzed in Detail Precommercial thinning: The project includes 1,793 acres of proposed precommercial thinning activities. Because precommercial thinning only utilizes hand tools and no ground-based mechanized equipment, this activity would not increase DSD in the project area. Precommercial thinning units were not surveyed. Road Reconditioning and Reconstruction: Forest system roads are not considered in the determination of potential DSD (FSH 2509.18). Approximately 170 miles of road reconditioning and reconstruction is proposed under Alternatives B, C, and D and would improve road drainage and reduce the risk of mass erosion. Road Decommissioning: Forest system roads are not considered in the determination of potential DSD (FSH 2509.18). Approximately 13.8 miles (55 acres) of road would be decommissioned. Road decommissioning would directly improve soil conditions by decompacting soils and adding coarse woody material and other organic matter to the existing road surface. Road decommissioning would also improve slope stability and reduce the potential risk of mass erosion from culvert failure. Decommissioned roads are considered as returned to the productive land base through removal from the transportation system. Soil structure, water infiltration, aeration, root penetrability, and soil biological activity improvements are observed with road decommissioning techniques used on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests (Lloyd et al. 2013). Monitoring has shown decommissioning and storage treatments to be effective at reducing surface erosion and mass failure risk and increasing vegetative ground cover (Foltz et al. 2007, Lloyd et al. 2013). Under Alternative A, no road decommissioning activities would occur. Soils in these areas would remain in an unproductive condition. Restoration: Approximately 41 acres of grassland restoration is proposed. This grassland area will undergo prescribed burning and will be revegetated with native grasses and forbs. No erosion or DSD is expected. 3.8.6.2 Activities Analyzed in Detail Commercial harvest and associated temporary road construction and prescribed burning are analyzed in detail, as these activities can contribute to detrimental disturbance calculations, cause erosion, and affect soil productivity. Commercial Harvest: Alternative B proposes 8,550 acres of commercial harvest within 143 units. Alternative C proposes 8,700 acres in 145 units, and Alternative D proposes 7,530 acres in 130 units. Harvest treatments include regeneration, improvement, and commercial thinning. Both skyline yarding and ground-based skidding systems would be used to remove trees. Activity-generated slash piled along roadsides and in landings would be dispatched via sale of biomass materials, chipping, or burning. Slash within the units would be left in place or treated using prescribed burning, mastication, or machine piling and burning. Temporary Road Construction: In Alternatives B and C, approximately 36 miles of temporary roads would be constructed. Of these miles, 8.7 miles would be located on existing road templates. Alternative D proposes 18 miles of temporary roads, of which 8.7 miles already exist. Disturbed width for temporary roads would average 25 feet. Temporary roads would be located on low-gradient, dry ridges or upper slopes and away from water; these roads would have no stream crossings. Temporary roads are considered 100% detrimental disturbance with reduced soil productivity until vegetation, organic matter, and hydrologic function are restored. The greater disturbance associated with temporary road construction is the displacement or mixing of the topsoil, including the Mazama ash cap, during road excavation. Temporary roads would be constructed, used, and decommissioned within 1-2 years. Road decommissioning following use would promote restoration of soil structure, water infiltration, aeration, root penetrability, and soil biological activity, as observed with road decommissioning techniques used on the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests. These techniques would support recovery of productivity on soils disturbed by temporary roads. Prescribed Burning: Low- and mixed-severity prescribed fire is proposed on 1,370 acres in 15 units for all action alternatives. Within the proposed units, approximately 465 acres are mapped as LSP and/or susceptible to mass wasting. A design feature of no ignition in these areas (following PACFISH guidelines) would be implemented. Fire would be allowed to back into these areas. 3.8.6.3 Direct and Indirect Effects The analysis area for direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the individual treatment units (variable acres) and associated skid trails, landings, and temporary roads within the 43,700-acre project area.  Alternative A—No Action 3.8.6.3.1This alternative maintains the existing condition. Alternative A would not alter the current soil erosion or landslide potential and would retain the same amount of coarse woody material, both standing and down. Existing DSD would persist with very slight natural recovery of surface layers of compacted soils. Over time, large woody debris from dead trees would fall on the ground, increasing organic matter and water-holding capacities on-site. In the absence of catastrophic fires, these trends would exist on most of the project units. Risk of large scale, stand replacing fire would increase over time; potentially causing hish soil burn severity and subsequent erosion. The timing, size, or intensity of such an event cannot be predicted. Under Alternative A, no road decommissioning activities would occur that would directly improve soil conditions by decompacting soils and adding coarse woody material and other organic matter to the existing road surface. Soils in these areas would remain in a less productive condition.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.8.6.3.2Landslide and Erosion Hazard Potential The project area has been mapped and divided into landtypes (areas featuring similar soils, hydrology, and vegetation characteristics). Soil erosion and mass wasting are natural processes, and many landtypes across the Forest have high inherent hazards of erosion, mass wasting, and landslides (NRCS 2006). These natural processes have occurred over long time periods and are fundamental factors in creating the present-day landscape. Landslide-prone (LSP) areas were identified using GIS analysis and verified in the field. For Alternative B, approximately 307 acres of LSP area are located within 22 units. Alternative C has 315 acres within 23 units, and Alternative D had 173 acres in 15 units. These LSP areas would be further delineated in the field during unit layout and would receive a PACFISH buffer. If additional landslide prone areas are identified, the area would be excluded from harvest and a PACFISH buffer would be added. No harvest activities would occur in these areas. Indicators of landslide prone areas include: steep (over 60%) concave slopes; hydrophytic vegetation (i.e. sedges, moist site ferns); slumps, draws, and basins; past landslide locations; and obvious soil movement areas (typically indicated by curved and/or buttressed tree boles, soil creep, tension cracks, etc.). An erosion hazard assessment based on landtype properties was used to determine erosional characteristics of the project units and temporary roads. This assessment was used to develop project design measures to minimize erosion potential. Mass wasting, surface erosion, and subsurface soil erosion potentials were evaluated for the landtypes coinciding within the proposed harvest and burn units. (See project file for detailed information on individual units.) Surface erosion was low to moderate for all harvest units. Only 16 acres were located on landtypes rated as high for mass wasting, and these acres were located within the same areas as the LSP areas and would be excluded from harvest activities.Under Alternatives B and C, ground-based logging would occur on approximately 3,080 acres located in areas with high subsurface erosion potential. Under Alternative D, ground-based logging would affect 2,950 acres located in areas with a similar high risk for subsurface erosion. Generally, logging in areas with high risk for subsurface erosion is problematic only if the surface soil is removed and the subsurface and parent material is exposed, such as excavated skid trails and landings. Based on past monitoring on the Clearwater Forest, an estimated average 10% of areas using ground-based logging systems are detrimentally disturbed. Using this assumption, approximately 300 acres would be utilized for skid trails and landings for all action alternatives on areas with high subsurface erosion potential. Landtype erosion hazards used to assess the effects of the alternatives on soil stability and erosion potentials indicate an overall increase of erosion potential for each of the action alternatives. Surface soil loss through displacement and mixing with infertile substrata has long-lasting consequences for soil productivity. This loss occurs during temporary road construction, excavation of skid trails and landings, and displacement of soils during ground-based harvest. Irreversible damage to soils could result from the loss of the volcanic ash cap. Although soil recovery could still occur in remaining subsurface soils, the exceptionally high porosity and water-holding properties of the Mazama ash cap would likely be irrecoverable. Even though the ash layer is not a significant source of soil nutrient content, loss of the ash layer reduces water-holding capacity and high-quality tree rooting material. Since volcanic ash is not easily replaced, these effects may be very long lasting. Skid trails and landings would be located and designated to minimize the area of soil disturbance. Design measures to reduce the potential for subsurface erosion include the following: limiting the amount of excavated skid trails and landings; fully decommissioning all excavated skid trails and landings on these landtypes; and placing large, woody material over the contoured slope for soil stabilization. For Alternatives B and C, approximately 30 miles of proposed temporary roads are located on landtypes with high subsurface erosion potential. Approximately 8.0 miles occur on already existing road templates. For Alternative D, 15 miles of temporary roads (7.5 miles existing) occur on high subsurface erosion landtypes. Location on these landtypes is often only problematic if the surface soil is removed and the subsurface material is exposed. The proposed temporary roads would be located on ridgetops and upper slopes, and only short, discontinuous portions would require some form of excavation. All temporary roads would be decommissioned after use, and large woody material (>3 inches in diameter) would be placed on the surface to aid in soil stability. An increased number of water bars or the addition of slash material to the road bed would be used as necessary to reduce erosion while the road is in use. Even if small segments in these roads cut into the subsurface material and some erosion does occur, the likelihood of sediment delivery to streams would be minimal, because temporary roads would be located on ridgetops far from stream channels. Low- and mixed-severity prescribed fire is proposed on 1,370 acres for all action alternatives. Green tree mortality within the treated areas would be less than 50%, resulting in a patchy mosaic of burned and unburned areas. Unburned portions of burn units would capture and hold much of any generated erosion. Approximately 465 acres are mapped as LSP and/or susceptible to mass wasting. A design feature of no ignition in these areas (following PACFISH guidelines) would be implemented. Fire would be allowed to back into these areas.  Soil Productivity 3.8.6.3.3Compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, loss of surface organic matter, and soil mass movements can all reduce site productivity. For the purpose of the project, proposed harvest units, temporary roads, and prescribed burn units are all considered Activity Areas. Much research has been conducted on the extent of ground disturbance from harvest activities. Disturbance has been shown to range from 4% to over 40%, depending on equipment used, method, and season of operation, and silvicultural prescription (Clayton 1981; Clayton 1990; McNeeland Ballard 1992; Tepp 2002). Megahan (1980) documented that the highest amount of disturbance came from tractor yarding, with lesser amounts from skyline and aerial methods. In order to estimate the potential increase in detrimental disturbance created by proposed activities, the following assumptions were made for ground-based skidding, skyline yarding, temporary road construction, and slash treatment: • Detrimental soil impacts from proposed ground-based skidding are estimated at 8%–12% (average 10%) of an Activity Area based on use of designated skid trails (Archer 2008). Detrimental soil disturbance is generally limited to main skid trails and landings. Soil disturbance can be minimized by using existing skid trails and/or by designating the locations of new skid trails (Froehlich and Adams 1984; Froehlich and McNabb 1983). • Estimated detrimental soil impacts from proposed skyline yarding are 4% of an Activity Area, and disturbance is mostly concentrated at landings. • Impacts to soil from temporary road construction are expected to span an average width of 25 feet wherever roads are built. This estimate is based on the assumption of a running road surface 12–15 feet wide and an additional 3–6 feet, cleared of vegetation, on each side of the road, where the soil would likely be displaced and the organic litter layer disturbed and/or removed. Based on these estimates, temporary roads would increase DSD by less than 3% for any activity unit. .Alternatives B and C propose 36 miles (8.7 existing) of temporary road. Alternative D proposes half as much temporary road with 18 miles (8.7 existing). An altered logging system design was developed for Alternative D due to the reduced access. This added an additional 2.0 miles (3 acres) of swing trail or skid trail construction. These would have essentially the same effects as temporary roads, due to the extent of soil disturbance. • Activity-generated slash piled along roadsides and in landings would be dispatched via sale of biomass materials, chipping, or burning. Activity generated slash would be machine-piled and burned on slopes less than 35% where needed to increase survival of leave-trees. Machinery would utilize existing trails for piling operations. On steeper ground, broadcast and jackpot burning would be used for fuels reduction and site preparation. Treatment of slash is incorporated in the estimated DSD discussed above. The calculations based on the above assumptions are gross estimations and are best used to compare alternatives and develop design criteria for units that may have particular concern. Based on the above DSD assumptions, the proposed activities could cause soil disturbance on approximately 521 acres for Alternative B, 541 acres for Alternative C, or 505 acres for Alternative D, with the estimated increase of DSD in the harvest units ranging between 4% and 21% (see project file). The estimated increase includes skid trails, landings, and temporary roads that would be obliterated after project activities, so some measure of improvement would occur on those areas. The area of increased DSD is approximately 1% of the 43,731 acre project area for all action alternatives. The highest percent increase in soil disturbance occurs in units with proposed ground-based yarding methods. Some of these units have existing skid trails and landings that could be reused, thus minimizing the amount of new detrimental disturbance. Implementation of project design measures and BMPs would minimize DSD, and the decommissioning of skid trails, landings, and temporary roads would further improve soil condition. Decommissioning activities include decompaction, recontouring, adding organic matter, and seeding/planting. Soil remediation improves water infiltration, reduces potential for weed invasion, stabilizes slopes, and improves tree growth and vegetation establishment. About half of the units are below Forest standards for down large woody material due to excessive slash management after previous harvest activities. Units 107, 117, 142, and 148 (past partial cut units proposed for regeneration harvest), units 201–206, 208–212, 214–216, 220–222, 225–227, 233, 236, 304–306, 309, 310, 315–320, 322–324, 330–332, 343–351, 354, 356, 358, and 373 (past clear-cut actions now proposed for commercial thin), and units 501 and 506 (past partial cuts proposed for improvement harvests) are lacking coarse woody material (<5 tons/acre). Units 209, 212, 213, 350, and 373 have thin litter/duff layers of <2 centimeters. Commercial thin units would retain 40%–50% of their trees (or more), providing existing and future coarse woody material, which would maintain soil stability and productivity. For regeneration and improvement units, 14–28 standing trees per acre (tpa) would be retained as individuals or in groups. In addition, 7–33 tons/acre (depending on habitat type and aspect) of down woody material would be left in the interior of each unit. Units 107, 117, 142, and 148 would have tree retention levels on the high end of the range to account for the lack of existing down woody material. By adhering to these design elements, the action alternatives would meet Regional soil standards for organic material by adhering to these design elements. Prescribed fire can remove organic matter from the soil or change the physical and chemical properties of soil if temperatures become too high, as in a severe burn. Underburning drier, open stands using quick, light-severity burns that burn only top layers of duff would have minimal impacts on soils. Areas of mixed conifers where the objective is to create openings may experience more high-intensity fire, but not necessarily high-severity burns. High-severity fires can create water-repellent soils, which may result in soil erosion via mass wasting, sheet erosion, and/or gully erosion events. Mapping of local wildfires and ongoing monitoring of past prescribed burns indicate that approximately 4%–10% of the burn units would burn severely. This would be considered DSD, but the amount would meet Regional soil standards.  Effectiveness of Design Criteria 3.8.6.3.4Past monitoring and research indicate that the effectiveness of the project design features would be moderate to high (Froehlich and McNabb 1983; Graham et al. 1994; Graham et al. 1999; Korb et al. 2004; Neary et al. 2008; Curran et al. 2005a,b). 3.8.6.4 Cumulative Effects For the purpose of the project, proposed harvest units and associated temporary roads and prescribed burn units are considered Activity Areas. The cumulative effects areas are the same as those discussed in the section addressing direct and indirect effects. Areas affected by DSD can take several decades to recover, depending on soil texture, depth of compaction, and loss of organic material (Powers et al. 2005; Froehlich et al. 1983). This analysis considers all activities from the 1950s to the present, as well as 20–50 years into the future. Conditions in the project area are a result of both natural processes and human activities. Past management activities include permitted grazing (1960s to present), recreation, fire suppression, road building and maintenance, and previous harvest activities (1950s to 2005). Past harvest and associated road construction have caused the most impact to the soil resource. Soil disturbance from these activities was incorporated into the DSD calculations.  Timber Harvest 3.8.6.4.1Harvesting methods prior to the 1990s often consisted of hand felling trees, unrestricted tractor skidding and extensive machine piling of slash. Ground-based logging occurred on slopes exceeding 35% and dense networks of excavated roads and skid trails were commonly constructed. These practices frequently resulted in extensive compaction, rutting, and areas of scraped or displaced topsoil and organic matter. Machine piling of slash often removed small organic material, large coarse wood, and topsoil. Forest practices have changed over the last few decades. Project design measures, BMPs, and Forest Plan guidelines have been developed in order to reduce the extent of disturbance and maintain soil productivity. Designated skid trails, retention of woody material, operating under dry conditions, and limiting ground-based skidding activities to slopes less than 35% are now common practices. Slash treatment techniques have changed from dozer piling to excavator piling along designated trails, so that less soil displacement and compaction occurs, reducing the detrimental effects to soil. Since the 1950s, 28% of the project area has been harvested. Most harvest activities occurred between the 1960s and 1990s, with approximately 2,500 acres of intermediate harvest and 9,500 acres of regeneration harvest. The most notable effects from harvest activities were compaction, displacement, and burned areas at landings. In steeper units, impacts were more dispersed. Less steep units had linear disturbance, mostly in the form of compacted skid trails and landings.  Fire 3.8.6.4.2Approximately 19,490 acres (45% of the project area) have burned in the project area since 1870. Evidence of past wildfire was noted in many of the units during soil surveys. No impacts from fire suppression activities were observed.  Roads 3.8.6.4.3Roads also influence soil, with long-term to permanent impairment of soil productivity. Although system roads are excluded in the determination of whether projects meet Forest Plan and Regional standards, these roads are a part of the existing condition. Within the project area, approximately 180 miles or 1,100 acres of system roads occur where topsoil and subsoil have been displaced, mixed, or lost to erosion. This acreage represents about 3% of the project area. Since 1997, over 30 miles of roads have been decommissioned. The project proposes to decommission 13.2 miles of system roads. An additional 65 miles of nonsystem roads would be decommissioned under the Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning Project, which is currently under development.  Grazing 3.8.6.4.4Effects from grazing are moderate and tend to be highest near meadow areas, seeps, and springs. Impacts within the units are transitory (in the form of livestock trails) and are mostly on the edges of units or along old skid roads. Grazing impacts accounted for less than 1% of soil detrimental disturbance in the units.  Recreation 3.8.6.4.5Recreation activities that were noted during field surveys include dispersed camping, off-highway vehicles (OHVs) and full-size vehicle use, fuelwood cutting, and hunting. Dispersed camping is generally located on already disturbed sites along system roads. Effects from recreation activities are primarily associated with full-size vehicles and OHVs using system roads during wet conditions, creating wheel ruts that concentrate water flow. Disturbance from recreation activities within harvest and burn units is anticipated to be negligible (less than 1%). Ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed Activity Areas (harvest and burn units) consist of grazing, recreation, and fire suppression. Grazing impacts could increase over a period of up to 10–20 years after harvest when more forage is available in the harvest units. This is not expected to account for increased disturbance as livestock would trail along already disturbed skid trails and temporary roads that have been seeded. Recreation activities are not expected to increase in the harvest units, so an increase in detrimental disturbance is not expected. Fuelwood cutting could increase after project activities, but many of the units are located along closed roads and access is limited. Fire suppression activities could increase DSD but the timing and extent of such disturbances cannot be predicted.  Alternative A—No Action 3.8.6.4.6This alternative maintains the existing condition. It would not alter the current soil erosion or landslide potential and would retain the same amount of coarse woody material, both standing and down. Existing DSD would persist with very slight natural recovery of surface layers of compacted soils.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.8.6.4.7The cumulative effects of these Action Alternatives were based on the estimated potential of increased detrimental disturbance (based on Region 1 Supplement definitions) when added to existing disturbance and to evaluate whether the project met Regional and Forest Plan standards. The cumulative effect of past and proposed activities was determined by adding the estimated disturbance from the project (increase of 4%–21%) to the existing DSD (0%–22%). Potential cumulative DSD within the harvest units is estimated to be between 7% and 40% prior to implementation of project design measures. (See project file for detailed information on individual units.) As shown in Table 3-17, 75 to 78 units would require implementation of unit-specific design measures in order to meet Regional soil standards. These measures would limit the amount of increased DSD from project activities and reduce the amount of existing detrimental disturbance by obliterating existing skid trails and landings. The project would meet the Regional soil standards by limiting the extent of detrimental disturbance to <15% following project implementation or by trending positive for those units with DSD currently >15%. Table 3-17.

Methods to meet or ensure this goal may include the following: main skid trails would be located only on existing disturbed areas with minimal, one-pass trails occurring on undisturbed ground; cut-to-length forwarder systems would be used; equipment used for machine piling or mastication of activity slash would remain on designated skid trails; and logging system layout designs would limit the amount of new detrimental disturbance (portions of the unit would be dropped if the layout plan cannot reach the entire unit while staying under the 15% standard). The estimated number of acres of new disturbance has been calculated for each unit and can be found in the project file. In addition, all skid trails, landings, and temporary roads would be decommissioned. Decommissioning of skid trails and landings would directly improve soil conditions, processes, and functions in the units by decompacting soils and adding coarse woody material and other organic matter to the existing skid trails or road surfaces. Decompaction of soil would break up platy structure, increase water infiltration rates, and temporarily remove vegetation. Seed would be spread over disturbed ground to re-establish vegetative cover. Where available, duff and woody material would also be spread over the disturbed area to increase the recovery rate. Skid trail decommissioning following harvest would utilize methods similar to Forest road decommissioning methods. Improvements in soil structure, water infiltration, aeration, root penetrability, and soil biological activity have been observed on the Clearwater National Forest after road decommissioning techniques were used there. A local soil study (Lloyd et al. 2013) observed that improved infiltration rates and soil bulk densities on decommissioned roads recover to values similar to never-roaded areas at 1, 5, and 10 years following decommissioning. In this same study and time frame, soil organic matter, total carbon, and nitrogen pools and processes increased to levels similar to those found in never-roaded surfaces. The Clearwater Forest Plan Monitoring Report (USDA Forest Service 2009b) stated that road decommissioning monitoring on the Forest across a wide range of sites has documented an increase in vegetative cover from 18% the year after decommissioning to 64% at 10 years after decommissioning. Skid trail and road decommissioning following reuse would also improve slope stability and decrease long-term erosion. Soil improvement activities on existing disturbed areas are expected to accelerate soil recovery and result in immediate or near-term (approximately 1–5 years) improvement in fundamental soil properties (e.g., bulk density, infiltration rates, soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen). These improvement activities would also provide support for continued long-term recovery of soil functions and productivity. 3.8.6.5 Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitment of Resources Loss of the volcanic ash–influenced loess through erosion or removal (excavated temporary roads and skid trails) is irretrievable. Remaining soil materials would eventually develop (over a minimum of several decades) but may lack the water- and nutrient-holding properties of volcanic ash. Small, localized areas would have reduced soil productivity until vegetation becomes reestablished and organic layers rebuild. These areas include temporary roads, skid trails, landings, and burned areas. Severely burned areas and areas with deep compaction could take decades to recover (Froehlich et al. 1983). Soil improvement activities such as decompacting soils and adding organic matter (woody material) could jump-start this process (Curran et al. 2005a,b). All project activities include BMPs, design features, or rehabilitative measures to avoid irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources on the productive land base. Decommissioning of temporary roads and skid trails, which includes recontouring and recovery of excavated ash cap topsoil, is expected to initiate recovery of soil productivity functions over time, which could be as long as 40–60 years. Additional design measures such as keeping disturbance to less than 15% areal extent, re-use of existing skid trails in units, decompaction of skid trails and landings, and retention of woody debris are intended to avoid loss of the ash cap soil. 3.9 VEGETATION This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on vegetation. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Project Vegetation Report,” located in the project file. Historically, the primary change agent within the Clear Creek drainage was a mixed-severity fire regime with return intervals ranging from 75 years to over 300 years. Insects, disease, and humans have become the primary agents of change since fire has been absent from the area. Historic logging practices generally created small patches with regular edges that are inconsistent with natural change agents. The project is designed to utilize existing small patches of young trees to create larger patches of young trees by implementing variable retention regeneration methods, thinning through younger stands, and retaining 100% of stands in some areas. All of these activities would occur within the Focus areas. These activities were designed to create a disturbance pattern that is more in line with the size and scale of what historically would have been a mixed-severity fire regime. The location of the Focus areas was intended to utilize the existing young forest and the existing transportation system. The goals of the project are designed to promote forest health by maintaining and reestablishing long-lived, early seral species such as white pine, ponderosa pine, and western larch, which have declined significantly over the last 80 years due to white pine blister rust and lack of disturbance (Arno and Keane 2002; Keane and Arno 1996). Healthy forests with ecological resilience will help provide and sustain a broad range of ecosystem services including fire/fuels, wildlife, recreation, aquatics, and commodity production. Healthy, resilient landscapes have a greater capacity to survive natural disturbances and large-scale threats to sustainability, especially under changing and uncertain future environmental conditions, such as those driven by climate change and increasing demand for human use.  Analysis Area 3.9.1The analysis area for this assessment includes only the 43,731 acres of NFS managed lands, all of which lie within the upper two-thirds of the drainage. The analysis area is ecologically and socially important for many reasons, including fish and wildlife habitat, opportunities for sustained local economic stability, protection of Nez Perce tribal treaty rights, and recreation opportunities. The analysis indicators discuss the existing conditions at treatment unit and analysis area scales. However, the existing conditions of the biophysical environment also need to be discussed at the larger spatial scale of the Middle Fork Clearwater River basin, and sometimes northern Idaho or the northwestern United States, to provide appropriate context for analyzing Clear Creek conditions. Agents of change—such as succession, weather, climate, fire, insects, and disease—must also be considered in these discussions.  Regulatory Framework 3.9.2Forest Plan direction and all federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to the management of vegetative resources on the Forest would be applied to the project, including the NFMA of 1976. In addition, diagnosis, prescription development, and forest health analysis are guided by Forest Service regulations and policy (FSH 1909.60 and 2409.17; FSM 1920, 2020, 2470, 2471, and 2472) and the Region 1 Integrated Restoration and Protection Strategy. 3.9.2.1 Nez Perce Forest Plan  Timber Standards 3.9.2.1.1Timber Standard 1 Require silvicultural examination and prescriptions before any vegetative manipulation takes place on forested lands. Final determination of the silvicultural system for areas to be harvested will be made by a certified silviculturist after an on-the-ground, site-specific analysis. All proposed treatment stands have had stand exams or have been examined on the ground by a silviculturist, wildlife biologist, and fuels specialist. All vegetative treatments will have silvicultural prescriptions approved by a certified silviculturist prior to treatment implementation. Prescriptions will consider site-specific factors as well as multiple resource objectives, NEPA decisions, other regulatory requirements and Forest Plan goals, objectives, and standards. Action alternative treatments were proposed because they balance the management, operational, silvical, and human dimension requirements and respond to the purpose and need. Timber Standard 2 Clear-cutting will not occur adjacent to previously harvested areas that are still considered openings. No harvest is being proposed adjacent to stands that would be considered an opening. All proposed harvest units that are adjacent to previously harvested stands are certified as fully stocked, and the trees are greater than 10 feet in height. Timber Standard 3 Permit timber harvest on lands classified as “unsuitable” for timber management to accomplish multiple use objectives. No harvest is being proposed on unsuitable lands.  Old Growth Standards 3.9.2.1.2In order to maintain a viable population of old growth dependent species the Nez Perce National Forest plans to manage 10 percent of the total forested acres as old growth with no less than 5 percent of the forested acres maintained as old growth within each prescription watershed or combination of watersheds totaling 5,000-10,000 acres. If less than 5 percent old growth exists in a drainage, the additional required acres will be assigned to adjacent drainages where excess old growth is available or an additional 5 percent of the forested acres within prescription watershed shall be designated as replacement old growth. Following direction to use best available science the Nez Perce National Forest has updated Forest direction for old growth and snag management. Old Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region by Green, Joy, Sirucek, Hann, Zack and Naumann is the current and best science available for defining old growth. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 is based on habitat types to determine old growth conditions. Greens research is based on field data called stand exams with over 20,000 samples. Although Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 criteria for old growth is more complex, the criteria is also more relevant, more precise and within the capability of the specific Nez Perce National Forest habitat types. Each habitat type is assigned to a habitat type group which corresponds to an old growth type. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 defines old growth within the ecological conditions with specific criteria that are within the capability of the habitat type. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 old growth description is based on successional processes in which stands develop into late seral single storied stands or late seral multi storied stands or the stage where climax tree species dominates the stand.  Protection Standards 3.9.2.1.3Protection Standard 3 Minimize the impacts of the mountain pine beetle and other insect and disease infestations to the extent necessary to achieve the overall goals and objectives of this Forest Plan. Loss of the long-lived early seral components in the ecosystem is a major factor in the lack of ecological resiliency. Regeneration treatments would remove dead, dying, and at-risk vegetation, which would trend the project area toward species compositions with increased resilience. Proposed treatments would minimize adverse pest effects and maximize a range of objectives. 3.9.2.2 National Forest Management Act  Vegetation Manipulation (36 CFR 219.27(b)[1] 3.9.2.2.1“Ensure that technology and knowledge exist to adequately restock lands within 5 years after final harvest.” Restocking within 5 years of regeneration harvest is a required design item of the action alternatives. Technology and knowledge do exist to comply with this requirement. The Clearwater National Forest Plan Monitoring and Evaluation Report for 2008 shows that 60% of stands harvested in 2002 have been certified, and the rest are progressing toward certification. Recent, similar monitoring data is not currently available for the Nez Perce National Forest; however, the project area is close enough to the Clearwater National Forest so that soils, habitat types, and moisture regimes are similar enough so that the Clearwater data can be used as a surrogate. The delay in certification was caused by a delay in achieving proper site preparation. This standard is met under the action alternatives.  Vegetation Manipulation (36 CFR 219.27(b)[1]) 3.9.2.2.2“Be chosen after considering potential effects on residual trees and adjacent stands.” The potential short- and long-term negative effects of proposed activities on adjacent trees were considered during alternative development. Retention areas would be designed to minimize mortality during site preparation activities. Site-specific prescription modifications, such as change unit boundary, would be incorporated into the prescriptions. This standard is met under the action alternatives.  Silvicultural Practices (36 CFR 219.27(c) 3.9.2.2.3“No timber harvest, other than salvage sales or sales to protect other multiple-use values, shall occur on lands not suitable for timber production.” Guidelines for determining suitability are found in the FSH (2409.13). The proposed harvest units are within the productive habitat types (as described in Cooper et al. 1991). None of the areas being proposed for treatment as part of the project are designated as unsuitable under the 1987 Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a). This standard is met under the action alternatives.  Even-aged Management (36 CFR 219.27(d) 3.9.2.2.4“When timber is to be harvested using an even-aged management system, a determination that the system is appropriate to meet the objectives and requirements of the Forest Plan must be made. Where clear-cutting is to be used, it must be determined to be the optimum harvest method.” The action alternatives propose a combination of regeneration harvests (shelterwood establishment with reserves) and prescribed burning. The regeneration harvests are even-aged regeneration harvest systems. All vegetative treatments would have prescriptions prepared by a certified silviculturist. Overall, the analysis area stands display high mortality and low growth rates. All proposed treatments meet objectives and requirements of the Forest Plan. 3.9.2.3 Forest Service Manual 2471—Harvest Cutting The size of harvest openings created by even-aged silvicultural in the Northern Region will normally be 40 acres or less. Creation of larger openings will require 60-day public review and Regional Forester approval. The public was informed during scoping that regeneration openings in excess of 40 acres were proposed for the project area. Approval to exceed the 40-acre opening size, with appropriate interdisciplinary analysis and documentation, was received from the Regional Forester‘s office on September 13, 2013. The action alternatives would create openings on the landscape that are closer in scale and pattern to the openings developed under historic disturbance regimes for this area. Proposed harvest openings greater than 40 acres are discussed under Patch Size in the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects section. This standard is met under all the action alternatives.  Resource Indicators 3.9.3No single indicator is a definitive measure of forest health or resilience. A healthy and resilient forest ecosystem is characterized by composition, structure, pattern, and ecological processes sustainable under current and future conditions. The basis for the forest health analysis is comparison of the existing condition and the outcome of the alternatives to the desired condition in the project area. The desired condition is specific to the project area and was developed by incorporating data from Ecological Units of the Northern Region Subsections, VRUs, the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Ecosystem Management Project, and the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Sub-basin Assessment. Studying historical data can reduce the chances of major future surprises. Forest composition and three characteristics of forest structure are used to assess trends toward or away from health and resilient conditions. Current conditions for these indicators were derived from legacy data Timber Stand Management and Records System (TSMRS) and FSVeg data. The effectiveness of the alternatives in addressing forest composition objectives is indicated by the following: • Percent of the project area with forest cover type dominated by the long-lived early seral species (western white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine) compared to area dominated by grand fir and Douglas-fir (Pseudotusuga menzeseii). The effectiveness of the alternatives in addressing forest structure objectives is indicated by the following: • Percent of the project area in each stand age class. Age groups are young (0–40 years), mid-seral (41–100 years), mature (101–149 years), and old (150 years and older). Age class will be analyzed at the project area scale to allow comparison of alternatives and desired conditions at various points in time-based age class distributions by vegetation response units. • Vertical structure is used as a within-stand structural arrangement indicator. It is represented by the number of vertical layers present in a stand. Vertical structure will be compared between alternatives. The 4 vertical structure classes are single-storied, two-storied, three-storied, and continuous vertical structure. Landscape arrangement is discussed in terms of changes in patch sizes of the age classes. Comparison of current conditions and action alternatives to the desired condition is an indicator of resiliency at the project area scale.  Analysis Methodology 3.9.4This analysis relies on comparison of existing conditions to desired conditions at various spatial and temporal scales. The DFC was used for comparing the present condition of the project area and anticipated conditions under the No Action alternative and the three action alternatives over time. The interaction of successional development (as represented by habitat types in Cooper et al. 1991; USDA Forest Service 1997) and disturbances such as fire, insects, diseases, and human influences results in the species composition, structure, and landscape arrangement of an ecosystem. Maps depicting habitat groups and VRUs are available in the project record. Existing conditions reflect past natural disturbances and management activities. The vegetative desired condition for the project area was developed prior to any proposed action or effects analysis. It is based on multiple resource objectives, using direction from the 1987 Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a), the proposed 2008 Plan Revision, the Selway Middle Fork Clearwater Sub-basin Assessment, and the draft Clear Creek NFMA document. 3.9.4.1 Data Sources Current vegetative conditions were summarized using a vegetation inventory model. The model uses forest stand data from FACTS, TSMRS, FSVeg, and the Most Similar Neighbor modeling program (a model that populates estimated stand data to areas without stand exams). The inventory model also uses the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) to grow all the stands to 2012 conditions, starting from the time when the stands last received a stand examination. Additionally, Region 1 Vmap data were used to further evaluate current conditions of the project area. The data were collected in 2006 and classified using the Region 1 Vegetation Council Existing Forested Vegetation Classification System. Inventory work is performed on individual stands. A stand is defined as a contiguous group of trees sufficiently uniform in species composition, arrangement of age classes, and condition on a relatively similar site. The FVS model provided a variety of information that was used in the analysis, including species composition, growth over time, and fire and fuels parameters. Documentation of these FVS attributes is found in Graham et al. (1994), Dixon (2002), Crookston (1999), Frankel (1998), and McGaughey (2002). Additionally, a patch analysis derived from the Fragstats program was used to describe and compare landscape pattern, arrangement, and patch size. The patch analysis is available in the project record.  Affected Environment 3.9.53.9.5.1 Biophysical Environment Much of the vegetation in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests is a result of the productive ash cap soils and the prevailing climatic pattern. The climate is dominated by Pacific maritime air masses and prevailing westerly winds. Within the analysis area, annual precipitation varies from 40 to 50 inches. Over 90% of the annual precipitation occurs during fall, winter, and spring months as a result of cyclonic storms in the form of a series of frontal systems moving east. The elevation of the analysis area ranges from 2,000 to 6,600 feet. 3.9.5.2 Ecological Settings and Vegetation Response Units Bailey’s ecosections were used to summarize historic vegetation information (McNab and Avers 1994). Each ecosection contains broad vegetation and topographic conditions. Local landtype classifications were used to divide each section into 3 settings, which are roughly similar to the subsections described in Ecological Units of the Northern Region: Subsections (Nesser et al. 1997). A map of potential vegetation types was used to attribute the forest cover types to the settings (Northern Region Cohesive Strategy Team 2002). The primary settings within the analysis area are Idaho Batholith Breaklands, Idaho Batholith Uplands, and Idaho Batholith Subalpine. The Subalpine setting comprises only 160 acres of the project area, and no treatments are proposed for these acres. Therefore, the Subalpine acreage will not be discussed in this analysis. Incorporated within each of the resulting two settings are 7 VRUs. These units are broad ecological land sections that contain habitat type groups and terrain that have similar patterns of disturbance and successional processes. Patterns of plant community composition, age class structure, and patch size tend to fall within certain ranges for each VRU. The components used to build the VRU classification system are habitat type groups (potential vegetation), landforms, climate, and presettlement disturbance processes (such as fire regimes). The desired conditions, potential natural vegetation that could occupy the project area following a disturbance, and a discussion of successional patterns and development are presented below. The existing conditions for age class groups are also presented to give an idea of where potential land management activities could be used to shift the project area toward desired conditions. Existing conditions are described for the year 2012 and 2017. The year 2017 was included because that is the estimated year when actual vegetative management activities would be implemented. Stands will continue to age through that time, which will result in age class shifts.  Idaho Batholith—Breaklands 3.9.5.2.1The Breaklands are characterized by low- to mid-elevation canyons on steep south aspects. The Breaklands setting is dominated by steep slopes and deep canyon walls through which the Middle Fork and Clear Creek tributaries flow. Soils are derived from granite, border zone, and basalt geologies. Landslides and surface creep are the dominant erosion processes. The Breaklands are known for having inclusions of LSP areas and shallow soils. These characteristics make this setting more susceptible to erosion and more sensitive to disturbance. Wildfire was the primary process affecting plant succession, composition, and distribution. Steep terrain favors rapid, upslope spread of wildfires. Stand-replacing fires are more prevalent on long, steep slopes and less frequent in adjoining moist habitats. Patches on dry aspects are uneven-aged, resulting from nonlethal to mixed-severity wildfire. Patches on moist aspects are even-aged, with uniform vegetation and fuel conditions resulting from stand-replacing fires. Early seral species (shrubs, forbs, and grasses), Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, and grand fir readily reestablish following wildfire episodes. VRU 3: 3,030 acres (7% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Open stands of large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir dominate upland habitats. Approximately 40%–60% of the landscape contains 10–25 tpa of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir older than 150 years. Mixed-severity disturbance occurs on about 10%–15% of the analysis area in any 2-decade period. Low-severity disturbances occur on up to 50% of the landscape in a decade. Old forests occur both as isolated or open-understory, large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir (uplands) and mixed to coniferous forest (shaded or moist habitats). The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 3 are shown in Table 3-18.  Table 3-18.

The action alternatives would use regeneration harvest to increase the young age class through management of the mid-seral stage, which exceeds the desired high condition by almost 1,000 acres. Commercial thinning or full retention would be used to promote healthy stands that could grow into the late- and old-forest stages. Patch sizes are on the low end of desired ranges. Proposed regeneration harvest and burning activities would increase patch sizes to better emulate natural disturbance patterns. VRU 8: 11,350 acres (26% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Grand fir, Douglas-fir, and western redcedar dominate stands during late successional stages. Early seral stages range from relatively open to densely stocked and are usually dominated by a mix of early seral and mid-seral species, including lodgepole pine, western larch, and western white pine. Ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, and Pacific yew may be present. Important elements include coastal disjunct plant species, early to seral tall shrub and hardwood communities, and old-growth inclusions of western redcedar riparian habitats. Patch sizes are widely variable and result from irregular, infrequent mixed-severity fires and very infrequent stand-replacing fires throughout the landscape. Old-forest habitats dominated by shade-tolerant conifers typically occur in patches of <40 acres and are associated with topographic inclusions (benches, basins, flat ridges, and moist habitats). These smaller patches are a result of stand-replacing fires. About 50%–60% of stands originate from stand-replacing fires. Postdisturbance stands include at least 10 live tpa that are >150 years old. Relict Douglas-fir, western larch, grand fir, and ponderosa pine are common on ridges. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 8 are shown in Table 3-19.  Table 3-19.

The proposed action alternatives would use regeneration harvest and prescribed fire to reduce the mid-seral stage and increase patch size. VRU 12: 40 acres (<1% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Bluebunch wheatgrass and Idaho fescue dominate dry upland habitats; shrubs dominate draws and moist inclusions. Patch sizes are limited by aspect and coniferous vegetation. Invasive forbs and grasses are reduced or eliminated. Very frequent (5- to 20-year intervals), low-severity fire maintains open grasslands and rejuvenates shrub habitats. Ponderosa pine and an occasional Douglas-fir occur incidentally. This VRU is incidental at the analysis scale because the unit comprises only 40 acres within the analysis area. All 40 acres are proposed for grassland restoration activities.  Idaho Batholith—Uplands 3.9.5.2.2The Uplands setting is a mix of gentle-to-steep slopes that form shallow canyons. Surface soils are derived from granite, border zone, and basalt geologies. The warm, moist climate, in combination with deep volcanic ash soils, creates high site productivity for forested stands. Surface creep is the dominant erosion process; mass-wasted areas are local and uncommon. Fire was the primary landscape disturbance process affecting plant succession, composition, and distribution. The fire regime is variable due to irregular terrain that discourages rapid fire spread. This fire regime creates a mosaic of mixed- to lethal-burned uplands and nonlethal or unburned riparian habitats. Small openings created by the more frequent low- and mixed-severity fires result in a mix of tree species and ages. Stand-replacing wildfire occurs at intervals of 150–250 years or more (Kapler-Smith and Fischer 1997) and is likely associated with strong wind episodes in combination with extended drought. VRU 7: 2,570 acres (6% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Stands are often dominated by mixed occurrences of grand fir, Douglas-fir, Pacific yew, western larch, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine. Western white pine may be present. The decline in white pine has led to the increase of grand fir and Douglas-fir, which have a high susceptibility to root diseases. Pacific yew and moist old-growth are important elements. About 20%–40% of stands originate from mixed-severity disturbances, and 60%–80% originate from stand-replacing disturbances. Post-disturbance stands include at least 10 live tpa that are >150 years old. Two or more age classes are common in any given stand. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 7 are shown in Table 3-20. Table 3-20. Desired and Existing Conditions for Patch Size, Successional Stage Distribution, and Tree Size Class for Vegetative Response Unit (VRU) 7 Factor Desired Conditions Existing Conditions Patch size 40–300 acres 1–282 acres 20% within size range Successional Stage Distribution Young Mid-seral Mature Old-forest Private 10%–20% 15%–35% 10%–30% 35%–65% -- 26% 25% 28% 20% 2% Tree size class Non-forest <5 inches dbh 5–8.9 inches 9–21 inches 21+ inches 1%–10% 5%–20% 10%–25% 25%–35% 35%–45% 2% 27% 10% 16% 46%  The greatest departure from desired conditions in VRU 7 is the need for an increase in old forests. The young-forest stage is in excess of the desired high condition by 150 acres. The action alternatives would use regeneration harvest to create young forests and would implement commercial and precommercial thinning to promote healthy stands (by selecting for preferred, long-lived species and reducing stand densities to reduce competition for light, water, and nutrients). Thinning would help the stands progress toward the older age classes. VRU 10: 5,170 acres (12% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Open-canopied, multi-aged old-forest stands of grand fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, western redcedar, and Sitka alder are the dominant cover types. Isolated Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and Pacific yew locally occur on ridges. Mixed alder, forbs, and grasses are well distributed and persistent as inclusions. Multi-aged, mixed-species stands originate from low- and mixed-severity disturbances, including windthrow. Old-forest habitats are dominated by shade-tolerant conifers associated with moist habitats. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 10 are shown in Table 3-21. Table 3-21. Desired and Existing Conditions for Patch Size, Successional Stage Distribution, and Tree Size Class for Vegetative Response Unit (VRU) 10 Factor Desired Conditions Existing Conditions Patch size 40–800 acres 5–282 acres 24% within size range Successional Stage Distribution Young Mid-seral Mature Old-forest 10%–20% 10%–30% 10%–30% 35%–65% 9% 18% 15% 58% Tree Size Class Non-forest <5 inches dbh 5–8.9 inches 9–21 inches 21+ inches Unknown/no survey data 1%–10% 5%–20% 10%–25% 25%–35% 35%–45% — 0.1% 10% 0.1% 38% 40% 12%  The greatest departure from desired conditions in VRU 10 is the need for a slight increase in the young forest. Old forest occurs near the top end of desired condition. As expected, mortality from insects, disease, and old age is becoming more evident in these stands as they mature. Proposed regeneration harvest would be used to reduce the old-forest component while increasing the young forest. Proposed commercial thinning in the mid-seral forests would promote healthy, vigorously growing stands. VRU 17: 20,485 acres (47% of the analysis area) Desired Condition: Western redcedar and grand fir are the dominant mature forest cover types in the absence of disturbance. With stand reinitiation, Douglas-fir, western white pine, and western larch occur as isolated relics in mature and old stands. The decline in white pine has led to the increase of grand fir and Douglas-fir, which have a high susceptibility to root diseases. Open-canopied, multi-aged old forest and tall shrub communities are important elements. About 40%–60% of stands evolve with mixed-severity disturbances, and 40%–60% develop following stand-replacing disturbances. Post disturbance stands include at least 10 live tpa that are >150 years old. Old-forest habitats are dominated by shade-tolerant western redcedar and grand fir. The desired and existing conditions for patch size, successional stage distribution, and tree size class for VRU 17 are shown in Table 3-22. Table 3-22.

Proposed precommercial thinning in young forest and commercial thinning in mid-seral forests would promote healthy stands as they continue to grow into the late- and old-forest stages. Regeneration harvest would be used to increase patch sizes to more natural levels and to maintain desired levels within 5 years. 3.9.5.3 Vegetative Agents of Change Vegetation is a fundamental part of terrestrial ecosystems. The vegetation that exists across an ecosystem and through time is a function of the physical state, the climate, the plant species available in an area, the disturbance history of the site, and the successional processes that follow disturbance. Most landscapes are a mosaic reflecting the interaction between disturbance and plant succession. The interaction between disturbance forces and successional processes is a keystone process shaping the landscape vegetation mosaic (Zack and Morgan 1994). Understanding disturbance and succession and how they relate to forest composition is necessary to understand the current vegetative state. Additionally, timber harvest has created disturbances to successional patterns.  Weather 3.9.5.3.1While fires can create dramatic changes to successional development and the ecosystem, weather continually modifies the ecosystem. Moisture and temperature are important to characterize the biophysical environment. Weather disturbances (such as wind events, periods of high moisture, or drought) adjust species composition, structure (at the fine and coarse scale), and function (growth; conditions conducive for insect, disease, or fire mortality) consistently throughout successional development. Weather is not predictable in terms of ecological timing or landscape arrangement, but it has continual and important influence. Examples of weather-related influences include changes in composition and structure due to an ice/wind storm, extended drought creating conditions conducive to bark beetle infestation (mountain pine beetle currently occurring at higher elevations), and the survival of regeneration based on occurrence of a series of moist or droughty years. As discussions move from weather (atmospheric conditions over a short period of time) to climate (how the atmosphere behaves over long periods of time), the continual effects of moisture, temperature, and weather disturbances define the environment and therefore the compositions, structures, and function of the ecosystem.  Climate Change 3.9.5.3.2Climate change and management of natural resources with a changing climate are both science and social issues. Managing in the face of climate change is a common forest management question, both in terms of the effect climate change will have on the managed ecosystem and the effect the Proposed Action may have on the climate. The Forest Service has been involved in climate change research for about 2 decades and has a century of science and management experience. The Forest Service has stated its objective regarding climate change as follows: The aim is to reestablish and retain ecological resilience of NFS lands and associated resources to achieve sustainable management and provide a broad range of ecosystem services. Healthy, resilient landscapes will have greater capacity to survive natural disturbances and large scale threats to sustainability, especially under changing and uncertain future environmental conditions, such as those driven by climate change and increasing human uses (FSM 2020.2). The future of forest management in a changing climate is best addressed with approaches that embrace strategic flexibility, characterized by risk-taking, the capacity to reassess conditions frequently, and willingness to change course as conditions change (Hobbs et al. 2006 [cited in Millar et al. 2007]). The appropriate approach is an integrated strategy involving a scientific and social climate change approach that considers predictions/scenarios specific to the local ecosystem as well as analysis of specific ecosystem responses. The Washington Climate Change Impacts Assessmentis the most recent and area-specific tool available to understand potential changes in northern Idaho. Until more scientific details for this approach are available, a conservative forest management approach is reasonable; a conservative approach is based on diversity and resilience and can be adjusted in the short, middle, and long terms (adaptive management). This is the basis for proposed treatments in the Clear Creek project area. Text box that contains the definitions for nonlethal fires, mixed-severity fires, and lethal firesFire Severity • Nonlethal fires – fires that kill 10% or less of the dominant tree canopy. A much larger percentage of small, understory trees, shrubs, and forbs may be burned back to the ground lines. • Mixed-severity fires – fires that kill more than 10% but less than 90% of the dominant tree canopy. These fires are commonly patch, irregular burns, producing a mosaic of different burn severities. • Lethal fires – fires that kill 90% or more of the dominant tree canopy. These are often called stand-replacing fires, and they often burn with high severity. They are commonly crown fires.  Fire 3.9.5.3.3While forests can be disturbed by weather, insects, and microorganisms, all of these interact with fire. Fire can release a large amount of energy in short periods of time, which is why fire is one of nature’s most powerful disturbance forces. During summer, the Clear Creek watershed experiences significant dry periods when vegetation can sustain fires. Lightning was probably the primary ignition source prior to Euro-American settlement. Lightning and human causes are the present-day ignition sources. Fire suppression was considered to be effective at the landscape scale in the 1930s. Understanding fire as an agent of change allows understanding of the functional interactions in a healthy, sustainable ecosystem. Understanding past fire disturbance or vegetation scenarios for an area allows increased understanding of the area’s resilience and sustainability. Data from the predominant VRUs within the project area (VRUs 8 and 17), combined with the analysis done for the Clear Creek watershed assessments, indicate that only the lethal, very infrequent (151 to 300-year interval) fire regime is still operating. The nonlethal underburning fire regime no longer occurs, due to fire suppression efforts. Fires that start under underburning conditions are usually extinguished at <1 acre in size. The mid-seral successional stages are, therefore, denser and more uniform over the landscape than those that would have occurred historically. For a more detailed discussion of fire ecology, refer to the fire/fuels specialist report.  Insects and Disease 3.9.5.3.4In the absence of fire, forest insects and diseases can accelerate or reset forest succession by affecting tree species, size, and stand density. Functions of pathogens and insects in forests can be divided into 2 parts: the action, such as killing trees, decaying heartwood, or reducing growth; and the outcome, such as changing species composition of stands or changing stand structure from a mature, closed canopy to a pole-size, low-density structure (USDA Forest Service 2000). Based on summarized species composition, tree diameters, and age classes from Vmap and FSVeg, approximately 76% of the project area may currently be susceptible to insect and disease activity. This level of susceptibility is important because over the last 75 years, insects and disease have replaced fire as the most prominent agent of change. Root Diseases Historically, root diseases were a significant factor in reducing subalpine fir and grand fir, which tended to outcompete western larch and, on some sites, white pine. Grand fir regenerated readily in the early stages of stand development but dropped out as a significant component due to high rates of mortality caused by root disease (Byler and Zimmer-Grove 1990). White pine and larch have a higher level of resistance to root diseases at this stage of stand development and were able to capitalize on the increased availability of growing space. Fire exclusion and the loss of these species through logging, blister rust, and mountain pine beetle have reduced the opportunity for early seral species to become established in root disease areas (Harvey et al. 2008). Insects Major insect change agents of the Clear Creek watershed include mountain pine beetle, Douglas-fir beetle, Douglas-fir tussock moth, and fir engravers. Historically, mountain pine beetle played an important successional role in mature white pine or lodgepole forests; the presence of mountain pine beetle led to various significant changes, including altered species composition and widespread tree mortality that resulted in fuel buildup and increased fire susceptibility. Douglas-fir beetle and fir engravers have always been present throughout the Clear Creek watershed, and both have been observed in the project area over the last 10 years. The presence of root disease in many of the Douglas-fir and grand fir forest types has resulted in even higher endemic levels of the Douglas-fir beetle and the propensity for rapid beetle population buildups during favorable conditions. Historically, short-term increases in fuel loading may have led to increased fire intensity and severity and subsequent development of openings conducive to regeneration of early seral species. In some cases, insect infestations may have contributed to large stand-replacing fires (USDA Forest Service 1998a). White Pine Blister Rust White pine blister rust was introduced into northern Idaho and this analysis area in the early 1900s. Blister rust is a fungal disease that forms cankers on branches or stems of trees; the cankers then weaken the trees and may eventually kill them. Weakened trees also become susceptible to other disease or to insect attack. Trees were either killed or harvest was accelerated to capture anticipated loss of economic value. In addition, the young white pine component (established following the 34 fires in 1910) was highly impacted by blister rust, as these young trees had little natural resistance, if any, to the disease. The project area has experienced substantial white pine mortality. Heavy fuel loads, along with increasing amounts of grand fir, are likely a result of high numbers of white pine succumbing to blister rust. The presence of live 50-year-old to 80-year-old white pine is an indicator of some level of natural genetic resistance to blister rust in these survivors. Natural blister rust resistance is thought to be <10%. The live white pine is an ecologically important component of the resource area, both in terms of its resistance to blister rust and because of its role as a successional component as the stands develop.  Harvest 3.9.5.3.5Logging activities were initiated in the area in the 1960s. Known past harvest in the project area has been cataloged and summarized in Table 3-23. Regeneration harvest converted mature stands into younger and to smaller size classes. Additional regeneration harvest occurred at the same time on adjacent private and State property. Table 3-23.

The existing and desired forest cover types in the project area are displayed in Table 3-24. The forest cover types in the project area are primarily mixed conifers and shrubs. The Uplands and the Breaklands have relic, long-lived early seral species (western larch and ponderosa pine) but are primarily composed of late-seral, shade-tolerant species. Some scattered western white pines remain in the project area. The presence of long-lived early seral components can be used as an indicator of forest health. These species and their composition, structure, and functions have the desired resistance (ability to prevent impacts and protect valued resources), resilience (capacity of ecosystem to return to desired conditions after disturbance), and response (ability to transition from current to new conditions). Currently the project area is well out of the desired range for these species. This change is consistent with the Upper Columbia River Basin (USDA Forest Service 1997) and the Northern Region Overview (USDA Forest Service 1998a). While the Forest Plan does not mandate management at levels of historic species compositions and structures, these are helpful reference points to understand what trends may be needed over the long term to increase resiliency in the ecosystem. Table 3-24.

Fires in 1880 and 1919, as well as past timber harvesting, have created the current age class distribution within the project area.

Vertical structure depicts the number of vertical tree layers present in a stand (Berglund et al. 2008). The 4 vertical structure classes include single-storied (62% of the project area), two-storied (27%), three-storied (5%), and continuous (6%) vertical structure. The predominant class within the project area is the single-storied class, probably because the majority of the project area is in the stem exclusion stage. The single-storied stands will eventually enter the understory reinitiation stage and become multi-storied stands. The current condition is now within the desired range. It is desired to have dominance of single- and two-storied stands in the project area, with fewer areas of three-storied stands and continuous vertical structures. The single- and two-storied stands are favorable in terms of fuels management, and two-storied stands provide preferred habitat for some wildlife species.  Landscape Arrangement 3.9.5.4.4The arrangement of stand size classes and vertical structures on the landscape influences the way some types of fire, insects, or wildlife will move across the landscape. Managing for connected landscapes is seen as a way to increase a landscape’s resilience and allow animal movement (and in some cases, plant movement). The creation of a vegetation mosaic, by design, allows the land manager to control, or at least ameliorate, hazards of all kinds (Brackebusch 1973). Patch size and arrangement must be considered with all management actions: retaining resilient, large size class patches is an important objective; land managers must also consider that the young patch established this decade may become the most resilient old-growth patches in 150 years. Not all disturbance agents produce the same patch and scale characteristics. Mixed-severity fire causes a different patch size and arrangement on the landscape than large stand-replacing fire or insect and disease disturbances do. The current average patch sizes and ranges are displayed in Table 3-25. The desired condition varies by VRU but on average strives for patch sizes of 50–200 acres minimum and 1,000 acres maximum, with variable tree retention and forest connectivity where possible.  Table 3-25.

The remainder of the area is comprised of immature stands (40–80 years) that will provide for replacement old-growth habitat” (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. III-56). Data from the 2007 Forest Inventory and Analysis indicate that an estimated 13.4% of the Forest is old-growth habitat, as defined by Green et al. (1992). The lower and upper confidence interval bounds are 11% and 16.1%. The Forest meets the Forest-wide old-growth standard. The Forest Plan objectives for MA 20 are to maintain viable populations of wildlife species that are dependent on old-growth habitat. At least 10% of suitable old-growth habitat would be managed as old growth for old growth–associated species. This acreage will be distributed across the Forest in a way that ensures that at least 5%of the forested acres within major prescription watersheds of 6,000–10,000 acres will be managed as old-growth habitat (USDA Forest Service 1987a, page II-6). Appendix N of the Forest Plan describes the preferred distribution requirements and outlines an old-growth identification process: “Old growth stands should be at least 300 acres. Next best would be a core block of 150 acres with the remaining blocks of no less than 50 acres and no more than . mile away from another old growth block. If existing old-growth blocks are less than 100 acres, the stands between the old-growth blocks should be managed as an old-growth complex” (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. N-2). Old-growth analysis areas (OGAAs) were designated across the Forest in order to maintain the minimum Forest Plan requirements for amount and distribution of old-growth habitats. The analysis area includes 7 OGAAs. Two of the OGAAs are small and do not meet the Forest Plan assessment scale of 5,000–10,000 acres. OGAA 618 is 1,036 acres, and OGAA 619 is 935 acres. For this analysis, these OGAAs were combined with adjacent OGAAs to comply with Forest Plan direction. Verified old growth is defined by Green et al. (1992) in Old-Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region. Table 3-26 shows the verified old growth in each OGAA. The data derive from 2010, 2011, and 2012 stand exams, and field validation.  Table 3-26.

Clear Creek Verified Old Growth The project area contains 11% verified old growth, which meets the Forest Plan standard. A total of 31 verified old-growth patches, ranging from 7 to 987 acres, exist within the OGAAs. Sixteen percent of the patches exceed the preferred 300-acre size, 28% are at least 150-acre core areas, 13% are between 50 and 150 acres, and 42% are <50 acres. Most of the small patches (<50 acres) are effectively enlarged by the adjacent RHCAs, which also provide linkages between all old-growth patches. This facilitates dispersal of old growth–associated species. Additional old-growth forest is present in each of the OGAAs but has not been verified by recent stand exams. Stand data (TSMRS) show an additional 1,722 acres (4%) over 150 years old and over 21 inches average dbh (Table 3-27). Figure 3-7 shows the unverified old growth in each OGAA. Additionally, 24% of the analysis area is contained within RHCAs, which would be managed for future old growth. 3.9.5.5 Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects  Alternative A—No Action 3.9.5.5.1Alternative A would not affect MA 20 or old-growth forest habitats, because no activities would be conducted. Fire suppression would continue. Risk of large-scale stand-replacing fire would increase; the size or severity of such an event cannot be predicted. MA 20 and old-growth habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as succession, insect and disease, and wildfire. Some mixed-conifer habitats would mature and develop old-growth habitat characteristics, including multiple canopies, snags, and large downed wood, which provide habitat for a variety of wildlife species. Canopy openings created when snags fall would allow sunlight to reach the forest floor, providing for shrub, forb, and grass growth, which would become forage for ungulates and small mammals. The risk of a crown fire would increase with increasing surface and ladder fuels. A wildfire would create large numbers of snags and would initiate young forest conditions. Canopy cover would be lost in varying amounts. A fire would reduce the amount of old-growth habitat available to species such as fisher, pileated woodpecker, goshawk, and American marten. If no fires occur, cumulative effects on MA 20 would be an increase in the amount of suitable old growth as stands age. A negative cumulative effect would occur in the event of a wildfire that removed old-growth habitat. Predicting the size and severity of wildfire is not possible, so the level of potential cumulative effects cannot be determined.  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.9.5.5.2The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects are analyzed for each of the 7 OGAAs. The time frame for cumulative effects is 150 years, which is the time required for stands to develop into old-growth habitat. Forest Plan MA 20 would be allocated to 4,654 acres of verified old-growth habitat, which would meet Forest Plan old-growth standards. No treatment would occur in allocated MA 20 under any alternative; therefore, no direct effects to the resource would occur. MA 20 would continue to be altered by natural events, such as succession, insects and disease, and wildfire, under any action alternative. Habitat would remain available for fisher, American marten, pileated woodpecker, and northern goshawks (old growth–associated species). PACFISH buffers would provide for current and future old growth and would provide connectivity between old-growth patches and uplands. Thinning stands adjacent to old growth would increase their resilience to insects and disease, which would increase their survival and development into larger patches of future old growth. Stand-replacing fire risk would be reduced on 7% of the analysis area through project activities. This could benefit MA 20 by making the landscape more resilient to wildfire and reducing the likelihood of stand-replacing fire in old-growth habitat. There could be a slightly positive cumulative effect to MA 20 when combined with fire suppression. The Forest plan states, “Where possible, roads should not be located through or adjacent to old-growth stands in order to reduce human disturbance, loss of snags to firewood cutters, windthrow, and micro-climate changes” (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. N-2). Alternatives B and C build 2 miles and Alternative D builds 1mile of temporary roads through old-growth habitats. The average length is 0.1 miles. Road building would remove an average of 0.4 acres of vegetation on 17 road segments under Alternatives B and C and on 13 segments under Alternative D; the total amount of old growth disturbed by temporary roads would be 7 acres and 5 acres, respectively (or 0.1% of all verified old growth). The largest impact would be removal of large green and dead trees, but the effects would be indistinguishable when compared to natural diversity and openings in old-growth habitats. The roads would be decommissioned after use. Temporary roads would cause no cumulative effects to MA 20.  Environmental Consequences 3.9.63.9.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects at the Treatment Unit Scale in terms of Eco-setting As noted above, the analysis area for direct and indirect effects of the alternatives is the project area.  Alternative A—No Action 3.9.6.1.1Under the No Action alternative, no project activities would be conducted to maintain forest health or maintain resiliency. Activities to restore forest vegetation or increase its resilience would not be implemented. Two general trends would be expected to occur (Cooper et al. 1991). Uplands The Uplands make up 65% of the project area. The short-term effects of the No Action alternative would include increased mortality of Douglas-fir and grand fir as stands continue to mature and experience in-stand competition, root diseases, and decay. In addition, insects would continue to cause deterioration of stands dominated by these species. The amount of existing early seral tree species in the project area would decline. The amount of medium and large size classes would decline as root disease and insects cause mortality. Grand fir and cedar would occupy the growing space left by the mortality of other species; stands would increasingly become dominated by grand fir and cedar (Byler and Hagle 2000). In the absence of natural disturbance such as fire, regeneration to fill gaps in the canopy would be limited to the same species of the current overstory, because white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine will have limited seed sources. Douglas-fir would also gradually become less prevalent due to root disease and bark beetle mortality. Stands would continue to grow, and the diameters of trees would increase; however, the rate of this growth would slow as overstory trees die and are increasingly replaced by understory (smaller-diameter) trees. Canopy cover would remain about the same, as vertical structures would continue to move the remaining single- and two-storied stands to three-storied stands and continuous-storied stands due to mortality. The landscape would become more homogeneous, with continuous vertical structures and multiple ages (Byler and Hagle 2000). Stands would develop old-growth characteristics over time; however, when compared to similar areas 100 years ago, these stands would have fewer long-lived early seral species, more vertical structure, and multiple ages earlier in their successional development. The landscape would increasingly become less resilient to change or disturbances. Overall, while the numbers represented by current conditions are closest to desired conditions, the indirect effects of the No Action Alternative and the combination of species compositions, landscape arrangement, and structures would trend more areas to lesser health, less resistance, and less resilience than the current condition or desired conditions. The young age class (0–40 years) would continue to be underrepresented. Most stands currently within this age class will shift to the next age class (40–100 years) within 5 years. Breaklands Breaklands represent about 33% of the project area and contain a combination of Douglas-fir and dry grand fir habitat types, mostly on south-facing Breaklands. Indirectly, the No Action alternative would lead to increased grand fir and Douglas-fir as mortality in long-lived, early seral species continues due to competition and insects. Douglas-fir would not necessarily become less prevalent on the driest sites (because the lack of moisture limits natural regeneration of other species). Growing space opened by the Douglas-fir beetle mortality over the last decade would likely become grand fir and Douglas-fir, as that is the only seed source. This would continue as other disturbance agents cause mortality. Even if fire were to create sites for regeneration of long-lived early seral species of ponderosa pine, western larch, and western white pine, the lack of seed source would greatly limit this regeneration. The effects on stand growth rate, canopy cover, vertical structure, old-growth development, and overall stand health and resilience would be the same as the effects described for the Uplands setting, above. General Trends Common to All Eco-settings under the No Action Alternative: • A substantial decrease in the young age class within the next 5 years • An increase in multi-storied, multi-aged stands within stand structure due to the effects of root disease and bark beetles resulting from a continued absence of fire • Continued increase of shade-tolerant cover types with the loss of shade-intolerant cover types • An increase in the amount of mature structure • A decrease in overall resistance, resilience, and response to ecological disturbance agents  Alternatives B, C, and D 3.9.6.1.2Overview of Vegetative Aspects of the Proposed Action The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (Sec. 4003(c)) directs that restoration proposals shall be based (in part) on restoration strategies that • incorporate the best available science and scientific application tools in ecological restoration strategies; • fully maintain, or contribute toward the restoration of, the structure and composition of old growth stands according to the pre-fire suppression old growth conditions characteristic of the forest type, taking into account the contribution of the stand to landscape fire adaptation and watershed health and retaining the large trees contributing to old growth structure; • would carry out any forest restoration treatments that reduce hazardous fuels by . focusing on small diameter trees, thinning, strategic fuel breaks, and fire use to modify fire behavior, as measured by the projected reduction of uncharacteristically severe wildfire effects for the forest type (such as adverse soil impacts, tree mortality or other impacts); and . maximizing the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fire-resilient stands The CFLRP program glossary defines Large Tree Retention as: Vegetation treatment methods applicable to areas outside of identified old-growth stands to maximize the retention of large trees in a manner that is appropriate for the forest type based on ecological characteristics and that will reduce uncharacteristically severe wildland fire effects with the treated area and reduce fire risk to communities, municipal water supplies, and at-risk Federal land (see also “Large Tree Retention” section of the HFRA/HFI Interim Guide). Table 3-27 displays the proposed vegetative management activities for each alternative, including activities proposed for Focus areas and activities proposed for other land within the project area. Table 3-27.

The majority of the proposed regeneration harvest areas occur in stand types dominated by fire intolerant species such as grand fir (Tables 3-28 and 3-29). Historically, the most common fire regimes of the habitat types and VRUs located within the project area were lethal burns and mixed-severity fire. The absence of fire for nearly a century has created homogenous stand conditions in most areas that increase the probability that an uncontrolled fire would burn on more of a lethal regime (see fuels report). Such a fire could potentially damage resources and threaten communities.  Table 3-28.

The resulting mosaic created through harvest will serve to provide “fences and corridors” that limit fire spread and are a key to landscape resilience (Mckenzie et al. 2011, Chapter 3). Structure classes in areas designed as full retention would not change, because the harvesting would not occur and incursions of prescribed fire into these areas would be minimal and classified as low-severity. All activities within the Focus areas were designed to create a disturbance pattern that is similar to the size and scale of what historically would have been a mixed-severity fire. The location of the Focus areas was intended to utilize the existing young forest and the existing transportation system in order to break up fuels and homogenous stand conditions along probable fire pathways. Regeneration harvest is used when stands have mortality rates that are higher than growth rates, either due to age or pathogens. Following harvest, stands receive site preparation and are reforested with long-lived early seral species that will increase resistance and resilience at the stand level and begin to trend the project area toward resistance and resilience. Management activities that favor resistant tree species on sites that are prone to or infected with root disease would be utilized (Rippy et al. 2005; Hagle 2006). Treatment priorities were based on DFCs and take into consideration the VRUs and habitat types, landscape species, and structure objectives of the project area. Components within harvest areas that meet overall objectives (desired conditions) would be retained; where not present they would be established. Variability will be substantial within treatment areas because the amount of retention would be based on available components (e.g., large trees, preferred species). Wildlife, fire/fuels, and visual concerns played a prominent part in maximizing retention on sites while trending the overall area toward the DFC. 3.9.6.2 Direct and Indirect Effects of the Alternatives Indicators focus on characteristics that contribute to forest health. Indicators are compared to the desired conditions. The desired conditions would trend the landscape toward increased ecological resistance and resilience to reasonably expected disturbances (e.g., fire, insects, disease, and weather). Analysis indicators are the same for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. Indicators to be discussed in this section include forest composition, age class, vertical structure, and patch size. Current conditions reflect all past natural disturbances and management activities, and while this discussion considers those current conditions, it will only specifically address the effects of the action alternatives.  Direct Effects at the Treatment Unit Scale 3.9.6.2.1Variable Retention Regeneration System Variable Retention Regeneration systems (clear-cut with reserves) would establish and grow site-adapted western larch, white pine, and ponderosa pine while maintaining available and healthy western larch and ponderosa pine and groups of other species. Silvicultural prescriptions will be designed for forest vegetation treatments that integrate fuel and other resource objectives. The treatment areas would resemble a mosaic of even-aged groups after harvest and planting activities are completed. In effect, these treatments are designed to mimic mixed-severity fires that create patches of forest structure, composition, and seral status (Perry et al. 2011). Overall residual tree retention would range between 14 and 28 tpa, based on a 12-inch dbh tree. Retention of biological legacy trees, both as individuals and small groups of trees and as undisturbed forest patches, is consistent with the goals of variable retention harvesting as described by Franklin et al. (1997) and Franklin and Johnson (2011a). Variable retention harvesting type methods have also been discussed in Graham and Jain (2005), Jain and Graham (2007), Franklin and Johnson (2010), Franklin and Johnson (2011), and Franklin et al. (1997). Silvicultural prescriptions will prescribe for the retention of large fire resilient trees. The best available representative western white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine would be retained to serve as shelter and, in some cases, a seed source. Some level of shelter is needed on harsh sites to ensure regeneration success. Where fire resilient species do not exist, other large tree species will be left to the extent that is consistent with other objectives (e.g. wildlife, snags, woody debris). In some areas, large trees of selected species that are not fire adapted may need to be removed to promote greater fire resiliency and achieve other objectives such as “fences and corridors”. Retained trees would remain over the long term for structure and would result in stands with two-storied vertical structure. Species composition would meet desired conditions following reforestation. Prescribed fire would be used to prepare sites and reduce shrub competition so that planted seedlings could be established. Prescribed fire would also reduce post-harvest fuel loading. See Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests Target Stands for Multiple Objectives in Appendix G. Intermediate Treatments An intermediate harvest is any treatment designed to enhance growth, quality, vigor or composition of the stand after regeneration but before final harvest (Helms, 1998). An intermediate harvest is not intended to regenerate anew stand, but to improve a developing stand. Some stand characteristics that indicate improved quality include, larger trees size, greater percentage of wood without knots, increase in percentage of preferred species, or reduction of ladder fuels. Clear creek intermediate treatments will not directly affect species composition, age class, or patch size at the unit scale. These treatments will, however, shift all the acres that have been treated to the single- or two-storied vertical structure.  Direct and Indirect Effects at the Resource Area Scale 3.9.6.2.2Forest Composition The project area is currently not within the desired range for forest composition. The composition within the project area is currently high in grand fir and red cedar and low in long-lived early seral species. Existing western larch would continue to decline due to inter-stand competition, while ladder fuels would continue to accumulate around existing ponderosa pine. The action alternatives would decrease the grand fir and red cedar dominance type and maintain/increase existing long-lived early seral species while reestablishing them in areas where they are currently underrepresented. Tables 3-29 and 3-30 represent the extent to which the action alternatives would shift species composition from the existing condition. Age Classes The action alternatives increase the younger age classes while slightly reducing the older age classes and maintaining the oldest age class. The oldest age class is currently well represented. Managing for long-term resistance and resilience within the project area would help maintain existing structure development into the older age classes. Table 3-30 depicts the shift in the young age class, as this is the only age class that can realistically be managed. The time frame for the direct effects to occur would be within 5–10 years. Based on this temporal scale, the analysis includes the existing condition (2012) and 5 years into the future, when implementation is expected to take place. This is an important distinction, as current condition for some VRUs would show they are well within the DFC for the young age class; however, after 5 years many of the acres in the young age class shift to the next age class (leaving them outside of the DFCs). Additionally, comments from the public during scoping expressed concern about a deficit of the very young (brush and seedling) stage. This deficit is a reality, as 1,575 acres of the project area are in the 0–19 age class. VRU 10 contains minimal activity acres, which are insignificant at the resource area and VRU scales and are not shown in Table 3-30. Table 3-30.

The vertical structure of the project area is well within desired condition. Vertical structure at this scale would not be changed by the action alternatives since all treatments would maintain a single- or two-storied vertical structure. Patch Size The desired condition strives for patch sizes from hundreds of acres up to 1,000 acres. Minimum patch sizes would be 50–500 acres, with variable retention and connectivity where possible. The current condition does not have patches of the desired size in any of the structural stages. Table 3-31 displays the shift in average patch size by successional stage. The action alternatives would decrease the later successional stages and increase early successional stages. The increase in patch size for the young-successional stage (stand initiation) would enable the establishment of long-lived early seral species where appropriate, which would increase long-term resilience and potential to desired patch sizes in the future. Locating regeneration treatments next to existing young forest leads to an increase in patch size among all of the structural classes. Table 3-31.

Commercial thinning is an intermediate harvest in which the primary goal is to improve growth rates in young, healthy stands by reducing crowding (USDA, 2008). The effects of commercial thinning are similar to the effects of improvement harvest. The trees that are removed during commercial thinning are large enough to provide valuable wood products, and the cost of commercial thinning is less than the value of the wood products that are removed (Helm, 1998). The objective for commercial thinning is to maintain and/or improve diameter/tree growth with stocking control. Alternative B proposes 2,240 acres of commercial thinning inside the Focus areas, Alternative C proposes 3,995 acres, and Alternative D proposes 2,017 acres. This management activity was designed to mimic an underburn as part of a mixed-severity fire disturbance pattern. Outside of the Focus areas, Alternatives B and C propose 3,366 acres of commercial thinning, and Alternative D proposes 3,144 acres. All action alternatives were designed to address the issue of stands not reaching the culmination of mean annual increment; the action alternatives take advantage of thinning opportunity while maintaining and improving stand growing conditions. Approximately 40%–60% of the overstory would be removed, leaving the largest, healthiest ponderosa pine, western larch, white pine, Douglas-fir, and grand fir. Treatment would result in a slight improvement in species composition compared to the No Action alternative but would not meet desired conditions. Stand structure would be much as it is now, with a reduction of the intermediate trees competing with the overstory. Fuel loading would be roughly the same, although canopy base height would be raised and canopy bulk density reduced. Mortality due to insects and disease would continue to change canopy and structure over the long term, with areas needing consideration for regeneration treatment in the next few decades. Gradual changes to growing space and conditions would favor regeneration of Douglas-fir and grand fir. Precommercial Thinning Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) is the removal of trees not for immediate financial return, but to improve growth rates for the more desirable remaining trees (Helms, 1998). Pre-commercial thinning is used in young stands of relatively small trees to reduce crowding which improves growth rates. Trees that are removed during pre-commercial thinning are usually too small to have commercial value. All action alternatives allocate the same amount of acreage for precommercial thinning. The effects would be similar to the effects of commercial thinning. Early seral species would be retained, improving species composition by reducing competition and improving growing space. Approximately 200–300 tpa would remain following treatment. Improvement Cutting An improvement harvest is an intermediate harvest that removes less desirable trees to improve the composition and quality of the remaining stand. Clear creek improvement harvest would be used in stands that include large, old ponderosa pine and western larch. These stands would be thinned from below and would remove smaller trees which are ladder fuels. Reducing crowding would maintain or improve the health of the remaining trees and would reduce the risk of wildfire mortality. Improvement cutting in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project is proposed in stands with an existing component of large, old ponderosa pine and western larch. In the absence of fire, these stands have substantial amounts of understory in-growth composed of grand fir and western redcedar. Improvement cutting would affect within-stand structure in much the same manner as a commercial thinning. The lower canopy would be reduced more than in a commercial thin, due to the focus on maintaining the large relic trees, reducing ladder fuels, and creating enough spacing to allow ground fire and prevent crown fire. This would increase the amount of air movement through the affected stands and increase the amount of sunlight reaching the forest floor relative to the existing condition of the stands. These two factors would increase the rate of drying of dead and down fuels during the summer months and may stimulate additional growth of understory herbs, shrubs, and shade-tolerant conifer regeneration. Slash and other dead and down fuels would be reduced through underburning following harvest. Underburning would also reduce ladder fuels, further increasing the distance between the ground and the base of the live overstory canopy. Improvement cutting typically increases the growth rate of the residual stand of trees. However, improvement cutting may also increase the rate of infection by root diseases in residual Douglas-fir and grand fir, because stumps and their attached root systems would become readily available for colonization by fungi that cause root disease. Included stands would have an even-aged overstory that may be uniformly distributed throughout the stand or may be clumpy and somewhat irregular where clumps of healthy white pine, western larch, or ponderosa pine are retained. Planting of ponderosa pine, western larch, and/or western white pine may occur wherever pre-harvest mortality has resulted in the development of small openings in the improvement cuts. This planting would improve the long-term species diversity of the overstory and the long-term resilience of the stand(s). Burning See fuels specialist report. Restoration Restoration is proposed on dry, upland grassland habitats and on moist inclusions (historically dominated by shrubs). Patch sizes are limited by aspect and coniferous vegetation. Invasive forbs and grasses have been introduced and are becoming dominant. Historically, very frequent (5- to 20-year intervals), low-severity fire maintained open grasslands and rejuvenated shrub habitats. Ponderosa pine and an occasional Douglas-fir occur incidentally. Restoration activities would include herbicide application and prescribed fire for site preparation, followed by seeding of native species. 3.9.6.3 Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis area will be the entire 65,000-acre Clear Creek watershed. This area includes federal, state, and private lands. Cumulative effects will be analyzed15 years after project implementation. Regeneration harvest areas would be certified stocked within 5 years. However, by 15 years, the stand would be moving out of the plantation seedling/sapling stage and establishing tree dominance at the sapling/pole stage. Past regeneration and intermediate timber harvests on the Forest were the only activities on federal lands considered for cumulative effects. No other present or foreseeable management activities on federal lands would affect vegetative composition, structure, arrangement, or disturbance types at the stand scale or at larger scales. Vegetative conditions on State and private lands were considered and reviewed using VMap. The Clear Creek watershed includes 24,235 acres of State or privately owned land, all of which is downstream from federal lands. Roughly 10,400 acres are in the grass or shrub cover type. The remainder is in a mixed grass/forest or forest cover type. Future timber harvest on forested private lands adjacent to the project area is expected. The Idaho Department of Lands (IDL) provided information regarding upcoming State and private harvest proposals. One private proposal involves harvest timber, but no acres were provided. The acres are expected to be small, since land ownership in the area appears as many houses on small (<100-acre) lots. The focus of harvesting on small, private ownerships is often salvage and/or partial harvest to remove dead/dying trees and/or trees of high economic value. In 2013, the IDL completed a 160-acre seed tree (regeneration) harvest directly adjacent to the Forest boundary and one of the proposed project harvest units (Unit 123). This harvest removed most of the trees and retained an average of 8 seed trees per acre.  Species Composition 3.9.6.3.1Alternative A—No Action The cumulative effect of this alternative would continue the long-term trends in loss of early seral species composition. This alternative would allow the continued decline of the remaining ponderosa pine and western larch present in these stands. Harvest activities on private and State lands would not contribute toward the establishment of early seral species, since both rely on natural regeneration to restock the stands. Shade-tolerant grand fir, cedar, and Douglas-fir typically regenerate on these sites. Alternatives B, C, and D All of the action alternatives trend the project area toward the DFC by creating openings large enough to establish long-lived early seral species at a scale that is large enough to measure. Alternative C trends toward the desired conditions the most, while Alternative D trends the least. Harvest activities on private and State lands would not contribute toward the establishment of early seral species, since both rely on natural regeneration to restock the stands. Shade-tolerant grand fir, cedar, and Douglas-fir typically regenerate on these sites. Therefore, no cumulative effects would occur at the analysis area scale.  Age Class 3.9.6.3.2Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no effect on age class in the project area. The area would continue to be dominated by mid- and late-seral shade-tolerant species with a lack of young structure. Insects and disease would continue to be the major agents of change, resulting in multi-aged stands with continuous ladder fuels. Harvest on State lands increase the young age class by 160 acres, which at the analysis scale would have no measurable effect. Since no federal activities are proposed under this alternative, no cumulative effects to age class would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D The action alternatives increase the younger age classes while reducing the mature age classes and maintaining the oldest age class. The oldest age class is currently well represented. Managing for long-term resistance and resilience within the project area would help maintain existing structures develop into the older age classes. Placement of the proposed regeneration treatments next to existing stands of young forest helps trend the analysis area toward the desired condition. Regeneration harvest on state land adds 0.2% toward the DFC for younger age class.  Vertical Structure 3.9.6.3.3Alternative A—No Action Although the vertical structure of the resource area is well within desired condition, the stands proposed for regeneration treatment are in the stem exclusion phase. They are currently transitioning into the understory reinitiation and a multilayer condition due to age and natural change agents. The No Action alternative would ultimately result in an area dominated by stands with continuous vertical structure, causing the area to eventually fall out of the range for DFCs. Alternatives B, C, and D All the action alternatives would continue to maintain the desired range for single- and two-storied stand conditions through regeneration, intermediate harvest, and precommercial thinning. Regeneration harvest on State lands would also maintain these conditions. Cumulatively, a slight positive effect to vertical structure would occur.  Patch Size 3.9.6.3.4Alternative A—No Action This alternative retains the existing patch sizes, which are and would remain, on average, small and fragmented. No activities are proposed that would alter patch size on federal lands. The 160-acre IDL harvest would not contribute to increases in patch size on federal lands. Since no activities are proposed under this alternative, no cumulative effects to patch size would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D All action alternatives increase average patch size across all structural stages and reduce the number of patches overall within the area. All action alternatives trend the area toward the DFC by increasing patch size of existing older forest and increasing the representation of long-lived early seral species in new large patches. The harvesting on State land would contribute only slightly to increasing patch size in the cumulative effects analysis area by creating new openings adjacent to existing openings. 3.10 VISUALS The Clear Creek Integrated Resources Project area of interest is located in the rolling uplands to the south of the Lochsa River canyon between the South Fork of the Clearwater River drainage to the west and the Selway River Drainage to the east. The area of interest is approximately 5 miles from the community of Kooskia, Idaho. Treatment areas are located to the south of Forest Road (FR) 286 and north of FR 284, also known as the Elk City Wagon Road. The Clear Creek project proposes management activities including prescribed fire, commercial and pre-commercial thinning, reforestation, and timber harvest to achieve more healthy and resilient vegetation across the landscape. These activities are designed to create a landscape that exhibits more natural disturbance patterns. Also included in the project are road decommissioning, culvert replacement, and road activities designed to improve watershed health. Vegetative diversity improvements will not be limited to coniferous vegetation, approximately 41 acres of bunch grass communities are proposed for restoration through re-vegetation with native grasses and forbs. Planned activities would be visible in foreground, middleground and background views from Forest Road 286 and Forest Road 284 which are identified as visual travel corridors in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan. Also within the area of interest is the Lookout Butte Lookout which is utilized as a recreation rental during the summer season. Corral Hill Lookout and Trails 130, 728, 723, 139, 150, and 151, are designated in the Forest Plan as travel corridors or use areas and have mixed levels of recreation use associated with them. This report analyzes the visual impacts of the proposed management activities and determines whether the activities would meet Forest Plan standards for scenic quality. Visual simulation techniques are used to analyze these visual impacts. Numerous viewpoints were reviewed to determine the short and long term impacts to scenery within the resource area.  Analysis Area 3.10.1The geographic scope of the scenery analysis for the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project includes areas visible from key locations both within and outside the area of interest. Table 3-33 lists all key viewpoints or viewing corridors and their sensitivity levels identified in the 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Plan which are relevant to the Clear Creek Project scenic quality analysis. Direct and indirect effects analysis focuses on the viewshed within which the proposed activities can be seen from these viewpoints, and the extent proposed treatment units affect the Visual Quality Objectives (VQOs) assigned to that piece of ground. The cumulative effects area is similar to that for the direct and indirect effects, except that it takes into account the whole viewshed, as opposed to focusing on the individual units and surrounding area. The temporal scope of the analysis is limited to the 25–30 years following harvest activities—the length of time openings created by regeneration harvest are likely to be evident.  Regulatory Framework 3.10.2The 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan provides standards and guidelines for scenic quality for the Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests within the area of interest (Table 3-32). The desired condition for scenic quality within the area of interest would be to retain the existing landscape character and maintain the designated visual quality objectives of partial retention, modification, and maximum modification from travel corridors and use areas. The foreground viewing zone of FR 284 and 286 and the trails listed below have the VQO of partial retention (Table 3-32) while several minor trails have VQO of modification in the foreground. Table 3-32.

Specific visual resource management direction is provided by the 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Plan and is described in terms of Visual Quality Objectives (VQO). Forest Plan VQO standards and guidelines were based on the Visual Management System described in Agriculture Handbook Number 462, National Forest Landscape Management, Volume 2 (PF-Doc. PI-R02). The visual management system was revised in 1995, and is now known as the Scenery Management System. The revised guidelines are provided in Agricultural Handbook 701, Landscape Aesthetics: A Handbook for Scenery Management (USDA Forest Service, 1995; PF Doc. VIS-R01). VQOs provide measurable standards for scenery management in conjunction with demands for goods and services from the forest. Scenic resource management is integral to all management areas and implied in all management goals. The Forest Plan standard relevant to the Clear Creek visual resources are: • Meet adopted visual quality objectives (VQOs). • The visual resource has been evaluated based on visual sensitivity levels assigned to travel routes, use areas, and water bodies. The analysis considers the character and appearance of the surrounding natural landscape and the VQOs of areas proposed for treatments as assigned under the current Forest Plan. VQOs are a desired level of scenic quality and diversity of natural features based on physiological and sociological characteristics of an area, and refers to the degree of acceptable alterations of the landscape Management activities such as commercial timber harvest, prescribed burning, and road construction can alter the scenic character of the landscape. There is a potential concern that activities proposed under the action alternatives could adversely affect visual resources to the extent that the Visual Quality Objectives (VQOs) established by the current Forest Plan (1987) would not be met. Effects to the visual resource are discussed in general terms; however, the indicator used to measure effects would be whether or not VQOs are achieved (Table 3-33). Visual Quality Objectives are listed in Table 3-32 for the Clear Creek Project. Below is a brief description of each objective level. • Preservation: In general, human activities are not detectable to the visitor. • Retention: Human activities are not evident to the casual Forest visitor. • Partial Retention: Human activities may be evident, but must remain subordinate to the character of the landscape. • Modification: Human activities may dominate the characteristic of the landscape but must, at the same time, utilize naturally established form, line, color, and texture. • Maximum Modification: Human activity may dominate the characteristic landscape, but should appear as natural occurrences when viewed as background. Scenic resources are managed using the Visual Management System (VMS) which specifies the Visual Quality Objectives (VQOs) for designated areas. VQOs are based on the area seen from sensitive viewpoints such as travel corridors and other features where there may be a high visual sensitivity level. Table 3-33.

VIS-R02) has been replaced by the Scenery Management System (PF Doc. VIS-R01), this analysis uses terminology used in the Forest Plan which was developed and written under the former. A crosswalk between the two systems is found in Agricultural Handbook 701, Appendix A (PF Doc. VIS-R01). A variety of tools were used in the visual resource analysis including analyzing VQO maps and visibility modeling. Treatment units and their associated VQOs were evaluated in relation to visually sensitive viewpoints to determine the extent to which proposed activities would likely be seen, and the likelihood that those activities would adversely affect VQOs. VQO maps prepared under the Forest Plan are very general in nature. Scenic class and sensitivity level can provide a general understanding; however, the maps can’t always illustrate how visible specific treatments would be from locations of concern, or the extent to which treatments are likely to stand out or blend with existing scenic features. Points on VOQ maps with direct line of site to treatment units were identified. Units were observed from these locations, using unit maps. Units are found in the foreground, middleground, and in the background when viewed from key viewpoints. To assist in determining unit visibility, the analysis utilized Google Earth (Google Inc. 2012). Treatment units for each alternative were imported into Google Earth and draped over the landscape. Units were then viewed from ground-level or “street view” at a variety of representative sensitive locations, including: Forest Road 286, 284, Lookout Butte Lookout, Corral Hill Lookout, and Trails 723, 728, 130, 150, 151 and 197. This 3-D modeling gives a different perspective on how visible a given area is from a specific geographic location. A limitation of using Google Earth for determining visibility is that near view screening from adjacent trees cannot be taken into consideration; for instance, if you are on a trail or road, the 3-D imaging cannot place you down amongst the trees, where your view might be obscured by trees and other vegetation in the foreground. After establishing relative sensitivity of affected areas when viewed from key viewpoints, Agricultural Handbooks 462 and 701 were used as references to determine if proposed activities were likely to modify the landscape to the extent that visual quality objectives could not be met.  Affected Environment 3.10.5The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project is located in the Columbia Rockies Subregion, within the Bitterroot Mountain Range. The existing landscape character is one of rolling hills, deep canyons, and mixed conifer vegetation. These features are commonly found throughout the Middle and South Fork of the Clearwater drainages and their tributaries. The vegetation is continuous coniferous cover consisting mostly of late seral, non-fire resistant mixed conifer and lodgepole pine forests. There are some areas of rock outcrops and some natural vegetative openings, but these elements are a minor component of the landscape character. Broad views of the rolling hills are commonly found along FR 286. Much of the vegetative cover shows evidence of aging and disease. Within the viewshed of the FR 286 the rolling hills have numerous man-made openings in various stages of regeneration. There are a number of recreation activities that occur within the Clear Creek drainage including dispersed camping, motorized and non-motorized trail use, driving for pleasure, berry picking, and firewood gathering. Lookout Butte Rental Lookout is a popular destination. To the south of the project area is the Elk City Wagon Road and the route of the Southern Nez Perce Trail. Located adjacent to the Elk City Wagon Road is the Corral Hill Lookout. The Elk City Wagon Road route is heavily vegetated, allowing few views north toward the project area. Minor trail segments are found throughout the area of interest, but the most popular destinations for trail use are found in the central portion of the Middle Fork of Clear Creek drainage. Bisecting the area west to east are Trails 728, 130 and 151. These trails follow the ridgeline above Clear Creek and have view into the drainage. Trail 723 is found in the canyon of Clear Creek and Trail 150 is found east of the South Fork of Clear Creek. The Clear Creek area is easily accessed by local residents of Kooskia and other small communities along FR 286. Access from the Elk City Clearwater area is more difficult, with travel over FR 284 which is generally only suitable for high clearance all-wheel drive vehicles. Within the central portion of the area of interest is the Clear Creek Roadless Area which has the theme backcountry restoration. While there is evidence of past harvest activities and manmade improvements, these modifications do not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the existing visual quality objectives of partial retention, modification and maximum modification. Areas of vegetative mortality within the existing vegetation do affect the scenic nature of the canyon area.  Environmental Consequences 3.10.6All alternatives in this project will meet the Nez Perce National Forest Land Management Plan Visual Quality Objectives. 3.10.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects  Alternative A 3.10.6.1.1There would be no direct or short-term affects to the scenic condition of the area since no harvest activities would occur. The openings in forest cover that are visible as a result of past forest management would continue to recover tree growth, and overtime would recover unnatural appearing openings. Processes affecting forest dynamics would continue, including continuing insect and disease related mortality. The amount of dead and diseased coniferous vegetation would continue to increase. While for some this may have a negative impact on the scenic quality of the area, these are considered natural processes therefore the resource area would continue to meet assigned VQOs.  Alternative B 3.10.6.1.2Alternative B proposes to modify the existing vegetation through harvesting and burning activities to improve forest health, improve wildlife habitat and reduce the fire hazard. Activities will be grouped in “focus areas” where use of “variable retention” techniques will be used to improve patch size, increase the amount of early seral forest and replant with a mix of species that would improve the long-term resilience of these stands. Healthy stands would be commercially thinned, while stands where root disease was detected would be deferred. The project proposes to treat approximately 8546 acres of the area of interest using regeneration harvest (2,609 acres), improvement harvest (331 acres), and commercial thinning (5,606 acres). Approximately36.3 miles of temporary road will be needed to complete this alternative including 8.7 miles of temporary road on existing templates and 27.6 miles of new construction. This analysis is mainly concerned with the landscape that can be observed from viewpoints identified in the Forest Plan. Proposed activities that are blocked from these viewpoints by terrain are considered to be in compliance with VQOs. Proposed management actions that have concern from a scenic resource standpoint are evaluated for how they conform to naturally occurring features that exist or could be created by natural events. Many of the proposed management features have short term visual effects, but would not have long term effects on the overall landscape character of the area of interest. The management activities proposed for the Clear Creek area are located within the middleground and background viewsheds of Forest Roads 286 and 284, Lookout Butte Rental Lookout, Corral Hill Lookout, and Trails 130, 150, 151, 723 and 728. Although not included in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan, the area is also visible from several minor trails found throughout the Clear Creek drainage. Most of the proposed units would be visible from one or more of the viewpoints found within and surrounding the area of interest. View from Forest Road 286 For the most part, views of the area of interest are screened by vegetation and topography for this major access road. There are some viewpoints where there are limited views of the area. Near unit 101 retain vegetative screening to protect views of unit 101 in the foreground in the northwest portion of the area of interest. In the northeastern portion middleground views of units 108, 109, 122, 126, and 130 would meet the VQO of Modification from the roadway. These units will remove vegetation that is adjacent to past harvest units reducing some of the straight edges of those existing openings. The new opening will be larger, but will have the appearance of a natural opening created by fire or other natural event. View from Lookout Butte Lookout Rental The only harvest activities in the foreground views of the lookout are commercial thinning, which will retain the majority of the canopy cover and should not appear as openings. In the middleground view are a number of regeneration harvest units. Units 103, 109 and 114 will be seen along several of the ridgelines, but should be viewed from the side so that the edges are not as apparent. With edge feathering and some retention of vegetative structure these openings should meet the VQO of modification in the middleground. Unit 159 to the northwest of the lookout is a large unit that borders past harvest units. The boundary of the unit follows natural breaks where possible, and even though large in size still is within the scale of existing natural openings created by fire events. There are also natural rock outcrops in this unit that will increase the natural appearance of the opening. Thinning in unit 307 can be increased along the boundary with Unit 159 also to create a more natural edge. Views from Trails The trails with the highest sensitivity level are found to the north and south of the South Fork Clear Creek drainage. They include Trails 728, 130 and 150. VQOs in the foreground from these trails are partial retention and modification/max. modification in the middleground. These trails are found on either side of the drainage and are within the Clear Creek Roadless Area. For the most part these trails are screened with vegetation and topography from the proposed harvest activities, but there are some areas where there are viewpoints. Units adjacent to Trail 155 to the south of Trail 130 can be seen from limited viewpoints in the middleground, but there are no proposed harvest activities adjacent to these trails except for the commercial thinning Unit 122. Vegetation within the immediate foreground of the trail should be retained, but commercial thinning should not alter the viewshed and would therefor meet the VQO of partial retention in the foreground. Design measures of edge feathering and retention of stand structure in Units 122 and 130 would meet the criteria for modification in the middleground for these trails. Views from Corral Hill Lookout A number of the focus areas for vegetative treatment can be seen from Corral Hill Lookout. Units 134 and 135 can be seen in the close middleground viewshed. Treatment of the edges and retention of some stand structure will be critical to retain the natural appearance of these openings. Units 101–103 will appear in the far middleground view. These units will harvest several ridgelines above clear creek. Edge feathering will be critical to maintain the appearance of natural openings in the far middleground viewshed. Units 150–154 will appear as one large opening to the northeast of the lookout in the middleground view. Units 147–149 can be seen in the background view of the lookout. The large improvement cut, 505 will also be visible from this lookout. Commercial thinning units throughout the area of interest are also seen from this viewpoint. The appearance from this viewpoint will be changed from the existing condition, but with design measures, openings will emulate natural processes and will reduce the existing straight edges of past harvest activities. Overall there will be significant changes to the visual appearance of the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries. Most proposed units are located adjacent to past harvest areas and will be designed to emulate the visual appearance of past fire activity or other natural openings. With design measures to reduce the man-made appearance of proposed openings, these focus areas will be returned to a more resilient vegetative cover with appropriate seral species and age class mix. Temporary Road Building There are 36.3 miles of temporary road building proposed in Alternative B. Of that total, 8.7 miles of temporary road will be built on existing road templates and should have minor visual impacts. The remaining 27.6 miles will be new construction. There will be some visual affect when these roads are constructed, but all of the new construction will only be evident in the middleground viewshed and will meet the VQOs of Modification and Maximum Modification for those areas.  Alternative C 3.10.6.1.3Alternative C also proposes to modify the existing vegetation through harvesting and burning activities to improve forest health, improve wildlife habitat and reduce the fire hazard. This alternative proposes to use regeneration harvest rather than commercial thinning in areas that may be experience disease outbreaks. This alternative proposes to treat approximately 8,707 acres of the area of interest using regeneration harvest (4,156 acres), improvement harvest (331 acres), and commercial thinning (4,220). Temporary road construction of 36.3 miles will be the same as proposed in Alternative B. Harvesting and burning activities in Alternative C will have greater impacts to the visual resource than Alternative B. Twenty-five of the commercial thinning units proposed in Alternative B will be regeneration units in Alternative C. The change is most evident from Corral Hill Lookout. But can also be seen from Lookout Butte Lookout also. The close middleground views will have larger and more numerous large openings requiring design measures of edge feathering and retention of stand structure to maintain the VQO of modification in the middleground. The viewshed from Trail 728 and Trail 150 will be affected near Units 139–141. Commercial thinning units within this focus area will become regeneration units. Unit 221 which is immediately adjacent to trail 150 will now be a regeneration unit. Retention of vegetative screening will be required to maintain the VQO of partial retention in the foreground from this trail. Edge treatment and careful retention of stand structure through the remainder of the units will be needed to maintain the natural appearance of the area in order to meet the VQO of partial retention from these trails.  Alternative D 3.10.6.1.4Alternative D proposes harvest of the existing vegetation through harvesting and burning activities to improve forest health, improve wildlife habitat and reduce the fire hazard, but uses more commercial thinning rather than regeneration harvest proposed in either Alternative A or B. This alternative proposes to treat approximately 7.530 acres of the area of interest using regeneration harvest (2,178 acres), improvement harvest (211 acres), and commercial thinning (5,141). Temporary road construction is proposed to be 17.5 miles to reduce effect on wildlife and water resources. Harvesting and burning activities in Alternative D will have the fewer impacts on the scenic quality of the Clear Creek drainage and its associated recreation facilities as Alternative B or C. The number of regeneration harvest units will be reduced by eleven from Alternative B and by 36 from Alternative C. There will also be fewer miles of temporary road building with a reduction from approximately 36 to 17 miles of temporary roads. 3.10.6.2 Cumulative Effects  Alternative A 3.10.6.2.1There would be no change in the scenic quality of the area of interest under Alternative A in the short term, but the risk of wildfire would increase with time. The existing openings would continue to regenerate and within 10 to 15 years would no longer appear as openings. The potential for wildfire would remain. Alternative A would not change the landscape character of the geographic area encompassed within the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries.  Alternative B 3.10.6.2.2Since the 1970s there have been timber harvest activities throughout the drainage. Evidence of these activities is visible, but does not dominate the existing landscape character of rolling hills with continuous coniferous vegetation. Past harvesting is in various stages of regrowth, with many areas no longer having the appearance of an opening. There are a number of openings to the within the Clear Creek area of interest that still appear as opening, but they have young plantations that will continue to mature and will no longer appear as an opening within 10 to 15 years. There is some evidence of past burning activities, but they are minimal and will only have an impact in the short term. Within 5 years these activities will no long be visible. The proposal would blend existing units with the proposed units, emulating the appearance of areas that have undergone changes through the natural processes of fire and insect and disease. Thinning is proposed for the previously harvested area, designed to blend into the proposed harvest areas so that unnatural geometric openings are not created. Given the aspect and growing history of the area, the openings created by this proposal would no long appear as openings within 25–30 years, but should appear as an area that has experienced the natural process of wild fire rather than man-made openings.  Alternative C 3.10.6.2.3The cumulative effects in Alternative C will be more visually apparent than Alternative B. This will be especially evident from the Corral Hill Lookout and from Trail 150 and 728.  Alternative D 3.10.6.2.4The cumulative effects in Alternative D will be the less than either Alternative B or C. Regeneration harvesting will be reduced and temporary road building will be reduced in this alternative. 3.10.6.3 Effects Determination to the Resource Indicator for All Action Alternatives Past activities are in various stages of re-vegetation, with young timber stands blending in with more mature vegetation. Past activities have utilized harvest methods that left little stand structure within the harvest areas and most areas do have geometric appearance that emphasizes the man-made opening. Past activities either no long appears as openings or are small enough that they do not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the Forest Plan Standards for Visual Quality Objectives. Proposed activities under all action alternatives will reduce the visual effects of those unnatural openings and openings will be natural appearing in the middle and background viewshed so they will not dominate the existing landscape character and therefore meet the Forest Plan Standards for Visual Quality Objectives. The effects of temporary road building will be minimal, since most will not be visible (Table 3-34). Table 3-34. Summary Comparison of How the Alternatives Address the Key Issues for Visuals Issue Indicator/ Measure Alternative A No Action Alternative B Proposed Action Alternative C Alternative D Meeting VQOs Will meet VQO, but the scenic character of the area will continue to be affected by increases in dead and dying vegetation due to insect and disease. The area will also be susceptible to catastrophic wildfire. Although activities will be visible, the harvest and burning proposed will meet the VQO of partial retention in the foreground, modification, and Modification/Max. Modification in the middleground and background. Temporary roads will be visible but will not dominate the existing landscape character. Design measures will be needed for some units to maintain the natural appearance of the area. Harvest activities will have the greater effect on the scenic character of the area. Trail 150 and 728 will have regeneration harvest activity within the foreground viewing zone. Design measures will be critical to maintain the natural appearance of the viewshed especially in the foreground and near middleground views from critical travel corridors and use areas. Harvest activities will have less impact to the scenic resources that alternative B or C. Regeneration harvest and temporary road building have been reduced in this alternative. Design measures will still be needed to maintain the VQO objectives in foreground and near middleground viewsheds from critical travel corridors and use areas.  3.10.6.4 Effects Common to All Action Alternatives Pre-commercial Thinning In all action alternatives 1,887 acres are proposed for pre-commercial thinning. The activities outlined for pre-commercial thinning will retain the majority of canopy cover within those harvest units and would there have no long-term effect on the scenic quality of the analysis area. Grass Restoration In all action alternatives 41 acres are proposed for restoration of native grasses and forbs. This proposal would rehabilitate the area and would therefore have a positive long term effect on the scenic quality of that landscape. Fuels Treatment 1,371 acres of prescribed fire are proposed in all action alternatives. The effect of these activities will appear as a natural occurring event and although the burns will change the appearance of the landscape they will appear as a natural process. These activities will meet the scenic quality objectives for the area of interest. Transportation System There is no new road construction proposed in this project. There are 119.8 miles of road reconstruction, 48.8 miles of road reconditioning, and 13.2 miles of road decommissioning proposed in all action alternatives. There may be some short term effects from ground disturbance related to these activities, but the effect will be limited to the existing road template and its immediate surroundings. The scenic impact of these activities will be minimal and will not affect the scenic quality of the area. 3.10.6.5 Compliance with Forest Plan and Other Relevant Laws, Regulations, Policies and Plans This area currently meets the Nez Perce National Forest Plan Visual Quality Objectives of Partial Retention in the foreground and Modification/Max. Modification in the middle and background viewing zones from all identified viewpoints and viewing corridors. Although there are currently harvest units that appear as openings they do not dominate the existing landscape character of the area. 3.11 WATERSHED This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on water quality and quantity. This section was summarized from the “Clear Creek Restoration Project Watershed Report,” located in the project record.  Analysis Area 3.11.1The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project encompasses 43,730 acres within the greater 58,990 acre Clear Creek watershed (HUC 10 #1706030401). Clear Creek is a tributary to the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The direct and indirect effect areas for sediment yield, water yield, ECA, and road density indicators are the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds located within the project area. Water yield, ECA, and road densities were also analyzed for the three HUC 12 subwatersheds within the project area: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Lower Clear Creek. The cumulative effects area for all indicators is the Clear Creek watershed (HUC 10).  Regulatory Framework 3.11.2Nez Perce Forest Plan direction and all federal and State laws and regulations applicable to watershed resources would be applied to the Clear Creek project, including the Clean Water Act, Idaho Water Quality Standards, Idaho Forest Practices Act, Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act, and EOs 11988 and 11990, and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (SWCP) Handbook, FSH 2509.22. The Clear Creek project was designed to comply with these directions and water quality conditions would be improved or maintained following project activities. Streams would continue to support beneficial uses. 3.11.2.1 Nez Perce National Forest Plan Forest standards for water resources are found in the Nez Perce National Forest Plan on pages II-21 through II-22 and Appendix A (USDA Forest Service 1987a) and are shown in Table 3-35. The Forest Plan was amended in 1995, following a joint decision (commonly called PACFISH) by the U.S. Forest Service and BLM for managing anadromous fish-producing watersheds on federal lands (Forest Plan Amendment 20). This amendment also includes direction for restoration opportunities and cooperation with other agencies and individuals. For the Clear Creek project, RHCAs are considered no-cut stream buffers and are excluded from harvest activities. RHCA widths that were established exceed State stream management zone requirements. Forest Plan standards for water quality apply to this project, and compliance would be achieved via field reviews, effects analyses, project design features, and BMP implementation. Table 3-35.

Included in these standards are provisions for identifying beneficial uses, establishing the status of beneficial uses, setting water quality criteria, and establishing BMPs to control nonpoint sources of pollution. EO 12088 also requires the Forest Service to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act. Section 313 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state, interstate, and local requirements with respect to control and abatement of water pollution, and to cooperate with relevant processes and sanctions and administrative authority. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act stipulates that states must identify and prioritize water bodies that are water quality limited (i.e., water bodies that do not meet water quality standards). For waters identified on this list, states must develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL) for the pollutants, set at a level to achieve water quality standards. No streams in the project area are listed for pollutants in the EPA-approved 303(d)/305(b) 2012 Integrated Report (IDEQ 2014). Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires permits to dredge or fill within waters of the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers these provisions. Culvert removal and replacement activities proposed under the Clear Creek project would require authorization under section 404, through application of either nationwide or site-specific permits. 3.11.2.3 Idaho Water Quality Standards EPA regulations require each state to adopt an antidegradation policy as one component of its water quality standards. The objective of the Idaho Anti-degradation Policy is, at a minimum, to maintain and protect existing instream water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses (IDAPA 16.012501.01). Beneficial uses and water quality criteria and standards are identified in the Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements (IDAPA 58.01.02, IDAPA 37.03.02). 3.11.2.4 Idaho Forest Practices Act This legislation regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01). These rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. 3.11.2.5 Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act This legislation regulates stream channel alterations between mean high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho. Instream activities on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act (IDAPA 37.03.07). These rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. 3.11.2.6 Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 These orders provide for protection and management of floodplains and wetlands.  Resource Indicators 3.11.33.11.3.1 Water Quality and Quantity The balance of water yield and sediment yield in a watershed influences the water quality/quantity of a stream system. Water yield refers to stream flow quantity and timing and is a function of water, soil, and vegetation interactions. Changes in amount or distribution of vegetation can affect water yield and ultimately alter stream channel conditions. Although there are no Federal, State of Idaho, or Forest Plan standards governing increases in water yield, there is general guidance on thresholds (NOAA 1998, Gerhardt 2000, USDA Forest Service 1973). Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) analysis is a tool used to correlate the relationship between water yield and the extent of forest canopy openings from fire, harvest, and roads. Active erosion of the landscape yields sediment to streams and occurs naturally. When an excess of sediment—that is, over the natural (balanced) amount—is delivered to a stream, the stream’s ability to route the sediment out of the system is diminished, and water quality is reduced. Harvest, temporary road construction, prescribed fire, and road-related activities have the potential to increase erosion production and sediment delivery into streams. Roads influence both water quantity and quality. Roads concentrate surface water and are a source of sediment entering streams. Watershed road densities >3 miles per square mile (mi/mi2) are categorized as low condition (i.e., poor conditions for watershed resources) (NOAA 1998). Resource Indicators: • Percent increase in ECA for HUC10 and HUC12 watersheds (compare to thresholds in NOAA 1998) • Percent increase in ECA for Forest Plan Prescription watersheds (compare to guidance limiting increase in ECA to 20-25%, Gerhardt 2000) • Percent increase in average annual water yield for HUC10 and Forest Plan Prescription watersheds • Percent sediment yield increased over base (natural), as modeled by NEZSED (for HUC 10 and Forest Plan Prescription watersheds) • Reduction in watershed road miles (HUC 5, HUC 6, Forest Plan Prescription watersheds  Analysis Methodology 3.11.4The watershed analysis was completed at different scales based on designation of Strahler stream order. Stream order is a term used to characterize the branching of a drainage system. A first order stream is a perennial, mapable, unbranched tributary. A second order stream is formed when two unbranched first order channels join together, and continues as a second order stream until it meets another second order channel to become a third order channel, or enters a third order or higher channel as a side drainage. The term “headwaters” are often used to refer to first and second order streams. Forest Plan prescription watersheds are generally 3rd to 5th order streams. USGS watersheds are part of the Watershed Boundary Dataset and the different levels are based on the number of digits in their Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). This analysis will focus on the Clear Creek HUC10 and the three HUC12s: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek and Lower Clear Creek. GIS-generated reports and maps, aerial photos, and field reviews were used to analyze effects to water quality and quantity from the Clear Creek proposed activities. Resource condition observations were conducted in the field during 2011 and 2012. Headwater channels, ephemeral swales, and springs/seeps in the proposed treatment units and downstream of them were examined and recorded on a map. Forest stand database (FSVeg) queries were conducted to identify past harvest activities and the time frame during which they occurred (see project file). Information from the Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2011a) and from the Clear Creek Watershed NFMA Assessment (2012) was used to develop the existing condition and cumulative effects evaluation. Several analysis tools and models were utilized to calculate resource indicator values in in order to compare to threshold levels. Models were used to provide estimates, not absolutes, for comparison of alternatives. Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) analysis is a tool used to index the relationship between vegetation condition and water yield from forested watersheds. The ECA model evaluates vegetation removal and the resulting potential changes to stream flow, timing, and water yield. The ECA analysis for this project utilized treatment and recovery coefficients from Ager and Clifton (2005) to determine existing and percent increase in ECA at the HUC10, HUC12, and Forest Plan Prescription watershed scales. Because harvest and burn history were not available for private or state lands, size and date of forest openings were determined using NAIP imagery in ArcGIS and Google Earth software. The ECA model was developed in Region 1 of the Forest Service to analyze the effects of timber harvest and road construction on average annual water yield. The method was developed in the early 1970s by research scientists and several Region 1 Forest Service hydrologists and culminated in the publication Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA Forest Service 1973). Early guidance for vegetation management recommended that ECA not exceed 20-25% in third to fifth order drainages (Silvey 1973). Stream orders for HUC10, HUC12, and Forest Plan Prescription watersheds are displayed in Table 3-36. When the ECA model was developed and during the time that many paired watershed studies on clearcut harvesting were conducted, general forest practices included clearcutting with no retention trees; larger harvest units; distinct, linear unit edges; harvest right up to stream channels; higher severity slash removal burns (site prep); and different Best Management Practices than are used today. Studies by Belt (1980) and King (1989) have served as field tests of the ECA procedure. Belt concluded that the ECA procedure is a rational tool for evaluation of hydrologic impacts of forest practices on third to fifth order drainages, which are typically similar in size or smaller than current HUC12 subwatersheds. King recommended local calibration of the model and a greater emphasis on conditions in first and second order headwater streams. The Matrix of Pathways and Indicators of Watershed Condition for Chinook, Steelhead, and Bull Trout is an analysis tool adopted by federal agencies to describe the condition and function of many watershed processes (NOAA1998). ECA is one of several indicators used in the matrix. High quality habitat is associated with ECA of less than 15% in a HUC10 watershed and all internal HUC12 subwatersheds, moderate quality is associated with 15-20% ECA in HUC10 watersheds, with one or more internal HUC12 subwatersheds at 15-30% ECA, and low quality is associated with ECA of greater than 20% in a HUC10 watershed, with one or more internal HUC12 watersheds at greater than 30%. Increases in average annual water yield for the HUC10 and Forest Plan prescription watersheds were calculated for Alternative C using formulas and graphs from Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973). A Rosgen classification was determined for each of the evaluated streams and sensitivity to disturbance ratings and associated recovery potential ratings were assigned (Rosgen 1994 and Rosgen and Silvey 1996). The streams were also evaluated using the Stream Reach Inventory and Channel Stability Evaluation Guide (USDA FS 1975, Pfankuch 1975). It was used to determine how resistant streams are to recent flow forces exerted on them and the capacity of streams to adjust and recover from potential changes in flow and/or increases in sediment production. USGS StreamStats was utilized to compute ungagged stream flow information and stream reach information. The Disturbed WEPP erosion model (Elliot et. al. 2000), and WEPP:Road (Elliot et al. 1999) were used to predict the level of erosion and sediment delivery produced from hypothetical “average” harvest, prescribed burning, temporary road construction and road improvement activities. The WEPP model is designed to predict sediment yield resulting from various forest management activities and the probability of sediment delivery, erosion, and runoff. The values obtained from the hypothetical “average” activities was used to determine the magnitude of difference between activities and incorporated into the upward trend analysis (Appendix J). The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield over base (natural) conditions to determine if thresholds from Forest Plan Appendix A would be exceeded. The use of the model is a Forest Plan standard and is useful for comparing alternatives. The NEZSED model was derived from the R1/R4 Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields from Forested Watersheds (USDA Forest Service 1981). The methodology for using the NEZSED model and the model’s limitations are described in detail in the Forest’s guidance document, Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Sediment yield is calculated in tons per year and reported as “percent increase over base” conditions. Sediment yield is calculated for base conditions (without management activities), current conditions (cumulative of past and existing management activities combined with base conditions), and predicted conditions (cumulative of past, existing, and proposed activities combined with base conditions) for each of the proposed project alternatives. These percentages of sediment yield over base conditions are then compared to the sediment yield guidelines for prescription watersheds listed in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. Modeling was done on a peak year basis in order to meet the assumptions under which Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan was developed. It is highly unlikely, however, that all of the activities proposed would occur in a single year. Additional information about the models used in this analysis and limitations can be found in the project file.  Affected Environment 3.11.53.11.5.1 Watershed Descriptions The Clear Creek project area (43,730 acres) is encompassed by the Clear Creek watershed (HUC 10), which flows into the Middle Fork Clearwater River. The 58,990-acre Clear Creek watershed contains three HUC 12 subwatersheds: Upper Clear Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, and Lower Clear Creek. These HUC 12 subwatersheds are divided into 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds. Leitch Creek and Little Cedar Creek subwatersheds were not considered in the analysis, as they have no Forest Service ownership within them. The existing conditions of the watersheds are shown in Table 3-36. Watershed boundaries and stream locations are displayed in Figure 3-8 and Figure 3-9. No municipal water supplies or source waters are within, adjacent to, or downstream of the project area. There are no Source Water Protection areas that extend into the Clear Creek project area, although the Source Water Protection area for the city of Orofino (PWS# 2180024 - City of Orofino) extends to main stem Clear Creek downstream of the project area (Clear Creek and Big Cedar Creek confluence). The IDEQ Source Water Assessment database was used to identify public water systems in Clearwater and Idaho counties that are located downstream of the Clear Creek project. Other than Orofino, all other public water systems including Kooska and Kamiah originate from wells. Surface Source Water Protection areas extend 25 miles upstream and 500 feet on each side of stream reaches. Implementation of BMPs, including the Idaho Forest Practices Act and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (FSH 2509.22) are sufficient to maintain water quality at the Orofino surface water intake and meet BMPs listed in EPA Region 10 Source Water Protection Best Management Practices for USFS and BLM (Draft October 12, 2005). A search of water rights applications, permits, decrees, licenses, claims, and transfers was made for the areas located in the Clear Creek project area. Twenty water rights were identified: 19 for the U.S. Forest Service and 1 for the State of Idaho. Uses include minimum stream flow, stock water, and federal reserved use. Further details of each water right are located in the project file. The proposed action alternatives analyzed for this project would not alter any existing water rights claims or decrease the available water relative to these claims. Table 3-36.

Forest Plan Prescription Watersheds and Major Streams in the Clear Creek Watershed  Color map with the three subwatersheds show in different colors Figure 3-9. Clear Creek Subwatersheds (6th Level HUC)  Forested seeps and springs are found throughout the project area and often mark the upper extent of perennial flow. Stream channels range from headwater channels that are relatively steep and confined (Rosgen A) to lower-gradient Rosgen B and C channels (Rosgen and Silvey 1996). Prior to project initiation, the Forest conducted a NFMA analysis (USDA Forest Service 2011a) for the Clear Creek Watershed tiered from the Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001). Both the Subbasin and NFMA assessments identified departed conditions for terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Results were then used to inform and develop the purpose and need for the project. In addition, Nez Perce Forest Plan direction was also reviewed and used to identify prescription watersheds in the project area that did not meet fish/water quality objectives in 1987. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, resource specialists evaluated conditions of headwater perennial and intermittent channels, ephemeral draws, and springs and seeps within and downstream of the proposed harvest units. Information collected included stream gradient, substrate configuration, bank condition, wetted, bankfull, and floodplain widths, erosion hazards (mass wasting/headcutting), road and culvert conditions at stream intersections, and determining if streams were in equilibrium in regards to cutting and deposition. Headwater channels in this area were found to be generally A3 and B3 channels (Rosgen and Silvey 1996) with well vegetated stream banks and stable substrates. Ephemeral draws showed no evidence of downcutting. In addition, temperature data and instream channel conditions of 3rd to 5th order streams were gathered (see aquatics section). During 2012 field reviews, bank cutting and deposition from 2011 runoff events were noted in Pine Knob and Browns Spring creeks. Comparison of stream conditions in nearby Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater drainages showed similar channel conditions and gage data indicated flows were higher than usual for the area. Channels are primarily stable and not entrenched, and are fully accessible to their floodplains (which are generally less than 30 feet wide). Banks are stable, and channel substrate consists of silts and sands, gravels, cobbles and small boulders. Based on the indicators observed, most stream segments were considered to be in a stable condition, with balanced cutting and deposition (effectively storing and routing sediment). Aggradation (deposition of fine substrate) was noted upstream of several culverts, particularly culverts that were undersized or were at a flatter gradient than the stream channel. Some stream bank damage was noted in isolated locations where livestock crossed streams or at watering locations. Most of the disturbance occurred on closed roads where roads bisected streams. Additionally, road and culvert related concerns were identified in the field and prioritized for repair. Some of these items were addressed under separate NEPA decision documents and were incorporated into the existing condition of the EIS or the cumulative effects analyses as a future project. Although assessed during the same pre-NEPA assessment as this EIS, it was determined that implementing these projects through separate NEPA and prior to the completion of this EIS would accelerate watershed recovery. For example the stream adjacent 650D road complex was included in the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA (2011) and approximately 2.0 miles of road along Hoodoo Creek was decommissioned (see Appendix J). A stream stability evaluation was conducted for the 48 stream reaches reviewed in the field to determine how resistant streams were to recent flow forces exerted on them (USDA FS 1975). The evaluation also helps predict the resistive capacity of streams to detachment of bed and bank materials due to changes in flow and/or increases in sediment production, as well as assessing the ability of channels to adjust and recover from those changes (USDA FS 1975). Fifteen indicators are evaluated and scored a certain value. A final score is achieved by adding the fifteen values. Scores range from 38 to 152. An “Excellent” score is 38 and all 15 indicators have to rate as excellent to obtain this rating. A score of “Good” ranges between 39 to 76, “Fair” ranges between 77 to 114, and a >115 is a “Poor” rating. A stream channel reach that rates “poor” has a combination of attributes that would require more judicious upstream management of forest lands than one rated “excellent”. Rapid changes in the density and aerial extent of vegetation on a watershed can increase stream discharges. Channel systems rated “excellent” can withstand these increases with less damage than systems rated “poor”. Most of the streams inventoried rated as Good and would be able to withstand some level of increased stream flows. One of the indicators for upper banks is landform slope and to achieve an excellent rating, bank slope must be <30%. For most of the “V” shaped first and second order streams associated with this project area, bank slopes are generally greater than 30%, making it difficult to achieve an excellent score. (see project file for individual stream reach ratings, photos, and map). A Rosgen classification was also determined for each of the evaluated streams and sensitivity to disturbance ratings and associated recovery potential ratings were assigned (Rosgen 1994 and Rosgen and Silvey 1996). For the A2 and B3/4 channel types, there is a low to moderate sensitivity to disturbance (includes increases in streamflow magnitude and timing and/or sediment increases) and recovery potential is excellent. The A3/4 channel types are more sensitive to disturbance with a rating of very high to extreme and a very poor recovery potential. These sensitivity parameters were originally designed for livestock grazing management but are still useful in demonstrating that headwater channels in the project area may be more sensitive to disturbance than the larger B channels. Beneficial uses and water quality criteria and standards are identified in the Idaho Water Quality Standards and Wastewater Treatment Requirements (IDAPA 58.01.02). Designated Beneficial Uses (IDAPA 58.01.02, Section 120) for the Middle Fork Clearwater River Subbasin are cold water biota, salmonid spawning, domestic water supply, and primary contact recreation. Designated Beneficial Uses for Pine Knob Creek, Browns Spring Creek, and Clear Creek (mainstem) are cold water biota, secondary contact recreation, and salmonid spawning. The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) has determined that the streams are fully supporting those beneficial uses (IDEQ 2012 Integrated Report 2014). For those streams not individually listed (undesignated surface waters), beneficial uses include cold water biota and secondary contact recreation. Solo Creek and Middle Fork Clear Creek were found to be fully supporting these beneficial uses, while Kay Creek, South Fork Clear Creek, Hoodoo Creek, and Big Cedar Creek have not been assessed. The IDEQ direction is to improve or maintain water quality conditions in order to support beneficial uses. No streams within the Clear Creek drainage are listed for impairment by pollutants in the EPA-approved 2012 IDEQ 303(d)/305(b) Integrated Report (IDEQ 2014). Conditions in the Clear Creek project area are a result of both natural processes and human activities. Past human-related activities include recreation, fire suppression, road building and maintenance, and harvest activities (1950s–2000s). Past harvest and associated road construction have had the most impact, with some increases in water yield and sediment yield. Harvest activities from 1950s to 2005 have occurred on 5%–70% of the Forest Service owned portions of the prescription watersheds in the Clear Creek project area. The morphology of stream channels (width, depth, slope, substrate, etc.) is the result of the balance between the timing and amount of water yield and the amount of sediment yield, deposition, and transport. If changes occur in the amount of sediment or magnitude of peak flows, the shift in the balance between water yield and sediment yield can lead to changes in channel morphology. For instance, an increase in water yield without an increase in sediment yield may lead to scouring the stream bed and the channel down-cutting, and conversely, increases in sediment yield without an increase in water yield can lead to excessive deposition of sediment in the stream channel. The stream system is a connected network, and therefore changes in the physical processes upstream have effects in downstream reaction in channels.  Water Yield 3.11.5.1.1Compaction, disturbance, or removal of the ground surface and disturbance or removal of vegetation can alter water yield. Water yield refers to the volume and timing of stream flow at a given point. In the absence of major disturbance, a stream channel is typically dynamically in balance with its flow regime, which is a key determinant of the energy available for erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment within channels. Increased water yields may be associated with increased probability of peak flow events, which could lead to increased channel and bank adjustment through scour, bedload movement, or redistribution of sediment in depositional areas. Water yield can increase after loss of mature trees (e.g. through harvest or wildfire) due to a reduction in transpiration and precipitation interception losses. Removal of forest canopy can also affect snow accumulation and melt processes, often resulting in an increase in snowpack accumulation and melt rates, which can lead to altered timing of peak snowmelt runoff, depending on the size, orientation and total area of clearcuts in a given drainage (Storck et al. 2002, Winkler et al. 2005). The presence of roads and skid trails typically increases overland flow due to soil compaction; these impacts are similar to those of canopy removal from timber harvest. ECA is often used as an indicator of potential changes in water yield and represents the amount of forest canopy openings in the watershed. Existing roads are considered permanent openings in ECA estimates. Lower ECAs generally indicate a higher likelihood that stream channels are in balance with their flow regime. There are no Federal or State of Idaho standards govern changes in peak flow or water yield. The Forest Plan calls for maintaining the stability, equilibrium, and function of all streams on the forest, but does not specify a threshold for ECA or increase in water yield. The plan does require that water yield not increase beyond acceptable limits. This guidance was subsequently refined to state that water yield analysis should be done where vegetation removal occurred over a high proportion of a watershed area. High proportion was recognized to vary with watershed and climatic characteristics, but was generally considered to occur when ECA exceeded 25-30% (Gerhardt, 1991). Early Forest guidance for vegetation management recommended that ECA not exceed 20-25% in third to fifth order drainages (Silvey 1973). ECA is also used as an indicator in ESA consultation for habitat condition. An ECA of <15% at the HUC10 and HUC12 scales are associated with high quality habitat (NOAA 1998). An ECA analysis was conducted to determine the existing ECA condition. Past harvest, wildfire, and roads were included in the analysis and included roads and forested openings on private and state lands. Existing ECAs at the HUC12 scale range from 1% to 6% (Table 3-38). Each of the subwatersheds is considered in high (good) condition of <15% ECA (NOAA 1998). Existing ECAs in the Forest Plan prescription watersheds ranged between 1% and 10% (Table 3-38) and are below the recommended threshold of 20 to 25% for 3rd to 5th order streams (Gerhardt 2000).  Sediment Yield 3.11.5.1.2Active erosion of the landscape yields sediment to streams and occurs naturally or as the result of management activities. When an excess of sediment—that is, over the natural (balanced) amount—is delivered to a stream, the stream’s ability to route the sediment out of the system is diminished, and water quality is reduced. Prescription watersheds were assigned fish/water quality objectives in Appendix A of the Forest Plan. These objectives provide management direction in terms of the maximum estimated increase in sediment over baseline conditions that can be approached or equaled for a specific number of years per decade. In 1987, the eight Forest Plan prescription watersheds with assigned objectives did not meet their fish/water quality objectives, and sediment was the primary limiting factor. These same watersheds have an Upward Trend Requirement, which allows timber management to occur, concurrent with improvement efforts, as long as a positive, upward trend in habitat carrying capacity is indicated. Objectives for Big Cedar Creek and Lower Clear Creek Face were not designated, nor were sediment yield guidelines assigned. The sediment yield guidelines (the maximum sediment yield allowable to meet fish/water quality objectives) for each watershed are shown in Table 3-40. Appendix A of the Forest Plan also assigned entry frequency guidelines for each of the watersheds. Few activities have occurred in any of the watersheds in the past 10 years to qualify as an entry, when considering sediment production. The most recent harvest was the Middle Fork timber sale in the Pine Knob Creek drainage in 2005. Roads are a source of sediment to streams, particularly at culvert inlets where cutslope slumping occurs and on roads in need of more drainage structures. Road densities within the prescription watersheds range from 1.6 to 4.8 mi/mi2. A watershed in high (good) condition generally has a road density of <1 mi/mi2. Watersheds with 1–3 mi/mi2 are rated as moderate, and those with >3 mi/mi2 are rated as low (poor) condition (NOAA 1998). Of the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds, 5 are rated as moderate condition, and 5 are rated as low condition. The baseline road miles for this project include the 10 miles of road decommissioning that occurred under the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning 2011 decision.  Environmental Consequences 3.11.63.11.6.1 Direct and Indirect Effects Due to the scale of resource indicator guidance thresholds, direct and indirect effects areas are the three HUC 12 subwatersheds and the 10 Forest Plan prescription watersheds. In addition, headwater streams (first and second order) were also evaluated, as these areas represent the lowest level at which effects would be detected.  Alternative A—No Action 3.11.6.1.1Under this alternative, no proposed management actions would occur. Actions occurring on state and private lands would continue. Because no vegetation removal or ground-disturbing activities would occur, no direct effects would result from this alternative. Under Alternative A, road density and road-related erosion (indirect effects) would remain unchanged. Benefits from the reconditioning, reconstruction, and decommissioning of roads, proposed as part of the action alternatives, would not be attained. These roads would continue to be a potential source of sediment and would continue to intercept water and reroute it to stream systems. Forested stands would continue to decline due to insect and disease and lack of regenerating disturbance. Maintenance and re-establishment of long-lived, early seral species would not occur. Risk of large scale, stand replacing fire would increase over time, although the timing, size, or severity of such an event cannot be predicted. Increase in ECA for this scenario was not estimated due to unpredictability of extent of mortality from insect and disease or future wildland fires, but ECA could exceed levels estimated from the action alternatives. Alternative A does not propose any new activities that would directly or indirectly affect wetlands or floodplains or increase water temperatures.  Alternatives B, C, and D—Action Alternatives 3.11.6.1.23.11.6.2 Regeneration, Improvement, and Commercial Thinning Alternative B proposes 2,609 acres of regeneration, 5,606 acres of commercial thinning, and 331 acres of improvement. Alternative C proposes 4,156 acres of regeneration, 4,220 acres of commercial thinning, and 331 acres of improvement. Alternative D proposes 2,178 acres of regeneration, 5,141 acres of commercial thinning, and 211 acres of improvement. The vegetation treatments would maintain or reestablish long-lived, early seral species and would create a healthier, more resilient landscape better able to survive natural disturbances. Table 3-37 displays vegetation removal activities by alternative for the three HUC12 subwatersheds. The most harvest occurs under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, and then D. Harvest activities were assessed using ECA, increases in percent water yield, and the NEZSED model (sediment yield). Table 3-37.

Removal of vegetation has the potential to increase stream flow in the short term (0–10 years) due to changes in evaporation, precipitation, wind patterns, and soil infiltration and percolation (Fowler et al. 1987; Dunne and Leopold 1978). In studies summarized by Grant et al. (2008), detectable increases in peak flow (10%) generally occur when more than 20% of a watershed (<10 km2 drainages) is harvested. Clearcut harvest prescriptions were the primary focus of those studies. Increase in stream flow is generally not measurable until at least 20 to 30% of a watershed’s forest cover is removed (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). Stednick (1996) suggests that flow changes are not measurable when <25% of the watershed is clearcut. Conclusions from the studies are mostly base on research in small tributary watersheds (approximately 200 acres, but Troendle et al. (2001) found that the hydrologic effects of forest management on a 6.5 mi2 basin were directly comparable to the results from much smaller basins. At Coon Creek in south-central Wyoming there was a detectable change in annual water yield as a result of harvest and road-building on 24% of the watershed (Troendle et al. 2001). The size of the study area was 6.5 mi2 (approximately 4,000 acres) and roughly the equivalent of the Forest Plan prescription watersheds. Changes in runoff measured on small experimental basins can be scaled up to much larger basins (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). A review of paired catchment experiments concluded that at least 15-20% of a forested basin must be treated within a short time period in order to detect a change in runoff (Bosch and Hewlett 1982). Troendle and Leaf (1980) noted that 20-30% of a watershed must be treated to detect a statistically significant change in flow. Recommendation in USDA Forest Service (1970) suggested not clearcutting more than 25 to 30 percent of a 3rd order drainage area to stay below a 8-10% increase in average annual water yield (recommended threshold). As shown in Table 3-38, regeneration harvest activities would occur on 1% to 22% of the Prescription watersheds (Alt. C only). Proposed regeneration harvest accounts for <8% of any of the HUC12 subwatersheds. The effect of thinning overstocked stands on water yield is usually minor, and hydrologic recovery can occur within 5 years (USDA Forest Service 1973). Analysis of water yield is probably not necessary for treatments that remove 20% or less of basal area, because the effects are not likely measurable (Troendle et al. 2009). Effects of thinning, fuel treatments, and partial cuts on water yield are likely to be short-lived and may not even be measurable (Troendle et al. 2009). ECA is used as an indicator of change in water yield resulting from reductions in forest canopy. The ECA analysis takes into account the initial percentage of crown removal and the recovery through vegetative regrowth since the initial disturbance. Existing roads are considered permanent openings in ECA estimates. The analysis takes a simple snapshot in time, with the assumption that all Clear Creek project activities would be implemented in 1 year. ECA predictions are used to compare alternatives and are not viewed as absolutes. This water yield indicator serves only as a red flag that suggests a potential for decreased stability due to sustained increased energy in the stream channel. ECA is used in combination with other indicators such as channel stability and channel type to determine hydrologic risk. The ECA method was developed to address concerns regarding water yield increases and potential effects on channel morphology. In the 1970s and 1980s, channel impacts (primarily scouring) were often observed, and these impacts were thought to be caused by water yield increases. During that period, clear-cutting was common, timber harvest levels were substantially higher, and impacts to streams were common. Forest management practices have changed dramatically since that time. Streams now have no-harvest buffers of 100–300 feet on both sides of the watercourse, and BMPs are implemented on all projects. These changes have greatly reduced the impacts of forest management on stream channels and aquatic habitat. ECA was calculated at two scales: 1) the HUC12 scale in order to compare to the thresholds in The Matrix of Pathways and Indicators of Watershed Condition for Chinook, Steelhead, and Bull Trout (NOAA 1998) and 2) the Forest Plan prescription watershed scale to compare to guidance limiting ECA to 20 to 25% for 3rd to 5th order streams (Gerhardt 2000). ECA at HUC12 subwatershed scale A lower ECA values corresponds to a lower likelihood that undesirable effects of increased water yield (e.g. elevated channel and bank scour) would occur. An ECA value of less than 15 percent is unlikely to result in measurable change in water yield, a condition rated as “high” or healthy by NOAA Fisheries (1998). At the HUC12 scale, ECAs of <15% indicate high (good) condition. ECAs of 15%–30% indicate moderate condition and ECAs of >30% are considered low (poor) condition (NOAA 1998). The estimated percent increase in ECA from harvest activities, temporary road construction, and prescribed burning ranges from 5% to 13%, depending on watershed and alternative (Table 3-40). When these increases are added to the existing ECAs, they produce ECA estimates that predict what watershed conditions would be like after the Clear Creek project. These ECA estimates range from 7% to 15% for Alternative B, 8% to 16% for Alternative C, and 6% to 14% for Alternative D. The highest increases in ECA occur under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. For the Upper Clear Creek HUC 12 subwatershed, watershed condition would move from high (good) condition to a moderate condition for Alternatives B and C, but would remain in good condition for Alternative D. South Fork Clear Creek subwatershed would remain in good condition for the ECA indicator for all alternatives. For the Lower Clear Creek subwatershed, watershed condition would move from a good to moderate condition for Alternative C, but would remain good for Alternatives B and D. Although two subwatersheds would change from a good to moderate condition, the percent ECAs are on the low end of values within the moderate category.  Table 3-38.

Numbers are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.  ECA at Forest Plan prescription watershed scale As suggested in Belt (1980), ECA calculations were originally proposed for third to fifth order stream drainages. Early guidance suggested ECAs not exceed 20 to 25% in 3rd to 5th order drainages (Gerhardt 2000). Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973) describes that most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of timber harvest before increases are detectable. Using calculations and graphs documented in Forest Hydrology, Part II (USDA FS 1973), it was determined that for an average 5,000 foot elevation (range of 3,500 to 6,000 feet), a limitation of10% increase in average annual runoff, and a water yield increase factor of 40% (F factor), an allowable ECA for these drainages equate to 25% (ranges between 22% to 29% depending on elevation). Final ECAs for the Forest Plan prescription watersheds range from 3% to 20% for Alternative B, 3% to 26% for Alternative C, and from 2% to 19% for Alternative D. The highest increases in ECA occur under Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D (Table 3-39). Table 3-39.

As stated above, these ECA estimates are based on the assumption that all project activities would occur in 1 year. In reality, these activities would be staggered over several years. For example, this project could be broken up into seven different timber sales and harvested over a seven-year period. Units in Browns Spring and Solo Creek areas (Upper Clear Creek) would be split out into two to three timber sales and harvested at different time periods. The same would be done for those units in the Hoodoo and West Fork Clear Creek areas (Lower Clear Creek). Additionally, increases in average annual water yield for each of the Forest Plan prescription watersheds were calculated for Alternative C using formulas and graphs from Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973). Isaacson (1977) concluded that when average annual flows are exceeded by more than 10 percent channel damage could begin to occur. Most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of timber harvest before increases are detectable (USDA Forest Service 1973). Other guidance documents (USDA Forest Service 1970) indicated that when the average annual water yield is increased by 8-10%, stream channel damage (aggradation-degradation) could be initiated. The potential for alteration develops during the spring runoff period. The degree of change or rate at which it occurs is dependent upon the degree of stream channel stability that presently exists and the type of stream channel that would carry the increase yield. Increases in water yield from the proposed activities were estimated to be 10% or less for the Forest Plan prescription watersheds (Table 3-39) which are predicted to be below detectable limits. Increases over the recommended 10% increase in average annual water yield are generally allowed when stream banks are more than 60% stable. As stated above, most of the streams reviewed in the field were in a stable condition with Phankuch ratings of Good. Morphologic and hydrologic condition on third order or larger streams may minimize their vulnerability to harvest-related flow increases. The morphology of most third order and larger stream bottoms tend to minimize the scour of increased flows (Rainville 1987). Stream channels naturally experience bank full flows about once every two years (Leopold et al. 1964). Flows that exceed the channel capacity flood into the riparian zone. This reduces the erosion potential of peaks because the water flows over a much wider area and over energy reducing vegetation and wood. For flood flows to cause significant channel scour, they would have to be large enough to overcome this energy dissipating system. If canopy removal affects only small to moderate sized peaks and generally results in less than a 20% increase in water yield, the increase in flow may be insufficient to overcome the energy absorbing affect (Rainville 1987). Much research has been conducted on harvest activities and the potential for increased water yield. Most of the studies conclude that removal of forest vegetation increases water yield to some extent, but there is much variability in conclusions (summarized in Grant et al. 2008, Bosch and Hewlett, 1982; Stednick, 1996, MacDonald and Stednick 2003). The broad variation in findings suggests that one or more studies can be found to support nearly any point of view. Several of the earlier studies regarding harvest and increased water yields analyzed paired watersheds—one watershed with no harvest as the control and another usually 100% clear cut (summarized in Stednick 1996 and Bosch and Hewlett 1982). Forest practices in these studies included cutting up to the stream channels and hot, broadcast burning of slash. Newer practices include retention of large green trees, snags, and downed wood material, utilization of Riparian Habitat Conservation Area no cut buffers, less ground disturbing logging systems, and less intense slash reduction methods. Many of these studies looked at clearcut activities in areas with openings of >2–5 tree heights distributed over a substantial portion of a watershed (Kendall 1999, Troendle and King 1987, Winkler et al. 2005). The mechanism for altering flows is largely from two sources: reduced evapotranspiration rates following vegetation removal and altered rates and patterns of snow accumulation and melt (Grant et al. 2008). The rate of snowmelt depends upon many factors such as the silvicultural treatment, size of openings, aspect, and climate. Increased exposure of snow packs to solar radiation and thermal radiation from surrounding trees or stands, melts snow faster and earlier in the spring (Troendle 1983), which can result in increased water yields and peak flows. A substantial portion of a watershed would have to be effectively treated to cause a significant change in the timing and magnitude of snowmelt (Kendall 1999). In general, maximum snow retention occurs in clearings of approximately 5 tree heights in diameter (approximately 500 to 600 feet) (USDA Forest Service 1973). Although studies have shown localized increases in snow accumulation, they found no statistically significant change in mean snow water equivalent over the entire watershed as a result of clear-cut openings (Troendle 1983). The increases in snow water equivalent found in clearings were balanced by losses from adjacent forested areas. Clear-cuts that are small enough to be shaded by nearby forest (1 to 3 tree heights) will melt later and may not contribute to streamflow at all (MacDonald 1989). Proposed variable tree retention levels of 14–28 trees per acre for this project would be left as singles or clumps depending on the locations of the larger legacy trees and species wanted for retention and could look similar to Figure 3-10. No cut riparian buffers would also provide retention areas within and adjacent to regeneration harvest units. Snow accumulations would occur in the smaller openings between clumps within the regeneration harvest units, but larger accumulations are not expected, due to design criteria limiting openings to 2 acres in size without leave tree retention.    Figure 3-10. Variable Retention Example from the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest  The magnitude of any peak flow increase in response to forest management diminishes with increasing basin area for several reasons, including attenuation of flood peaks because of channel resistance, flood-plain storage, and transmission losses, as well as effects of storm size and origin (Archer 1989, Garbrecht 1991, Shaman et al. 2004, Singh 1997, Grant et al. 2008, Macdonald and Stednick 2003). No hydrologic mechanism exists by which peak flow increases, when measured as a percentage change, can combine to yield a higher percentage increase in peak flows in a larger basin. As a consequence, the magnitude of peak flow increases for larger basins will necessarily be equal to or smaller than those reported for small watersheds. (Grant et al. 2008). Some factors affecting timing and amount of runoff include: variability of snow accumulation, timing of snow melt due to aspect and elevation, amount of available water storage in the soil, and underlying parent material. King’s studies (1994) conducted on the Nez Perce National Forest showed that while there was evidence of peak flow increases in the headwater first and second order streams, they were cumulatively not detectable on the main stem (third order). The larger the drainage area, the less likely synchronization of flows will occur due to the greater opportunity for storage (Megahan 1972). Most stream channels experience bank full flows about once every 2 years. Flows which exceed the channel capacity flood into the riparian zone, which reduces the erosion potential of peaks by flowing over a larger area containing vegetation, trees, and other obstructions. Water yield changes resulting from timber harvest in the northern Rockies typically includes an advance in the timing of the rising limb of the snowmelt hydrograph and an increase in the total volume of runoff. Changes were most evident in the first 10 years after harvest (Hicks et al. 1991, Jones 2000. Even where rain-on-snow is an issue, the biggest effect on smaller peak flows is at recurrence interval (RI) less than one year (i .e., lower than the bankfull event) (Harr 1976, Harr 1986, Zeimer 1998). Larger flows tend to be dominated by the rainfall component of the storm, and the snowmelt component has little influence on the flood size. Increases in runoff following forest harvest are substantially greater in wet years than in dry years (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). Early studies, such as Wagon Wheel Gap (1928) and Fools Creek (1969), demonstrated that in areas where the majority of precipitation is in the form of snow, increase in water yield occurred primarily during the snow melt runoff season. Although water yield increases of 16% and 25% were noted in these studies, both reported that no damage to channels occurred nor was sediment increased significantly (USDA Forest Service 1973). Utilizing predictions from Bosch and Hewlett (1982) there would be an approximate 20% increase in water yield if 50% of forest vegetation was removed in small tributary drainages (study areas were about 50-300 acres in size). This calculation is based on a 40 mm increase in water yield per 10% change in cover and a mean annual precipitation for the project area of 1100 mm. Research in the nearby Horse Creek watershed study area (Nez Perce National Forest) demonstrated instantaneous peak flow increases of up to 34 percent and maximum monthly flow increases up to 44 percent, resulting from road construction and timber harvest (patch clearcutting) in small catchments (King, 1989). The East and Main forks of Horse Creek are third order streams with watersheds of approximately 4,000 acres. The Horse Creek study watersheds were first and second order drainages ranging between 60 and 380 acres in size. Although there were increases in stream flows noted at the smaller tributary watersheds, there was no detectable change in any stream flow parameters at the Main Fork Horse Creek gage station (King 1989). For first order drainages, approximately 50 percent (range 40 to 60 percent) of a drainage could be regeneration harvested (utilizing variable tree retention with approximately 20% tree retention, including no-cut buffers) and still fall within the approximately 40% PECA (range 20 to 60%) allowable in first order drainages before increases in water yield exceed 10% (Benoit 1973). This estimate is for first and second order drainages (generally 50 to 300 acres in size) with elevations of 3,500 to 5,500 feet and with stream channels of Good condition. The Probable Equivalent Clearcut Area (PECA) was originally created for the Clearwater National Forest. Additionally, guidance in Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA Forest Service 1973) recommends a 50% maximum area in clearcut condition for second order streams and 70% for first order streams. There are some first and second order stream drainages within the project area that have 50% or more proposed regeneration harvest treatment within their drainages. These regeneration treatment areas include portions of Units 102, 103, 109 (Clear Creek drainage); 126,128,129, 229, 230, 234 (West Fork Clear Creek drainage); 139, 142, 224, 226 (South Fork Clear Creek drainage) and 145 (Kay Creek drainage). Generally, a 20% reduction in unit acres occurs due to additional wetlands and streams being located during marking of unit boundaries in the field. These areas receive no-cut harvest buffers. Also any additional landslide prone areas identified during unit boundary layout and marking of trees are dropped and protected with no-cut harvest buffers. Most of the first and second order streams in the within and adjacent to harvest units are greater than 10% gradient, with gravel/cobble substrates, and have small average annual water yields and peak flows. For example a tributary to Clear Creek (located between Units 102 and 103) with a drainage area of 320 acres, has a stream gradient of over 10%, cobble substrate, an average annual flow 0.4 cubic feet per second (cfs), and a bankfull peak flow of 5.5 cfs. Clear Creek at that point has an annual flow of 20 cfs and bankfull flow (peak1.5) of 130 cfs. Third to fifth order streams downstream of harvest units range between 4 and 10%. As discussed in Grant et al. (2008) peak flow effects on channel morphology are generally limited to stream reaches where channel gradients are less than approximately 2% and in which streambeds are composed of gravel and finer substrate material. There are very few areas in the Clear Creek project area with these characteristics (see stream evaluation field notes in the project file. There are short sections (100-500 feet in length) in the third to fifth order streams that have a <2% gradient, but sections have predominantly cobble sized substrate. Longer sections of <2% gradient occur in main stem Clear Creek (300 to 2500 feet in length) on Forest Service land and downstream of the project area on privately owned lands, but again, substrates are moderate in size (cobbles and some small boulders) and not subject to scour. Peak flow effects on channel morphology are generally not found on high-gradient (>10%) streams and are minor in most step-pool systems (Grant et al. 2008). Stream channels directly downstream of harvest units are Rosgen A and B channels (Rosgen and Silvey 1996). Based on the bank and channel substrate of these streams, they have a low (Rosgen B3) to extreme (Rosgen A4) sensitivity to disturbance rating and a very poor (Rosgen A4) to excellent (Rosgen B3) recovery potential. Field assessments confirmed that streams in the project area are in good conditionChanges in channel conditions are not expected to occur because gradients are mostly >10%, large wood material is present and anchored, steam banks are well armored with vegetation and rock, substrates are primarily cobble size and angular and are unlikely to be displaced by elevated water yield or peak flows.  Sediment Yield 3.11.6.2.2Ground-disturbing harvest activities can also increase erosion and sediment loads in the intermittent and small perennial channels within and adjacent to treatment units (0–2 years). Topography, retained woody material, and no-cut RHCAs would capture and store most of the erosion material. As ground cover is reestablished, hillslope erosion would diminish (0–3 years). Headwater streams and wetlands typically trap and retain much of the sediment that washes into them. The faster the water travels, the larger the particles it can carry. Natural obstructions in small streams, such as rocks, downed logs, or even just a bumpy stream bottom, slow water and cause sediment to settle out of the water column (Meyer et al. 2003). Also, as gradient flattens and stream energy diminishes fine sediment is deposited. Deposition often occurs at area where higher gradient tributaries or sections of streams meet lower gradient streams. As noted above in the water yield section, lower gradient areas (<2% ) occur in short, dispersed segments in most of the of the main channels and are the areas where larger amounts of fine materials are located and stored (see field survey information). The NEZSED model was used to estimate the predicted percent increase in sediment yield from the proposed activities under Alternatives B, C, and D. The predicted increases in sediment production by the NEZSED model are for relative comparison to existing conditions and do not reflect actual instream sediment yields expected from the project. Modeling was done on a peak year basis in order to meet the assumptions under which Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan was developed. It is highly unlikely, however, that all of the activities proposed would occur in a single year. The NEZSED model results have their primary utility in comparing differences between each proposed alternative and the existing condition; model results are also useful for comparing the proposed alternative to the guidelines of Appendix A of the Forest Plan. The sediment yield guidelines were established to reflect the sediment-carrying capacity of the stream system. The guidelines for each watershed are shown in Table 3-40. A more detailed discussion of the NEZSED model is in the Forest Plan Appendix A guidance document (Conroy and Thompson 2011). As shown in Table 3-40, each of the prescription watersheds would remain below the sediment yield guidelines allowable under Forest Plan Appendix A (USDA Forest Service 1987a), under all alternatives. Table 3-40 displays the percent sediment yield over base, the natural (base) erosion rate, and increase in sediment yield. The highest increases were found in Alternative C, followed by Alternative B, then D. Sediment yields would return to current conditions within 10 years as modeled, and would be approximately 1% less than Alternative A due to system road decommissioning activities. Table 3-40.

It is acknowledged that some additional sediment yield would occur due to traffic increases from logging operations. This would be mitigated through road maintenance, road improvements, rock surfacing, application of dust abatement material, and timber contract provisions. Foltz (1996) found that rock surfacing with good quality aggregate reduced the sediment produced from unpaved forest roads. At the levels planned, harvest and burning activities would be considered an entry when compared to the Forest Plan standard. With no activities qualifying as entries in 9 of the prescription watersheds in the last decade, all alternatives are within Forest Plan Appendix A guidelines for sediment yield. For Pine Knob Creek, an entry was made in 2005 for the Middle Fork timber sale. This watershed is allowed 2 entries per decade, so it also meets the Forest Plan guideline. Implementation of project design measures, adherence to BMPs, and maintenance of no-harvest RCHAs would reduce potential erosion and further limit the risk of sediment reaching streams. Any sediment yield increases would be short-term (0–6 years following project activities), and beneficial uses in Clear Creek and the Middle Fork Clearwater River would be maintained.  Conclusion for Regeneration, Improvement, and Commercial 3.11.6.2.3Thinning Activities: The combination of water yield and sediment yield effects from harvest activities are not anticipated to result in changes in channel morphology of sufficient magnitude to alter physical parameters such as width/depth ratio or pool volume in 3rd to 5th order streams. Some changes could occur in limited reaches, especially in small headwater streams, where localized bank cutting or scouring could occur. Forest harvest and fuels treatments should have minimal adverse effects on water quality if they are carefully designed and conducted in accordance with best management practices (MacDonald and Stednick 2003). Proposed harvest activities are currently planned to be separated into seven different timber sales over a 7-year period. This is only an estimate and is subject to change based on the decision made as a result of this EIS. Proposed timber sales are staggered across the Clear Creek watershed to better distribute harvest activities. For example proposed harvest in the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed is scheduled to be separated into four sales. Project specific design measures (see Chapter 2) were created to minimize potential increases in sediment and water yields. Best Management Practices and Soil and Water Conservation Practices (FSH 2509.22) are incorporated into the design criteria.  Prescribed Burning 3.11.6.2.4Low- and mixed-severity prescribed fire is proposed on 1,370 acres in 15 units (701–715) for all action alternatives. This activity was assessed using ECA and the NEZSED model and resulting increases in ECA and percent sediment yield over base are incorporated in the earlier discussion above. . Burn severity would be low enough to maintain much of the duff layer to help prevent germination of invasive species. Fire would not be ignited within PACFISH buffers (riparian or landslide prone), although fire would be allowed to back into these areas. This design measure would reduce the potential for erosion on sensitive landscapes and areas close to stream channels. In addition, 42 acres of restoration is proposed in bunchgrass communities. This area would be treated through prescribed burning and revegetated with native grasses and forbs. Burn severity is expected to be low, with no increase in soil erosion.  Precommercial Thinning 3.11.6.2.5Although precommercial thinning would cause some opening of the canopy, ECA would not increase; therefore, water yield would not increase either. Ground vegetation would be left undisturbed. Thinning would be completed with chainsaws, so no ground-disturbing activities would take place; therefore, neither soil erosion nor sediment input to streams would increase.  Temporary Road Construction 3.11.6.2.6Approximately 36 miles of temporary roads would be constructed to access harvest units for Alternatives B and C, 8.7 miles of which occur on existing templates. Alternative D proposes 17.5 miles of temporary roads, including 8.7 miles located on existing templates. Temporary roads generate the most erosion when they are first constructed, and lesser erosion would occur during the 1–2 years the proposed roads would be open. Erosion would stabilize 2 years after decommissioning occurs. Temporary roads were included in the ECA and NEZSED analyses. Increase in ECA from temporary road construction is <1% for all watersheds and increase in water yield from this activity is unlikely. As outlined in the Implementation Guide to Appendix A (Conroy and Thompson 2011), temporary roads interior to harvest units are not modeled separately, but are incorporated into the computation for the harvest unit, and are not considered separately. For instance, where a temporary road is located on an unstable mid-slope or crosses streams, the road is modeled separately. Roads exterior to harvest units are modeled separately. Temporary roads calculated individually are modeled as having an erosion rate increase of 18,000 tons/square mile the year of construction, 5,000 tons/square mile for the years the road is being used and one year after decommissioning, and then goes to zero two years after decommissioning. The erosion potential from temporary roads for all alternatives would be short-term (4 years), since the roads would be built, used, and decommissioned over a period of 1–2 years and located on low-gradient, dry ridges or upper slopes, away from water, with no stream crossings. Project design measures for temporary roads would minimize the erosion produced over the short life of these roads. For example, temporary roads would be closed to public motorized use during project activities, reducing the chance of increased erosion from vehicles driving on wet roads and rutted surfaces. Water bars and placement of roads on the landscape help to reduce the likelihood of channelized flow leaving the road surface and entering riparian areas or system road ditches. Temporary roads would be decompacted and fully recontoured following project activities. Large wood material and organic materials would be positioned over exposed soils to reduce erosion potential and better accelerate recovery.  Road Reconditioning and Reconstruction 3.11.6.2.7Road reconditioning of system roads is proposed on approximately 48.8 miles. Each of the roads proposed for reconditioning are listed in Appendix B. Reconditioning is a combination of road ditch clean-out, blading and shaping the road surface to maintain a proper road template and drainage, or surfacing. This treatment is similar to road maintenance. Road reconditioning was calculated as an increase in sediment yield in the NEZSED model. As outlined in Conroy and Thompson (2011), road reconditioning is modeled as moderate reconstruction with an erosion rate increase of 18,000 tons/square mile the year of work Erosion rates return to the existing 5,000 tons/square mile in year 2. The entire 48.8 miles was modeled in NEZSED, but in actuality only portions of road in need of treatment are actually reconditioned.  Road reconstruction of system roads is proposed on approximately 119.8 miles. Each of the roads proposed for reconstruction are listed in Appendix B. Reconstruction includes replacing and installing new culverts for cross drains and live water crossings, placement of rock surfacing, placement of roadway fill, and installation of new signs or gates. Road reconstruction was calculated as an increase in sediment yield in the NEZSED model. As outlined in Conroy and Thompson (2011), road reconstruction is modeled as major reconstruction with an erosion rate increase of 67,500 tons/square mile the year of work and 18,000 tons/square mile in year 2 (similar to new permanent road construction). Erosion rates return to the existing 5,000 tons/square mile in year 3. The entire 119.8 miles was modeled in NEZSED, but in actuality only portions of road in need of treatment are actually reconstructed. A recent study using GRAIP monitoring showed that 7% of all drainage points in the study area delivered 90% of the road related sediment, and 2% delivered 50% of sediment (Black et al. 2013). Most of the roads in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project area were evaluated in the field and road recondition and reconstruction was prescribed as needed. These road improvement activities should address the key points that are delivering the highest amount of sediment to streams. Adding cross drains to roads in order to drain ditches prior to entering perennial stream channels will reduce sediment delivery dramatically. Road maintenance and improvements are considered a beneficial effect to water quality (Burroughs 1990; Grace and Clinton 2006; Switalski et al. 2004; Swift and Burns 1999). Surface graveling has been shown to be effective at reducing erosion from road surfaces, especially at road/stream crossings. Studies have found gravel reduces sediment by 70%–79% (Burroughs and King 1989). Increased drainage culverts, especially on either side of stream channels, would further disconnect the road system from the perennial stream network; lessening sediment delivery. Although this activity is designed to reduce sediment input over the long term, a minor increase in sediment is expected to occur at the time of the activity and the year following (2 years).  Road Decommissioning 3.11.6.2.8Road erosion and sediment yield usually decline over time but continue at a chronic level indefinitely (USDA Forest Service 1981). Approximately 13.2 miles of road are proposed for decommissioning with this project. Road removal would reduce road density (Table 3-41) and provide an improvement in the overall watershed condition. However, even with the proposed road decommissioning, the current (existing) watershed condition ratings would remain the same for each of the watersheds. For Big Cedar Creek, road miles on the Forest Service portion of the watershed were reduced by 20%. Road miles on LSP areas were reduced by 15%. At the HUC 12 level, road density in Upper Clear Creek went from 3.1 mi/mi2 (high/poor condition) to 2.8 mi/mi2 (moderate condition). In Lower Clear Creek, road density went from 3.0 mi/mi2 to 2.9 mi/mi2. South Fork Clear Creek road density remained moderate at 1.8 mi/mi2. Table 3-41 displays the number of road miles proposed for decommissioning within each of the Forest Plan Prescription watersheds and resulting road densities. Table 3-41, Column 2, shows road density prior to the South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek road decommissioning project that was completed under a separate Environmental Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2011b) and was incorporated into the existing condition of this project. Although assessed during the same NFMA as this project, it was determined that decommissioning 10.0 miles of system road prior to the completion of this project would accelerate watershed recovery.  Table 3-41.

The proposed road decommissioning projects include the removal of culverts, which would improve stream bank stability, width-to-depth ratio, and floodplain connectivity at localized sites. Road decommissioning activities would produce some short-term sediment, both temporally and spatially (Foltz et al. 2007). Some short-term sediment delivery is expected in the smaller tributaries that bisect the decommissioned roads. Sediment would be delivered during project implementation and during the stream channel stabilization period of 2–3 years. Past monitoring of obliteration showed only minor amounts of sediment delivered to headwater streams, mostly in the form of suspended sediment, as indicated by increases in turbidity. Design criteria and BMPs would be applied to each of these activities to minimize increases of sediment delivery to stream channels. Road decommissioning may produce short-term (0–3 years) and localized sediment increases, but it would produce both immediate and long-term recovery benefits.  Water Temperature 3.11.6.2.9The Clear Creek project is not expected to measurably influence stream water temperatures. This would be due primarily to implementation no-harvest RCHAs, and thus would have minimal impact on stream shading in the project area. The aquatics specialist’s report discusses stream temperature in more detail.  Floodplains and Wetlands 3.11.6.2.10US Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory maps were initially reviewed for inventoried wetlands. Approximately 1525 acres of wetlands were identified in the project area and 103 acres are located within proposed harvest units. Field reviews by hydrologists, fish biologists, botanists, and soil scientists were conducted within all timber harvest and burn units and on all roads where work would be performed under this project. Stream channels, seeps, springs, wet areas, hydrophilic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetlands were identified and were mapped using field GPS techniques and subsequently digitized into GIS to ensure they were tracked. Within harvest units all wetlands, including seeps, springs, and streams would be protected by no-cut PACFISH buffers. There would be no temporary road construction constructed within floodplains or wetlands. Direct and indirect effects could occur on wetland areas and within stream floodplains during installation, replacement and/or removal of culverts. However these effects, both undesirable and beneficial, are expected to be insignificant. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires permits to dredge or fill within waters of the United States. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers administers these provisions. Each year, the Forest consults with appropriate agencies to evaluate permitting needs on all actions that could affect stream channels (including wetlands). Culvert removal and replacement activities proposed under the Clear Creek project would require authorization under section 404, through application of either nationwide or site-specific permits. No proposed project activities are expected to negatively change the functions or values of wetlands and floodplains as they relate to protection of human health, safety, and welfare; preventing the loss of property values, and; maintaining natural systems. The goals of Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 would be met. 3.11.6.3 Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects arise when the incremental impact of an action is added to impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions. Past harvest activities and associated road construction have had the most impact, with increases in water yield and sediment yield in the Clear Creek drainage and its tributaries. The cumulative effects area is the Clear Creek watershed (HUC 10), which encompasses the entire Clear Creek project area and state and private lands. The temporal scope for watershed effects extends from the 1950s to 2037. The beginning date is based on the time frame of the first harvest and road construction activities in the watershed. Evidence from those events is still noticeable on the landscape in the form of old skid trails and landings and the current road system. The scope continues to year 2037, which is approximately 24 years after project implementation, the estimated amount of time required for ECA levels from this project to be no longer perceptible.  Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Actions 3.11.6.3.1Several timber sales have occurred in the Clear Creek watershed (see project file and ECA analysis). Timber sales conducted between the early 1950s and late 1990s involved many miles of new road construction, little to no tree retention in regeneration harvest areas, and dozer piling of slash. These activities resulted in widespread and persistent impacts on the subwatersheds and caused increased sedimentation and increased water yields. The Forest Service manages 72% of the Clear Creek watershed, and past harvest activities have occurred on approximately 28% of that Forest Service land. Forest practices have changed over the last few decades. Project design measures, BMPs, and Forest Plan guidelines have been developed in order to reduce ground-disturbing activities and subsequent sediment delivery. Operating under dry conditions, implementing no-harvest RHCAs, retaining trees in regeneration harvest units, and limiting ground-based yarding to slopes <35% have become common practices. Over 30 miles of Forest Service system roads have been decommissioned in the Clear Creek watershed since 1996. This activity produced localized short-term sediment during implementation but created long-term sediment reductions and benefits to overall channel conditions. Present actions include permitted grazing, recreation, fire suppression, road maintenance, and control of noxious weeds using chemical, mechanical, and biological methods. Recreational activities produce little to no impact to water quality or quantity or to floodplain/wetland functions. Most effects from recreation are primarily due to associated road use, especially during wet conditions. Effects from grazing include stream bank instability and reduced water infiltration rates in areas with soil compaction (localized areas). Fire suppression activities are infrequent and limited in size. Road maintenance has minimal short-term effects and long-term benefits (Burroughs and King 1989). Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of this EIS. Some of the concerns were addressed through projects that were completed under separate decision documents and were incorporated into the existing condition of this EIS and were included in the NEZSED analysis. Although assessed during the same pre-NEPA assessment as this EIS, it was determined that implementing these projects through separate NEPA and prior to the completion of this EIS would accelerate watershed recovery. Watershed improvement projects associated with this project and which a majority have been implemented: 10 miles of system road decommissioning, 73 miles non-system road decommissioning, 4 miles road reconstruction, 49 culvert replacements, and 22 culvert removals. (See Appendix J of FEIS for a more detailed outline.) The following concurrent or foreseeable future actions may occur in the Clear Creek watershed: • Eastside Allotment project (decision 2014): This project includes an adaptive management plan to improve pasture and water quality conditions while keeping livestock numbers the same. • Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning (decision 2015): This project proposes 65 miles of nonsystem roads for decommissioning, which will improve water infiltration and reduce soil erosion potential. • Harvest of state of Idaho lands: The Bruin Storm project harvested approximately 160 acres with a seed tree prescription in the Lower Clear Creek subwatershed in 2013. This activity was included in the ECA analysis. • Private land harvest: This project includes undetermined amount and prescription of harvest of private lands in the Crane Hill area (Upper Clear Creek subwatershed) in the next 5 years. Harvest is expected to occur on less than 200 acres. The first two projects are considered watershed improvement projects and will help to improve water quality and quantity. Any increases in erosion and subsequent sediment yield would be short-term and in isolated locations. The last two projects are harvest activities that could increase ECA and soil erosion. The small amount of acreage involved would increase ECA by <1% in the Clear Creek watershed. These projects would follow water and soil quality protection practices regulated through the Idaho Forest Practices Act. Alternative A—No Action Cumulative effects arise when the incremental impact of an action is added to impacts from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions. Alternative A would create no direct or indirect effects; therefore, no cumulative effects to water yield or sediment yield would occur under this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D  Water Yield 3.11.6.3.2Even though NFS lands comprise 72% of the Clear Creek watershed, they contribute 84% of the average annual flow of Clear Creek. The estimated existing ECA for the Clear Creek watershed is 4% and includes past activities on Forest Service, state, and private lands. Because harvest and burn history were not available for private or state lands, size and date of forest openings were determined using NAIP imagery in ArcGIS and Google Earth software. Estimated increases in ECA from the Clear Creek project are 9% for Alternative C, 8% for Alternative B, and 7% for Alternative D. When these increases are added to the existing ECAs, they produce ECA estimates that predict what watershed conditions will be like after the Clear Creek project. Final ECA estimates are 13% for Alternative C, 12% for Alternative B, and 11% for Alternative D. A lower ECA indicates a higher (better) watershed condition. ECAs of <15% at the HUC10 scale indicate high (good) condition (NOAA 1998). A 6% increase in average annual water yield for Clear Creek was calculated for Alternative C using formulas and graphs from Forest Hydrology - Hydrologic Effects of Vegetation Manipulation, Part II (USDA FS 1973). Most 3rd through 5th order drainage channels on the Nez Perce National Forest can sustain a 10% increase in average annual runoff as a result of Line graph that shows the decrease in percent ECA over time, from 2013 to 2037timber harvest before increases are detectable (USDA Forest Service 1973). Clear Creek is a 5th order stream starting two miles from within the Forest Boundary (confluence with Middle Fork Clear Creek) to the mouth. ECA estimates predict that watershed conditions would remain high (good) under all three action alternatives and percent increase in annual water yield would be below the 10% detectable level. Therefore, no stream channel alteration from increased water yield is expected from the Clear Creek project in mainstem Clear Creek. As shown in Figure 3-11, ECA would decrease to its pre-project level (4%) after 12 years for Alternatives B and D and after 14 years for Alternative C. ECA from Clear Creek activities would no longer be discernible after 22 years.   Figure 3-11. Percent Equivalent Clearcut Area (ECA) Over Time for Clear Creek Watershed (5th Field HUC) (Note: Includes Forest Service and private lands)  As shown in the above discussions, a broad review of available literature discussing harvest activities and water yield/peak flows was conducted. Much of the analysis regarding water yield for this project was based on older literature (1970s) that established general thresholds and guidance for determining ECA, ECA recovery, and increases in water yield. They also created the foundation for Nez Perce Forest Plan (1987) direction. Alternatively, new research indicates that water yield increases (and associated effects on streams) may not be as important as previously thought, especially in the context of contemporary forest management. The primary concern about changes in water yield is how they may directly or indirectly affect stream channels, aquatic habitat, and water quality. Numerous studies have documented the effects of forest canopy removal on water yield, but surprisingly, very few have demonstrated a direct link between water yield changes and channel impacts in a forested environment. For example, Schnakenberg and MacDonald (1998) found no correlation between ECA and stream channel characteristics in forested catchments in Colorado. MacDonald et al. (1995) studied the relationship between WATSED-predicted water yield increases and channel characteristics on the Kootenai National Forest. None of the channel types (pool riffle or colluvial step-pool) showed any increase in bankfull width or width-to-depth ratio with more intensive management. However, correlations were found between management indices and sediment characteristics; these correlations suggest that sediment delivery is a more important consideration than water yield. Analysis of reference and managed streams on the Flathead National Forest suggests no relationship between bankfull width and the degree of management (Kendall 2011), a finding that is consistent with the results of MacDonald et al. (1995). Grant et al. (2008) conducted a comprehensive literature review and determined no field studies have made a direct link between peak flow increases and channel impacts. Grant et al. (2008) concluded that the effects of peak flow increases are relatively minor in comparison to other anthropogenic changes to streams and watersheds. In general, channel impacts associated with peak flow increases alone are likely to be much less significant than other impacts associated with forest management activities. Management-induced increases in peak flow generally diminish with the percentage of watershed impacted and increasing recurrence interval. Management effects on peak flow events over a 6-year recurrence interval are highly speculative (Grant et al. 2008). Considering the merits of all viewpoints and the above analysis, increases in water yield or peak flows are not anticipated to be detectable at the HCU10 scale (5th order stream) and negligible stream channel alteration form increased flows are expected from the Clear Creek project. Project design measures including no-cut harvest buffers, green tree retention guidelines, low to moderate severity prescribed burning, and implementation of Best Management Practices would reduce likelihood of increased water yields.  Sediment Yield 3.11.6.3.3Although the NEZSED model did predict an increase in sediment yield, the increase was below that allowable under Forest Plan Appendix A for the associated prescription watersheds. Figure 3-12 shows the predicted sediment yield percent over base increased at the Forest boundary from Clear Creek project activities for each alternative. Estimated percent increase in sediment yield would be highest in Alternative C at 17%, followed by 16% for Alternative B, and then 14% for Alternative D. Estimates includedthe existing sediment yield over base from past project activities, plus the additional sediment yield generated from the Clear Creek project. As indicated between the years 2013 to 2014 a slight decrease is shown due to the implementation of the SF/WF Road Decommissioning project. Also, sediment yield percent over base declines below the existing amount in 2021 (as modeled) due to the 13 miles of road decommissioning and Line graph showing a decrease in sediment yield at the Forest Service boundary from 2013 to 2022road improvements proposed in the Clear Creek project. Road density in the Clear Creek watershed was reduced from 2.7 mi/mi2 to 2.6 mi/mi2.   Figure 3-12. Sediment Yield Percent Over Base (Natural) for Clear Creek at Forest Service Boundary (Note: Includes National Forest System lands only)  An upward trend analysis following guidance from Conroy and Thompson (2011) was completed for the project (Appendix J). The analysis showed that although there would be some short term increase in sediment yield, there would be long term improvement over the existing condition (Appendix J). Implementation of project design measures, adherence to BMPs, and maintenance of no-harvest RHCAs would reduce potential erosion and further limit the risk of sediment reaching streams. Any sediment yield increases would be short-term (0–6 years following project activities), and beneficial uses in Clear Creek and the Middle Fork Clearwater River would be maintained. 3.12 WILDLIFE This section summarizes the effects of the alternatives on the management of wildlife resources. This section was modified from the “Clear Creek Restoration Project Wildlife Report,” located in the project file.  Analysis Area 3.12.1Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects analysis areas considered home range size, mobility, habitat requirements, habitat availability, and habitat quality of the analyzed species. In most cases, the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects analysis area is the 43,700-acre project area which includes all proposed activity areas. It is large enough to assess the effects of proposed activities, but not so large as to make habitat changes undetectable. . Effects were based on the acres of potential habitat treated by proposed activities, or affected by natural events such as fires, insect and disease outbreaks and so on. The timeframe for direct and indirect effects is 5 years (unless otherwise stated), which is the estimated time needed to complete harvest activities. For old-growth, elk, and lynx predetermined analysis units were used as required by Regional or Forest Plan direction. There are 7 old growth analysis areas, 7 elk analysis areas (EAAs), and a small portion (3,300 acres) of one 24,000 acre lynx analysis unit in the analysis area. The analysis area includes 43,700 acres of National Forest within the upper two-thirds of the Clear Creek drainage which includes the 9200 acres (21%) Clear Creek Roadless Area. The roadless nature of this area provides secure habitat for many species, such as wintering elk herds, which are dependent on more remote, isolated environments with relatively little human disturbance. Terrestrial environments in the area are diverse and provide habitat for many birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Wildlife habitat is dominated by grand fir and western red cedar at mid-elevations (91%). Open, dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forest, dry and moderately moist grand fir/Douglas-fir forest, and grasslands comprise 8% of the lower elevation, more westerly portions of the area. Cool subalpine forests in the headwaters make up the remaining 1% of the area. The primary ecological settings in the area are the Idaho Batholith Breaklands, Idaho Batholith Uplands, and Idaho Batholith Subalpine. The Subalpine setting is found on only 160 acres, has no treatments proposed in it, and will therefore not be addressed in this assessment. The Breaklands provide a variety of forest conditions that offer a mix of forage and cover for wintering big game and many forest raptors. Large trees, especially western larch, Douglas-fir, western red cedar, grand fir and some ponderosa pine, provide habitat for a variety of cavity-using species. Fires and endemic insect infestations also provide a continuous supply of standing snags for wildlife nesting and feeding. Young forests are essential for providing quality elk and white-tailed deer winter browse. Preferred browse species include redstem ceanothus, mountain maple, scouler willow, and service berry. These are associated with mixed-coniferous forests and are adapted to, and thrive following, dry-season (summer/fall) fire. North-slope habitats provide mid-seral and mature forest habitats for northern goshawk. Southerly exposed habitats provide mature, open-forest conditions for flammulated owls. Large patches of mature and old-forest habitats throughout provide nesting and foraging habitats for pileated woodpecker. Large standing/down dead wood levels typically range from 7 to 13 tons/acre. Sensitive and Management Indicator Species that would benefit the most from achieving the desired vegetation conditions on the breaklands include the flammulated owl, pygmy nuthatch, goshawk, pileated woodpecker, and elk summer and winter range. The Uplands provide young-forest habitats that offer quality elk and deer spring, summer, and fall forage. Plant communities with Pacific yew are a key moose winter browse. Moose favor mature grand fir forest habitats with a closed tree canopy and moderate snow depths. Moose also successfully forage in shrub habitats commonly following stand-initiation disturbances. Large patches of mature- and old-forest provide nesting and foraging habitats for pileated woodpecker and denning and prey habitats for fisher and American marten. Mid-seral and mature-forests provide habitat for northern goshawk. Infrequent wildfires favor the accumulation of large standing/down dead wood, which typically range from 20 to 40 tons/acre. Standing snags provide roosting habitats for several Sensitive bat species (fringed, long-legged, and long-eared myotis) as well as foraging and nesting habitat for a variety of birds. Large downed wood provides cover, foraging, and denning habitats for Sensitive western toads and ringneck snakes. Sensitive and Management Indicator Species that would benefit from achieving the desired vegetation conditions in the Uplands include the American marten, fisher, moose, elk winter range, pileated woodpecker and goshawk.  Regulatory Framework 3.12.23.12.2.1 Nez Perce Forest Plan The 1987 Forest Plan documents goals, standards, objectives, and guidelines for managing Forest wildlife species and habitats. Project related Forest Plan wildlife standards and objectives are displayed in Table 3-42. The Proposed Action complies with the Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan requirements relevant to wildlife species and their habitats.  Proposed Forest Plan Amendments and Impacts to the Wildlife 3.12.2.1.1Resource Appendix C contains the proposed site-specific Forest Plan Amendment for soils. The proposed activities would create some disturbance to wildlife from noise and activity by human and machines. The duration would be two or three days in each affected unit, during daylight hours. The long-term benefit for wildlife from the soil amendment would be repairing scarred areas to the level of producing vegetation that would function as forage or habitat for terrestrial species. Appendix D is a Forest Plan Amendment to Appendix N: to adopt best available science for classifying old growth and snag management at the Project specific level. This allows a better interpretation of different habitats, age, number of trees, basal area and other characteristics that assist the biologist with which wildlife species would use different types of old growth. The Forest Plan is less detailed, but does encourage field verification. The amendment table shows the number of samples: which are the number of plots from the plot data base that met the screening criteria and are used in the old growth type descriptions. The amendment does not affect Forest Plan requirements for the amount and distribution, or identification and designation of old growth. The amendment would not affect the Forest plan for MA 20. The snag amendment provides the best available science for determining snag potential and recommendations for snag retention according to the habitat type affected by the prescribed harvest treatment. The amendment would provide more snags for wildlife than the Forest Plan standards.  Table 3-42.

See Chapter 2, Design Measures.  3.12.2.2 Endangered Species Act of 1973 This act directs that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by federal agencies do not jeopardize the continued existence of any threatened or endangered species, or result in the adverse modification of habitat critical to these species. It is also the responsibility of the Forest Service to design activities that contribute to the recovery of listed species in accordance with recovery plans developed as directed by the ESA (50 CFR part 402). Section 9 of the ESA of 1973, as amended, requires threatened and endangered species be protected from “harm” and “harassment” wherever they occur, regardless of recovery boundaries. This Project analyzed effects to Canada lynx, the only listed wildlife species in the Project area. All Action Alternatives are consistent with the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD) and are in compliance with the ESA and FSM 2670. Informal coordination with the USFWS on this Project was initiated on September 28, 2012. 3.12.2.3 National Forest Management Act This act requires the Forest Service to “provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use objectives (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(B)). The Forest Service’s focus for meeting the requirement of NFMA and implementing its regulations is on assessing habitat to provide for diversity of species. All alternatives would be consistent with NFMA direction for diversity of animal communities. Although the Action Alternatives analyzed in the Project may impact individual animals, the Project would not affect the viability of any species across its range. The Vegetation Section discusses the distribution of age classes (successional stages) and shows the Project area is trending toward historic distributions of each successional stage. Design measures (Chapter 2) were developed to retain elements of diversity (green trees, snags, and large down wood) in harvested areas. Additionally, there would be no timber harvest in RHCAs or verified old growth. Sensitive Species: Sensitive wildlife species are those that show evidence of a current or predicted downward trend in population numbers or habitat suitability that would substantially reduce species distribution. Federal laws and direction applicable to sensitive species include the NFMA and FSM 2670. The Forest is required to determine the potential effect of proposed activities on SS and to prepare biological evaluations. The Forest Service is bound by federal statutes (ESA, NFMA), regulations, and agency policy (FSM 2670) to conserve biological diversity on NFS lands and assure sensitive species populations do not decline or trend toward listing under the ESA. This document fulfills the requirements of the biological evaluation for sensitive species. The Proposed Actions would not affect sensitive species viability on federal lands, nor would it cause sensitive species to become federally listed as threatened or endangered. Species Viability: The Proposed Action, in combination with and within the context of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future management actions in the Analysis Area, would not affect population viability or distribution of native and desired nonnative vertebrate species on the Forest. The Draft Idaho Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (IDFG 2005) contains information on species of concern or interest including range-wide and state-wide status and known population information. At the Forest-wide scale, this Project would not disturb, agitate, or bother populations to a degree that causes, or is likely to cause, a measurable decrease in productivity by substantially interfering with normal breeding, feeding, or sheltering behavior.  Resource Indicators 3.12.3The primary indicator for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects to wildlife species is the effect to their habitat, or disturbance associated with proposed activities. Existing habitat conditions were determined by field observations, vegetation data, habitat modeling, disturbance/management history, and sighting records. Analysis indicators for species analyzed in detail are displayed in Table 3-43.  Table 3-43.

These features are snags, old growth and riparian areas.  Snags 3.12.3.1.1Snags have been recognized by the scientific community as critical habitat for numerous vertebrate wildlife species (McClelland 1977; Thomas et al.1979). Standing dead trees provide some of the most suitable nest and roost sites, owing to characteristics of wood and its decay patterns (Bull et al.,1986). Snags provide forage opportunities for woodpeckers and other cavity nesters to feed on insects and other invertebrates that are boring holes in the trees or digesting tree cambium. Species that depend on snags and analyzed in this section include bats, black-backed woodpecker, fisher, pygmy nuthatch, American marten and pileated woodpecker. These species use snags for nesting, perching or foraging, and/or a combination of uses. Natural effects to recruitment of snags include fire events, insect and disease outbreaks. Natural factors affecting the loss of snags include fire, wind or snow events, soil slumps or landslide events and decay. Human effects that increase snags are from man-made fire. Likewise, snags are lost from timber harvest operations, prescribed burns and firewood cutting. The management for snags is found in Appendix N-3 of the Forest Plan. The Nez Perce Snag standards include: Riparian areas- manage to support 80% of maximum populations of snag-dependent species by maintaining a minimum of 1.8 snags/acre; with 1 snag per 10 acres ≥ 20”dbh & rest ≥ 12”dbh. Due to windthrow or other causes, in riparian areas, 5 green trees/acre must be retained: 1≥ 20”dbh, the others≥ 12” dbh. All other areas outside of riparian areas are to support 60% of maximum populations of snag-dependent species by maintaining a minimum of 1.4 snags/acre; with 1 snag per 10 acres ≥ 20”dbh & rest ≥ 12”dbh. Due to windthrow or other causes, in riparian areas, 4 green trees/acre must be retained: 1≥ 20”dbh, the others≥ 12” dbh. Clumps and individual trees should consider safety, resistance to windfall, efficient logging operation, ease of slash treatment and protection from firewood cutters. The Clear Creek Project would use Forest Plan Amendment #42 to retain or recruit more snags per acre than the Forest Plan Standards. Using the best available science, Bollenbacher et al. (2009) recommend 9-14 snags per acre, depending on the habitat types. For all proposed units, and average of 14-28 live and/or dead trees per acre would be maintained. The numbers and dbh for snags would vary according to the habitat type of the unit (see snag portion of Amendment 42).  Old Growth 3.12.3.1.2The same forest plan Amendment #42 would replace the Forest Plan standards for old growth with best available science from Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 2/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11. Table 1 in the document shows the description, minimum criteria and associated characteristics of old growth by habitat type. The amendment adopts definitions for old growth based on successional stages, habitat types and other site conditions by Green et al. 1992. Old growth indicator species are wildlife dependent on or find optimum habitat in old growth stands for at least part of their life cycle. Primary indicator species are the pileated woodpecker, northern goshawk, and fisher; while the American marten is considered a secondary indicator species as it inhabits both mature and old growth stands. The Amendment would not change the Forest Plan objective for MA 20, which is to maintain viable populations of old-growth dependent wildlife species. To maintain the latter, a minimum of 10% of total forested acres should be managed as old growth, with ≥ 5% of the forested acres managed as old growth within each prescription watershed or combination of watersheds (5,000 to 10,000 acres). If less than 5% of old growth is in a drainage, additional required acres will be assigned to adjacent drainages from available excess old growth. An additional 5% of forested acres in each prescription watershed shall be designed as replacement old growth.  Stands will be identified through the use of stand exam information, aerial photos, and field reconnaissance. Stands should be ≥ 300 acres; however, the next best would be a core block of 150 acres with blocks ≥ 50 acres less than . mile away. If existing blocks of old growth are less than 100 acres, stands between the old growth blocks will be designated as replacement old growth and managed as an old growth complex. If the complex contains less than 50% of the old growth component, then the entire complex should be considered as replacement old growth. Linear strips ≥ 300’ wide along streams are acceptable if more suitable sites are not available. Where possible, roads should not be located through or adjacent to old growth stands to reduce human disturbance, snag loss to firewood cutters, windthrow and micro-climate changes. To increase the probability of species immigration and colonization of old growth islands and to facilitate genetic exchange between isolated population demes, a system of interconnected corridors of old growth islands is required. Riparian zones will serve as the principal means to provide these interconnecting corridors. Finally, verify the quality, amount and distribution of existing and replacement old growth habitat as part of project planning (Forest Plan, Appendix N-1,2). The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration (CCIR) Project would meet the 10% old growth Forest Plan standards in all alternatives.  Riparian Areas 3.12.3.1.3Riparian areas are important to many wildlife species for forage, water, cover, nesting, in some cases denning, movement corridors, and vegetation diversity or structure. Kauffman and Krueger (1984) present a rich list of referenced authors that discuss the value of riparian ecosystems to wildlife. Olsen et al. (2007) discuss the the importance of stream-riparian areas for amphibians. Knopf et al. (1988) explain that less than 1% of the western landscapes in the US are covered by riparian vegetation, yet this habitat provides for more species of breeding birds than surrounding uplands. All wildlife species analyzed by the forest are known to use riparian areas sometime in their life cycle. Forest Plan goals mention maintaining a diversity and quality of habitat to support viable wildlife populations (Goal 3), provide habitat and contribute to recovery of T&E species (Goal 4), stream channel stability and water flow (Goal 20), water quality (Goal 21) and protect or enhance riparian-dependent sources (Goal 22). Forest Objectives address managing riparian areas for the betterment of wildlife and other values Page II-5, FP. Standard 1 for the Wildlife and Fish resources is to maintain viable populations of existing native and desirable vertebrate wildlife species; which would include the habitats of such.  Forest Plan Standards for Riparian Areas (Page II-22): abbreviated 3.12.3.1.4interpretations 1. No management in riparian areas that causes detrimental changes/conditions in water quality or fish habitat. 2. Preferential consideration to riparian-area dependent resources (wildlife, fish, plant). Protect and if applicable, improvement of such resources. 3. All effects on wetlands or floodplains must be considered in all alternatives during the environmental analysis process. 4. Delineate and evaluate riparian areas in project areas prior to activities. 5. Manage riparian areas for cover and security for riparian-dependent species with emphasis on T & E species.Analysis  Methodology 3.12.4The Nez Perce Forest Plan designated 11 management indicator species (MIS). The Forest Service Northern Region (R1) has identified 21 sensitive species (SS) that are suspected or known to be present on the Forest. The USFWS recognizes the Forest as secondary area, unoccupied habitat for threatened Canada lynx. Additional information for these species can be found in the Project file. The wildlife analysis identifies wildlife species and/or their habitat potentially present in the Analysis Area. Species include ESA listed, sensitive and MIS. The analysis presents the distribution, population status, and habitat ecology of each species and their existing habitat conditions. Modeling of potential habitat in the Analysis Area was conducted using GIS and was based on vegetative characteristics preferred by each species. Table 3-44 displays the habitat criteria used to identify suitable habitat for each species. Suitable habitat considered includes that necessary for breeding, nesting, rearing, and foraging activities. Suitability is based on stand characteristics such as tree species, tree size, and tree canopy cover. Other habitat quality considerations include patch size, snag numbers and size, downed wood, riparian habitat, and security areas. Stand criteria used to assess species’ habitat suitability were obtained from peer-reviewed technical literature on species specific research. Table 3-44.

This provides a broader scale context relative to the Analysis Area. Samson’s Conservation Assessment (2006a) work was based on literature reviews, habitat use in the Northern Region, estimates of habitat per national forest, short and long term viability evaluations for 4 species (northern goshawk, black-backed woodpecker, flammulated owl and pileated woodpecker). The conservation assessment is based on a principle-based approach to population viability analysis (PVA). The methods and background for this approach uses point observation data and vegetation inventory information based on Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to build wildlife habitat relationship models and analyze short-term viability. FIA produces statistical reports and analytical information on status and trends in forest area and location; species, size, and health of trees; total tree growth, mortality, and removals by harvest; wood production and utilization rates for various products; and forest land ownership during the period 1975 though July 2001. The Samson (2006b) habitat estimates added analyses on the fisher and American marten with the four previously mentioned species, and uses data through 2005. Estimates of forested habitat for each national forest in the USDA Northern Region were developed by remote sensing to provide estimates of forest versus non-forest habitats. He discusses threshold habitat amounts, home ranges of species and minimum viable population for six species. Bush and Lundberg (2008) review Samson’s work and document updates to his habitat models (metric units, habitat types, formatting errors and so on) used in Region 1 and provide estimates of habitat amounts. All three of these documents and their authors are referred to in the wildlife sections for the concerned species. Their work is referred to as the potential amount of forest scale habitats for these species. The analysis for species in this project is based on vegetation models and information collected in the field. The effects of the project are described and provide the potential acres of habitat the project would affect for each analyzed species. Discussion of the regional analyses is to compare project effects to the calculated amount of forest available habitat produced by the region.Viability of the concerned species is at a much larger scale than the project level. This analysis uses the best available science to assess effects. Data related to vegetative features model potential habitat, including species, age, size, density, canopy cover, and harvest history were taken from the TSMRS, FSVEG, FACTS, 2011 VMap, and LIDAR databases. Disturbance events were analyzed from fire history, insect and disease updates and harvest history. Other forest layers used for potential habitat or impacts to species include roads, streams, land ownership and so on. The database was recently updated with stand exams that were conducted in 2011 and 2012. ArcMap GIS was used for modeling, mapping, and quantifying habitats and Project impacts. Considerable information on wildlife habitat conditions was obtained from the following four supporting documents: Clear Creek NFMA Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2011a); Selway and Middle Fork Clearwater Rivers Subbasin Assessment (USDA Forest Service 2001); Proposed Land Management Plan Nez Perce National Forest (USDA Forest Service 2007a), and; the Nez Perce National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a). Field review of treatment areas was conducted in 2011 and 2012. Field visits combined with National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images were used to validate information gathered from other sources. The Idaho State Conservation Data Center (CDC) is the primary storehouse of sensitive or rare wildlife species survey and observation data. CDC data was mapped within a 5-mile radius of the Project area boundary to identify sensitive species potentially using the Project area. Additional wildlife sighting from district historical records may be used in this section. Old-growth habitat was identified using NRIS R1 Old-Growth Report Query based on 2011 and 2012 stand exams and field review during the same time period. The Idaho State Wildlife Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy provides background habitat and population information and is incorporated by reference (IDFG 2005). Information for bird species has been synthesized from the Northern Region Land Bird Monitoring Program with data available from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (Sauer et al. 2011). Population trend information for elk and moose was synthesized from data available from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game research reports. This analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial sensitive species and fulfills the requirements of the required Biological Evaluation, per direction pertaining to the FSM and streamlining process (USDA Forest Service 1995). The streamlined process for doing biological evaluations for sensitive species focuses on the following two areas: • Incorporating the Effects on Sensitive Species into the NEPA Document • Summarizing the Conclusions of Effects of the Biological Evaluations for Sensitive Species The following Regional Forester sensitive species may occur in the Project area: black-backed woodpecker, fisher, flammulated owl, fringed myotis (bat), gray wolf, long eared myotis, long-legged myotis, mountain quail, pygmy nuthatch, ringneck snake, and western toad. 3.12.4.1 Species Dropped from Detailed Analysis The following Sensitive species or MIS species were dropped from detailed analysis as suitable habitat is not present, or the project would not affect individuals or their habitats: American peregrine falcon, bald eagle, bighorn sheep, black swift, Coeur d’ Alene salamander, common loon, harlequin duck, long-billed curlew, Townsend’s big-eared bat, white-headed woodpecker, yellow-billed cuckoo, and grizzly bear. Appendix F includes a table displaying these animals and the reasons why they were not further analyzed. 3.12.4.2 Species Analyzed in Detail The area used for species analysis is primarily the 43,700 acres Project area scale. This scale is small enough to detect potential changes in habitat but not too large for them to be diluted beyond measure. There are several species where specifically identified analysis units are required to be used for the analysis. They include: Old Growth Analysis Areas (OGAAs), Lynx Analysis Units (LAUs), and EAAs. The common direct affects from the action alternatives to the following analyzed species would be potential disturbance from project activities. This would include noise from machinery and other human activities. Those species dependent on current habitat may be displaced from the proposed activities. Other species may move to unharvested areas during daylight hours and return during hours of darkness. The latter species may continue to visit units between the time periods of different activities. Upon completion of the activities (roadwork, timber harvest, prescribed burning, tree planting) in the units some species would return. The time frame of return depends on the species and its preference for the various stages of revegetation that would occur over time. Fire suppression is the foreseeable management action that would occur in the project area that could affect species habitats. It is the only foreseeable action considered in the cumulative effects analysis for all species. All past activities are considered as part of the existing condition and there are no present activities that would affect the analyzed species. Private and state lands comprise a very minor presence in this project area (less than 1,000 acres among 3 sections in the northwest corner. Due to the small size and lack of information on present or foreseeable activities, the cumulative effects of fire suppression to the analyzed animals in this report would be immeasurable.  Environmental Consequences 3.12.53.12.5.1 General Effects of Proposed Action Alternatives for Wildlife The existing condition of the project area was created by natural events (wildfire, insect and disease outbreaks, weather events (drought, climate change, and so on)). Human-caused events are considered as well: harvest history, roads. These events are explained in other sections of this chapter (vegetation, fuels, aquatics, noxious weeds, rare plants, soils and watershed.) The general indirect effects of the action alternatives would be disturbance noise from machinery, human activities and presence (project activities, woodcutting, recreational activities, and so on) and smoke from prescribed burns. Some losses of potential habitat would occur to the analyzed species. Indirect effects would be an animal’s avoidance of the area until activities are finished. Some individuals of various wildlife species would be potentially displaced, until forest vegetation reaches the structure (age, density, cover, availability of food, security) that would encourage individuals to return. Cumulative effects vary dependent on the species preference for certain types of forest structure. Past actions leading to the present condition are explained in other sections of the chapter as mentioned in the first paragraph of this short segment. 3.12.5.2 Threatened, Endangered, Candidate or Proposed Species (TES)  Canada Lynx 3.12.5.2.1The Canada lynx was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in March 2000. A Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy (Ruediger et al. 2000) or LCAS document was developed to attempt a consistent and effective approach to conserve Canada lynx and to assist with Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act. The Forest Service (FS) signed the LCAS with the USFWS in 2001, and agreed to halt projects that were “likely to adversely affect” lynx until the plans were amended. The renewed 2005 LCAS added the concept of occupied mapped lynx habitat. The USFWS issued a Recovery Outline for Canada lynx to serve as an interim strategy to guide and encourage recovery efforts until a recovery plan was completed. In 2006, the LCAS was amended to define occupied habitat and to list those National Forests that were occupied; the goal was to provide guidance necessary to conserve lynx (USDA Forest Service and USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). In March 2007, 18 Forest Plans were amended with the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD) Record of Decision (ROD) (USDA Forest Service 2007c NRLMD ROD, Attachment 1, p. 1). The LCAS was revised in August 2013 by the Interagency Lynx Biology Team, incorporating the best available science that had been published since previous editions. Based on examination of historical and recent evidence, the 2005 Canada lynx recovery outline categorized lynx habitat and occurrence within the contiguous United States as either core areas, secondary areas, or peripheral areas (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2005). “Core areas” show long-term persistence of lynx populations within the contiguous United States. These areas have verified records of lynx occurrence over time and recent evidence of reproduction. The fluctuating nature of lynx population dynamics and the ability of lynx to disperse long distances have resulted in many individual occurrence records outside of core areas, without accompanying evidence of historic or current presence of lynx populations. Areas classified as “secondary areas” are those with historical records of lynx presence with no record of reproduction; or they are areas with historical records and no recent surveys to document the presence of lynx and/or reproduction. If future surveys document presence and reproduction in a secondary area, the area may be considered for elevation as a core area. Secondary areas may contribute to lynx persistence by providing habitat to support lynx during dispersal movements or other periods, allowing animals to then return to core areas. In “peripheral areas” the majority of historical lynx records is sporadic and generally corresponds to periods following cyclic lynx population highs in Canada. There is no evidence of long-term presence or reproduction that might indicate colonization or sustained use of these areas by lynx. However, some of these peripheral areas may provide habitat enabling the successful dispersal of lynx between populations or subpopulations. Besides the recovery outline categories, the Forest Service’s NRMLD document addresses occupied and unoccupied forests. All lynx habitat on a forest is considered occupied if 1) there are at least two verified lynx observations or records since 1999, and 2) there is evidence of lynx reproduction on the national forest (NRMLD 2007b). Unoccupied lynx habitat would be the absence of the factors that are considered for occupied habitat. Core habitat is always considered occupied, while secondary and peripheral areas could be occupied or not by lynx. In the NRLMD, the Nez Perce National Forest was considered as unoccupied habitat based on the best scientific information available at the time of the NRLMD Forest Plan Amendment. Further information from past and present literature led the USFWS to modify their interpretation of lynx presence. In 2012, the USFWS sent a letter addressed to then Forest Supervisor, Rick Brazell on December 10, 2012 stating that “there is consensus that transient lynx may be present on the Nez Perce National Forest, at least occasionally”. The letter also stated that, “the issue of lynx occupancy on the NPNF is a separate but related matter that is not the focus of this letter, and did not change the NPNF status as ‘unoccupied’. Therefore, under the NRMLD, the Nez Perce National Forest is considered unoccupied, the USFWS has determined that lynx “may be present”, and the Forest is considered to be a secondary area. Lynx typically live in mesic coniferous forests that have cold, snowy winters and provide a prey base of snowshoe hare and other animals. Historical and current lynx records in the Northern Rocky Mountains occur primarily in the Douglas-fir forest, spruce-fir forest, and fir-hemlock forest. A gradient in the elevation distribution of lynx habitat is apparent across the area. In the higher latitudes of northern Idaho and northwestern Montana, lynx habitat generally occurs above 4,000 feet (Ruediger et al. (LCAS) 2000). Based on these habitat attributes, the Nez Perce National Forest mapped lynx habitats and established Lynx Analysis Units (LAUs) for the entire forest. An LAU is an area of at least the size used by an individual lynx, from about 25–50 square miles (Ruediger et al. 2000, Interagency Lynx Biology Team 2013). Historical (prior to 1999) and recent anecdotal observations of lynx across the forest have occurred. However, these observations are not “verified” as defined by the NRLMD (USDA Forest Service 2007b, pp. 99–100, 142–143; USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2006, p. 4), and anecdotal sightings do not determine a resident population. Reputable sightings include lynx caught in traps and then verified by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. The Rocky Mountain Research Stations conducted surveys for lynx in 2007 for the Nez Perce National Forest. The surveys were conducted according to established protocols outlined in the NRLMD (Ulizio et al. 2007). The surveys conducted in 2008 (hair snare) and 2009 (winter track surveys) were reduced in size and scope due to snow conditions, limited personnel and limited funding. No lynx were detected during any of these survey efforts (2007, 2008, or 2009). During the winter of 2013 snow track surveys were conducted for lynx, with no evidence of the animal detected. In this project, the modeled lynx habitat will be analyzed as secondary areas that may provide habitat for dispersing lynx to travel between core areas. The USFWS concluded that Forest vegetation management in secondary areas would provide adequate connectivity and forage habitat for dispersing lynx in the absence of specific habitat management direction (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2007). The analysis for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on Canada lynx is the action area encompassing the project area (43,731 acres) and LAU 30 (24,057 acres). Modeled lynx habitat in this LAU contains the following habitats: foraging (34%), denning (33%), unsuitable (2%), and non-lynx habitat (31%). Disturbance in the past 30 years has been from wildfire (1,817 acres) and timber harvest (1,012 acres). The total disturbance in LAU 30 is 2,829 acres or 11.7%. This conforms to the Standard Veg S1 of no more than 30% of the lynx habitat in an LAU is currently in a stand initiation structural stage (see Appendix F). Standard for Veg S2 is met as only 61 acres (less than 1%) have been regenerated in the past 10-year period. The threshold for this standard was no more than 15% (see Appendix F). LAU 30 is an isolated unit. No LAUs are adjacent to it, and the closest neighbor is about 1.8 miles to the south. The next nearest LAU is 5.7 miles east of LAU 30. Some habitat above 4,000 feet is located outside of LAU 30 and within the project boundary. Habitat modelling shows the area is lacking optimal conditions for boreal forest conditions. Grand fir, western cedar and Douglas fir are the dominant overstory within the project area. The same habitat is found in the portion of the LAU that is located within the project boundary. About 12% of the analysis area has some Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir (USDA Forest Service 2013). This is scattered throughout the area and does not possess the integrity of a connective corridor to lynx as discussed by authors (Squires et al. 2013). LAU 30 intersects two different WUIs: one lies on the east side of the LAU, while the other is on the north portion. Activities in the action area are located in the northern WUI. Of the approximate 3,300 acres that lie in both the LAU and the project area, 1,220 acres is foraging habitat, 1,420 acres is denning habitat, 112 acres unsuitable, and 545 acres is non-lynx habitat. Both den and forage habitats are dominated by grand fir with some subalpine fir and a small component (10%) of lodgepole pine. Non-lynx habitat may consist of lakes, meadows, tundra, rock outcroppings, talus fields, and stands not capable of providing lynx habitat. The effects analysis extends 25 years into the future, allowing for new understory feeding habitat and downed woody accumulation to develop in many areas. Population Trends: Lynx populations occur at naturally low densities and very few museum or trapping records exist for Idaho County (McKelvey et al. 2000). No Canada lynx sighting records have been reported in the Project area (IDFG 2010), and the results of previous surveys have been mentioned. The Nez Perce National Forest considers lynx may be present. This does not suggest that lynx are breeding, denning, or rearing young on the Nez Perce National Forest, but that lynx may move through the Nez Perce National Forest during dispersal events. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no direct or short-term indirect effects to Canada lynx as no treatments would be conducted. Red squirrel (an alternate forage species to snowshoe hare) habitat would remain available on nearly 50% of mature and old forest in the Analysis Area and about 46% of the LAU. Over the long term (50–100 years), forest succession would continue in the analysis area, as modified by natural processes. Existing younger patches would continue to grow and mature. This succession would tend to reduce lynx foraging habitat, but would increase lynx denning habitat. If wildfires or extensive windstorms occur in the area, foraging habitat could be replenished, but these events may decrease denning habitat. Insect infestations and root disease would continue causing numerous dead trees to fall to the ground, which may provide high quality denning habitat if downed logs are densely layered. Because the events and processes that might affect forest succession (and therefore lynx habitat) in the analysis area are either unknown or highly variable in frequency and size, the long term indirect effect on lynx of Alternative 1 is not predictable. Alternatives B, C, and D Activities proposed for the portion of LAU 30 are timber harvest, temporary road construction and decommissioning, prescribed burning and tree planting. Initially, over 200 acres of pre-commercial thinning were proposed. Some studies have found that this thinning of the understory reduces forage and cover for snowshoe hares (Bull et al. 2005, Griffin and Mills 2007). Therefore, all precommercial thinning has been dropped in the LAU. All harvest units are under 40 acres, with vegetative buffers in between. Connectivity would remain available for lynx by such buffers, as well as riparian and mature stands. Regeneration and/or commercial thinning treatments would revert areas to the stand initiation stage, and over time create snowshoe hare habitat within proximity to denning habitat. Desired stand conditions (see target stands in vegetation section) may offer denning opportunities with prescriptions for snag, green tree, and coarse woody debris retention. Initially, some units occurred in modeled lynx habitat. Field surveys by the silviculturist found the “denning” habitat did not have the composition of desirable tree species (LPP, SAF, ES), nor the structure (root wads, woody debris, blowdown) to meet the definition of denning habitat in the NRMLD ROD, 2007. Therefore, no denning habitat in this LAU would be affected by the project. The result of regeneration harvest would create a transition of the affected units to a stand initiation stage by removing the dense grand fir overstory and diseased Douglas-fir. For Alternative B, proposed commercial thinning would occur in 66 acres of foraging habitat, and regeneration in 7 acres of foraging habitat. Combined harvest treatments in Alternative B would treat about 1% of forage habitat in the LAU. Under Alternative C, foraging habitat would be modified by about 0.7% from proposed regeneration harvest (6 acres) and commercial thin of 55 acres. Finally, Alternative D would modify forage habitat by less than 0.7%: 55 acres from commercial thinning and 2 acres from regeneration. The commercial thinning treatments would remove trees but would retain some overstory cover. The regeneration harvest treatments would remove most trees and convert the stands over to a stand initiation structural stage. Direct effects to an individual lynx would be noise and logging activities that may disturb lynx and cause the animal to avoid the affected areas. These disturbances would occur during daylight hours, including traffic in all timber harvest units and vehicles traveling to our away from these locations. During hours of darkness, lynx may visit these areas for hunting or to travel through to other locations. The prey base (e.g., snowshoe hares, squirrels,grouse) for lynx would also be affected by the above disturbances and would move into adjacent areas. During hours of darkness some of these animals may move back into harvest units to forage. Indirect affects to the lynx would be its prey base may concentrate along the edges or boundaries of harvested units during nighttime hours. This may offer a more clustered prey base for the lynx to hunt. The timing of the harvest activities would occur during the normal operating season- late June or early July to October. However, these activities may continue during the winter months, if soil standards are met. During wet seasons (late fall or spring) activities are usually suspended due to soil concerns. The proposed units in LAU 30 are in the southern portion of the Project area. Once logging equipment is moved to that area, it is highly likely that the contractor will focus his resources on completing each block of units before moving on to the next. The regeneration harvest units and one commercial thin unit are clustered in two blocks. A 60-acre commercial thin unit is west of these blocks. It is feasible that all of these units could be harvested in one season. However, it is possible that the duration of these activities may take up to two seasons, about 18 months. Approximately 36 miles of temporary road building and decommissioning would occur in the Action area. Within LAU 30, about 1.68 miles of temporary roads would be constructed to access timber units (see Appendix F). The largest section would be less than 0.5 miles. All temporary roads would be closed to the public and re-contoured after the project is finished. These activities would create effects of noise and human activities. Again, the disturbances would occur during daylight hours. The roadwork and construction of about 2 miles of temporary roads would begin in July and be completed no later than August. The construction occurs about a year prior to harvest operations, in order to let the road prism settle and harden before vehicles travel over the track. All activities would occur in daylight hours, and be restricted to a small area of disturbance (the width of the road, plus any cuts and fills). Decommissioning would happen at a later season, after harvest and log hauling is finished. The estimated time span of this work would be from 2 weeks to a month. Prescribed burning is planned for the regeneration units to clean up slash and to prepare the units for tree planting. Burning activities would generate noise from mechanical (vehicles, pumps) and human activities. Prescribed burning would occur during daylight hours, however, some personnel may stay on site during hours of darkness to monitor the fire. Lynx and other animals would avoid the area due to fire, smoke, noise, and human activity. Recently burned areas usually would not provide forage for the snowshoe hare until the next plant growing season. However, lynx may hunt or move along the edges of these units. The timing of prescribed burning in the harvest units would generally occur in the autumn, though compatible weather conditions may offer opportunities in the spring. Burning would occur about 3 years after the harvest: allows tree needles to drop from slashed limbs, the weight of the snows to break limbs and compress the slash, and let the woody debris dry out or cure. Once prescribed burning begins, monitoring of fire activities in each unit may warrant up to a week of spot checks after the prescribed burn was initiated. Tree planting usually occurs during the spring season after the prescribed burn. Disturbances to lynx and its potential prey would be from vehicles and the tree crews moving through units. This activity occurs during daylight and is of very short duration, usually a day or less per unit. The planting crew would require no more than a 15 day period during May and/or June to accomplish all planting of units in the LAU. In the short-term (0 to 20 years), these acres converted by timber harvest or prescribed fire would be unsuitable habitat until forage becomes available for the snowshoe hare. As the affected areas become older than roughly 20 years of age, the trees become dense and tall enough to provide cover above the snow line and winter forage habitat for the hare. The combined activities fall within compliance of the standards, guidelines and objectives of the 2007c NRLMD (see Appendix F) and the intent of the LCAS (2013). Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action Timber harvest in the Clear Creek Project area has occurred between 1931 and 2009. Timber sales conducted between the early 1950s and late 1990s involved many miles of new road construction, little to no tree retention in regeneration harvest areas, and dozer piling of slash. Since then, forest practices have been modified through project design measures, BMPs and Forest Plan guidelines to reduce ground-disturbing activities. A total of 2,829 acres (11.7%) of lynx habitat in the LAU has been harvested or burned within the last 30 years. These areas are in the stand initiation or earlier structural stage, potentially providing summer forage habitat for snowshoe hares. A small amount (2%) of this habitat would become potential winter snowshoe hare habitat in 10 years. The rest of the disturbed areas would reach that stage in about 25 years. There would be no cumulative effects to hare or lynx habitat since there are no future foreseeable activities that would affect it. Alternatives B, C, and D Past and proposed actions are accounted for and discussed under the direct and indirect effects sections above. Of the action area considered (64,492 acres), 11,912 acres (18.5%) would be affected by some type of vegetation treatment. In the 24,057 acre LAU 30, the action alternatives would affect approximately 1.2%–1.7% of lands by timber harvest. Of this, 1% or less would be in foraging habitat for lynx. No areas to be treated are considered multi-story forest. All prescribed burns would be within the unit boundaries. Disturbances generated by the above activities would be short-term, pulse-like occurrences in each individual timber unit. Five of seven units would have temporary roads built. About 1 year later, each unit would be harvested. Temporary roads would be re-contoured. Three to five years later, prescribed burning would be mostly completed. Roughly, 1–2 years after units have been burned, tree planting would occur. All affected regeneration units would be in the stand initiation phase upon the completion of the above activities: producing understory plants, shrubs and seedlings for snowshoe hare summer forage. Commercially thinned units would be further along in the stand initiation phase, with residual trees and shrubs offering cover and forage for snow shoe hares. In some cases, these stands may provide winter forage for snow-shoe hares. Precommercial thinning units would not provide the latter. However, the latter type of treatment would not occur in LAU 30. Besides continued fire suppression in the area, the other foreseeable actions in the project area include: • Browns Spring culvert replacements (decision 2012): This activity involves the replacement and upsizing of 2 culverts in the Upper Clear Creek subwatershed. • Eastside Allotment project (decision 2013): This project will improve pasture and water quality conditions. • Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning (decision 2012): This project proposes 65 miles of nonsystem roads for decommissioning, which will improve water infiltration and reduce soil erosion potential. • Harvest of State lands: The Bruin Storm Project would seedtree harvest approximately 160 acres in the Lower Clear Creek subwatershed in the next 5 years. • Private land harvest: project includes undetermined amount and prescription of harvest on private lands in the Crane Hill area (Upper Clear Creek subwatershed) in the next 5 years. Currently, the combination of the Nez Perce and Clearwater Forests has occurred at the administrative level. The newly unified forest is in the planning stages for a new Forest Plan. This will affect all resources (e.g., wildlife, fisheries, soils) by the methods and approaches they conduct for future analyses in their area of concern. New science literature has been affecting analysis and types of activities in lynx habitats. Projects in unoccupied lynx habitat must consider that lynx may be present, and analysis should use an evaluation table (Appendix F) for NRMLD consistency (Region 1 letter, dated 2009). Some research in Montana suggests that lynx select homogenous spruce–fir patches, and avoided recent clear-cuts or other open patches (Squires et al. 2010). Further discussion in the research article shows that the latter avoidance was apparent during winter, but not so during summer months. Squires et al. (2013) investigated lynx movements in Montana to predict travel corridors based on the animals’ resource selection and movement behavior. This study would be of value as the combined Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests wildlife program analyzes the re-mapping of LAU boundaries and considers travel or linkage corridors in the new forest plan. The effects of future fire suppression in the project area and the LAU cannot be determined since the amount of potential suppression is not known. None of the listed foreseeable actions would occur in LAU 30. Cumulative effects from the project activities would affect less than 2% of the LAU. Existing potential for Canada lynx habitat and snowshoe hare winter habitats are expected to remain available, well distributed and connected (Squires et al. 2013), within the LAU due to minimal proposed management. Under all action alternatives, the NRLMD standards and guidelines would be met in the LAU. The biological determination for all action alternatives is a May Affect, but is Not Likely to Adversely Affect the Canada lynx or its habitat. This determination is based on the following: • All objectives, standards and guidelines in the 2007 NRLMD would be met. • Short-term direct effects to transient lynx may occur related to disturbance (noise and mechanized equipment) during implementation of vegetation treatment. However, any short-term impacts would be offset by the positive benefits of regenerating snowshoe hare habitat for lynx foraging as described as a Guideline in VEG G1(see Appendix F). • Travel habitat would be maintained across the LAU. Lynx may be present, and are potentially transient animals traversing across the forest. Thus no long-term impacts to individual lynx and their habitat are anticipated. • Forest roads generally have low speeds and are gravel, and do not pose a threat to lynx. No permanent road construction is proposed. Any new temporary roads constructed will be recontoured after use. • Lastly, the proposed Federal actions described under Alternative B, C, and D are not occurring within designated critical habitat. 3.12.5.3 Region 1 Sensitive Species  Fringed, Long-eared, and Long-legged Myotis 3.12.5.3.1The fringed, long-eared, and long-legged myotis are Region 1 Sensitive species. Habitat for the fringed, long-eared, and long-legged myotis occurs in the project area. The fringed myotis is also considered a species of greatest conservation need in Idaho (IDFG 2005). All three species are known to be multiple habitat bats in regard to roosts, hibernacula, and foraging habitats. They utilize caves, mines, buildings, cliff faces, bridges, exfoliating tree bark, snags, and crevices in rocks as roost and hibernacula sites. Large trees with protective bark and large snags provide the primary roosting habitat in the Analysis Area. No hibernacula sites are known in the project area. All three species forage where winged invertebrates are available: riparian areas, tree canopies and clearings. All of these areas would encompass the majority, if not all of the project area. Therefore, the estimates for bat species potential occurrence are based on habitat elements each species prefers for roosting. Bat presence on the forest has been detected during the late spring and summer seasons. When bats forage for periods longer than a couple of days, they would require a place to roost. Therefore, the computer analysis for potential bat habitat is based on literature pertinent to roosting habitat needs of each species. The long-legged myotis occurs in sagebrush steppe, grasslands, and forested montane regions (Romin and Bosworth 2010). Habitat is often relatively continuous tracts of late-successional forest. They forage throughout most of the night (Keinath 2004) in and above the forest canopy (Warner and Czaplewski 1984). In managed forests, the long-legged myotis avoided harvest units unless large snags and old trees were left in relatively high densities, such as in shelter woods and aggregate retention patches (Taylor 1999). These bats have been found in north central Idaho foraging in managed forests with trees that range from 5 to 15 inches in diameter (Johnson et al. 2007). The long-eared myotis often occurs in rocky areas in an extensive variety of habitats (Adams 2003). Individuals typically roost under bark, in tree cavities, in crevices in cliffs, or in abandoned buildings (Romin and Bosworth 2010, Harvey et al. 1999, Nagorsen and Brigham 1993). The species has been found roosting in the snags and stumps of Douglas-fir, western hemlock (Barclay and Kurta 2007), western red cedar (Arnett and Hayes 2009), and pine (Vonhof and Barclay 1997). Arnett and Hayes (2009) found in their study and others (Crampton and Barclay 1998, Cryan et al. 2000) that the long-eared and long-legged bats typically roost in older forest stands. There are 16,844 acres of suitable roosting habitat for long-legged and long-eared bats in the Project Area. The fringed myotis inhabits a variety of habitats, including sagebrush steppe, grassland, and montane forests (Adams 2003, O‘Farrell and Studier 1980), primarily at middle elevations of 3,900 to 7,050 feet. It is often found in dry habitats where open areas are interspersed with mature forests, creating complex mosaics with ample edges and abundant snags (Keinath 2004). There are 277 acres (see criteria in Table 3-45) of potential roosting habitat in the project area for fringed myotis. The reduction of large diameter trees and snags from previous harvests and the transition of older forests dominated by large shade-intolerant tree species toward a dense structure of smaller diameter, shade-tolerant tree species, primarily due to fire exclusion (Wisdom et al. 2000) have reduced bat roosting habitats. Fire exclusion has changed species composition: gradually replacing ponderosa pine, white pine and western larch, with species less fire tolerant, smaller size, and younger age classes that are more susceptible to insects and disease before reaching maturity. These conditions have limited suitable habitat for fringed myotis in the project area. Two long-legged and 2 long-eared myotis were captured in the Analysis Area in 2006. Both locations occurred in grand fir forest older than 130 years. The fringed myotis has not been observed in the Project area but they were netted during a bat survey at Moose Creek Ranger Station in 1998. The Station is within 15 miles of the project area and it is assumed that this species could occur in the project area. Population Trends: Long-legged and long-eared myotis have a global rank of G5 (secure) and an Idaho State rank of S3 (vulnerable). The long-eared myotis is a bat of western North America and one of the most widely reported bats in northern Idaho (Romin and Bosworth 2010). The fringed myotis has a global rank of G4/G5 (apparently secure/widespread, abundant, and secure) and an Idaho State rank of S2 (imperiled). The Western Bat Working Group (1998) ranked long-eared myotis and long-legged myotis as moderate conservation concern. The present population status of fringed myotis is unknown. The Western Bat Working Group concluded that it may be uncommon or rare through most of its western range. It was one of the least common detected species during surveys in northern Idaho (Romin and Bosworth 2010). Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action No timber harvest, roadwork or prescribed burning would occur under Alternative A. Fire exclusion allows forest canopies to become more dense; inhibiting sunlight to potential roost sites. This alters the microclimate of roosts and limits easy access to the sites (Vonhof and Barclay 1997). Fire suppression would continue under this alternative and habitats would become denser, creating conditions that would promote stand-replacing fire. Wildfires can change vegetative structure and composition, altering roost habitat by removing loose, exfoliating bark and opening tree canopy. However, fires assist in snag recruitment, thus potentially providing more roost sites. This alternative could have both positive and negative impacts on long-legged, long-eared, and fringed myotis. Alternatives B, C, and D Alternative B would treat 1,278 acres (7.6%), C would treat 1,283 acres (7.6%), and Alternative D would treat 877 acres (5%), of long-eared and long-legged myotis habitat through regeneration and improvement harvest. Thirty to thirty-five acres would be commercially thinned under all alternatives. Under all Action Alternatives, landscape burning would occur on 7 acres (less than 1%) and no PCT would occur in roosting habitat of long-eared and long-legged myotis habitat..Temporary roads would affect 3 acres of less in all action alternatives. Alternatives B and C would treat 47 acres (17%), and Alternative D would treat 39 acres (14%) of suitable fringed myotis roosting habitat using regeneration harvest. Under all Action Alternatives, no prescribed or landscape burning would occur in fringed myotis roosting habitat. Temporary roads would affect less than one acre of habitat. All proposed activities would occur during daylight hours when bats are usually roosting. Prescribed fire would be initiated during daylight hours, however, it would continue to burn or smolder into hours of darkness. Fatality or displacement may occur to some individuals located in units during harvest, temporary road construction or burning operations. Other general effects of activities are mentioned in the Environmental Consequences. Large tree and snag, old-growth, and riparian habitat retention, would provide adequate snag habitat for the bat over time. Timber harvest would remove some roosting habitat. However, retained live trees, snags, and legacy trees within treatment units would provide for some roosting and foraging opportunities. Regeneration harvest would also enhance herbaceous growth important for insect production and bat foraging. Long-legged myotis would likely use treated areas due to tree retention within the units. Treatments in fringed myotis habitat would create open areas adjacent to mature stands that contain snags preferred for roosting. Design features include the retention of an average of 14–28 tpa in regeneration and improvement units, of which 9 to 14 snags or recruitment snags of various sizes would be retained. Prescribed burning would be both positive and negative. It would create new snags but may reduce habitat availability by removing bark on trees or causing snags to fall. Burning would create more open areas preferred by fringed myotis resulting in slightly increased suitable habitat. Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no cumulative effects to myotis species since cumulative effects can only arise from proposed actions when combined with past, present, and future foreseeable actions. There are no proposed actions associated with this alternative. However, large snags near roads open to public motorized access may be lost to firewood cutters. Alternatives B, C, and D The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 100 years because it would take this long to develop large snags in regeneration harvest and burning areas. Past actions have been accounted for in the Environmental Consequences that contribute to the existing condition. Potential roosting habitat for the fringed myotis would be removed or modified by 17% from Alternatives B and C, while Alternative D would impact about 14%. For the long eared/legged bats, Alternatives B and C would remove or modify about 8% of their roosting habitat while Alternative D would impact about 5%. Foreseeable actions from the Brown Spring culvert replacement would have no impact on the bats. Same for the Eastside Allotment project, as the selected alternative would not change from the present allotment plan. The Clear Ridge Road decommissioning project would reduce some potential foraging habitat, but that would recover in about five years from the end of the project. Any trees affected by the re-contouring of roads would not be of the age preferred for roosting habitats. The Crane Hill private land harvest may affect bat habitat, as acres affected and prescription harvest is unknown. Fire suppression is a future foreseeable management action that could affect snag and old growth habitats. This management tool may reduce snags for safety standards, yet maintain more old trees and snags by suppression efforts that save them from wildfire. Again, snags near roads open to public motorized access are susceptible to loss for firewood cutting. Wildfires may be allowed to burn in the Clear Creek Roadless Area; however there is no way to determine the extent of fires that may occur. Fire suppression would continue outside the Roadless Area where snags would be created primarily through insect and disease outbreaks. These would be available for use by bats. The direct and indirect effects of the action alternatives are expected to maintain suitable bat habitat both within and outside of treatment areas. Old growth and PACFISH buffers would provide habitat during the cumulative effects time frame. Fire suppression and allowing fire to burn in the Roadless Area would also provide habitat for bats. Forest Plan standards for 1.4 snags/acre of appropriate dbhs would be modified by Forest Plan Amendment 42, leaving 9-14 snags on average per acre, an increase of ten-fold compared to current Forest Plan standards. . Alternative A would create No Impact on the bats or their habitats. Alternatives B and C would affect about 14% of potential fringed myotis habitat. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination for fringed, long-eared, and long-legged myotis is May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or reduced viability for the population or species. Forest management activities can have direct (e.g., fatality) and indirect (e.g., loss of habitat and/or changes in prey availability) impacts on bats. Roost abandonment or death can occur in the winter if bats are disturbed (Adam 2003). Forest Plan Amendment 42 would retain about 10 times the snags or snag recruits compared to current Forest Plan standards. More snags would be available for bat species during the spring and summer period when they are in the project area. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for bats include Standards 1, 7, and Page II-6 from Table 3-43.  Black-backed Woodpecker 3.12.5.3.2The black-backed woodpecker is a Region 1 sensitive species found in post-fire areas and in areas of insect outbreaks. They occur at highest densities in 1–6 year-old burns where there are abundant snags for nesting and beetles and wood-boring insects for feeding (Hutto 1995a, 1995b; Saab et al. 2004). The woodpecker’s presence is primarily influenced by the occurrence of high severity burn patches (Hutto 1995a,b). Hoyt and Hannon (2002) detected black-backs in a burned area, but not in old growth or mature stands within 30 miles of the 2-year-old burn. However, the woodpeckers did occupy old coniferous stands located 45 to 90 miles from the recent burn. Old forests offer habitat for black-backed populations to persist between fires in regions with long fire intervals (Bonnot et al. 2008). Bull et al. 1986 found the majority of black-backed nests in dead trees of Ponderosa Pine, lodgepole pine and western larch in their northeastern Oregon study. Nielsen-Pincus (2005) found a preference for Ponderosa pine in her study. Bull et al. (1986) suggest the black-backed woodpecker prefers dead Ponderosa pines because the trees have a thicker layer of sapwood than do other tree species of the same size. Nearly 180,000 acres burned on the Nez Perce National Forest between 2006 and 2011. Over 155,000 acres burned in 2012. On average 20,000 acres burned per year for the last 20 years. Insect and disease activity has also been occurring since the 1980s. All of these areas that were disturbed in the past 8 years provide potential habitat for black-backed woodpeckers. Population Trends: Idaho ranks this species as S3 (vulnerable). Breeding bird survey (BBS) data show a long-term upward trend of >0.25% per year since 1966 in northcentral Idaho (Sauer et al. 2011). Idaho Partners in Flight estimates a population of 4000 birds in Idaho. The state-wide population objective is to increase bird numbers to 4400 (Rosenberg 2004). Samson 2006b indicates 29,406 acres of suitable habitat are required to maintain a viable black-backed woodpecker population in Forest Service Region One. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show over 700,000 suitable acres on the Nez Perce Forest alone. As of September 22, 2012, the very active and prolonged fire season on the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests has created over 200,000 acres of burned habitat. From the amount of disturbance and thresholds for viability, there appears to be adequate black- backed woodpecker habitat across the Forest. A discussion of Samson’s work and Bush and Lundberg’s (2008) modelling is located after Table 3-45. Bush and Lundberg (2008) used their criteria for black-backed potential habitat: if the plot≥ 8 recently dead trees/acre between 8”-16” dbh. However, not all of these snag areas would have suitable habitat for the woodpecker if the trees have been dead 8 years or longer. As opposed to forest and region-wide analyses for the black-backed woodpecker, the district biologist compared recent (past 8 years) fire history and insect or disease outbreaks. This information is updated in GIS layers in annual or biennial periods. One fire burned 36 acres within the Project area in 2008. No other fires have occurred that would provide highly suitable habitat. Endemic populations of black-backed woodpeckers are likely sustained by dying and recently dead standing trees from localized insect and pathogen activity (USDA Forest Service 2007d), such as the tussock moth outbreak that occurred in 2011 in the upper South Fork of Clear Creek. The combined fire and insect affected acres provides an estimated 2,357 acres of suitable habitat for the woodpecker in the Analysis Area. Field surveys targeting pileated and American three-toed woodpeckers were conducted in 2012 in the Analysis Area. One of 12 sample units detected black-backed woodpeckers. These surveys did not target black-backed woodpeckers, so this is an underestimate of black-backed woodpecker presence in the Analysis Area. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action None of the proposed activities would be implemented. Tree mortality is expected to continue in the upper South Fork tussock moth outbreak area. Root disease is also prevalent in the Analysis Area and would provide a continuous supply of snags. Fire suppression would continue allowing for an increase in fuel loading. This would make the area susceptible to a stand replacing fire event which would create highly suitable black-backed woodpecker habitat. Alternatives B, C, and D Alternative B would treat 276 acres, Alternative C would treat 287 acres, and Alternative D would treat 248 acres of potential black-backed habitat through regeneration and improvement harvest. Regeneration harvest would remove snags where necessary for logging safety but would retain them where possible. The snag amendment to this project would retain an average of 9-14 snags/acre, which is 10 times the 1.4 snags/acre in the Forest Plan standards. Regeneration harvest would reduce canopy coverage and foraging opportunities for black backed woodpeckers in affected units. Improvement harvest would reduce canopy cover to 30%–40% which is at or just below preferred levels but would retain large trees and snags. Commercial thinning would retain more trees per acre than the regeneration or improvement cuts. However, not all snags would be retained; only 9-14 snags per acre are required for the snag amendment. In units to be commercial thinned, the desired condition is retention of trees that will benefit from reduced competition. Commercial thinning would treat 233 acres in Alternative B, 223 acres in C, and 215 acres in D. In summary, potential black-backed woodpecker habitat that would be affected regeneration harvest, improvement harvest, and commercial thinning would be 509 acres (22%) in Alternative B, 510 acres (22%) in Alternative C, and 463 acres (20%) in Alternative D. An example of treatments in or around woodpecker habitat for Alternative C can be found as a map in Appendix F. Pre-commercial thinning (66 acres in all alternatives) would not impact woodpecker habitat since only small trees are being removed. Landscape burning would occur on 7 acres within all alternatives, which would have insignificant effects on habitat. However, approximately 2,000 acres of prescribed burns outside of current owl habitat would create potential habitat for the woodpecker. Any fire-killed snags would provide potential nesting and/or foraging opportunities for up to 8 years. In general, project activities would reduce insect and disease mortality and reduce the risk of future stand-replacing forest fires on 20% to 22% of suitable habitat. Commercial and precommercial thinning would indirectly promote large tree growth for future roosting sites but would remove little habitat. Effects to the woodpecker would be disturbance as mentioned in the Environmental Consequences and removal of habitat by harvest or prescribed fire. The latter may also cause a recruitment of snags. Use of the Project area by black-backed woodpeckers would continue because untreated areas would continue to provide feeding and nesting habitat. All verified old growth and riparian areas would also be available to the woodpeckers. Outside of fire or insect outbreaks, these latter habitats would most likely provide the most snags and decay present in the forest. The proposed alternatives would meet Forest Plan standards for retaining10% old growth and would meet the Forest Plan amendment for snags. Cumulative Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no cumulative effects to black-backed woodpeckers since cumulative effects can only arise from proposed actions when combined with past, present, and future foreseeable actions. There are no proposed actions associated with this alternative. However, woodcutting along roads open to public motorized access would remove snags near such roads, which may reduce woodpecker habitat. Alternatives B, C, and D The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 100-150 years because it would take this long to develop habitats with high levels of snag habitat. Past actions have been accounted for in the existing condition (see the Environmental Consequences for wildlife). As mentioned, disturbance would be likely to individual black-backs that are foraging or nesting in proposed unit boundaries. Landscape and prescribed burns would create snags that may provide woodpecker habitat. There will be no treatment in verified old growth or riparian areas, which may become susceptible to future fire or insect and disease outbreaks. The landscape burns of nearly 2,000 acres would provide some foraging and/or nesting habitat to woodpeckers. Snags or recruited snags would also be available in riparian and old growth stands. Foreseeable projects of the Eastside Allotment and Clear Ridge Road decommissioning would not affect black-backed habitat. The Brown Springs culvert replacement project would not affect the woodpecker or its habitat. The private land harvest may impact insect or diseased trees, but the proposed acreage and treatement is unknown. Fire suppression is a future foreseeable management action that could affect snag and old growth habitats. In the absence of fire suppression, wildfires would likely burn more acres, creating more snags, but potentially burning up old growth areas that may take up to 150 years to recover. This management tool may reduce potential snags by fire suppression or by removal of burned trees for safety standards. In some cases fire suppression for some small fire outbreaks would save old growth or existing snags. Wildfires may be allowed to burn in the Clear Creek Roadless Area; however there is no way to determine the extent of fires that may occur. A burn may create highly suitable woodpecker habitat for up to a decade. Fire suppression would continue outside the Roadless Area where snags would be created primarily through insect and disease outbreaks. These would be available for use by woodpeckers. The direct and indirect effects of the action alternatives are expected to maintain suitable woodpecker habitat both within and outside of treatment areas. Fire suppression and allowing fire to burn in the Roadless Area combined with the retention of old growth and other retention areas would maintain habitat for black-backed woodpeckers. No cumulative effects are therefore expected from the Action Alternatives when combined with fire suppression. The Forest Plan Amendment for old growth and snags would provide more structure than Forest Plan standards to support some black-backed individuals foraging in old growth or riparian areas within the project area. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the black-backed woodpecker include Standards 1, 7, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Alternative A proposes no actions, so this would create No Impact on the woodpecker. Alternatives B, C, and D, a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species for the black-backed woodpecker. Design criteria and unit layout would manage for snag retention or recruitment for the next 10 to 25 years after the project is completed.  Fisher 3.12.5.3.3The fisher is a Region 1 sensitive species, a Forest MIS, and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). There have been 11 fisher observations (2 observed tracks, the rest are individuals or trapping records) reported within five miles of the Analysis Area between 1982 and 2005. Two occurred outside the northeast corner of the Project area. The scattered distribution of these reports indicate well-distributed habitat. Fishers are associated with mature coniferous forests and specific structural elements—particularly large trees and coarse woody debris (Ruggiero et al. 1994). They inhabit mesic, coniferous forest between 3,500–6,000 feet elevation, although habitat preference changes with season, age, and sex (Badry 2004; NatureServe 2012). Fishers avoid open ground (Buskirk and Powell 1994; Powell 1993) and have a preference for structurally complex areas with multiple canopy layers, including understory shrubs and large amounts of woody debris (USDA Forest Service 1998b, Powell 1993). Ruggiero et al. (1994) concluded that riparian zones, high elevation old growth grand fir, and subalpine fir stands are important habitat components for fisher (Powell 1993). Fishers appear able to use "many different habitats for hunting as long as these areas provide overhead cover at either the stand or patch scales" (Weir and Harestead 2003, p. 9). Sufficient overhead cover in foraging habitat may be provided by either tree or shrub cover. Although fisher home ranges are consistently characterized by moderate to high proportions of mid- and late seral forests, there are few overarching patterns of selection for particular seral conditions or species compositions (Sauder and Rachlow 2014). Raley et al. (2012) hypothesized that when fishers select home ranges, they benefit from including a diverse array of available forest conditions by increasing access to a greater diversity and abundance of prey species while still attaining habitat features important for reproduction and thermoregulation. Sauder and Rachlow’s (2014) results are consistent with this contention. In a study on the Nez Perce National Forest in the Elk City area from 1985 to 1988, most fisher observations were in mesic grand fir habitat types (Jones 1991). Grand fir and Engelmann spruce dominated stands the fishers used in summer. Similarly, in winter fishers used grand fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine dominated stands. Summer habitat had a relatively high component of moderate to large diameter Engelmann spruce, large diameter Douglas-fir, and pacific yew. Fishers avoided stands with a strong lodgepole or ponderosa pine component. Winter habitat included stands with a relatively high basal area in Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine. Fishers also strongly selected wetland forest types, with selection for forested riparian habitats evident at several scales in summer and winter (Jones 1991). In summer, 50% and 75% of observations were within 49 and 75 feet of water. Moving across landscapes, fishers commonly used forested riparian areas, where preferred resting habitat and prey may be more available than in surrounding habitats. In north-central, Idaho, home ranges contained 53% mature/old growth stands on average. In summer, 90% of observations were in mature/old growth forest. In winter, 54% were in mature/old growth and 46% in young forest (Jones and Garton 1994). The authors speculated that the shift in diet between the seasons was likely due to prey availability. Availability of large diameter logs (>21 inches dbh) appeared to be particularly important in winter habitat selection. Mature/old growth stands were used extensively for resting, while hunting occurred in a range of successional stages, including young sapling and pole forest. For resting, fishers preferred stands with canopy cover greater than 60% and for hunting they preferred canopy cover greater than 80%. They avoided areas with less than 40% canopy closure and drier habitats. There are 10,037 acres (23%) of currently suitable summer habitat (mature/ old forest) and 13,570 acres (31%) of winter habitat (seedling/sapling/young forest) for fisher in the analysis area. Though more acres of mature forest exist in the project area, the available habitat focuses on a combination of tree canopy cover greater than 40%, an age class of 100 year or older, as well as the diameter class shown in Table 3-45. Population Trends: Fishers have a global ranking of G5 (secure) and a state rank of S1 (critically imperiled). Fishers are distributed throughout most of their historical territory in the Clearwater drainage, although the population remains at a low level (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994). Samson (2006b) indicates 74,380 acres are required to maintain a viable fisher population in Forest Service Region One. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show over 440,000 suitable acres of summer habitat and over 700,000 acres of winter habitat occur on the Nez Perce National Forest. . For descriptions of the above acreages estimated by the authors, please refer to the paragraphs following Table 3-45. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no direct effects to mature or old growth habitat since no activities are proposed. Habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as succession and insects/disease. Fire suppression would continue. Snag and large down wood habitat elements would remain available as trees die (and fall) from natural causes. A wildfire and/or insect and disease activity would leave greater numbers of snags and large down wood than exist now but would also reduce canopy cover. These more open areas would provide unsuitable conditions for fisher. Ongoing fire suppression may help maintain mature and older habitats on the landscape longer. Winter habitat would continue to be available across the analysis area. Connectivity across the landscape would continue to be provided by RHCAs. Alternatives B, C, and D As an MIS, fisher populations would be expected to continue to display population stability across the Nez Perce National Forest under Alternatives B, C, and D. Proposed regeneration harvest would simplify suitable fisher habitats in the short term (<50 years) by eliminating canopy cover and layering, reducing large down wood, and reducing standing snags in treated areas. Snags and down wood would be provided for over the long term (100 years or later) through tree retention design features: average 14-28 trees/acre; 9-14 of which would be snags or snag recuits. Canopy cover would increase to suitable levels after about 30 years. Proposed commercial thinning would have minimal effects by retaining enough structure and overstory canopy to be used by fisher. The Action Alternatives would reduce the likelihood of a large, intense fire. Fires have both positive and negative effects on fisher (as discussed under the No Action alternative). Jones (1991) suggests that landscape scale habitat management should incorporate young- to mid-successional stages to provide habitat for prey species while retaining mature and late-successional habitats that provide important denning and resting habitat. The project has been designed to maintain all successional stages within the Project area, providing suitable habitat for fisher. Alternatives B and C would conduct regeneration and improvement harvest on 580 acres (6%) of currently suitable summer habitat and Alternative D regenerates 438 acres (4%). Landscape burning occurs on 22 acres (0.2%) and would have similar effects to regeneration and improvement harvest activities. Retained trees, snags, and down logs in these areas would provide future habitat for fisher as the stands age. All action alternatives commercially thin 35 acres (0.3%) of summer habitat. Commercial thinning would reduce canopy cover to 40%–60% and would maintain a canopy cover level suitable for fisher use. Alternatives B and C conduct regeneration and improvement harvest on 1,124 acres (8%) and 1,646 acres (12%) of fisher winter habitat respectively. Alternative D does not propose these types of harvest. No landscape burning is planned on fisher winter habitat under any alternative. Alternative B, C, and D commercially thin 2,210 acres (16%), 1,731 acres (13%), and 2,013 acres (15%), respectively. The effects of regeneration/improvement harvest and commercial thinning on winter habitat are the same as for summer habitat. Habitat quality in currently suitable summer and winter fisher habitat would decrease in all Action Alternatives. Alternatives C would convert 18% of mature habitat to early seral conditions. Alternative B converts 16% and Alternative D coverts 4%. No harvest would occur in verified old-growth or RHCAs under any alternative. These areas would continue to provide suitable habitat and well as connectivity between suitable habitat patches on over 30% of the landscape. Insects and disease events would continue across the landscape causing tree mortality. These would produce snags and large down wood used by fishers for denning and resting. Commercial thinning would have minimal effects on up to 16% of fisher habitat. Summer and winter fisher habitats would remain well distributed and available under all alternatives. Trends in fisher populations at the local and forest scale would not be affected by project activities due to the wide availability of suitable habitats. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area for fisher is the 43,700-acre project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 100 years which is the approximate amount of time required for stands to develop into a mature or older vegetative state and snags to develop into a condition that provides habitat for old growth and snag dependent species. Alternative A—No Action There would be no negative cumulative effects from this alternative since no actions would occur. The effects of fire suppression are the same as those discussed under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D Fire suppression could have positive effects on fisher habitat by limiting fire in mature and older forests. The cumulative risk to fisher habitat from the action alternatives is considered low because the project will meet Forest Plan standards for old growth and snags, PACFISH buffers will be applied in riparian areas, and other mature stands that would provide fisher habitat will remain after treatment. A 2015 research article found that core use areas within fisher home ranges were consistently composed of moderate amounts of both high canopy cover forest and moderate landscape edge density. These results support the hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity and diversity are important to fishers and influence habitat selection within home ranges (Sauder and Rachlow 2015). Early seral forest would provide winter forage habitat for fisher. Woody debris would continue to be recruited as trees age and die. The cumulative effects concerning this project would be insignificant and short-term (about 10 years) for the fisher. Future foreseeable projects, the Eastside Allotment and the Brown Springs culvert replacement, would not affect the fisher or its habitat. The Clear Ridge Road decommissioning would create disturbance to individual fishers. Upon completion of the project, the obliterated road prisms would produce vegetation in 3-5 years. Trees would be providing winter foraging habitat in 20 to 30 years. As trees mature to around 100 years of age, fisher habitat for all seasons would be available. The private land harvest would reduce potential fisher habitat. It is not known if the future intent for the land is to return to a forested condition. Foreseeable projects may disturb fishers by machine and human presence. Forest Plan standards being met by the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project for the fisher include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43.Alternative A would have No Impact on the fisher or its habitat. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species for the fisher.  Flammulated Owl 3.12.5.3.4This species is a Region 1 sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). The flammulated owl is a small owl, considered a neotropical migrant, nests in tree cavities and preys on insects (Hayward and Verner 1994, Powers et al. 1996). The diet of this owl consists mostly of nocturnal moths and insects gleaned from open tree branches, taken on the wing, or picked up from the ground. Idaho flammulated owl habitats are typically mid-elevation, mature or older open ponderosa pine and/or Douglas-fir forest (IDFG 2005). Groves et al. (1997) showed flammulated owls used “…stands with mature to old ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, multiple canopy layers, low tree densities, moderate to low canopy closure, and moderate ground cover”. They prefer habitat on warm, south facing slopes. Clear Creek has limited habitat for these birds; about 236 acres of suitable habitat in the analysis area. This habitat is scattered and occurs in relatively small patches. Better quality habitat occurs primarily on breaklands along lower Clear Creek. Samson (2006a) states that few estimates of territory size are available for the flammulated owl. Some researchers suggest that the owl’s habitat will decline due to fire suppression (Groves et al. 1997, Wright et al. 1997, Linkhart and Reynolds 2007), as suppression allows Douglas-fir trees to outcompete shade intolerant trees that are important for the owl. Another set of researchers (Nelson et al. 2009) suggest that flammulated owl habitat has declined over a period of 50 years. Their basis included the Jeffrey pine (which is not found on the Nez Perce Forest), and 10 western states that are outside of Idaho. The latter is not a feasible study to lend conclusions as to potential owl habitat conditions on the Nez Perce National Forest. Population Trend: In Idaho, the flammulated owl has a state rank of S4 (apparently secure). There is no population trend data for Idaho; however the Forest Service Region 1 conducted flammulated owl surveys across Montana and Idaho. Sixty-nine owls were detected on Nez Perce Forest. The 2005 effort included surveys in the nearby South Fork Clearwater River. Additional surveys were conducted in 2008 in Region 1, including on the Forest. Flammulated owls were detected on 55% of the routes with the Nez Perce National Forest having the highest proportion detections. A study conducted by Samson (2006a) found no scientific evidence that the flammulated owl is decreasing in numbers in the Northern Region of the Forest Service. Samson (2006b) elaborates on a 6-step decision tree to conclude that no data suggest the flammulated owl would be susceptible to change in its habitat as affected by forest management following a consistent and quantitative approach. (Samson 2006). Bush and Lundberg (2008) used FIA date to estimate that the Nez Perce Forest has about 39,579 acres. A more detailed description of regional modelling is found below Table 3-45. The district biologist used a forest model for the owl, then queried for tree ages greater than 100 years in order to establish mature habitat the bird prefers. Modelled potential habitat for the owl based on the criteria in Table 3-45 estimated 236 acres in the project area. There were 2 confirmed sightings 4 miles north of the Project area in 1995 (IDFG 2010). Flammulated owl presence in the Project area has not been confirmed. Flammulated owls are difficult to detect because they are nocturnal and have low population densities. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action No activities would occur under this alternative. Habitat would continue to be sparse, scattered, in large and small patches. Habitat quality and quantity would decrease as tree density in ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir habitats increase due to a lack of disturbance and fire suppression. Forest conditions would trend away from preferred open grown, old-growth habitats. The increase in tree density would also increase the risk of stand-replacing fire in potential habitats. This type of fire would lead to habitat loss. Nesting habitat would increase slowly as a result of insect and disease outbreaks where fire does not occur. Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration harvest would occur on 34 acres of suitable owl habitat under Alternatives B and C, and 27 acres under Alternative D. Harvest may remove snags suitable for nesting and roosting, due to safety concerns for personnel involved in timber or fire operations. It would also reduce the number of canopy layers and ground cover which would improve foraging opportunities for the owl. Total impacts to the owl’s potential habitat would be 14% from Alternatives B and C, and 11% from Alternative D. Design features would retain 14-28 tpa, of which an average of 9 to 14 snags or recruits per acre would be retained in units of the warm and dry habitat type groups (refer to Forest Plan Amendment 42). The retained trees would be in clumps or scattered individual trees. All legacy trees would be retained. Such trees would provide nesting and perching habitat after project implementation and into the future as stands become denser and develop multi-layered canopies. Wright et al. (1997) found that flammulated owls were present in approximately half of the selectively logged stands in her study area south of Missoula, Montana. Howie and Ritcey (1987), in a British Columbia study, found that most owls occurred in mature and old stands of Douglas-fir with 35%–65% canopy closure that had been selectively logged 2 to 3 decades prior. Improvement harvest would occur on 4 acres of potential owl habitat under all the action alternatives. Benefits resulting from harvest would include making ponderosa pine stands more resilient to wildfire, reducing the Douglas-fir and grand fir component, and managing large ponderosa pine habitats in an open understory condition. Canopy cover would be reduced, which provides for better owl foraging opportunities. However, with only 4 acres (<1%) planned in flam owl habitat, the benefits are immeasurable. An example of treatments in or around owl habitat for Alternative C can be seen as a map in Appendix F. No thinning or burning would occur in potential flammulated owl habitat under any of the action alternatives. However, about 2,000 acres of landscape burning is proposed in all action alternatives that would occur outside of the owl’s current habitat. Potential foraging habitat for the flammulated owl may become available as shrubs grow back. Flowering stages of the understory would attract invertebrates that the owl would feed on. The proposed activities concerning regeneration harvest would reduce nesting habitat. However, forage habitat may improve as shrubs take hold. The latter provide habitat for insects that are prey for the flammulated owl. All treatments would improve the resilience of ponderosa pine and create the forest structure necessary to support the flammulated owl over time. The proposed activities are not likely to alter the population trend at the project or forest level due to the mostly positive effects associated with them. The negative effects are expected to be limited and there is no sign of decline at the regional level (Samson 2006a). Owls would also continue to be able to use the treated areas primarily for foraging. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area for flammulated owl is the 43,700-acre project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 100 years which is the time it takes to develop large snags and trees used for nesting. Alternative A—No Action The direct and indirect effects of this alternative when combined with fire suppression could lead to negative cumulative effects on flammulated owl in the event of a wildfire. Snags would be created but canopy cover would be reduced. Determining the extent and probability is not possible; however 50% of the Project area is currently susceptible to stand replacing fire. Some snags adjacent to roads open to public motorized access would be cut for firewood gathering. Alternatives B, C, and D There would be both positive and negative cumulative effects associated with the action alternatives. The project would reduce the amount of flammulated owl habitat by 11% to 14% through regeneration harvest in the mid-term (50–100 years Improvement harvest would affect less than 1% of habitat in all alternativers. Disturbance to owls would occur in units and roads where activities and noise from humans and machines are present. The activities would occur in the daylight hours, and would not impact the owl’s foraging at night. Almost 2,000 acres of landscape burning is proposed. Though none of it is currently in flammulated owl habitat, it offers potential to create more habitat for the owl. The burning would reduce canopy cover and favor older tree species with thick bark, such as Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir. As the canopy is decreased, more shrubs would have potential to compete. These flowering plants would attract invertebrates that the owl forages for. As far as foreseeable projects, the culvert replacement and range allotment projects would not impact the owl. Additionally, the Clear Ridge road decommissioning is unlikely to knock down large trees preferred by the owl. The private land harvest may or may not impact habitat, but the prescription and volume is not known. Fire suppression would maintain dense stands in untreated areas reducing the quality of owl habitat and increasing the risk of stand replacement fire in those areas. The level of cumulative effects cannot be assessed but are expected to be negligible. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the flammulated owl include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Alternative A (no action alternative) would have No Impact on the flammulated owl or its habitat. The Action alternatives determination is May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species for the flammulated owl.  Gray Wolf 3.12.5.3.5Gray wolf is a Region 1 Sensitive species. Wolf habitat spans a broad range of elevations and habitat types. Key habitat components include: a sufficient year-round prey base of ungulates and alternate prey; suitable, somewhat secluded denning and rendezvous sites; and sufficient space with minimal exposure to humans (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1987). The Pilot Rock wolf pack uses the Analysis Area. One rearing location was documented in 2007, and wolves with pups were observed in 2007, 2008, and 2010, where two rendezvous sites have been confirmed. No den sites were identified. Two wolves were captured in Hoodoo Creek in 2007 and wolf tracks were observed in 2011. The Analysis Area provides a variety of suitable habitats for wolves and their prey. Ungulates comprise more than 90% of wolves' diets from spring through winter in the Rocky Mountains. Mule and white-tailed deer, elk, and moose are the principal prey species (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1987). Elk provide the primary prey base for wolves. Maintaining elk habitat effectiveness (EHE) above minimum Forest Plan standards, providing elk security areas above minimum recommendations and managing winter range to enhance elk forage productivity and quality would provide a sufficient prey base to sustain wolf populations according to State objectives for the Dworshak and Lolo Wolf Management Zones (WMZs). Population Trends: The gray wolf recovery plan (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1987) established a recovery goal of 10 breeding pairs for three consecutive years in central Idaho. There are currently 101 wolf packs in Idaho as of 2011. Recovery objectives have been met and exceeded. Hunting and trapping of wolves for control purposes has been approved by court decisions, allowing natural resource agencies and the public opportunities to take wolves. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect effects to denning or rendezvous sites. Habitat security would remain unchanged and high (see Elk section). Wolves would continue to have abundant prey sources. Continued fire suppression efforts may actually increase the risk for wildfire. Large insect or disease infestations or wildfire would reduce hiding cover for wolves and their prey, but forage for big game may increase over a period of 20 years. This would be a short-term benefit for the wolf in the analysis area. Foraging habitat for elk may decline in these areas after 20 years as a result of forest succession. Alternatives B, C, and D The proposed activities would have no direct or indirect effects on known rendezvous sites since no activities are proposed in or near them. All Action Alternatives would increase forage for elk. Harvesting and landscape burning would reduce tree canopy cover and promote the growth of native shrub species important for elk forage. The amount of forage from regeneration and improvement harvest would increase by 7%, 10%, and 5% under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Forage improvements would last for about 30 years. Hiding cover would decrease by the same amounts in the treated areas and would be recovered in about 20 years. Landscape burning on 3% of the Project area would promote forage growth on winter range in all Action Alternatives. Elk habitat effectiveness would decline during implementation of the Action Alternatives, but would return to levels at or above Forest Plan objectives (see Elk section).. Increases in elk forage, and therefore forage opportunities for wolves, are expected on 3% to 20% of the Project area. Reduced hiding cover would improve the potential hunting success for wolves in treatment areas. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area and includes seven elk analysis units. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years, as it would take this long for regeneration harvest and burned areas to develop into hiding cover. Cumulative effects were assessed using EHE because elk are the main prey base for wolves. Elk security was not addressed since there are no changes to it as a result of any of the alternatives. Alternative A—No Action The effects of this alternative are the same as those described under the direct and indirect effects. There would be no cumulative effects since there are no proposed actions with this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D The cumulative effects of the action alternatives on EHE and wolves would be both positive and negative. Fire suppression would reduce forage quality and quantity by not allowing fires to burn; however proposed activities would increase forage by 3% to 20% depending on the alternative. The level of potential positive or negative cumulative effects cannot be determined as fire severity and size is not predictable. Ongoing or foreseeable projects may disturb wolf individuals, but will not remove habitat that would affect dens, wolf movement or forage opportunities. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the wolf include Standards 1, 6, 7, 10, 13, FW 1, and Pages II-5 & 6 from table 3-43. Alternative A would create No Impact on the wolf. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species.  Mountain Quail 3.12.5.3.6This species is a Region 1 Sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). The species is on the fringe of its western range in Idaho and on the Forest (Idaho Partners in Flight 2000). Preferred habitat is dense thickets of rose, hawthorn, black currant, serviceberry, elderberry, blackberry, chokecherry and willow (Wisdom et al. 2000, Gutierrez and Delehanty 1999, Heekin and Reese 1995). They also use densely vegetated draws, shrubby understory and forest and meadow edges in open ponderosa pine and Douglas fir (Heekin and Vogel 1995). In Idaho, mountain quail habitat was dominated by tall shrubs that averaged 10 feet in height with an average canopy density of 45% that were within a few hundred feet of water. They occur most frequently in draws with shrub galleries along the breaks and secondary drainages of the Snake, Salmon, and Clearwater Rivers. Nests are primarily located within 200-300 yards of water since chicks require water soon after hatching (Johnsgard 1973; Wisdom et al. 2000). Known, recent locations on the Forest are in dry, low elevation, face drainages of the Salmon River. Mountain quail habitat is more commonly found on private lands at lower elevations in the Clear Creek watershed near Kooskia, Idaho (about 10 miles northwest of the Analysis Area) and along the lower Selway River canyon. Mountain quail historically occurred in the Project area. Mountain quail breed and winter in warm and dry shrub-dominated communities (IDFG 2005). Healthy shrub-dominated riparian areas are important features of suitable habitat and provide corridors for quail to move to higher elevation breakland habitat in summer. There are 187 acres of currently suitable early successional mountain quail habitat in the Project area. All if it is within VRU 3 in the Clear Creek Roadless Area and occurs along stream breaklands. VRU 3 contains 6% young seral conditions and is well below the desired condition of 15%–25%. A small covey of mountain quail were observed 1 mile from the northeast boundary of the Project area in 1997 (IDFG 2010); however the observations were not confirmed. Population Trend: Mountain quail populations have been declining in the intermountain west for the past several decades (Gutierrez and Delehanty 1999), and the Idaho population has experienced the same pattern of decline since the 1930s (Heekin and Reese 1995). Mountain quail occur along the Snake, Boise, Clearwater, Salmon, and Little Salmon River canyons (Heekin and Reese 1995). Remaining habitat areas are fragmented and populations often exist in isolated islands (Wisdom et al. 2000). Habitat in the Salmon River near Riggins, Idaho, supports a stronghold population. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Current habitat would become unsuitable over time as tree density and canopy cover increase and shade out shrubs. Habitats may become more susceptible to stand-replacing wildfire, which could threaten individual birds, yet may create additional habitat for quail. Alternatives B, C, and D Proposed landscape burning would increase mountain quail habitat by 19% (35 acres). Burning would reduce the Douglas-fir and grand fir component in ponderosa pine stands, retaining large ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir trees, and promoting shrub growth. Landscape burning would help maintain open conditions; however birds may be disturbed by proposed activities. The risk is considered low given the small amount of proposed treatment acres and the expected low number of birds in the area. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because this is when shrub habitat conditions would begin declining. Alternative A—No Action There could be minor cumulative effects from this alternative. No activities would be conducted to improve quail habitat and fire suppression would prevent the development of suitable habitat resulting from wildfire. Alternatives B, C, and D The action alternatives would improve habitat quality through the use of prescribed fire. Proposed treatments may increase the potential for allowing natural fires in the Roadless Area, which would be beneficial to quail. Fire suppression would continue outside of the Roadless Area, with little habitat improvement for quail. Some positive cumulative effects to mountain quail would be expected, however the limited amount of treated acres may not create an increased trend in quail populations. Ongoing and foreseeable projects in the area would not affect mountain quail habitat. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the mountain quail include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Alternative A would have No Impact on mountain quail or its habitat. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species of the mountain quail.  North American Wolverine 3.12.5.3.7On February 4, 2013, the USFWS proposed listing the Distinct Population Segment (DPS) of the North American wolverine (Gulo gulo luscus) in the contiguous United States as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). After further review of all available scientific and commercial information, the USFWS subsequently withdrew that proposal, and published their determination on August 13, 2014, that adding the North American wolverine occurring in the contiguous United States as a distinct population segment to the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants was not warranted (79 FR 47522). As a result of this action, the wolverine automatically returns to the R1 Sensitive Species list, and is analyzed as such. Wolverines occur naturally in low densities, and current population levels and trends are not definitely known (FR78 7868). However, there is evidence that their population is increasing (FR 79 47524) and that wolverines are expanding both within areas currently occupied as well as suitable habitat not currently occupied (FR 79 47536). Wolverines are not tied to any specific vegetative or geologic habitat features—they use a variety of habitats, including those altered by management activities and fire and can persist in areas with dispersed or developed summer or winter recreation activities. Wolverine occurrence is linked to the presence of deep, persistent snow (as modeled by Copeland et al. 2010) across their range, except for denning, which appears to have an obligate relationship with the deep persistent snow zone. The weasel has a large home range and moves through altered landscapes. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect effects under this alternative since no activities would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D Habitat models show that approximately 6,257 acres in the project lie within a persistent snow area (an attribute of wolverine habitat). Proposed harvest units within potential wolverine habitat include commercial thin (about 535 acres), pre-commercial thinning (140 acres) and regeneration in about 50 acres: about 12% of the animal’s potential habitat in the project area. These activities would not affect the persistence of the snow in the area. No activities would occur in talus or scree fields, and no harvest would occur in alpine meadows. No records of wolverine observations were apparent in databases. Cumulative Effects Alternative A would not create any cumulative effects, and therefore will have No Impact on the wolverine. Human activities in the Clear Creek Integrated Resource Project would create disturbances to any wolverine which may be in the project area. These disturbances would be associated with land management activities such as forestry, or fire/fuels reduction activities. They would include human and mechanical activity, noise, prescribed burning and other management activities. At the local level, there may be impacts to individual wolverines, but population level effects are unlikely because: (1) wolverines can travel long distances and are not adverse to crossing open spaces; therefore, if temporarily displaced, they can easily move into the large areas of undisturbed habitat that surrounds the project; and (2) any habitat impacted will not be rendered unsuitable for wolverines post-project and will continue to contribute toward maintaining wolverine viability (FR 47539). The project activities would not affect the persistence of the snow in the area. Activities would begin in June, after most snow has melt and the roads can be used without soil damage. Ongoing or foreseeable projects may disturb individual wolverines in the area, but would not affect their habitat. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the wolverine include Standards 1, 6, 7, 10, FW 1, and Pages II-5 & 6 from table 3-43. The Alternatives B, C, and D of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species North American wolverine.  Pygmy Nuthatch 3.12.5.3.8This species is a Region 1 sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). In Idaho, the pygmy nuthatch has a state ranking of S1 (critically imperiled). They are residents in mountain conifer woodlands, often in open woodland with large trees (Baicich and Harrison 1997). In Idaho, they are mainly found in pine forests and woodlands, especially ponderosa pine. They prefer older, open ponderosa pine habitat with <70% canopy cover. Nests appeared most often in cavities excavated by other birds (McEllin 1979). Raphael and White (1984) and Brawn and Balda (1988) found 100% of nests were in snags, not live trees. Modelled habitat from the criteria in Table 3-45 depicted 581 potential acres of habitat in the Project area for the pygmy nuthatch.Habitat is scattered in small patches generally under 15 acres in size. . Only 5 patches ranging from 10-14 acres were present; with the remaining 325 patches containing less than 10 acres in size. Home ranges of nuthatches range from 0.5 to 21 acres (Ghalambor and Dobbs 2006). This species requires snags for nesting and forages on pine seeds and insects extracted from tree bark. Two pygmy nuthatches were recorded in the Analysis Area during a breeding bird point count survey in 1994. Population Trend: Rosenberg (2004) and Partners In Flight (PIF) estimate approximately 5,000–5,300 individuals on a year-round basis in Idaho. BBS data indicate a positive population trend of >1.5% change per year from 1966–2010 for the northern and northcentral Idaho pygmy nuthatch population. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Suitable habitat would decrease in the Project area over time as tree density and canopy cover increases with forest succession. Ponderosa pine habitats would continue to be encroached on by shade tolerant Douglas-fir and grand fir, further limiting suitable habitat. Fire suppression would limit the creation of new habitat. Snags would remain across the landscape and may increase from aging or diseased stands. This would provide nesting habitat for nuthatches. Existing young pine plantations would not provide suitable habitat for about 100 years. Alternatives B, C, and D Approximately 2,000 acres in all alternatives are proposed for landscape burning: most of it in currently unsuitable habitat for the pygmy nuthatch. This treatment would create suitable habitat by reducing Douglas-fir and grand fir, retaining large legacy trees, creating snags and maintaining ponderosa pine habitats in an open understory condition. Potential disturbance to the pygmy nuthatch is similar to what has been mentioned in the Environmental Consequences. Snags that are adjacent to public roads that allow motorized access may be lost from woodcutters. However, all temporary roads will remain closed to the public access during operations, and decommissioned upon completion of the project. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 100 years because it would take this long to develop large snags and trees used for nesting after regeneration harvest. Alternative A—No Action The direct and indirect effects of this alternative when combined with fire suppression could lead to negative cumulative effects on pygmy nuthatch in the event of a wildfire when older forest are burned. Snags, however, would be created and would be available for future nesting. Determining the extent and probability of fire effects is not possible; however 50% of the Project area is currently susceptible to stand replacing fire. Alternatives B, C, and D The action alternatives would reduce the amount of nuthatch habitat by 11% to 14% through regeneration and improvement harvests. Landscape burning could more than double current foraging habitat for the nuthatch in the affected areas where this occurs. Many other patches of suitable habitat are adjacent to the proposed burn units, which would offer foraging opportunities in 3-10 years for individual nuthatches that migrate to these patches. All regeneration units would be replanted with shade intolerant species, including ponderosa pine. In about 80 years, these trees would be of the age and structure to provide potential habitat for the nuthatch. Fire suppression would maintain dense stands in untreated areas reducing the quality of nuthatch habitat and increasing the risk of stand replacement fire in those areas. Fires would have short term negative but long term positive effects. Ongoing and foreseeable projects would disturb nuthatch individuals in the area, but no harvest of their habitat would occur. An exception may be the private timber harvest, as the Agency has no information on the prescription the owner plans to implement. Firewood cutting would continue to occur near roads where snags and public motorized access meet. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the pygmy nuthatch include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Alternative A would not affect the bird with human activities, therefore it is determined as No Impact on the pygmy nuthatch or its habitat. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species.  Ring-necked Snake 3.12.5.3.9This species is a Region 1 sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). Ring-necked snakes can be found in forested, brushy areas or open hillsides that have rocks, logs, talus or other debris for cover and they may use microhabitats that are moist (Storm and Leonard 1995). In west-central Idaho they are typically found adjacent to perennial rivers or streams in grassland or forested habitats (IDFG 2005). The animal is nocturnal and hides underground or under surface cover (wood, rocks) during the day- making detections difficult. They feed on small invertebrates. An unrecorded observation of a ring-necked snake 5 miles north of the Project area was made in the 1990s. Similar elevations and drier vegetation types occur in the Analysis Area making it possible that these snakes are present in the area. There are 3,030 acres of potential ring-neck habitat on the low elevation breaklands (VRU 3) where grasslands, open dry forest, and dry and moderately moist forest provide suitable conditions. Roughly 730 acres occurs within PACFISH RHCAs. Population Trends: The ring-necked snake has a global rank of G5 (secure) and an Idaho State rank of S2 (imperiled). Current population and trend are unknown. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action Fire suppression would continue under this alternative and habitats would become denser, creating conditions that would increase the risk of stand-replacing fire. Wildfires can directly harm ring-neck snakes and reduce their habitat. Approximately 20 years after a fire, beneficial effects would include snag recruitment and subsequently large down wood recruitment which creates habitat for ring-necked snakes. Currently 50% of the Project area is susceptible to stand replacement fire. Alternatives B, C, and D Timber harvest and landscape burning activities can cause direct mortality through contact with fire, machinery, or yarded logs. The effects on direct mortality cannot be estimated, but given the lack of observations and the use of protected riparian areas as habitat, the risk is expected to be low. Riparian habitat used by snakes would not be affected due to PACFISH buffer implementation. Regeneration harvest would treat 66 acres (2%), 177 acres (6%), and 27 acres (1%) of suitable habitat under Alternatives B, C, and D respectively. Commercial thinning would treat 236 acres (8%), 125 acres (4%), and 171 acres (6%) of suitable habitat respectively. Improvement harvest would treat less than 1% under all alternatives. Harvest activities would remove trees that would have eventually become downed wood and suitable habitat for snakes. Regeneration harvest would remove the most potential habitat compared to other treatments. Snags and standing live trees as well as downed wood would, however, be retained in all harvest units which would provide limited current and future habitat for snakes. Talus slopes and rock outcrops used by snakes would not be affected. Opening the tree canopy would stimulate shrub growth which could increase invertebrate production and therefore foraging opportunities for ring-necked snakes. Landscape burning would treat 191 acres (6%) of suitable habitat under all alternatives. The effects to ring-necked snakes would vary depending on fire intensity. Low intensity areas are expected to have no effects while high severity areas could cause direct mortality to snakes. Beneficial effects would be the increase in downed wood material (suitable habitat) 5 to 10 years after the burn when snags fall. Grassland restoration activities occur on 0.1% of suitable habitat and would have no effect on this species. The overall negative effects to ring-necked snakes from proposed harvest and burning activities is expected to be low due to the retention of trees and downed wood in treatment areas and the retention of PACFISH buffers. No change to population trends of ring-neck snakes would therefore be expected from proposed activities. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because this is the time when snags would to start falling in treated units creating habitat for ring-neck snakes. Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct effects to ring-necked snakes from this alternative. Potential indirect effects include increased stand densities resulting from fire suppression and higher risk of stand replacing fire. This could result in direct mortality of snakes, though individual snakes would seek shelter under downed wood, rocks or talus slopes. Both positive and negative cumulative effects would be expected from this alternative as previously discussed. The levels are expected to be low due to the limited amount of potential habitat and effectiveness of fire suppression. Alternatives B, C, and D Cumulative effects to ring-neck snakes are expected to be both positive and negative and are the same effects as those discussed in the direct and indirect effects section. No quantitative estimate of cumulative effects can be provided since the number of potential fires and their size cannot be predicted. Harvest and landscape burn activities would reduce the risk of crown on 7% of the project area and 17% of VRU 3. Fire suppression would continue outside the Clear Creek Roadless Area (which is 28% of VRU 3). Naturally ignited fires in the Roadless Area may be allowed to burn after harvest and burn treatments are completed. This would allow for natural process to continue on 2,180 acres (72%) of VRU 3 which would be both beneficial and detrimental to ring-necked snakes depending on fire severity and size. Foreseeable projects would have no impact on snake habitat. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the snake include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Alternative A would have No Impact on the snake or its habitat. Activities proposed in Alternatives B, C, and D, May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species of the ringneck snake.  Western Toad 3.12.5.3.10The western toad is a Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). Western toads breed in temporary and permanent lakes, ponds, streams, and road ditches. They prefer shallow, warm areas with mud bottoms, and typically breed in May and June. Potential breeding and dispersal habitat occurs throughout the area along the network of riparian areas (10,700 acres, or 24% of the Analysis Area). Toads can be found from dry grasslands to moist subalpine forests, but optimal habitat is found in humid areas with moderate undergrowth (Nussbaum et al. 1983). They are largely terrestrial, but generally found within fair proximity to water. In Idaho, western toads are associated with almost all habitats within 1,600 feet of water. Adult western toads are largely terrestrial and are very active at night. They have been known to move up to 1 mile from their breeding habitats, (Bartelt et al. 2004) often into upland habitats (Bull 2006). Toads selected south-facing slopes, preferred open sites to forested settings, and sites with high density of burrows, rocks, logs, or rootwads that provided cover (Bull 2006). Burned and harvested sites were not avoided by western toads in Bull’s study. Guscio et al. (2007) found western toad occurrence increased after wildfires and they used severely burned areas. Use shifted from severely burned to moderately burned areas in the late summer likely as a result of more ground/canopy cover and higher soil moistures. There are 510 acres of potential upland toad habitat (<30% canopy cover and south aspects) in the Project area. Population Trends: This toad has a state rank of S4, apparently secure. Population trends in Idaho are difficult to track due to a lack of baseline information, but they are well distributed (Engle and Harris 2001). The western toad is known to occur on the Forest but none have been reported in the Analysis Area. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no actions, and therefore no direct effects to western toad upland habitat under this alternative. Upland openings preferred by toads may decrease as forest stands age and become denser. Fire suppression would minimize the amount of new openings that could be potentially created by wildfire. Downed wood used for cover currently exists and recruitment would continue as a result of tree mortality caused by insects, diseases, and potential wildfire. Alternatives B, C, and D Western toad breeding habitats are protected under all alternatives through no-harvest in RHCA implementation. A minor amount of habitat could be lost through road decommissioning and road improvement activities. Seasonal puddles occur along the edges of several roads as a result of poor road drainage. Long-toed salamanders were observed in 5 different roadside puddles (Smith, personal observation, 2010 and 2011). Tadpoles (potential toads or frogs) have been observed in similar pools but were not identified to species. Road improvements or decommissioning would improve drainage and limit the sediment to area streams. The effects to toads from these activities are considered low due to a low numbers of sites where roadside puddles occur. Alternatives B and C would improve upland habitat for toads on 55 acres (11%) and Alternative D would improve 59 acres (12%) of suitable habitat respectively through regeneration harvest. Commercial thinning would occur on 4 acres under Alternative B and D. Harvest activities would decrease canopy cover while retaining downed wood for cover. No landscape burning would occur in suitable toad habitat. Proposed activities have the potential to cause direct mortality to toads due to tree falling and yarding, site preparation burning, and road work. The risk is expected to be low due to design features that minimize yarding corridors in harvest units and road work being completed during the drier parts of the year. No change in the population trend of toads is expected at the project level due to the limited amount of habitat being affected and the fact that treatments would slightly improve habitat quality for toads. All breeding habitat would be protected through the retention of RHCAs. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area. The cumulative effects timeframe is 20 years because this is the time when tree canopy cover would begin to close and reduce the quality of upland toad habitat. Alternative A The effects to upland toad habitat are the same as the direct and indirect effects discussed above. Cumulatively, this alternative may reduce upland toad habitat by natural canopy closures without disturbance by fire, wind or other factors. Fire suppression may affect the frequency and severity of future fires. This may be a benefit or detriment to the upland habitat for toads. Alternatives B, C, and D All action alternatives would maintain or increase the quality of upland habitat for toads. Treatments may allow for the use of naturally ignited fire in the Clear Creek Roadless Area which could create additional habitat. Fire suppression would occur outside of the Roadless Area limiting disturbance opportunities and toad habitat development there. The cumulative effects of the project would be beneficial (from harvest) to neutral depending on the amount of fire suppression activities. It is not possible to predict the amount of disturbance minimized by fire suppression. Ongoing and foreseeable actions in the area may impact western toads, the specifics of which are addressed in the respective project files. Cumulatively, the timing of all activities would avoid periods of breeding and the tadpole life stage. The toads would be capable of moving away from most hazards these other activities would generate. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the toad include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Alternative A would have No Impact to the western toad or its habitat. For Alternatives B, C, and D, the determination is a May Impact Individuals or Habitat, but not likely to result in a trend to federal listing or a reduced viability for the population or species of the western toad. 3.12.5.4 Management Indicator Species The National Forest Management Act of 1976 directs the U.S. Forest Service to identify and actively monitor management indicator species (MIS) to assess impacts of forest management activities on native biota within national forest lands (Code of Federal Regulations 1985). As defined by the National Forest Management Act, MIS may include species listed as (1) threatened, endangered, or rare, (2) having habitat requirements sensitive to management activities, (3) having social or economic value, and (4) serving as monitors for environmental factors, population trends of other species, or habitat condition. The Nez Perce National Forest Plan (1987) uses the term wildlife indicator species, but the intent is the same as the national term. Five out of eleven MIS occur in the project area and are analyzed in the next few pages.  American Marten 3.12.5.4.1The American marten is a Nez Perce Forest high elevation old growth MIS. Optimal habitat for marten has been described as mature/old-growth spruce-fir forest with at least 30% canopy cover, plentiful fallen logs and stumps, and a lush understory of shrubs and forbs. . Marten may be more associated with complex vertical and horizontal woody structure than with forests of a particular age, species, or overstory requirement (Chapin et al. 1997). Marten in north-central Idaho were found to use a variety of forest types in winter, but activity was highest in Engelmann spruce/subalpine fir stands with mesic habitat types, >30% canopy cover, and overstory age >100 years (Koehler et al. 1975, Koehler and Hornocker 1977). Mature lodgepole pine is also suitable in moist habitat types, and in areas of high precipitation, dense cedar-grand fir forests at lower elevations provide habitat for the marten as well (Koehler et al. 1975). Due to the limitations of the vegetation models used for habitat analysis, the canopy cover was over-estimated (at ≥25%, instead of the suggested canopy cover of ≥30%). Approximately 20,305 acres of suitable habitat were calculated for marten in the Project area. Marten habitat is well distributed and connected throughout the area in the mid-to upper elevations.Population Trends: Total population size is unknown, but probably is at least several hundred thousand in the United States and the species can be regarded as secure (NaturServe 2012). Few data sets allow evaluation of population trends over long periods (Ruggiero et al. 1994). Samson (2006) indicates 3,500 suitable habitat acres are required to maintain a viable marten population in the Forest Service Northern Region. Bush and Lundberg (2008) show over one million suitable acres on the Forest. The state of Idaho considers the marten a “furbearer,” and is legally trapped during the winter season. There is a difference in computer model analysis used in determining marten habitat. Samson (2006a, 2006b) and Bush and Lundberg (2008) used models that would enable them to analyze potential marten habitat in the larger area of Montana and northern Idaho. Therefore, they used more tree species than the analysis conducted for the project area. The VMAP model used by the district biologist also has limitations: ranges of tree sizes and canopy cover that do not always capture a specific element, such as the 30% canopy cover or greater. Also, this model does not capture tree age, so a different model (TSMRS-based) was used to gather this information. This action allowed the biologist to analyze potential habitat, according to the habitat criteria in Table 3-45, with a minor over-estimation on canopy coverage. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action This alternative would have no direct effects to mature or old growth habitat since no activities are proposed. Habitats would be altered by natural events such as forest succession and insects/disease. Fire suppression would continue. Snag and large down wood habitat elements would remain available as trees die (and fall) from natural causes. A wildfire and/or insect and disease activity would leave greater numbers of snags and large down wood than exist now but would also reduce canopy cover. These more open areas would provide unsuitable conditions for marten. Ongoing fire suppression may be beneficial for this species because it can help maintain mature and older habitats on the landscape longer. Snags near roads open to public motorized access would likely be reduced by woodcutting. Alternatives B, C, and D Proposed regeneration harvest would simplify suitable marten habitats in the short term (<30 years) by eliminating canopy cover and layering, reducing large down wood, and reducing standing snags in treated areas. Marten tend to avoid large openings (Hargis et al. 1999, Moriarty et al. 2011, Potvin et al. 2000). Snags and down wood would be retained by the silvicultural prescription. Marten are known to rest or den in snags, slash piles, downed logs (Bull and Heater 2000). Canopy cover would increase to suitable levels after about 50 years. Proposed commercial thinning would have minimal effects, as the retained trees would provide structure and canopy coverage to marten. The Action Alternatives would reduce the likelihood of a large, intense fire. Fires have both positive and negative effects on marten (as discussed under the No Action alternative). Jones (1991) suggests that landscape scale habitat management should incorporate young- to mid-successional stages to provide habitat for prey species while retaining mature and late-successional habitats that provide important denning and resting habitat. The project has been designed to maintain all successional stages within the Project area which would continue to provide suitable habitat for marten. Alternatives B and C would conduct regeneration and improvement harvest on 1,189 acres (6%) of currently suitable habitat and Alternative D regenerates 796 acres (4%). Retained trees, snags, and down logs in these areas would provide future habitat for marten as the stands age. All action alternatives commercially thin 40 acres (<1%) of marten habitat. Commercial thinning would reduce canopy cover to 40%–60% and would maintain a canopy cover level suitable for marten use. Ten acres of landscape burning would occur in marten habitat in all action alternatives. Harvest units would create edge effects adjacent to untreated stands. Marten would likely avoid the new opened areas, but continue to conduct activities in preferred habitat that exists adjacent to or nearby the treated stands. Noise from machinery and human presence would disturb individual martens in or near treatment areas. For mitigation, current access closures would be maintained as part of the proposed project. Proposed road and watershed improvements, road to trail conversion, temporary road construction, and road decommissioning activities would not have an appreciable effect on marten or their habitat. There may be minor impacts to habitat from landscape or prescribed burning activities as individuals or clumps of trees may be torched, therefore opening the canopy and creating a mosaic landscape. No harvest would occur in verified old-growth or RHCAs under any alternative. These areas would continue to provide suitable habitat and well as connectivity across over 30% of the landscape. Insects and disease events would continue across the landscape causing tree mortality. These would produce snags and large down wood used by martens for denning and resting. Marten habitat would remain well distributed and available under all alternatives. Trends in marten populations at the local and forest scale would not be affected by project activities due to the wide availability of untreated suitable habitats at the project and Forest level. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area for marten is the 43,700-acre project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 100-150 years which is the approximate amount of time required for stands to develop into a mature or older vegetative state and snags to develop into a condition that provides habitat for old growth and snag dependent species. Alternative A—No Action There would be no negative cumulative effects from this alternative since no actions would occur. The effects of fire suppression are the same as those discussed under the direct and indirect effects of this alternative. Alternatives B, C, and D Fire suppression could have positive effects on marten habitat by limiting fire in mature and older forests. The action alternatives would modify from 4-7% of existing marten habitat. Silvicultural prescriptions would retain 14-28 tpa, consisting of live trees and snags. Some of the retained clumps would offer structure for marten foraging or resting areas. Forest plan standards for snags would be met by these alternatives. The cumulative risk to marten habitat from the action alternatives is considered low due to the retention of old growth, PACFISH buffers, snag retention guidelines, and other mature stands that would provide marten habitat after treatment. Woody debris would continue to accumulate and be created as trees age and die. Martens would possibly be disturbed during the Brown Spring culvert replacement and the Clear Ridge road decommissioning; but that would only occur at sites of activity. Overall, the riparian work would mitigate damaged areas that produce sediment to streams and replace the area with vegetation. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the marten include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from Table 3-43. Under Alternative B, C, and D, some impacts may occur to individuals or their habitat, but is not expected to result in a loss of viability in the Planning Area, nor cause a trend toward federal listing for the American marten.  Northern Goshawk 3.12.5.4.2The northern goshawk was identified as a Forest MIS for old-growth forest. Nesting habitat was chosen as the indicator as it is the primary limiting factor for goshawks and is represented by a much narrower range of vegetation structure and composition than the post-fledgling areas and forage area. Foraging habitat for goshawks may occur along the edges of open areas and is not considered limiting. Goshawks use large landscapes, integrating a diversity of vegetation types over several spatial scales to meet their life-cycle needs (Squires and Kennedy 2006). In “The Northern Goshawk Status Review,” the USFWS found that the goshawk typically uses mature forest or larger trees for nesting habitat; however, it is considered a forest habitat generalist at larger spatial scales (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1998). The USFWS found no evidence that the goshawk is dependent on large, unbroken tracts of old-growth or mature forest (63 FR 35183 June 29, 1998). Nest areas are usually mature forest with large trees, relatively closed canopies (50%–90%) and open understories (Squires and Kennedy 2006). In central Idaho, goshawks nest in a variety of forest stands that are comprised of mature trees with relatively high canopy cover and open understories (Moser 2007). Nest trees typically range between 12 and 21 inches dbh and are located on relatively gentle terrain with 70% of nests occurring on shaded aspects. Favored habitats typically are located in forest stands having only 1 or 2 canopy levels with an open or mixed-density understory. The goshawk is a habitat generalist at the foraging area scale. Goshawk foraging areas are heterogeneous and may include some mature forest components (Squires and Kennedy 2006) as well as a mix of other forest and nonforest components (e.g., sagebrush, grasslands, lowland riparian, and agriculture) (Younk and Bechard 1994, Reynolds 1994, Patla et al. 1997). Goshawks require habitats for prey that contain snags, downed logs, woody debris, large trees, herbaceous and shrubby understories, and a mixture of stand structural stages (Wisdom et al. 2000). They are an opportunistic predator that take prey items on the ground, on vegetation, in the air, and rely on a variety of forested and non-forested habitats. There are 2,066 acres (5%) of currently suitable nesting habitat in the Analysis Area. Goshawks have been recorded across the Forest and one was observed foraging near the Project boundary during recent field reviews. Population Trends: The goshawk is rated secure across its range (global rank G5) and is apparently secure (state rank S4) in the state of Idaho (Idaho Digital Atlas 2010). The goshawk population in the northern Idaho portion of the Northern Rockies Bird Conservation Region (BCR) is estimated to be approximately 3,900 birds (Rosenberg 2004). State-wide, the goshawk estimated population is 5,600, with a population objective of 6,200 individuals as noted by Rosenberg (2004). Survey data indicates an overall declining population Idaho since 1966; however it remains relatively stable in the Northern Rockies BCR (Sauer et al. 2011). No evidence exists that the northern goshawk is declining in number in the western United States (Kennedy 1997, USFWS 1998, Kennedy 2003, Anderson et al. 2005, Squires and Kennedy 2006). Samson (2005) also concluded no scientific evidence exists that the northern goshawk is decreasing in number in the Forest Service Northern Region. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action No management actions would take place. Habitats would continue to be altered by natural events such as succession, insect and disease, and potential wildfire. A wildfire and/or insect and disease activity would likely leave behind greater numbers of snags than exist now but would also reduce canopy cover that may create unsuitable conditions for goshawk nesting. In general, nesting habitat would increase and foraging habitat would decrease as forest succession continues to fill in understories and increase stand canopy closure. Fuel build-up resulting from fire suppression activities would continue, thereby increasing the likelihood of a stand-replacing fire. Stand-replacing fires would reduce nesting habitat in the short term (<50 years) but would create it and other various elements of goshawk habitat in the long term (>50 years). Alternatives B, C, and D All action alternatives would harvest in suitable goshawk nesting habitat. Alternatives B and C would regeneration harvest 93 acres (5%), and Alternative D would harvest 85 acres (4%). Activities would reduce habitat quality by eliminating canopy cover and layering, and reducing some standing snags. Unit prescriptions would retain an average of 14-28 live and/or dead trees per acre. The trees would be of larger dbhs, thereby offering potential perch sites for the goshawk to forage in or along the edges of the temporary clearings. Landscape burning on 45 acres (2%) of nesting habitat would have similar effects except that snags would be retained and additional ones created. Harvest and burning activities would preclude treated areas from being used by nesting goshawks until canopy cover increases to suitable levels (generally >50 years). Implementation of snag and green tree retention guidelines in harvest units, as well as PACFISH buffers, would retain trees for future nesting and help limit effects of habitat simplification. Commercial thinning would remove suppressed trees leaving 40%–60% of the tree canopy and about 120 tpa. All alternatives would thin 160 acres (8%) of suitable goshawk nesting habitat. Treatments may not retain enough overstory canopy to be used by nesting goshawks, but would promote large tree growth and would provide for foraging opportunities. Thinned areas would become suitable habitat as canopy cover increases over time (>20 years). During Project implementation, human activity, equipment noise, and burning might preclude use of the area by goshawks. Any active nests found in a treatment unit would be reported to the Zone or Forest a wildlife biologist and activities halted while site specific conservation measures are developed. This would reduce the likelihood of disturbance or injury to individual birds. None of the Action Alternatives would harvest in the 4,874 acres of MA 20 or the 10,700 acres of RHCAs. This equates to 35% of the analysis area. Mature and old forest habitat would therefore be maintained across the Project area and would be available for goshawk use. The Project is not expected to negatively affect goshawk population trends in the project area or at the Forest level due to the availability of untreated habitat in at both of these scales. Regional estimates indicate sufficient habitat is available to maintain population viability (Samson 2006; Bush and Lundberg 2008). Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area, which includes seven OGAAs. The cumulative effects timeframe is 150 years because it would take this long for regeneration harvest areas to develop old growth habitat characteristics. OGAAs were also selected because goshawks are an old growth MIS. Alternative A—No Action The potential cumulative effects of this alternative are the same as those described under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. There is a potential for cumulative effects; however levels cannot be determined because estimating the size and severity of potential future fires resulting from fire suppression is not possible. Alternatives B, C, and D Harvest and burning activities open and remove tree canopy, creating edges and clearings which would increase the amount of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and tree seedlings and improve habitat conditions for some goshawk prey species. Fire suppression would maintain closed canopies in untreated areas potentially improving nesting habitat over time. Suppression also increases the risk of stand replacing fire which could remove nesting habitat. Proposed treatments reduce the crown fire (stand replacement) potential by 7% across the project area. The OGAAs would retain 6% to 21% verified old growth (see Old Growth section) which would provide nesting habitat for goshawk over time. Additional old growth would be maintained in RHCAs. Negative cumulative effects are not expected due to the availability of untreated habitats and the likelihood that a wildfire would not burn all available nesting habitats during a fire event. There may be slight positive cumulative effects associated with creating openings for prey species. Ongoing and foreseeable actions may disturb goshawks, but would not remove nesting habitat. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the goshawk include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43. Under Alternative B, C, and D, some impacts may occur to individuals or their habitat, but is not expected to result in a loss of viability in the Planning Area, nor cause a trend toward federal listing for the northern goshawk.  Pileated Woodpecker 3.12.5.4.3The pileated woodpecker was identified as a Forest MIS for old-growth forest and large snag habitat. The pileated is most often associated with mature forests (Samson 2006) although the presence of large trees for nesting is reported to be more important than forest age. Pileated woodpeckers are relatively common in both cut and uncut mid-elevation forests, and appear to do well in a matrix of forest types (Hutto 1995a). They nest in both previously harvested stands that contain remnant large trees and snags, and in mature and old growth forests. The pileated woodpecker is able to do well in young and fragmented forests that retain abundant remnant structure, such as large diameter snags and down woody debris (Mellen et al. 1992). Pileated woodpecker surveys were conducted in 2012 in the Analysis Area and within a mile outside of its boundary. Eleven pileated detections were made, 8 within the area and 3 in the one mile buffer. Nineteen additional observations were recorded throughout the Analysis Area during project review in 2011 and 2012. Pileated woodpeckers were also detected in 59% of the surrounding surveyed areas of the Middle Fork Clearwater and Selway Rivers. Pileated woodpeckers are common and widespread in the Project area and across the Forest. Nesting habitat was chosen as the indicator because it is the greatest limiting factor for pileated woodpeckers. Nesting habitat has a narrower range of vegetation conditions when compared to foraging habitat. The Northern Region of the Forest Service summarized available scientific information on the pileated woodpecker (Samson 2006). The report found that the nest tree is the most important variable to estimate breeding habitat use by the pileated woodpecker. Large snags (>20 inches dbh) were preferred over live trees for nesting in the Northern Rocky Mountains, and nesting occurred in, mature cottonwood bottoms, ponderosa pine, and larch stands but also reported use of mixed conifer and cedar-hemlock. The minimum canopy cover selected by pileated woodpeckers for nesting stands ranges from 15% to 60% depending on the habitat type (Bull et al. 1992, Warren 1990, Bull and Holthausen 1993, Bonar 2001). There are 8,160 acres (19% of the Analysis Area) of currently suitable nesting in the Project area. About 3,000 acres of Douglas-fir habitat was attacked by tussock moth in 2011. Tree mortality is expected to increase in the area in combination with mortality caused by root disease which would provide additional nesting and foraging habitat for woodpeckers. Population Trends: The pileated woodpecker is rated as secure across its range (global rank G5) and apparently secure (state rank S4) in Idaho (Idaho Digital Atlas 2010). Breeding Bird Surveys compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey show an increasing population trend for pileated woodpecker over the past 45 years both at the scale of the Northern Rockies and in Idaho (Sauer et al. 2011). The time frame covers almost five decades, including the period when intensive timber harvesting occurred (Bull and Jackson 1995). Samson (2006) concluded that no scientific evidence exists that indicates pileated woodpeckers are declining in the Northern Region. There is a difference in computer model analysis that is used in determining pileated woodpecker habitat. Samson (2006a) determined that 96,000 acres are needed to maintain minimum viable population for the woodpecker. Bush and Lundberg (2008) used models that would enable them to analyze potential pileated nest habitat in the larger area of Montana and northern Idaho, and calculated that nearly 300,000 acres are on the Nez Perce Forest. The VMAP model used by the district biologist also has limitations: ranges of tree sizes and canopy cover that do not always capture a specific element, such as the 15% canopy cover or greater. The closest available range was 10-25% or greater canopy cover. Therefore, the analysis over-estimated the canopy coverage for potential woodpecker nest habitat. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action The effects of natural disturbance on pileated woodpeckers include events such as insect activity, disease, wind, and fire (Bull et al. 2007). These disturbances are the mechanisms that provide a continuum of snags, downed dead wood, and live trees with decay over time which the woodpecker depends on for nesting, roosting, and foraging. Root disease is prevalent in the Analysis Area and provides a continuous supply of Douglas-fir and grand fir snags which are suitable nesting and foraging trees. Fire suppression would continue. Fuels in the Analysis Area would continue increasing, making the area susceptible to a stand-replacing fire event. A stand replacing event would create snag habitat for pileated woodpeckers. Snag densities are low in the Analysis Area where regeneration harvest has occurred. Habitat quality would improve in these areas as forests mature over time. Overall, suitable habitat would remain available across the area as forest succession continues. Alternatives B, C, and D Researchers (Bull et al. 2007) showed a decline in the densities of nesting pileated woodpecker pairs in a project area where regeneration cuts of grand fir converted 50% mature stands to about 3%. In the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project no verified old growth would be treated. No activities would occur within MA 20 old growth and RHCAs (35% of the analysis area), which would provide suitable and connected nesting habitat across the project area. Additionally, unit prescriptions would retain on average 14 to 28 live and dead trees (9 to 14 snags/acre, depending on habitat type) to meet Forest Plan standards and provide habitat for the woodpecker. Under Alternative B, C, and D, pileated woodpecker populations would be expected to continue to display population stability across the Nez Perce National Forest. Regeneration and improvement harvest occurs on 476 acres (6%) of suitable nesting habitat under Alternatives B and C and 373 acres (5%) under Alternative D. Regeneration harvest would reduce habitat quality, canopy cover, large down wood, and standing snags in treated areas. Implementing snag and green tree retention would help limit these effects. In revisiting their study areas after 30 years, Bull et al. (2007) found that the high tree mortality and loss of canopy closure in stands of grand fir and Douglas-fir did not appear to be detrimental to pileated woodpeckers: provided there was an abundance of large dead or live trees and logs, and that stands were not subject to extensive harvest (i.e., concerted regeneration or fuel reduction harvests). Nesting habitat would be available in these areas once canopy closure reaches preferred levels (about 100 years). Commercial thinning would occur on 399 acres (5%) of suitable nesting habitat and would leave 40%–60% of the tree canopy and about 120 overstory trees per acre. Thinning promotes large tree growth and may retain enough structure and canopy to be used by pileated woodpeckers. Removal of some nesting habitat would occur; however snags tend to be limited in these younger stands. The retention of legacy trees, as well as green trees and snags where possible would provide future nesting habitat through time. No landscape burning or improvement harvest occurs in suitable nesting habitat. Replanted trees will populate the harvested areas with a new generation of tree species. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effect area is the 43,700-acre Project area, which includes seven old growth analysis areas. The cumulative effects timeframe is 150 years because it would take this long for regeneration harvest areas to develop old-growth habitat. Cumulative effects were also assessed using old-growth forest because pileated woodpecker are an old growth MIS. Alternative A–No Action The potential cumulative effects of this alternative are the same as those described under the direct and indirect effects of the No Action alternative. The effects of future fires are unknown and immeasurable, as wildfires will create and destroy snags. Woodcutting would continue to occur along roads with open access to public motorized vehicles. Alternatives B, C, and D Proposed treatments under all alternatives would slightly reduce potential pileated nesting habitat. Fire suppression would maintain closed canopies in untreated areas potentially improving nesting habitat over time. Suppression also increases the risk of stand replacing fire which could remove nesting habitat. Treatments would reduce the crown fire (stand replacement) potential by 7% across the project area. Snags would continue to be available across the landscape in untreated areas where insect and disease events occur. The OGAAs contain 6% to 22% verified old growth (see Old Growth section) which would provide nesting habitat for pileated woodpeckers over time. RHCAs cover 24% of the Project area and would be managed for old growth habitat which would also provide habitat for pileated woodpeckers. No measurable cumulative effects to pileated woodpecker populations at the local or regional scale, or alteration of current population trend, are expected. This is based on increasing populations and the availability of unaffected suitable nesting habitats in the Analysis Area and across the Forest and region. Woodcutting would occur as mentioned in Alternative A. Ongoing and foreseeable projects may disturb woodpeckers, but would not remove their habitat. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the pileated woodpecker include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from Table 3-43. Under Alternative B, C, and D, some impacts may occur to individuals or their habitat, but is not expected to result in a loss of viability in the Planning Area, nor cause a trend toward federal listing of the pileated woodpecker.  Rocky Mountain Elk 3.12.5.4.4Elk is a MIS for commonly hunted big game species on the Forest. Elk are habitat generalists and use a diversity of forest types and structures that provide forage and hiding cover. They forage in meadows and early seral communities from spring through early summer, use more closed canopies from late summer through fall and rely upon low elevation, warm aspect, and snow-free or snow-limited areas for foraging in the winter. Adult bulls often winter at much higher elevations than cows and immature elk. Elk also require forest cover for security. Preferred calving sites are generally large meadows, shrub fields, and early seral forest openings in close proximity to water. Population Trends: Elk populations in the Analysis Area were relatively insignificant until a series of major fire events occurred in 1919, 1928, and 1934. These fires increased forage availability and population levels. Elk also benefited from predator control efforts. The following information was obtained from the Idaho Fish and Game elk management plan (IDFG 2014): The Analysis Area falls in the Idaho Department of Fish and game Elk City Elk Management Zone and is within Management Unit 16. Recent (2008) elk population surveys in the unit showed stable cow and slightly elevated bull elk numbers which are slightly up from the 2000 survey. Cow elk numbers currently meet, and bull numbers exceed State population objectives (Table 3-45). However, calf recruitment decreased from 19 calves per 100 cows (from 1990 to 2000) down to 17 in 2008. The calf:cow ratio is an important indicator of population recruitment and long-term herd viability. A ratio of at least 25 calves to 100 cows is needed to offset natural mortality. Reasons for the decline are unclear but may be related to reductions in forage quality (poor condition of cows and low calf weights), high predation rates, less security area, and greater human disturbance and/or hunting pressure. Table 3-45.

III-46) designated MA 16 as big game winter range. The goal for MA 16 is to improve the quality of the winter range habitat for deer and elk through timber harvesting, prescribed burning, and other management practices. Winter range is primarily below 4,500 feet in elevation and has southern-to-western exposures. The vegetative types included are non-forest grasslands, seral brushfields, and timbered lands. High quality forage is an important component of elk winter range. Elk eat grasses, forbs, and the tips of twigs from some woody vegetation. Shrub fields and conifer forests provide a higher proportion of winter forage than grassland sites. Species such as redstem ceanothus, serviceberry, mountain maple, choke and bitter cherry, and syringa provide much of the winter forage available to elk. The Analysis Area has 15,600 acres of MA 16 winter range (35% of the Analysis Area). Elk also use non-MA 16 areas. Additional winter range is interspersed in the summer range EAAs. A collaborative effort with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation to map elk winter range in Idaho identified approximately 28,798 acres of winter habitat in the Analysis Area (66% of area). Fifty-nine percent of it occurs on the western redcedar/grand fir and Douglas-fir/grand fir breakland settings. Winter habitat occurs on 39% of the western redcedar/grand fir upland setting during more mild winter conditions. Most of the MA 16 winter range is closed to motorized use or part of the Clear Creek Roadless Area, providing high levels of secure habitat during the winter months. Most of the wintering elk in Clear Creek are found in Solo Creek and upper Clear Creek where low open road densities provide security areas from winter recreation disturbances. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct effects to elk winter range under Alternative A as no activities would occur. In the absence of natural disturbances winter range forage quality and quantity would decline as tree canopy cover continues to increase and shades out understory forage. Insects and disease impacts may create openings for shrubs, forbs, and grasses, although not to the scale of wildfires. Fire suppression may increase the severity of wildfires due to increased fuel loading. Large wildfires would increase the amount of available winter forage though space and time. Without further disturbance after a fire event, forage quantity would decline and hiding cover would increase in about 20 years. Regeneration harvest in the project area has affected about 2,400 acres in MA 16, with 842 acres impacted since 1990. Sixty-five percent of these areas are too old (>20 years) to provide high quantity and quality forage. These poor forage areas function as hiding cover for elk. Alternative A does nothing to create early seral habitats that would provide high quantities of forage. Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration and improvement harvest would be conducted on 1,497 acres (10%), 1,925 acres (12%), and 1,104 acres (7%) of MA 16 winter range under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Harvest would reduce elk hiding cover habitat by 10%, 12%, and 7% for the Action Alternatives. All alternatives use landscape burning on 1,370 acres (9%) of MA 16. Burning in late summer or early fall would increase coverage of shrub species and mimic natural fire seasons. Burning may reduce hiding cover by 9%, but could be less depending on fire severity. The proposed treatments would reduce tree canopy cover and allow sunlight, water, and nutrients to be more available to shrubs, forbs, and grasses. This would increase forage production on winter range. Forage quality may increase as a result of burning. Post-harvest burning in the fall would stimulate resprouting of important shrubs such as redstem and Scouler willow. These two species are often absent from new openings after harvest and may not re-establish in the absence of fire. Orme and Leege (1976) showed that fall burning produced over three times the seedlings than did spring burning. Higher quality forage would benefit cow elk during winter months. Forage quantity would increase for 20–30 years or until tree canopy cover closes and forage plants begin declining. Alternative C (21%) provides the greatest benefit to elk winter forage, followed by Alternative B (19%) and D (16%). Commercial thinning would occur on 953 acres (6%), 647 acres (4%), and 775 acres (5%) of the winter range under Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. Thinning would have short term (<10 years) benefits on elk winter range forage. Thinning retains 40-60% of the canopy cover which limits shrub growth. Hiding cover would be slightly reduced under all alternatives. Precommercial thinning is proposed for 560 acres (4%) of winter range and is anticipated to have minimal effects on elk winter forage, as much of the canopy cover would be retained and limit shrub growth. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis is the 43,700 acre Project area. The timeframe is 20 years: the time when tree canopy cover would begin to close and reduce the quality of elk winter forage. Alternative A—No Action The cumulative effects for this alternative are the same as described under the direct and indirect effects of the alternative. There would be a continued decline in elk winter forage quantity and quality if no wildfires occur. Forage could increase in the event of a wildfire however it is not possible to predict the amount or location. Alternatives B, C, and D The Action Alternatives would conduct regeneration or improvement harvest and landscape burning on up to 30% of MA 16 winter range. These treatments would create early seral habitats that provide high quantities of quality forage for about 20 years. Such treatments would meet the management intent to increase or improve big game winter range. The action alternatives would meet Forest Plan standards for MA 16 by implementation of seasonal road closures as per the motorized travel guide, and restricting public access to temporary roads or other roads utilized by harvest activities. Insects and disease would continue to create openings for the limited growth of shrubs, forbs, and grasses. Fire suppression would continue and fuels would continue to increase in untreated areas. A large fire could significantly increase the amount of winter forage and would decrease hiding cover for elk; however predicting the time and size is not possible. Habitats would be less susceptible to wildfire because proposed treatments reduce crown fire potential on 7% of the Analysis area. Elk Summer Range The majority of the Analysis Area is considered summer range for elk. Important habitat components for elk include foraging sites, hiding cover, calving areas, rutting, and security areas. Forage availability and abundance has declined throughout the area due to a lack of disturbance (fire, timber harvest) and subsequent increases in tree copy cover. Hiding cover is available in forested stands that are 20 years or older. Elk Security areas are places where wildlife can retreat for safety when affected by disturbance. In general, security areas are over 250 acres in size and >0.5 miles from an open road or trail. There are no forest plan standards for the amount of security areas to be managed. “Guidelines for Evaluating and Managing Summer Elk Habitat in Northern Idaho” (Leege 1984) was used to evaluate summer elk range and considers road open road density, livestock grazing, cover-forage ratios, and security areas. An updated reference on elk summer habitat management (Servheen et al. 1997) has generated interest from some of the public as to replace the Leege (1984) guidelines. Servheen et al. (1997) suggest analyzing for motorized trails, which were not considered at the time the forest adopted the 1984 guidelines. However, the calculations for primitive roads (found in the Leege 1984 worksheets) use the same co-efficients as the temporary road and system trail (found in Servheen et al. 1997 worksheets). Thereby, a motorized trail is now analyzed under the primitive road section of the worksheet, which results in the same value of standard road miles by either guideline. Overall the Servheen et al. (1997) model uses the same mileage co-efficients for road and motorized trail conditions (open, closed, or seasonal closures) as the Leege et al. 1984. Road and trail densities are the same between both models. Livestock presence in an elk analysis area is similarly calculated, as well as security areas, cover and forage. Displays of the calculation sheets for both models is located in the Wildlife Appendix F. The Elk Vulnerability model is unique to the Servheen et al. analysis. The model attempts to analyze elk depredation from hunting, natural mortality factors, road impacts (access for hunters), and extrapolate this information to trends in elk mortality per Game Management Unit (GMU). Liabilities of the model for use with Forest Service projects include the scale of analysis and mortality factors. The desired scale for analysis is at the Game Management Unit (GMU). These units range in size from 262 mi. to 1,555 mi.; while the Clear Creek Project area is 68.3 mi.. For impacts on elk in the project area, the biologist analyzes smaller polygons called Elk Analysis Areas or EAAs. These units are calculated from the input proposed in guidelines from Leege et al. (1984), which is also used in Servheen et al. (1997). Each EAA in the project area ranges from 7 to 14 mi.. Extrapolating road densities from Forest service lands, such as the Clear Creek Project, to a GMU is conjecture, and not a dependable source for determining elk vulnerability at the larger scale. Road densities and hunter activities vary on private and corporate lands, in comparison to Forest Service lands. The larger size of the GMUs in Central Idaho include wilderness, roadless areas and other terrain inaccessible to motorized vehicles, as well as the areas previously stated. Mortality factors in the Vulnerability Model depend on consistencies. Changes in hunting seasons or alteration of gender numbers allowed for hunting would skew trends the Servheen document discusses. The elk vulnerability model only gathers data on legal hunting. Illegal take is not factored. Treaty rights for the Nez Perce tribe allows take of big game throughout the year, of either sex, with any weapon. The model does not address this supplemental mortality. Additionally, the IDFG has recently increased trapping and other controls on the wolf population; which was not a consideration in the Servheen et al. 1997 guidelines. The latter document discusses a 10% natural mortality for elk, but the state’s increased predator control must be the result of a known or perceived natural threat that is creating a larger mortality of elk than originally thought. The IDFG has not contacted the forest about the need or implementation of this model. The public arguing for the change of elk modeling guidelines are requesting the agency replace a 30-year old plan with one that is nearly 20 years old. Both need to be replaced with an analysis that uses the best available science, and more up to date knowledge. As the Forest progresses in its forest plan revision, the best available science will be selected and used for elk analysis. The Forest Service manages habitat for wildlife, while the IDFG manages the state populations for animals that are legally hunted or trapped. It would make more sense for the IDFG to generate and interpret this model, as they gather annual hunter harvest information to determine the management (tags, timing of season, etc.) for elk in each Big Game Unit. The Forest Plan objective for summer range elk habitat effectiveness (EHE) is to achieve a minimum of 50% effectiveness in each EAA. There are seven EAAs, and all areas would meet the objective of ≥50% EHE upon completion of the project (Table 3-46). Errors were detected in the analysis of the guidelines conducted for the Draft EIS. Livestock presence was absent or incorrectly analyzed, as were road densities and security areas. The Leege et al. 1984 guidelines were recalculated and reviewed for accuracy for this Final EIS.  Table 3-46. Elk Summer Range Habitat Effectiveness by Alternative in the Clear Creek Analysis Area. The Forest Plan Objective is 50% for each Elk Analysis Area (EAA). Elk Analysis Area Summer Elk Habitat Effectiveness (%) Name Number Existing Condition Alternative B Alternative C Alternative D Clear Creek 1 304064022 56 56 56 56 Clear Creek 2 304064021 69 69 70 69 Clear Creek 3 304064031 55 56 58 56 Brown Springs 304067152 49 50 50 50 Pine Knob 304067151 51 52 52 52 Solo Creek 304067171 51 51 52 52 S.

Summer range would be more susceptible to wildfire when compared to the Action Alternatives due to increasing fuel loads resulting from fire suppression. A large wildfire would reduce hiding cover in the short-term (10–20 years) but would increase forage. All EAAs would continue to meet the Forest Plan objective of 50% (Table 3-46). Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration, improvement harvest, and prescribed fire would remove hiding cover and increase summer forage in the Project area. Alternative B treats 4, 311 acres (10%), Alternative C treats 5,858 acres (13%), and Alternative C treats 3,760 acres (9%) of the Project area. Forage quantity would increase for 20–30 years and then decline as tree canopy cover closes. Improvements in the quantity and quality of forage would benefit the condition of cow elk going into winter and ultimately improve calf survival. New openings created by the alternatives from regeneration and improvement harvests would reduce security areas. When closed roads are opened for harvest, thinning or burning, the half mile buffer to each road temporarily suspends elk security areas near the road, until vegetation matures to the point of providing cover: about 10-20 years after treatment and tree planting. Reductions in elk habitat effectiveness below 50% would occur in all but one EAA during implementation of the action alternatives. This would result from roads that are opened for access to project activities, and would create a temporary loss or reduction of elk security. None of the alternatives would construct permanent roads or change access restrictions on existing roads or trails. Roads proposed for decommissioning are currently closed or are impassable to motorized vehicles due to fallen trees or thick vegetation. Decommissioning would have minimal effects on current elk security. It would permanently prevent any future motorized access, which would maintain elk security areas indefinitely. Indirectly, regeneration harvest in security areas would create openings and potentially increase vulnerability to hunters. The risk is considered low, as the roads to the treated units would be closed to motorized access. Regeneration harvest effects on security would last 10-20 years until hiding cover is re-established in these areas. The EHE analysis is run as if all roads are open and all proposed units are being treated simultaneously. This exercise overestimates the impacts of project activities to elk. In reality, the harvest contractor would work a cluster of units within close proximity of one another. This reduces transportation costs and focuses the work to complete each unit before moving to the next. During treatment activities, roads used for access to units would remain closed to public motorized access. Upon completion of treatments in the units, all temporary roads would be decommissioned and Forest Service system roads would revert to their present travel management restrictions (in most cases, closed to public motorized access by a barrier). So activities in the affected EAAs would occur as pulses of disturbance over time, leaving available areas for elk security that are not affected. Reductions occur because some created openings are greater than 800 feet from hiding cover. Elk use in forage areas is reduced when distances to hiding cover exceeds 800 feet (Leege 1984). Although the proposed treatments would reduce EHE during project implementation, all EAAs would return to the existing condition or an improved level upon completion of proposed activities. All EAAS would meet the Forest Plan objective of 50% (Table 3-47). Elk populations are expected to respond favorably to proposed treatments due to increased foraging opportunities. Additionally, the calculations for livestock presence give the reader the impression that cattle are present throughout the project area. In fact the cattle move as a group along very few road systems in the area. They graze along flats and spurs adjacent to the roads, such as Road #286. They are unlikely to graze on steep slopes; leaving their activities and impacts confined to a very small part of the project area. Commercial and precommercial thinning has no effect on the calculations for elk habitat effectiveness (Leege 1984). Direct and indirect effects would be disturbance to elk from activities conducted by machines and presence of man. Elk may be temporarily avoid areas with the above activities during daylight hours. However, during hours of darkness, elk may move into these areas to forage on the downed vegetation. Upon completion of the project, openings created by treatments would begin producing forage in 3 to 5 years, and be available for about 15-20 years. Cumulative Effects The geographic boundary for assessing cumulative effects on elk summer habitat effectiveness is the combined seven EAAs within the 43,700 acre Project area. The time frame for cumulative effects is 20 years, which is the time it takes for new plantations to restore elk hiding cover in the harvested areas.  Alternative A- No Action 3.12.5.4.5There would be no direct or indirect, and therefore no cumulative effects to modeled EHE since fire suppression is not considered in the model. Firewood cutting would continue to occur along roads that are open to public motorized access. Elk would probably avoid these areas until the activities are finished and the humans have departed.  Alternatives B, C, and D- Action Alternatives 3.12.5.4.6As mentioned, direct effects would be a reduction in hiding cover (3% to 20% depending on the alternative) across most of the EAAs. This reduction would be an increase in forage for the same percentage range. Indirect effects would be improved forage habitat for elk up to approximately 20 years. Elk security areas would be reduced from roads used and openings created during implementation of the action alternatives. Upon completion, the roads would be decommissioned and closed to public motorized access, increasing elk security to levels near the existing or pre-project conditions. Hiding cover would recover in 10-15 years. Past road decommissioning from the South Fork/West Fork EA was already considered in the existing condition. The Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning project (2015) would improve elk security areas. The proposed Johnson Bar Salvage Sale (2016) would create additional foraging opportunities for elk. The ongoing DRAMVU project would eliminate cross-country motor vehicle use on the forest. Besides the conclusion for the preceding effects, no other cumulative effects are anticipated except for wildfires or fire suppression. Wildfires may create more forage for summer range. Effects are unknown, as timing and size of such events are unpredictable. Fire suppression would strive to contain fires in the affected area(s). Firewood cutting would occur as mentioned under Alternative A. All proposed project activities would maintain EHE above Forest Plan minimum levels. Other literature on elk modelling has suggested models on road effects (Rowland et al. 2000 & 2005), size of elk unit to be analyzed (Rowland et al. 2005, Unsworth et al. 1998, Boyce et al. 2003) and other elk habitat considerations. The forest is undergoing a new Forest Plan revision, and the above literature as well as future work will be considered in the development of a structure for analyzing elk on the combined Nez Perce/ Clearwater National Forest. In summary, the action alternatives are meeting the Forest Plan standards for MA 16 winter range, and at least 50% EHE. There are no Forest Plan standards for elk security. Ongoing and foreseeable actions would disturb elk in or adjacent to such activities; however, habitat would not be lost, with the exception of the private land harvest. It is unknown what habitat would remain. The conclusion of the road decommissioning project would provide more elk security after the vegetation matures to a level of density that offers elk cover. Overall, the Forest Plans standards that this project meets Standards 1,5, 6, 10, Pages II-5 and 6 from the 1987 Forest Plan (see Table 3-43 in wildlife section).  Shiras Moose 3.12.5.4.7Moose are a Forest MIS representing hunted big game species and old-growth/Pacific yew habitats. Moose in north-central Idaho select dense Pacific yew stands in old-growth grand fir communities during winter (Pierce and Peek 1984). Suitable habitats are characterized by an overstory of old growth grand fir and an understory of Pacific yew (a primary winter forage species for moose). An increase in the frequency and extent of yew has likely resulted from fire suppression; however timber harvest has likely reduced it in these same areas. Pacific yew was typically slashed and burned during regeneration timber harvest practices prior to 1987 (Crawford 1983 and Stickney 1981). From 1987 to 1991, harvest and burning were constrained in areas allocated to moose winter range. Since 1992, timber harvest and burning in Pacific yew stands have been reduced considerably based on the Conservation Guidelines for Pacific Yew (USDA 1992). Past harvest has reduced patch size and interior conditions, and isolated Pacific yew stands. The Forest Plan designated MA 21 as grand fir/Pacific yew communities to be managed for moose winter range. The goal in MA 21 is to provide for the continuing presence of Pacific yew suitable for moose winter habitat. The Forest Plan contains Management standards and practices for timber harvest and fire management can be found in the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. III-59). There are 3,686 acres (8%) of MA 21 in the Analysis Area, all located in the southern third of the area. There are 2,700 acres (77%) of currently suitable moose winter range habitat in MA 21. The other 23% is not suitable due to past harvest in or prior to the 1980s. Harvests created patchy areas of suitable habitat. There are 8 patches ranging in size from 8 to 2,658 acres (mean = 599). The two largest patches are over 1,400 acres. Past timber harvest and postharvest site preparation (hand, mechanical, and burning) reduced the winter habitat suitability for moose through the removal of the conifer overstory and the Pacific yew understory. The Forest Plan limits the amount of MA 21 regeneration harvest to 5% per decade and prescribes the retention of 50% of the live yew component scattered throughout the harvest unit in one-quarter to one-half acre patches. The preferred harvest type is patch clearcuts (preferably 5-10 acres and no more than 20 acres), individual tree selection, group selection or shelterwood. Leave strips between yew stands should also be retained to provide travel corridors for moose. Additional moose winter range totaling 8,156 acres lies outside of MA 21 in areas of subalpine fir (VRUs 1 and 10) and in smaller patches of grand fir/ yew in the headwater of the Project area (VRU 7). These are included in the effects analysis below but do not require the same Forest Plan guidelines as MA 21. Desired conditions for these areas are to retain a variety of conifer species including grand fir, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, western red cedar, Douglas-fir, western larch, lodgepole pine, and Pacific yew. These areas help to support moose populations in the project area. Suitable and potential summer range for moose is available throughout the mid- and upper elevations of the Analysis Area. Peek et al. (1987) recommended no more than about 45% of MA 21 should be in an age class younger than 90 years, and no more than 14% should be logged in any 30-year period. Roughly 835 acres (23%) of MA 21 is currently younger than 90 years old and 388 acres (11%) was harvested between 1982 and 2012. The area currently meets these recommendations. Population Trends: The Analysis Area is in IDFG Management Unit 16. Moose are managed where populations are large enough to support controlled hunts. Management Unit 16 currently has 4 antlered moose harvest permits which is down from 14 to 17 permits issued since 2000. Population levels of moose have fluctuated noticeably over time. Several sets of moose tracks were observed both within MA 21 and outside of it during field surveys. Direct and Indirect Effects Alternative A—No Action There would be no direct or indirect effects under this alternative since no activities would occur. MA 21 habitats would continue to provide moose winter habitat. Old grand fir trees would die of insects and disease, creating canopy gaps where small patches of regenerating trees would develop. This process would perpetuate the multistory conditions characteristic of grand fir/Pacific yew winter range. Outside of MA 21, in VRUs 1, 7, and 10, this process would also occur. Alternatives B, C, and D Regeneration harvest would occur on 130 acres (3%), 161 acres (4%), and 49 acres (1%) of MA 21 for Alternatives B, C, and D, respectively. This harvest type would reduce mature grand fir levels within treatment units, limiting the development of future old growth grand fir. Design features would limit patch size and retain overstory trees and existing Pacific yew in order to maintain a presence and perpetuate moose winter range. Regeneration harvest in MA 21 may slightly fragment moose winter habitat, but silvicultural prescriptions consistent with the Forest Plan would be applied to minimize effects. All grand fir and Pacific yew would be retained within PACFISH buffers which would provide a future seed source for grand fir and yew and also provide travel corridors for moose. None of the Action Alternatives would exceed the 5% per decade harvest requirement for MA 21. Regeneration harvest would occur on 329 acres and 345 acres (4%) under Alternatives B and C, and 255 acres (3%) for Alternative D, outside of MA 21 on moose winter range. Mature grand fir trees would be removed within treatment units, limiting the development of old growth grand fir. All trees, including grand fir and yew (in VRU 7) would be retained within PACFISH buffers which would provide a future seed source for grand fir and also provide moose travel corridors. Moose summer and winter habitat would continue to be available. Precommercial thinning would occur on 283 acres (8%) of MA 21 under all alternatives. Commercial thinning would occur on 363 acres (10%), 332 acres (9%), and 298 acres (8%) of MA 21 under Alternative B, C, and D respectively. Precommercial thinning would occur on 248 acres (3%) outside of MA 21 on moose winter range. Commercial thinning activities would occur outside of MA 21 on moose winter range on 625 acres (8%) for Alternative B and 581 acres and 607 acres (7%) for Alternatives C and D. Thinning would not affect suitable moose winter habitat as little to no Pacific yew remains in the stands due to past harvest and site preparation. Thinning would favor early seral species and Douglas-fir limiting the availability of grand-fir in the future. Some grand fir is present and would be retained in the stands due to tree spacing requirements and natural regeneration as stands age. Grand fir would also be retained in PACFISH buffers which would provide a future seed source for the species and suitable habitat for moose. The Alternatives B and D would meet both recommendations as described by Peek et al. (1987). Alternative C would exceed the suggested regeneration harvest limit by 1% over a 30-year period. All action alternatives would increase the harvested areas to no more than 27% of an age class of under 90 years. Thus, each alternative would remain below the 45% disturbance recommended by the authors. Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects area is the 43,700 acre project area. This area contains all MA 21, all grand fir/yew habitats, and provides general moose habitat. The time frame for cumulative effects is 30 years as that is the time it takes for a closed canopy to develop over understory yew trees in harvest units with Forest Plan MA 21 retention requirements. Alternative A- No Action There could be minor cumulative effects under this alternative from fire suppression which would increase the risk of stand replacing fire in the Project Area. This type of fire could kill existing yew and create large canopy openings where yew would have low survival. Predicting the size and severity of wildfire is not possible so the level of potential cumulative effects cannot be determined. Alternatives B, C, and D The Action Alternatives would reduce grand fir habitat slightly (<4%) but would be within Forest Plan guidelines for MA 21. Project activities would reduce the risk of stand replacing fire on 7% of the Project area which would reduce the potential impacts to MA 21 and other moose habitat. Fire suppression would continue but the risk of fire would be lessened under these alternatives when compared to the No Action Alternative. Predicting the size and severity of wildfire is not possible so the level of potential cumulative effects cannot be determined. The culvert replacement and road decommissioning projects would disturb individual moose in or near the area of activities. As the vegetation recovers in these areas, more forage would become available to moose. It is unknown if the private harvest will retain any habitat for moose. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the moose include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from table 3-43.  Neotropical Migrants 3.12.5.4.8Under the National Forest Management Act (NFMA), the Forest Service is directed to “provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use objectives” (P.L. 94-588, Sec 6 (g) (3) (B)). The January 2000 USDA Forest Service (FS) Landbird Conservation Strategic Plan, followed by the US Shorebird Conservation Plan and Executive Order 13186 in 2001, and the January 2004 PIF North American Landbird Conservation Plan all reference goals and objectives for integrating bird conservation into forest management and planning. In late 2008, a Memorandum of Understanding between the USDA Forest Service and the US Fish and Wildlife Service to Promote the Conservation of Migratory Birds was signed. The intent of the MOU is to strengthen migratory bird conservation through enhanced collaboration and cooperation between the Forest Service and the USFWS as well as other federal, State, tribal, and local governments. Within the National Forests, conservation of migratory birds focuses on providing a diversity of habitat conditions at multiple spatial scales and ensuring that bird conservation is addressed when planning for land management activities. The Nez Perce National Forest Plan contains language, “Provide and maintain a diversity and quality of habitat to support viable populations of native and desirable non-native wildlife species” (USDA Forest Service 1987a); which accommodates this more recent MOU. Opportunities to promote conservation of migratory birds and their habitats in the project area exist on forest with riparian buffers, limited activities in old growth, inventoried roadless areas, wilderness areas, wild and scenic designated areas, regional snag guidelines, and the flexibility of the Forest Plan to accommodate amendments. Examples of the latter are incorporating wildlife changes in management for threatened and endangered species and sensitive species. Design criteria for project activities cover potential disturbances to birds, and allow for mitigations of the project if necessary. Timber harvest techniques and prescribed burning would benefit many species of neotropical migrants that depend on shrubs and seral tree species for nesting and foraging. Direct and Indirect Effects No Action Alternative There would be no direct or indirect effects to neotropical migrants since no activities or disturbance would occur. Alternatives B, C, and D Noise and movement of machinery and other human activity may disturb migrant birds. The operating season may disrupt some nesting birds in or near areas of project activities. Harvest operations would begin in July, when some bird species may have fledglings present near their nest. However, most of the timber harvest and prescribed burning would occur after young birds have left the nest. Additionally, most of the project activities would not occur in riparian habitats. Design criteria would have the biologist involved with any detection of birds or nests by the project inspector. If the latter occurs, mitigations would be implemented to reduce impacts to birds or any animal that may be affected by the project activities. Cumulative Effects No Action Alternative There would be no direct or indirect effects to neotropical migrants from this alternative; therefore, there are no cumulative effects. Current population trends would be unaffected. Alternatives B, C, and D The short-term effects have been listed above in the direct and indirect effects. Long-term effects would be the benefit of increased vegetation for forest preferring migratory birds. The reduction of road densities would also discourage predation or parasitism of neotropical migrants from species that prefer edge effect habitats: cowbirds, starlings, ravens, and others. Ongoing and foreseeable projects would disturb of displace some species of migrant birds. Besides the private harvest, the other projects would produce vegetation that would be available for migrant birds as the plant structure reaches the life stage that is preferred for the various species of birds. Forest Plan standards being met by the project for the migratory birds include Standards 1, 7, FW 1, and Page II-6 from Table 3-43. The determination for the action alternatives -some impacts may occur to individuals or their habitat, but is not expected to result in a loss of viability in the Planning Area, nor cause a trend toward federal listing. Chapter 4–Consultation and Coordination The Forest Service consulted the following individuals, federal, State, and local agencies, tribes, and non-Forest Service persons during the development of this Final Environmental Impact Statement: 4.1.1.1 Interdisciplinary Team Members Matt Bienkowski—Silviculture Wes Case—Silviculture Missy Dressen—Wildlife Glen Gill—Wildlife Doug Graves—Fire/Fuels/Air Quality/Roadless Clay Hayes—Idaho Department of Fish and Game Lois Hill—Team Leader Joe Hudson—District Ranger Diana Jones—Visual Resources Margaret Kirkeminde—GIS/Maps Lynelle Knehans—Roads Megan Lucas—Watershed/Soils Steve Lucas—Heritage Resources Michelle Roberts—Wildlife Cindy Schacher—Heritage Resources Karen Smith—Fisheries/Aquatics Michael Ward—CFLRA Coordinator John Warofka—Botany Tam White—Logging Systems/Economics/Layout 4.1.1.2 Federal, State, and Local Agencies City of Cottonwood, Idaho Idaho County Sheriff Idaho Department of Environmental Quality Idaho Department of Fish and Game Idaho Department of Lands Idaho State Historic Preservation Office Kamiah Chamber of Commerce, Kamiah, Idaho National Marine Fisheries Service National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Resource Conservation Service U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 4.1.1.3 Tribes Nez Perce Tribe 4.1.1.4 Others Alliance for the Wild Rockies The Clearwater Basin Collaborative The Friends of the Clearwater The Nature ConservancyChapter 5–Glossary and Acronyms A Activity A measure, course of action, or treatment that is undertaken to directly or indirectly produce, enhance, or maintain forest and range land outputs or achieve administrative or environmental quality objectives. Affected Environment The biological and physical environment that will or may be changed by actions proposed and the relationship of people to that environment. AIRFA American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. Alternative One of several policies, plans, or projects proposed for decisionmaking. Anadromous Fish Fish which spend much of their adult life in the ocean, returning to inland waters to spawn; e.g., salmon, steelhead. Aquatic Ecosystem A stream channel, lake, or estuary bed, the water itself, and the biotic communities that occur therein. ATV All-Terrain Vehicle.

It is generally dependent on available soil moisture and nutrients and length of growing season. Stand A plant community of trees which possess uniformity in vegetation type, age class, vigor, size class, and stocking class and one which is distinguishable from adjacent forest communities. Standard An objective requiring a specific level of attainment; a rule to measure against; a guiding principle. Stream Order A measure of the position of a perennial stream in the hierarchy of tributaries. First order streams are unbranched streams; they have no tributaries. Second order streams are formed by the confluence of two or more first order streams. Third order streams are formed by the confluence of two or more second order streams; they are considered third order until they join another third order or larger stream. Subnivean A zone that is in or under the snow layer. It can form when latent heat from the ground melts a thin layer of snow above it, leaving a layer of air between the ground and the snow. Subnivean animals include small mammals such as mice, voles, shrews, and lemmings that must rely on winter snow cover for survival. These mammals move under the snow for protection from heat loss and predators Successional Stage A phase in the gradual supplanting of one community of plants by another. Suitable Forest Land Forest land (as defined in CFR 219.13) for which technology is available that will ensure timber production without irreversible resource damage to soils, productivity or watershed conditions; for which there is reasonable assurance that such lands can be adequately restocked (as provided in CFR 219.14), and for which there is management direction that indicates that timber production is an appropriate use of that area. Supply Limited Stream A supply (sediment) limited stream has more energy available during a typical year than there is sediment in the stream channel available to be moved. The excess energy leads to a resilience that enables the system to recover and cleanse itself if extreme sediment loads are not delivered in a short period of time. System Road; Forest System Road A road that is part of the Forest development transportation system, which includes all existing and planned roads, as well as other special and terminal facilities designated as Forest development transportation facilities. T Temporary Roads Roads which are constructed for a one time or short term use which are not expected to be utilized in the future.

Roads that have moderate to high risk of failure, that are near fish bearing streams, or are being used by unauthorized vehicles will require full decompaction and natural slope recontour. All roads with stream crossings or other watershed concerns will be recontoured including stream grade channel restoration. Roads identified in this project not meeting the above criteria may be abandoned. Abandoned roads have no stream crossings, are well vegetated, are resistant to surface erosion and are not prone to mass failure. Each road used for timber haul in accordance with this project will be either reconditioned or reconstructed based on the existing condition of the roadway. Reconditioning roads consists of standard maintenance, such as road blading, brushing, removal of small cutslope failures, applying rock in wet areas and removal of obstructions such as rocks and trees. Reconditioning also includes maintenance of existing culverts. Road reconstruction improves the roadway. This includes replacing and installing new culverts for cross drains and live water culverts, placement of rock surfacing, placement of roadway fill and installation of new signs or gates. Other activities include installation of drainage dips, road blading, brushing and removal of obstructions. The definitions for road reconstruction and road reconditioning above do not include all activities that can be completed under each classification; these definitions are for informational purposes only. Reconditioning and reconstruction is based on the current condition of the roadway. As the project continues, road failures or different access may require the type of work and roads requiring work to change. This is an approximation of road work for the Clear Creek project. Table B-1 shows road decommissioning, reconditioning, and reconstruction common to all action alternatives.   Table B-1.

Soil quality standard #2 currently reads as follows: “A minimum of 80 percent of any activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled upon completion of activities. This direction does not apply to permanent recreation facilities and other permanent facilities such as system roads.” The following amendment is proposed, specific to the Clear Creek project area: “Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect 15 percent or less of the activity area, a cumulative minimum of 85 percent of the activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddle upon completion of activities. Where detrimental soil conditions from past activities affect more than 15 percent o the activity area, the cumulative detrimental soil disturbance from project implementation and past activities shall not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and shall provide a net improvement in soil quality.” This guidance is taken from R1 soil quality guidelines found in R1 Supplement No. 2500-99-1 of Forest Service Manual 2500 - Watershed and Air Management. Analysis of Factors Soil Standard #2 (Forest Plan II-22) would be amended with a site specific Forest Plan Amendment for the Clear Creek project area on the Moose Creek Ranger District. The amendment would allow vegetation treatments and soil improvement activities to proceed in areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil conditions. The amendment takes into account the amount of existing detrimental soil disturbance, and allows the flexibility to achieve multiple resource objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions. Timing The amended Soil Standard #2 would be effective until the Forest Plan is revised or amended. The Nez Perce National Forest Plan is scheduled for revision in 2013. The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited. Location and Size The proposed Forest Plan amendment would affect implementation of activities only in the Clear Creek project area. The project area is about 43,730 acres, and is located in Township 30, 31, 32 North, Ranges 5 and 6 East, Boise Principle Meridian. The project area represents less than 2 percent of the total 2,274,146 acres of National Forest System land in the Nez Perce National Forest. The size of area affected is therefore limited. Proposed activities in the Clear Creek project include soil remediation to achieve a net improvement in proposed treatment units with past soil disturbance. Soil improvement actions can increase water infiltration, increase soil productivity, reduce potential for weed invasion, and stabilize bare slopes. Actions include decompacting soils, recontouring to slope, and adding organic matter, including large woody material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend for soil conditions; advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment. Goals, Objectives, and Outputs The Forest Plan goal for soils is to maintain soil productivity and minimize any irreversible impacts to soil resource. The Forest Plan objective for soils is to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion through the application of best management practices, careful riparian area management, use of fish/water quality drainage objectives, and soil and water resource improvement projects. This amendment is fully consistent with the goals and objectives of the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Because the amendment would: impose a standard to maintain soil productivity and allow activities to restore areas with considerable pre-existing detrimental soil disturbance. These activities would respond directly and indirectly to the Forest Plan goal and objective for soils. The activities would not inhibit achievement of the Forest Plan goal/objective. This amendment would allow a net improvement in soil condition in the units treated with prior impacts. This is a site-specific amendment to the Forest Plan soil quality standard #2 for lands in the Clear Creek project area. This site-specific amendment would allow the Clear Creek project to proceed despite the fact that several proposed units currently exceed the 20% compacted, displaced or puddle soils standard. The soils analysis in the Clear Creek project area found that some units harvested in the 1960 to 1980s using ground based and jammer logging systems, have compacted or displaced soils over more than 20% of the harvested area. Proposed activities for the Clear Creek project include soil remediation activities to achieve a net improvement in proposed vegetation management units. In order to enter these units under the Clear Creek project, an amendment to soil quality standard #2 is needed. Management Perspective Amendment of Forest Plan Soil Standard #2 is specific or applicable only to the Clear Creek activity area. This amendment does not apply to activities occurring outside the Clear Creek project area. The proposed change would occur on less than 2 percent of the Forest, therefore there would be no measurable change to goods and service produced in the total forest panning unit (2,274,146 acres, Forest) prior to completion of the Forest Plan revision. This direction does not apply to permanent recreation facilities and other permanent facilities such as system roads. This amendment would make the Forest Plan standard consistent with Regional soil quality guidelines (USDA 1999). Purpose and Need of Amendment Purpose The purpose of this amendment is to allow activities to occur on areas with greater than 20 percent detrimental soil disturbance. Need Past harvest activities have altered soils conditions in the Clear Creek project area. The current Forest Plan standards and the Forest Service Region1 soil quality guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. The proposed amendment would change Forest Plan standard #2, allowing for activities to occur on areas with greater than 20% soil detrimental disturbance, as long as soil improvement activities are implemented. Based on the current condition a project specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for Alternatives B, C and D to allow for harvest activities to occur on three units of the Clear Creek project. Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Impact of Amendment Direct and indirect effects No Action Alternative Alternative A would not amend the Forest Plan. Soil conditions in three units of the Clear Creek project area would remain detrimentally disturbed. No soil improvement activities would occur. Action Alternatives Alternatives B, C and D are evaluated in this analysis, and would require a Forest Plan amendment for soil standard #2. These alternatives would not adjust the goals, objectives or outputs as described in the Forest Plan. This amendment would allow the Clear Creek project to proceed despite the fact that three of the proposed units currently exceed the 20% compacted, displaced or puddle soils standard. The amendment would allow vegetation treatments and soil improvement activities to proceed in areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil conditions. The amendment takes into account the amount of existing detrimental soil disturbance, and allows the flexibility to achieve multiple resource objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions. Proposed activities in the Clear Creek project include soil remediation to achieve a net improvement in proposed treatment units with past soil disturbance. Soil improvement objectives are to increase water infiltration, increase soil productivity, reduce potential for weed invasion, and stabilize bare slopes. Actions include decompacting soils, recontouring to slope, and adding organic matter, including large woody material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend for soil conditions; advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment. This site specific amendment applies to the Clear Creek project area. The amended Soil Standard #2 would be effective until the Forest Plan is revised or amended. The Nez Perce National Forest Plan is scheduled for revision in 2013. The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited. This amendment would make the Forest Plan standard consistent with Regional soil quality guidelines (USDA 1999). Cumulative effects There are no cumulative effects with the proposed amendment to the Forest Plan. The amendment is project specific and limited in time. Application of FSM 1926.51 Directives Not Significant Criteria The determination of whether this proposed amendment is significant was done using the process in the Forest Service Planning Handbook, 1926.51 (http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/index5.html). The handbook states changes to the land management plan that are not significant can result from four specific situations. This forest-wide amendment is compared to those situations below:  Table C-1. Soils Amendment Criteria Considered Changes to the Land Management Plan That Are Not Significant Alternatives B, C, and D Forest Plan Soil standard #2 - Amendment 1. Actions that do not significantly alter the multiple use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management. The objectives set forth in the Forest Plan for soils would not be altered. The goal to maintain soil productivity and minimize any reversible impacts to the soil resource would still be met. 2. Adjustments of management area boundaries or management prescriptions resulting from further onsite analysis when the adjustments do not cause significant changes in the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management. The proposed amendment does not alter the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource management.  The amendment only affects the analysis for this project. It is a project specific amendment that would have no effect to Forest Plan objectives or outputs. 3. Minor changes in standards and guidelines. This amendment would only apply to the Clear Creek project. All other soil goals and standards would apply to this project. This amendment alters soil standard #2 to be consistent with regional soil guidelines. 4. Opportunities for additional projects or activities that will contribute to achievement of the management prescription. Future projects would follow the current Forest Plan standard. This amendment would not adjust management area boundaries or management prescriptions in future analyses.  Conclusion – Significance/Non-Significance The preliminary determination is that the adoption of this amendment to the Nez Perce National Forest Plan, soil standard #2, is not significant. This conclusion is based on consideration of the four factors identified in the Forest Service Planning handbook, 1926.51 and review of the Forest Plan. This amendment is fully consistent with the current Forest Plan goals and standards and Region 1 soil quality guidance.  Appendix D Proposed Site-Specific Forest Plan Amendment—Old Growth    Appendix D--Proposed Site-Specific Forest Plan Amendment—Old Growth Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment No. 42 (Proposed) Site-Specific Amendment to Appendix N For the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project Area The purpose of this amendment is to replace the Forest Plan Appendix N definitions of old growth with the definitions found in Old Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region (Green, et al., 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11). The Green et al. definitions are regarded as the “best available science” for the classification of old growth at the site-specific level. This nonsignificant amendment is site-specific, and would apply only to the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project action alternatives. This amendment would not apply to any activities or projects outside the project area. This amendment would not change the Forest Plan objective for MA 20, which is to maintain viable populations of old-growth-dependent wildlife species. “At least 10 percent of the forested acres across the Forest that are suitable old-growth habitat will be managed as old-growth habitat. This acreage will be distributed across the Forest in a way which assures that at least 5 percent of the forested acres within major prescription watersheds of 6,000 to 10,000 acres will be managed as old-growth habitat.” (USDA-FS 1987, page II-6). Adopting the definitions for old growth found in Green et al. (1992) that define successional stages, stratification by habitat types, and other site conditions would help refine our interpretation of the old growth characteristics described in Appendix N of the Forest Plan. Additionally, adoption of this amendment would ensure consistent terminology and analysis. Old growth determination is done through data collection in accordance with Region One stand exam protocols that correlate to the definitions found in Green et al (1992). Changes to Old Growth and Snag Management Following direction to use best available science, the Nez Perce National Forest has updated Forest direction for old growth and snag management. Old Growth Forest Types of the Northern Region by Green, Joy, Sirucek, Hann, Zack and Naumann is the current and best science available for defining old growth. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 is based on habitat types to determine old growth conditions. Greens research is based on field data called stand exams with over 20,000 samples. Although Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 criteria for old growth is more complex, the criteria is also more relevant, more precise and within the capability of the specific Nez Perce National Forest habitat types. Each habitat type is assigned to a habitat type group which corresponds to an old growth type. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 defines old growth within the ecological conditions with specific criteria that are within the capability of the habitat type. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 old growth description is based on successional processes in which stands develop into late seral single storied stands or late seral multi storied stands or the stage where climax tree species dominates the stand. The Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 description of old growth replaces the Nez Perce Forest Plan’s original old growth standards as stated below. Old Growth Management Standards “Forested acres” in this document refers to land that is capable of producing an old growth stand, as defined below. This generally applies to land in productivity classes 3, 4 and 5. Old growth habitat is defined as a community of forest vegetation which has reached a late stage of plant succession characterized by a diverse stand structure and composition along with a significant showing of decadence. The stand structure will have multi storied crown heights and variable crown densities. There is a variety of tree sizes and ages ranging from small groups of seedlings and saplings to trees of large diameters exhibiting a wide range of defect and breakage both live and dead, standing and down. The time it takes for a forest stand to develop into old growth condition depends on many local variables such as forest type, habitat type, and climate. Natural chance events involving forces of nature such as weather, insect, disease, fire and the actions of man also affect the rate of development of old growth stand conditions.  Table D-1.

However, the original set of old growth criteria is a blanket requirement for all old growth stands whether the location could meet the requirements or not. For example, lodgepole pine rarely reaches 21 inches in diameter and the original Forest Plan Appendix N requirements likely would not be met. The original old growth amendment did not state that the minimum age for old growth is 150 years old. However, on page III-56 of the forest plan describing Management Area 20 – Old Growth, old growth is described as being over mature and 150 years old or older. Using Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 the following criteria would be used to define old growth: Each old growth type is determined by minimum criteria including minimum age class of large trees, minimum number of trees per acre with a particular diameter at breast height (DBH), with minimum basal area. Associated stand characteristics include: 1) Variation in diameter 2) Percent dead or broken top 3) Probability of down woody debris 4) Percent Decay 5) Number of canopy layers 6) Snags greater than or equal to 9 inches in diameter  Table D-2.

They are the range of means for trees greater than or equal to 9 inches DBH across plots within forests, forest types, or habitat type groups. 3These are not minimum criteria. They are Low, Moderate, and High probabilities of abundant large down woody material or variation in diameters based on stand condition expected to occur most frequently. 4This is not a minimum criteria. The number of canopy layers can vary within an old growth type with age, relative abundance of different species, and successional stage. 5In Old Growth Type 4B, 120 square feet of basal area applies to habitat type groups F, G, and G1, and 80 square feet of basal area applies to habitat type groups H and I. In whitebark pine forest type, 60 square feet of basal area applies to habitat type groups I and J, and 40 square feet of basal area applies to habitat type group K. 6In Old Growth Type 7, the 25” minimum DBH only applies to cedar trees. Old trees of other species are evaluated with a minimum DBH appropriate for that species on these habitat types (21” for Douglas fir, grand fir, lodgepole pine, western hemlock, white pine, ponderosa pine; and 17” for subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock). (Green et al, 1992, Errata 2011) 7L = Low, M = Medium, H = High.  The primary reason for managing for old growth is to maintain viable populations of old growth dependent species. Our reasoning for maintaining old growth has not changed in the amended old growth description. The proposed site specific Forest Plan amendment for old growth is consistent with the previous forest plan amendment on old growth. The previous old growth amendment directed old growth designations to be in riparian areas. Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 indicates that most of the old growth is in lower elevations. The wet riparian habitat conservation areas (RHCA’s) are likely to have survived the fires of 1938 and developed into old growth. The Nez Perce Forest Plan indicates that the Forest wide goal is to manage riparian areas to support 80 percent of maximum populations of snag dependent species and all other areas to support 60 percent of maximum populations of snag dependent species. The Nez Perce National Forests minimum requirements for amount and distribution of old growth has not changed. However, old growth categories are clarified and defined. Currently the Nez Perce National Forest manages for old growth in Management Area 20 (MA 20), verified old growth and recruitment old growth. We have substituted the Green et al. 1992, errata corrected 02/05, 12/07, 10/08, 12/11 requirements for old growth but the process to designate and distribute old growth remains the same. The process for assigning recruitment old growth stands also remains the same. It is important to recognize and understand that some watersheds may not have any verified old growth because natural disturbance agents like severe wildfire have removed old growth from the landscape. Because of natural events like the fires of 1910 and 1938, recruitment old growth may be quite young and may take many years before functioning as old growth. The site specific old growth amendment does not require verifying old growth because verification has already been done in the project area.  Table D-3.

Species unlikely to be present due to insufficient habitat and species unaffected by proposed activities include: American peregrine falcon, bald eagle, bighorn sheep, black swift, common loon, Coeur d’ Alene salamander, harlequin duck, long-billed curlew, Townsend’s big-eared bat, white-headed woodpecker, and grizzly bear. These species will not be considered in detail in this assessment. Bald Eagle Eagle nesting activity in Clear Creek is highly unlikely because of its great distance from the nearest three large river systems (Middle Fork Clearwater River, South Fork Clearwater River, and Selway River) that provide primary foraging habitat. Winter roosting is possible, but highly improbable because of distance (over 2 miles) from the river systems. Infrequent, sporadic foraging may occur in Clear Creek as eagles search upland areas for prey. This species was dropped from detailed analysis because it is unlikely to use habitats in the analysis area and the project would have no impact on bald eagles. Bighorn Sheep This species is a Nez Perce National Forest management indicator species and sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). There is no suitable habitat in the analysis area, therefore the proposed activities would have no impact on this species and it was dropped from detailed study. Black Swift This species is a Nez Perce National Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). The black swift is a neotropical migratory bird that nests in moist cliff environments, preferring high elevation mountains. Nests are built on cliff ledges, near or behind waterfalls or in shallow caves. Riparian habitats would be protected by implementing Forest Plan Amendment 20 (PACFISH) and no suitable habitat is known to occur in the project area. The proposed activities would have no impact on this species and it was dropped from detailed study. Coeur d' Alene Salamander The Clear Creek analysis area is too far from the Clearwater and Selway river corridors to expect Coeur d’ Alene salamander occurrence in streams, seeps, or springs in the analysis area. Potential habitat features are present in the analysis area, but the lack of connectivity with occupied habitat may preclude their occurrence. All riparian habitats are protected in no harvest riparian habitat conservation areas by implementing Forest Plan Amendment 20 (PACFISH). Because of the improbability of occurrence and high levels of habitat protection, the project would have no impact this species and it was dropped from detailed analysis. Common Loon This species is a Nez Perce National Forest sensitive species. It is found in pond and lake environments. Riparian habitats would be protected by implementing Forest Plan Amendment 20 (PACFISH) and no suitable pond or lake habitat occurs in the project area. The proposed activities would have no impact on this species and it was dropped from detailed study. Grizzly Bear Despite numerous studies of this area and many reported bear observations, there were no verifiable sightings of grizzly bears in the last 60 years until an adult male grizzly bear was mistakenly killed by a black bear hunter in September 2007 in the northern mountains of the Bitterroot Ecosystem. In November 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) published a Record of Decision (ROD) for a Final Environmental Impact Statement to reintroduce bears in the Bitterroot Ecosystem. The preferred alternative selected in the ROD called for establishment of a nonessential experimental population of grizzlies in the Bitterroot ecosystem under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act. The decision was to reintroduce grizzly bears only into the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area unless it was later determined that reintroduction in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness also was appropriate. The State of Idaho sued to block the plan. The Service is now reevaluating this Record of Decision and is proposing a "No Action" alternative. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to concentrate recovery efforts and resources on existing grizzly bear populations in the lower 48 states and to withdraw its plan to reintroduce grizzly bears into the Bitterroot ecosystem of Idaho and Montana. Public comment on this proposal was received but there has not been a final decision. If the No Action alternative is selected, grizzly bears would not be reintroduced into the Bitterroot ecosystem. The analysis area falls within the Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Experimental Population Area but outside the Recovery Area. The Bitterroot Grizzly Bear Recovery Area consists of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness. The Recovery Area is located within the Experimental Population Area, and is the area where grizzly bear recovery would be emphasized. Because the FWS is re-considering grizzly reintroduction into the Bitterroot ecosystem, pending State of Idaho litigation if implementation of a reintroduction program is proposed, and since there has been only one verifiable grizzly sighting in the Clearwater basin in the last 60 years, the grizzly will not be further considered in detail in this analysis. Harlequin Duck Harlequin summer habitat is not expected to be present in Clear Creek based on the descriptive features of occupied breeding, nesting, and brood rearing habitat found in Idaho, and from prior surveys in the Lochsa, Selway, and South Fork Clearwater rivers. This project implements Forest Plan Amendment 20 (PACFISH). For these reasons, the project would have no impact on this species and it was not analyzed in detail. Long-Billed Curlew Long-billed curlews nest in open short-grass or mixed-prairie habitat with level or slightly rolling topography and in general avoid areas of trees, high-density shrubs, and tall, dense grasses. The non-forested areas in the analysis are limited and do not provide suitable habitat for this species. This project would have no impact on this species; therefore it was dropped from detailed study. Peregrine Falcon This species is a Nez Perce National Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). Peregrine falcons nests on ledges on steep cliff faces. The Clear Creek analysis area does not have any potential habitat features suitable for peregrine nesting, nor does the extensive forest cover provide much open hunting habitat preferred by peregrines. In the absence of suitable nesting cliffs, proposed activities would have no impact on this species and it was dropped from detailed study. Townsend’s Big-eared Bat Townsend observations have been confirmed on both the Clearwater and Moose Creek Ranger Districts. Romin and Bosworth (2010) found this bat just northeast of the analysis area on the Moose Creek Ranger District along the Selway River in the vicinity of Goddard Creek. Perkins (1992) surveyed some of the most suitable hibernacula and maternity/nursery roost sites on the Nez Perce Forest during summer and winter without finding any recent evidence or presence of Townsend’s big-eared bat on the Forest. He suggested that their occurrence on the forest is peripheral and does not involve reproductive activities. The probable occurrence of this bat outside the Salmon and Snake River riparian areas is extremely low and initial population indicators suggest less than 10 on the Forest (Perkins). Because the analysis area does not have cave habitat, it is unlikely that Townsend’s big-eared bats use snags as day or night roosting habitat or forage in the area. For this reason, they were dropped from detailed analysis and the project would have no impact on this bat. White-Headed Woodpecker This species is a Nez Perce National Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest conservation need (IDFG 2005). White-headed woodpeckers prefer open-canopy mature to old growth ponderosa pine forests. Recorded observations on the Nez Perce Forest are found in the Salmon River sub-basin. There are no potentially suitable habitat patches that meet the minimum area (148 acres) recommended for nesting habitat in the analysis area. In fragmented tracts of habitat such as those found in Clear Creek, home range size per pair could be up to 800 acres (Dixon 1995). It is doubtful white-headed woodpecker would occur in Clear Creek based on their habitat need for extensive areas of primarily mature and old growth ponderosa pine forest and mixed co-dominant ponderosa pine/Douglas fir forest. For this reason, the project would have no impact on white-headed woodpecker and it was dropped from detailed study.  Section 2—Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Table F-2. Standards and Guidelines Consistency Evaluation Table for Project Specific Activities* Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). All Management Practices and Activities (ALL) The following objectives, standards and guidelines apply to management projects in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU) and in linkage areas, subject to valid existing rights. They do not apply to wildfire suppression, or to wildland fire use. Standard43 ALL S1 New or expanded permanent developments33 and vegetation management projects48 must maintain26 habitat connectivity16 in an LAU21 and/or linkage area22. LAU 30 is an isolated polygon that has no linkage areas to other LAUs, according to Figure 1-1 of the 2007 NRLMD The closest adjacent LAU is about 1.8 miles south. Closest actual habitat from LAU 30 is about 4 miles south. No new or expanded developments are proposed. Habitat connectivity would be maintained in the LAU, as vegetation treatments would occur on less than 1.5% of the LAU. Guideline15 ALL G1 Methods to avoid or reduce effects on lynx should be used when constructing or reconstructing highways18 or forest highways12 across federal land. Methods could include fencing, underpasses or overpasses. No such activities would occur with this project. Standard LAU S1 Changes in LAU21 boundaries shall be based on site-specific habitat information and after review by the Forest Service Regional Office. Not applicable to this project. Vegetation Management Projects (VEG) The following objectives, standards and guidelines apply to vegetation management projects in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU). With the exception of Objective VEG O3 that specifically concerns wildland fire use, the objectives, standards and guidelines do not apply to wildfire suppression, wildland fire use, or removal of vegetation for permanent developments like mineral operations, ski runs, roads and the like. None of the objectives, standards, or guidelines apply to linkage areas. Standard VEG S1 – Stand initiation structural stage limits Standard VEG S1 applies to all vegetation management48 projects that regenerate37 timber, except for fuel treatment13 projects within the wildland urban interface (WUI) 49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: Fuel treatment projects within the WUI that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest). For fuel treatment projects within the WUI, see guideline VEG G10. The Standard: Unless a broad scale assessment has been completed that substantiates different historic levels of stand initiation structural stages44 limit Two WUI boundaries intersect LAU 30: one in the north, the other in the eastern section of the LAU. All but one 4-acre unit of the proposed harvest units are located in the northern WUI. At this time, only 11.7% of lynx habitat in the LAU 30 is currently unsuitable or in the stand initiation structural stage. The acres converted to a stand initiation structural stage for the project alternative include 246 acres (1.2%) of regeneration harvest. No landscape burning occurs within the LAU. The project complies with Standard VEG S1 and is well below the 30% Threshold.  Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). disturbance in each LAU as follows: If more than 30 percent of the lynx habitat in an LAU is currently in a stand initiation structural stage that does not yet provide winter snowshoe hare habitat, no additional habitat may be regenerated by vegetation management projects. Standard VEG S2 – Limits on regeneration from timber management projects Standard VEG S2 applies to all vegetation management48 projects that regenerate37 timber, except for fuel treatment13 projects within the wildland urban interface (WUI)49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: Fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest). For fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 see guideline VEG G10. The Standard: Timber management projects shall not regenerate37 more than 15 percent of lynx habitat on NFS lands in an LAU in a ten-year period. Lynx habitat lies in the WUI. At this time, only 0.2% of LAU 30 has been regenerated in the past 10 years. This project alternative would regenerate 246 acres; bringing the total to 1.3% regeneration. The project complies with Standard VEG S2 and is well below the 15% Threshold for regeneration in the past 10 years.  Guideline VEG G11 – Denning habitat Denning habitat6 should be distributed in each LAU in the form of pockets of large amounts of large woody debris, either down logs or root wads, or large piles of small wind thrown trees (“jack-strawed” piles). If denning habitat appears to be lacking in the LAU, then projects should be designed to retain some coarse woody debris4, piles, or residual trees to provide denning habitat6 in the future. Treatments (82 acres of regeneration) are proposed in ‘modeled’ lynx denning habitat. However, stand exams show this is in grand fir or Douglas-fir dominated overstories, and not mixed density ES, SAF, & LPP. Therefore, no treatments would occur in field verified lynx denning habitat. Vegetation treatments are not planned in the spruce-fir community or areas with an abundance of dead, down woody material. Treatments are proposed in dry community types made up of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine and grand fir. As a project design measure, harvest units will retain large down logs. Standard VEG S5 – Precommercial thinning limits Standard VEG S5 applies to all precommercial thinning35 projects, except for fuel treatment13 projects that use precommercial thinning as a tool within the wildland urban interface (WUI)49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: Fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest). For fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 see guideline VEG G10. The Standard: Precommercial thinning projects that reduce snowshoe hare habitat, may occur from the stand No precommercial thinning would occur in lynx habitat in this project alternative. Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). initiation structural stage44 until the stands no longer provide winter snowshoe hare habitat only: 1. Within 200 feet of administrative sites, dwellings, or outbuildings; or 2. For research studies38 or genetic tree tests evaluating genetically improved reforestation stock; or 3. Based on new information that is peer reviewed and accepted by the regional levels of the Forest Service and FWS, where a written determination states: a) that a project is not likely to adversely affect lynx; or b) that a project is likely to have short term adverse effects on lynx or its habitat, but would result in long-term benefits to lynx and its habitat; or 4.

For daylight thinning of planted rust-resistant white pine where 80% of the winter snowshoe hare habitat50 is retained; or 6. To restore whitebark pine. Standard VEG S6 – Multi-storied stands & snowshoe hare horizontal cover Standard VEG S6 applies to all vegetation management48 projects that regenerate37 timber, except for fuel treatment13 projects within the wildland urban interface (WUI)49 as defined by HFRA, subject to the following limitation: Fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 that do not meet Standards VEG S1, VEG S2, VEG S5, and VEG S6 may occur on no more than 6 percent (cumulatively) of lynx habitat on each administrative unit (a unit is a National Forest). For fuel treatment projects within the WUI49 see guideline VEG G10. The Standard: Vegetation management projects that reduce snowshoe hare habitat in multi-story mature or late successional forests29 may occur only: 1. Within 200 feet of administrative sites, dwellings, outbuildings, recreation sites, and special use permit improvements, including infrastructure within permitted ski area boundaries; or 2. For research studies38 or genetic tree tests evaluating genetically improved reforestation stock; or 3. For incidental removal during salvage harvest41 (e.g. removal due to location of skid trails). There would be no harvest in mature- or late-successional, multi-story hare habitat. Vegetation treatments are not planned in the spruce-fir community or areas with dense horizontal cover. Treatments are proposed in dry community types made up of Douglas fir, ponderosa pine and grand fir. Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). (NOTE: Timber harvest is allowed in areas that have potential to improve winter snowshoe hare habitat but presently have poorly developed understories that lack dense horizontal cover [e.g. uneven age management systems could be used to create openings where there is little understory so that new forage can grow]). Guideline VEG G1 – Lynx habitat improvement Vegetation management48 projects should be planned to recruit a high density of conifers, hardwoods, and shrubs where such habitat is scarce or not available. Priority should be given to stem-exclusion, closed-canopy structural stage44 stands for lynx or their prey (e.g. mesic, monotypic lodgepole stands). Winter snowshoe hare habitat50 should be near denning habitat6. Regeneration harvest, prescribed burning (site prep), and planting in LAU 30 would recruit a high density of conifers near denning habitat. Tree retention would occur within all units to provide for future woody material. This proposed alternative would convert 246 acres to a stand initiation structural stage. This is 1.2% of the LAU. Guideline VEG G4 – Prescribed Fire Prescribed fire34 activities should not create permanent travel routes that facilitate snow compaction. Constructing permanent firebreaks on ridges or saddles should be avoided. Prescribed fire associated with site preparation would not create permanent travel routes. No firebreaks are proposed in lynx habitat. Guideline VEG G5 – Habitat for alternate prey species Habitat for alternate prey species, primarily red squirrel36, should be provided in each LAU. Habitat for alternate prey would remain available in mature- and old-growth forest in the LAU. Guideline VEG G10 – Fuel treatments in the WUI Fuel treatment projects in the WUI 49 as defined by HFRA17, 48 should be designed considering standards VEG S1, S2, S5, and S6 to promote lynx conservation. About 94% of the project area lies in the rural Salmon-Clearwater WUI. All but one unit (4 acres) proposed in this project are located in LAU 30 and the WUI. Fuel treatments are planned as site preparation for tree planting. Summer forage for snowshoe hares should be available to potential lynx from 2-25 years after the planned burns. Livestock Management (GRAZ) The following objectives and guidelines apply to grazing projects in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU). They do not apply to linkage areas. Guideline GRAZ G1 – Livestock grazing and openings In fire- and harvest-created openings, livestock grazing should be managed so impacts do not prevent shrubs and trees from regenerating. Not applicable to this project. None of these actions would occur in the LAU. Guideline GRAZ G2 – Livestock grazing and aspen In aspen stands, livestock grazing should be managed to contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of aspen. Not applicable to this project Guideline GRAZ G3 – Livestock grazing and riparian areas & willow carrs In riparian areas40 and willow carrs3, livestock grazing should be managed to contribute to maintaining or Not applicable to this project. Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). achieving a preponderance of mid- or late-seral stages28, similar to conditions that would have occurred under historic disturbance regimes. Guideline GRAZ G4 – Livestock grazing and shrub-steppe habitats In shrub-steppe habitats42, livestock grazing should be managed in the elevation ranges of forested lynx habitat in LAUs21, to contribute to maintaining or achieving a preponderance of mid- or late-seral stages, similar to conditions that would have occurred under historic disturbance regimes. Not applicable to this project Human Use Projects (HU) The following objectives and guidelines apply to human use projects, such as special uses (other than grazing), recreation management, roads, highways, mineral and energy development, and in lynx habitat in lynx analysis units (LAU), subject to valid existing rights. They do not apply to vegetation management projects or grazing projects directly. They do not apply to linkage areas. Guideline HU G1 – Ski area expansion & development, inter-trail islands When developing or expanding ski areas, provisions should be made for adequately sized inter-trail islands that include coarse woody debris4, so winter snowshoe hare habitat49 is maintained. Not applicable to this project Guideline HU G2 – Ski are expansion & development, foraging habitat When developing or expanding ski areas, foraging should be provided consistent with the ski area’s operational needs, especially where lynx habitat occurs as narrow bands of coniferous forest across mountain slopes. Not applicable to this project Guideline HU G3 – Recreation developments Recreation developments and operations should be planned in ways that both provide for lynx movement and maintain the effectiveness of lynx habitat23. No recreational developments are in or planned to be in the LAU. Guideline HU G4 – Mineral & energy development For mineral and energy development sites and facilities, remote monitoring should be encouraged to reduce snow compaction. No such developments are occurring or planned in the LAU. Guideline HU G5 – Mineral & energy development, habitat restoration For mineral and energy development sites and facilities that are closed, a reclamation plan that restores39 lynx habitat should be developed. Not applicable to this project Guideline HU G6 – Roads, upgrading Methods to avoid or reduce effects to lynx should be used in lynx habitat when upgrading unpaved roads to maintenance levels 4 or 5, if the result would be increased traffic speeds and volumes, or a foreseeable contribution to increases in human activity or Met–Existing roads in or to access the LAU would be improved for harvest activities, but not to levels 4 or 5. None of these would be upgraded to a level to increase traffic speeds, or to increase volumes beyond the need to haul out product. Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). development. Guideline HU G7 – Roads, locations New permanent roads should not be built on ridge-tops and saddles, or in areas identified as important for lynx habitat connectivity16. New permanent roads and trails should be situated away from forested stringers. Met–No new permanent roads would be constructed. Guideline HU G8 – Roads, brushing Cutting brush along low-speed25, low-traffic-volume roads should be done to the minimum level necessary to provide for public safety. Met. Guideline HU G9 – Roads, new On new roads built for projects, public motorized use should be restricted. Effective closures should be provided in road designs. When the project is over, these roads should be reclaimed or decommissioned, if not needed for other management objectives. Met–All new roads are temporary and will be decommissioned in 1-5 years. In addition, another 13.8 miles of road (outside the LAU) would be decommissioned for soil concerns. Guideline HU G10 – Roads, ski area access When developing or expanding ski areas and trails, access roads and lift termini to maintain and provide lynx security10 habitat. Not applicable to this project. Guideline HU G11 – Snow compaction Designated over-the-snow routes, or designated play areas, should not expand outside baseline areas of consistent snow compaction1, unless designation serves to consolidate use and improve lynx habitat. This is calculated on an LAU basis, or on a combination of immediately adjacent LAUs. This does not apply inside permitted ski area boundaries, to winter logging, to rerouting trails for public safety, to accessing private inholdings, or to access regulated by Guideline HU G12. Use the same analysis boundaries for all actions subject to this guideline. Does not apply to this project. Guideline HU G12 – Winter access for non-recreation SUP & mineral & energy development Winter access for non-recreation special uses, and mineral and energy exploration and development, should be limited to designated routes8 or designated over-the-snow routes7. Met–Does not apply to this project. Linkage Areas (Link) The following objective, standard and guidelines apply to all projects within linkage areas, subject to valid existing rights. Met–No linkage areas defined in figure 1 of the NRLMD in this part of the Nez Perce Forest. Standard LINK S1 – Highway or forest highway construction in linkage areas When highway18 or forest highway12 construction or reconstruction is proposed in linkage areas22, identify See above. Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Is direction applicable to this project and has it been met (Yes or No; Met or Not Met)? Where direction is applicable but has not been met, explain the reason(s). potential highway crossings. Guideline LINK G1 – Land exchanges NFS lands should be retained in public ownership. Met. Guideline LINK G2 – Livestock grazing in shrub-steppe habitats Livestock grazing in shrub-steppe habitats42 should be managed to contribute to maintaining or achieving a preponderance of mid- or late-seral stages28, similar to conditions that would have occurred under historic disturbance regimes. Not applicable–No such habitat. *(1) For those areas identified as occupied lynx habitat in the Occupied Mapped Lynx Habitat Amendment to the Canada Lynx Conservation Agreement (USDA Forest Service et al. 2006), management direction are the standards and guidelines displayed below.

In such places, compacted snow is evident most of the time, except immediately after (within 48 hours) snowfall. These can be areas or linear routes, and are generally found in near snowmobile or cross-country ski routes, in adjacent openings, parks and meadows, near ski huts or plowed roads, or in winter parking areas. Areas of consistent snow compaction will be determined based on the area or miles used in 1998 to 2000. 2 Broad scale assessment – A broad scale assessment is a synthesis of current scientific knowledge, including a description of uncertainties and assumptions, to provide an understanding of past and present conditions and future trends, and a characterization of the ecological, social and economic components of an area. (LCAS) 3 Carr – Deciduous woodland or shrub land occurring on permanently wet, organic soil. (LCAS) 4 Course woody debris – Any piece(s) of dead woody material, e.g., dead boles, limbs, and large root masses on the ground or in streams. (LCAS) 5 Daylight thinning – Daylight thinning is a form of precommercial thinning that removes the trees and brush inside a given radius around a tree. 6 Denning habitat (lynx) – Denning habitat is the environment lynx use when giving birth and rearing kittens until they are mobile. The most common component is large amounts of coarse woody debris to provide escape and thermal cover for kittens. Denning habitat must be within daily travel distance of winter snowshoe hare habitat – the typical maximum daily distance for females is about three to six miles. Denning habitat includes mature and old growth24 forests with plenty of coarse woody debris. It can also include young regenerating forests with piles of coarse woody debris, or areas where down trees are jack-strawed. 7 Designated over-the-snow routes – Designated over-the-snow routes are routes managed under permit or agreement or by the agency, where use is encouraged, either by on-the-ground marking or by publication in brochures, recreation opportunity guides or maps (other than travel maps) or in electronic media produced or approved by the agency. The routes identified in outfitter and guide permits are designated by definition; groomed routes also are designated by definition. The determination of baseline snow compaction will be based on the miles of designated over-the-snow routes authorized, promoted or encouraged in 1998 to 2000. 8 Designated route – A designated route is a road or trail that has been identified as open for specified travel use. 9 Developed recreation – Developed recreation requires facilities that result in concentrated use. For example, skiing requires lifts, parking lots, buildings and roads; campgrounds require roads, picnic tables and toilet facilities. 10 Security habitat (lynx) – Security habitat amounts to places in lynx habitat that provide secure winter bedding sites for lynx in highly disturbed landscapes like ski areas. Security habitat gives lynx the ability to retreat from human disturbance. Forest structures that make human access difficult generally discourage human activity in security habitats. Security habitats are most effective if big enough to provide visual and acoustic insulation and to let lynx easily move away from any intrusion. They must be close to winter snowshoe hare habitat. (LCAS) 11 Fire use – Fire use is the combination of wildland fire use and using prescribed fire to meet resource objectives. (NIFC) Wildland fire use is the management of naturally ignited wildland fires to accomplish resource management objectives in areas that have a fire management plan. The use of the term wildland fire use replaces the term prescribed natural fire. (Wildland and Prescribed Fire Management Policy, August 1998) 12 Forest highway – A forest highway is a forest road under the jurisdiction of, and maintained by, a public authority and open to public travel (USC: Title 23, Section 101(a)), designated by an agreement with the FS, state transportation agency and Federal Highway Administration. 13 Fuel treatment – A fuel treatment is a management action that reduces the threat of ignition and fire intensity or rate of spread, or is used to restore fire-adapted ecosystems. 14 Goal – A goal is a broad description of what an agency is trying to achieve, found in a land management plan. (LCAS) 15 Guideline – A guideline is a particular management action that should be used to meet an objective found in a land management plan. The rationale for deviations may be documented, but amending the plan is not required. (LCAS modified) 16 Habitat connectivity (lynx) – Habitat connectivity consists of an adequate amount of vegetation cover arranged in a way that allows lynx to move around. Narrow forested mountain ridges or shrub-steppe plateaus may serve as a link between more extensive areas of lynx habitat; wooded riparian areas may provide travel cover across open valley floors. (LCAS) 17 HFRA (Healthy Forests Restoration Act) - Public Law 108-148, passed in December 2003. The HFRA provides statutory processes for hazardous fuel reduction projects on certain types of at-risk National Forest System and Bureau of Land Management lands. It also provides other authorities and direction to help reduce hazardous fuel and restore healthy forest and rangeland conditions on lands of all ownerships. (Modified from Forest Service HFRA web site.) 18 Highway – The word highway includes all roads that are part of the National Highway System. (23 CFR 470.107(b)) 19 Horizontal cover – Horizontal cover is the visual obscurity or cover provided by habitat structures that extend to the ground or snow surface primarily provided by tree stems and tree boughs, but also includes herbaceous vegetation, snow, and landscape topography. Horizontal cover was measured by John Squires et al. (pers. com.) in Northwestern Montana according to the following methodology: “A canvas cover-board (2 m x 0.5 m) was erected 10 m from plot center in 4 directions (forward track, back track, and at 2, 90° angles) was read to directly measure horizontal cover. The cover board was divided into 4, 0.5 meter blocks and each block was further dividend into quarters. At each reading, technicians estimated horizontal cover by 10% class at each of the 4 heights; these 4 estimates were then averaged for an overall estimate of that reading.” (According to Squires via pers. com., cover measured during the summer period averaged approximately 65% while at den sites it was measured at roughly 85%. During the winter period cover was measured at 45% while at winter kill sites it was slightly greater than 50%.) 20 Isolated mountain range – Isolated mountain ranges are small mountains cut off from other mountains and surrounded by flatlands. On the east side of the Rockies, they are used for analysis instead of sub-basins. Examples are the Little Belts in Montana and the Bighorns in Wyoming. 21 LAU (Lynx Analysis Unit) – An LAU is an area of at least the size used by an individual lynx, from about 25 to 50 square miles (LCAS). An LAU is a unit for which the effects of a project would be analyzed; its boundaries should remain constant. 22 Linkage area – A linkage area provides connectivity between blocks of lynx habitat. Linkage areas occur both within and between geographic areas, where basins, valleys or agricultural lands separate blocks of lynx habitat, or where lynx habitat naturally narrows between blocks. (LCAS updated definition approved by the Steering Committee 10/23/01) 23 Lynx habitat – Lynx habitat occurs in mesic coniferous forest that experience cold, snowy winters and provide a prey base of snowshoe hare. In the northern Rockies, lynx habitat is generally occurs between 3,500 and 8,000 feet of elevation, and primarily consists of lodgepole pine, subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. It may consist of cedar-hemlock in extreme northern Idaho, northeastern Washington and northwestern Montana, or of Douglas fir on moist sites at higher elevations in central Idaho. It may also consist of cool, moist Douglas fir, grand fir, western larch and aspen when interspersed in subalpine forests. Dry forests do not provide lynx habitat. (LCAS) 24 Lynx habitat in an unsuitable condition –Lynx habitat in an unsuitable condition consists of lynx habitat in the stand initiation structural stage where the trees are generally less than ten to 30 years old and have not grown tall enough to protrude above the snow during winter. Stand replacing fire or certain vegetation management projects can create unsuitable conditions. Vegetation management projects that can result in unsuitable habitat include clearcuts and seed tree harvest, and sometimes shelterwood cuts and commercial thinning depending on the resulting stand composition and structure. (LCAS) 25 Low-speed, low-traffic-volume road – Low speed is less than 20 miles per hour; low volume is a seasonal average daily traffic load of less than 100 vehicles per day. 26 Maintain – In the context of this amendment, maintain means to provide enough lynx habitat to conserve lynx. It does not mean to keep the status quo. 27 Maintenance level – Maintenance levels define the level of service provided by and maintenance required for a road. (FSH 7709.58, Sec 12.3) Maintenance level 4 is assigned to roads that provide a moderate degree of user comfort and convenience at moderate travel speeds. Most level 4 roads have double lanes and aggregate surfaced. Some may be single lane; some may be paved or have dust abated. Maintenance level 5 is assigned to roads that provide a high degree of user comfort and convenience. Normally, roads are double-lane and paved, but some may be aggregate surfaced with the dust abated. 28 Mid-seral or later – Mid-seral is the successional stage in a plant community that’s the midpoint as it moves from bare ground to climax. For riparian areas, it means willows or other shrubs have become established. For shrub-steppe areas, it means shrubs associated with climax are present and increasing in density. 29 Multi-story mature or late successional forest – This stage is similar to the old multistory structural stage (see below). However, trees are generally not as old and decaying trees may be somewhat less abundant. 30 Objective – An objective is a statement in a land management plan describing desired resource conditions and intended to promote achieving programmatic goals. (LCAS) 31 Old multistory structural stage – Many age classes and vegetation layers mark the old forest, multistoried stage. It usually contains large old trees. Decaying fallen trees may be present that leave a discontinuous overstory canopy. On cold or moist sites without frequent fires or other disturbance, multi-layer stands with large trees in the uppermost layer develop. (Oliver and Larson, 1996) 32 Old growth – Old growth forests generally contain trees that are large for their species and site, and are sometimes decadent with broken tops. Old growth often contains a variety of tree sizes, large snags and logs, and a developed and often patchy understory. 33 Permanent development – A permanent development is any development that results in a loss of lynx habitat for at least 15 years. Ski trails, parking lots, new permanent roads, structures, campgrounds and many special use developments would be considered permanent developments. 34 Prescribed fire – A prescribed fire is any fire ignited as a management action to meet specific objectives. A written, approved prescribed fire plan must exist, and NEPA requirements met, before ignition. The term replaces management ignited prescribed fire. (NWCG) 35 Precommercial thinning – Precommercial thinning is mechanically removing trees to reduce stocking and concentrate growth on the remaining trees, and not resulting in immediate financial return. (Dictionary of Forestry) 36 Red squirrel habitat – Red squirrel habitat consists of coniferous forests of seed and cone-producing age that usually contain snags and downed woody debris, generally associated with mature or older forests. 37Regeneration harvest – The cutting of trees and creating an entire new age class; an even-age harvest. The major methods are clearcutting, seed tree, shelterwood, and group selective cuts (Helms 1998). 38 Research – Research consists of studies conducted to increase scientific knowledge or technology. For the purposes of Standards VEG S5 and VEG S6, research applies to studies financed from the forest research budget (FSM 4040) and administrative studies financed from the NF budget. 39 Restore, restoration – To restore is to return or re-establish ecosystems or habitats to their original structure and species composition. (Dictionary of Forestry) 40 Riparian area – An area with distinctive soil and vegetation between a stream or other body of water and the adjacent upland; includes wetlands and those portions of floodplains and valley bottoms that support riparian vegetation. (LCAS) 41 Salvage harvest – Salvage harvest is a commercial timber sale of dead, damaged or dying trees. It recovers economic value that would otherwise be lost. Collecting firewood for personal use is not considered salvage harvest. 42 Shrub steppe habitat – Shrub steppe habitat consists of dry sites with shrubs and grasslands intermingled. 43 Standard – A standard is a required action in a land management plan specifying how to achieve an objective or under what circumstances to refrain from taking action. A plan must be amended to deviate from a standard. 44 Stand initiation structural stage – The stand initiation stage generally develops after a stand-replacing disturbance by fire or regeneration timber harvest. A new single-story layer of shrubs, tree seedlings and saplings establish and develop, reoccupying the site. Trees that need full sun are likely to dominate these even-aged stands. (Oliver and Larson, 1996) 45 Stem exclusion structural stage – In the stem exclusion stage, trees initially grow fast and quickly occupy all of the growing space, creating a closed canopy. Because the trees are tall, little light reaches the forest floor so understory plants (including smaller trees) are shaded and grow more slowly. Species that need full sunlight usually die; shrubs and herbs may become dormant. New trees are precluded by a lack of sunlight or moisture. (Oliver and Larson, 1996) 46 Timber management – Timber management consists of growing, tending, commercially harvesting and regenerating crops of trees. 47 Understory re-initiation structural stage – In the understory re-initiation stage, a new age class of trees gets established after overstory trees begin to die, are removed or no longer fully occupy their growing space after tall trees abrade each other in the wind. Understory seedlings then re-grow and the trees begin to stratify into vertical layers. A low to moderately dense uneven-aged overstory develops, with some small shade-tolerant trees in the understory. (Oliver and Larson, 1996) 48 Vegetation management projects – Vegetation management projects change the composition and structure of vegetation to meet specific objectives, using such means as prescribed fire and timber harvest. For the purposes of this amendment, the term does not include removing vegetation for permanent developments like mineral operations, ski runs, roads and the like, and does not apply to fire suppression or to wildland fire use. 49 Wildland urban interface (WUI) - The area adjacent to an at-risk community that is identified in the community wildfire protection plan. If there is no community wildfire protection plan in place, the WUI is the area 0.5 mile from the boundary of an at-risk community or within 1.5 miles of the boundary of an at-risk community. The WUI could also include areas if the terrain is steep, or there is a nearby road or ridge top that could be incorporated into a fuel break, or the land is in condition class 3, or the area contains an emergency exit route needed for safe evacuations. (Condensed from HFRA. For full text see HFRA § 101.)  50 Winter snowshoe hare habitat – Winter snowshoe hare habitat consists of places where young trees or shrubs grow dense – thousands of woody stems per acre – and tall enough to protrude above the snow during winter, so hares can browse on the bark and small twigs (Ruediger et al. 2000). Winter snowshoe hare habitat develops primarily in the stand initiation, understory reinitiation and old forest multistoried structural stage.   Appendix G Target Stands For Multiple Objectives       C:\Documents and Settings\amilburn\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\WDBRBPWJ\MC900001826[1].wmfContributors Carol Hennessey Matt Bienkowski Michelle Roberts Amanda Milburn Gene Delimata Marcus Chin Cara Farr Tim Theisen Joanne Bonn                 Appendix G—Target Stands For Multiple Objectives      Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests  Target Stands for Multiple Objectives By Habitat Type Groups  Compiled January 2013 Version 1.0 O:\NFS\NezPerceClearwater\Program\2400TimberMgmt\2470SilvPractices\target_stands   Target Stands for Multiple Objectives --Table of Contents  I.

Site-specific target stands are designed to articulate the desired vegetative condition at the fine scale to meet multiple objectives for a stand. Target stands are inherently based upon interdisciplinary objectives and desired conditions across multiple scales. There is a need for the silviculturist, interdisciplinary team, and line officer to have focused discussions to gain a common understanding of what the target condition is at multiple scales. Only then can the existing condition be compared to the desired condition, allowing the team to develop ecologically sound management alternatives. This work ultimately provides the information to build a site-specific silvicultural prescription. Forest-wide Integrated Target Stands are needed to provide a consistent basis for the development of project-specific target stands. These target stands are organized by logical habitat type groupings and incorporate appropriate ranges of values to capture potential variability. Investing the time to develop a target stands package that integrates multiple resources provides valuable information and a common starting vision for silviculturists and interdisciplinary team members alike. At the watershed assessment or project analysis scale, the Forest-wide target stands provide the basis for development of desired conditions and project-specific target stands. However, this process first requires a description of the desired vegetative condition at the mid to broad scale, or defining the Target Landscape. Once the landscape level desired condition has been defined, the spatial placement and desired condition of treatment areas follows by starting with Forest-wide integrated target stands. The team must determine whether refinement or variations are needed to address project-specific desired conditions. This process as documented in the NEPA analysis and decision provides the basis for the silviculturist to develop site-specific detailed silvicultural prescriptions for project implementation. The Forest strategy for completion of a Forest-wide target stand package is to utilize existing interdisciplinary teams and existing project analysis data over time. As a habitat type group becomes emphasized in a project, that team will address the target stand for that group. Thus far, several interdisciplinary teams have developed Forest-wide integrated target stands for the most common habitat type groups. Several target stands still need to be developed. This document provides a summary of the considerations for development of target landscapes along with the methodology and results for the interdisciplinary target stands developed thus far. This information should be utilized when developing landscape assessments, NEPA proposals, and as a starting point for both project-specific desired condition discussions and site-specific prescriptions. Future versions of this document will incorporate additional target stands and variations as they are developed. Target Landscape Considerations A Target Landscape is determined by the quantity and distribution (range) of habitat conditions as comprised of age, size, species and historic range of variability. In other words, the Target Landscape is the desired mosaic of vegetation conditions where natural disturbance regimes help to define habitats (1930 Lewinski). Classification systems are necessary to group sites and/or vegetation together based on key factors such as site capability, existing vegetation, physical site qualities, etc. The Clearwater Forest has typically used Landtype Associations (LTA) to classify areas. Clearwater LTA’s base the distribution targets primarily on soil and water attributes. The Nez Perce primarily uses Vegetation Response Units (VRU’s) which classify areas based on vegetative components, fire, vegetation and wildlife attributes. Based on these groupings, both sides of the Forest describe desired species, size, and age class (as determined by relative size and past disturbance regimes and patterns such as fire, insects/disease, and management) to define target landscapes. Target landscape definitions avoid defining stand specific attributes such as trees per acre and snags per acre. In projects across both Forests, it is possible to also use habitat type groupings to further describe target landscapes.  Table G-1: LTA and VRU Comparison Ecosection Setting LTA (Clearwater) VRU (Nez Perce Bitterroot Breaklands Groups 1,2 & 3  Bitterroot Uplands Groups 4 & 5  Bitterroot Subalpine Groups 6, 7 & 8 north of Lochsa River  Idaho Batholith Breaklands  3, 8, 12 & 16 Idaho Batholith Uplands  4, 6, 7 , 10 & 17 Idaho Batholith Subalpine Groups 6, 7 & 8 south of Lochsa River 1, 2, 5 & 9  In defining target landscapes, consider starting with the Forest Plan Revision basis (3 very large landscapes) which define distribution of only species and size; use these to identify target landscapes for the analysis area. Consider then using the appropriate LTA’s/VRU’s and/or habitat type groups to tier down target landscapes for the analysis area. Integrated Target Stands Target stands are used to achieve the landscape level Desired Future Condition (DFC). Target stands are management units used to describe stand development through time. The target stand does not prescribe treatments, but simply represents the desired condition at various phases of stand development. For Forest-wide target stands, this desired condition was built by framing objectives for each resource relative to site capability and natural disturbance regimes. The need to treat a given stand at any stage of development would be determined at the project scale by comparing the existing to desired condition. This target stand package does not include consideration of specific Forest Plan Management Area guidance, or other location factors that would inform desired conditions such as wildland urban interface (WUI) or roadless areas; specific area emphases and regulatory guidance would be applied at the project level. The Forest-wide target stands were built to include a range of values that would encompass the spectrum of possible management emphases. If interdisciplinary teams encounter situations that are outside the range of variability represented in existing Forest-wide target stands, new project-specific or Forest-wide variations may be developed as appropriate. The elements used in target stand tables are those of importance to multiple resources. For example, vegetation management relies heavily on species composition and structure. Wildlife management relies heavily on tree composition and structure, snags, snag recruitment and large woody debris. Soil and water management rely on large woody debris and debris recruitment. Fire and fuel management rely on elements such as canopy base height, ladder fuels, and crown bulk density. All resources have some need to provide for forest restoration and resiliency through time. Some elements of the target stands, wildlife and fuels in particular, are shown with qualitative values. The narrative descriptions with each stand define what those qualitative elements represent. Integrating target stand components based on habitat characteristics will take care of most wildlife species. Some species that are emphasized for each target stand when they are of particular importance. Generally, tree retention elements are assumed to be met across the whole stand, including the retention provided in untreated portions of the stand such as riparian areas. The distribution of individual trees and clumps is described generically for each target stand. If more specific distribution patterns or evenness are required, it should be described as such or refined clearly in the NEPA and site specific prescriptions. Vegetation management should be done at the landscape scale, with individual stands contributing to a desired mosaic of conditions. In some cases it may be appropriate to describe variable tree retention across larger scales than the individual stand. Some considerations for this are included in the narratives for each target stand, but should also be discussed in detail at the project scale. The following steps represent the process for using target stands in a NEPA project: 1. Define Target Landscapes: IDT members to discuss, understand and accept these as delineated 2. Determine Existing Condition (EC) of each Target Landscape 3. Determine Departure of the existing condition from the target landscape; where these is significant departure there is opportunity for treatment. 4. Define Areas of Concern: Understand/Apply screens (i.e. Old Growth, Riparian Areas, Sensitive Soils) a. Visuals and Fire could be considered but are more adaptive; these components may trigger additional analysis and/or process but do not define separate target landscapes or target stands; use these to aid in further refinement of areas of opportunity 5. Assign generalized Target Stands to areas of opportunity 6. Develop integrated, detailed, stand specific prescriptions for treatment areas; the objective of these is to move the areas needing treatment closer to the target stand objectives Forest-Wide Objectives The Nez Perce Clearwater Forest Plan Revision, Planning Set of Documents (2010) and the Analysis of the Management Situation (2003) summarize the following needs to maintain terrestrial sustainability and desired conditions. These needs provide the framework for target stand objectives. An important next step for subsequent versions of this target stand document are to further integrate with Forest Plan revision efforts to ensure target stands are consistent with the desired conditions specified in the final documentation. • Increase the amount of forests dominated by shade-intolerant, fire-adapted, relatively drought-tolerant, potentially long-lived tree species (western white pine, ponderosa pine, western larch, whitebark pine); • Decrease the amount of forests dominated by shade-tolerant, fire-intolerant, and drought-intolerant tree species (grand fir, western hemlock, western red cedar); and also decrease the amount of forests dominated by shorter-lived shade intolerant tree species (primarily Douglas-fir); • Increase the amount of forests within the seedling/sapling, large size class, and also old growth forests ; • Decrease the amount of forests within the small and medium size classes; • Increase patch size in the large size class and also old growth, decreasing fragmentation of these forests; • Increase patch size in the seedling/sapling size class, except where recent wildfires created large patches; • Wildland fire is used to manage vegetation, where appropriate. Social concerns limit the scale of managed fire short of historic levels; • Reduce Hazardous fuels. National Forest System lands within the wildland urban interface (WUI) are the highest priority for fuel treatment activities to reduce the threat of extreme fire behavior and to provide fuel conditions that allow for safe and effective initial attach, especially within the community protection zone as defined and characterized in county community wildfire protection plans. • For wildlife habitat, a variety of seral stages distributed across the landscape are desired to provide interior habitat, patch connectivity, and resiliency in the long-term. Habitats are well distributed both spatially and over time in patch sizes similar to those that occurred historically as a result of natural disturbance regimes such as fires, insects, and diseases. Large, contiguous habitat blocks provide for decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity, especially those with interior habitat conditions. • The shrub/seedling/sapling stages are maintained within the desired vegetation condition, providing habitat for species such as large ungulates and a variety of bird species. Dense and immature stands susceptible to drought and damage or destruction from insects, pathogens, and wildfire are reduced while providing habitat for a wide range of wildlife species. Late seral/old forest structures are increased, including large residual trees throughout all biophysical settings providing wildlife habitat for species such as fisher, pygmy nuthatch, pileated woodpecker, and boreal owl. Methodology For each of the Forest-wide integrated target stands, and interdisciplinary approach was used. The team included a silviculturist, line officer, wildlife biologist, soils scientist, and fuels specialist. The team was assigned based on existing projects that included habitat type groups of interest. Habitat type groups were discussed, and example stand data selected to represent the group. Over the course of several meetings, the applicable ecological objectives for each stand and each phase of development for the stand was discussed and FVS runs conducted to show expected succession or results of treatments over time. Team members also reviewed literature relative to their resource to inform proposed values for target stand elements. Team members also reviewed conditions in the field and examples of treatments to gain a common understanding of the metrics used to describe target stands. Habitat Type Groups The Nez Perce and Clearwater Forest use a Forest habitat type grouping developed in 1997 (revised 2005). These groups are based upon species composition, site potential, and natural fire regime. The groups are meaningful for a wide range of analysis and provide the basis for target stands. However for several groups, subgroups are recognized for variations. This split does not discount the validity of the use of the broader groups for resource analyses, but is important to reflect accurate species compositions in the target stand. Another common habitat type grouping used in Region 1 is presented in Green et al (1992). These groupings are used for old growth analysis, and also provide meaningful groupings of habitat types. These groups were compared with the Nez/CLW groupings for consistency. In most cases the groupings are fairly similar. The goal of the Forest-wide target stands package is a target stand for 5 coarse groupings of the 11 Nez/CLW habitat type groups, with additional variations for climax types and species of interest (notably lynx). To date, several of the groups of highest interest to ongoing projects have been developed. The Cool and Wet/Moist Subalpine Fir Group had two variations developed, including a lynx habitat emphasis stand. The Mixed Conifer Moist Group was also developed which represents some of the most productive forests and where white pine restoration is often emphasized. Most recently, the Moderate Warm/Dry group was developed which is common on the Nez Perce forests and represents mixed conifer areas where seral species such as ponderosa pine and western larch are of particular importance. Variations were developed for this group to split apart drier, Douglas-fir climax sites from more moist, grand-fir climax sites. There are several homework items pending for all developed target stands before they are considered final, as described in the narrative for each. As of Version 1.0 of this document, the Warm/Dry and Cool/Cold Dry Upper Subalpine groups have not yet been addressed. These are both high priority to complete. The Warm/Dry group represents unique dry ponderosa pine breakland areas that are often an emphasis for fuel management and pine restoration. The Cool/Cold Dry Upper Subalpine Group contains whitebark pine restoration opportunities, which are of particular interest due to its listing as a sensitive species. Table G-2: Habitat Type Grouping for Forest-wide Integrated Target Stands Nez/CLW (1997) Habitat Type Groups and Descriptions Habitat Types Green 1992 Habitat Type Group Nez/CLW Target Stands 1 – Warm & Dry Dry & open PP/DF w/ bunchgrass.

Currently no stand exam data is available for habitat types in this group. These sites are characterized by very dry ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir climax forests with bunchgrass understories and a high frequency, low severity fire regime. These areas often lie at low elevations, at the transition from forested to open savannah or grassland communities. These sites are more often targeted for fuels or ecosystem prescribed fire treatments rather than commercial timber projects. Objectives Applicable objectives for this group are likely to include ponderosa pine restoration, grass forage production, and open forest conditions consistent with the frequent historic fire regime. These types may be particularly sensitive to changing climate conditions in terms of potential timber suitability. Table G-3 (Not Yet Developed): Warm Dry Target Stand – Vegetation Table G-4 (Not Yet Developed): Warm Dry Target Stand – Wildlife Integration Table G-5 (Not Yet Developed): Warm Dry Target Stand – Soils, Fire, and Natural Disturbance Integration Moderately Warm/Dry Habitat Type Groups 2 and 3 Description These habitat type groups cover the transition from dry to moist, including ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir climax habitat types and more moist grand fir climax types with grass or shrub understories. A wide diversity of species composition is possible, including ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir on the drier sites and western larch, grand fir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine on the moistest sites. Fire intervals are generally from 5 to 50 years from low to moderate severity. Objectives & Discussion • Variations should be built to split the dry sites (DF habitat type) from the moist sites (GF habitat types). • Both variations should include an appropriate mix of seral species and generally a 2-storied condition. An emphasis on promoting ponderosa pine and western larch is assumed, although the precise proportion achievable would vary by site. On the grand fir sites in particular, there will be components of lodgepole pine, subalpine fir, grand fire, and/or Engelmann spruce to some extent. • To promote resiliency, it is desirable to limit the susceptibility to bark beetles and root. • The moister end of the group would provide habitat for pileated, fisher, goshawk, 3-toeds, black-backed, and elk hiding cover. The dry end would emphasize flammulated owl habitat. Elk winter range is provided at the seedling stages for both groups. • 50-75 year natural fire return intervals, so our example stand data has missed 1 or 2 fires – this is the most common reason why stands we encounter in this type are in an undesirable condition relative to forest structure, insects/disease, and seral species composition. • For tree retention, clumpy is desirable and clumps should be a minimum of 2-4 trees. • The tree size for overstory retention values are the desired condition – if there are not that many large trees available, the biggest available would be the priority to leave. • We used a “natural” FVS run with no disturbance to get an idea of potential old growth conditions. • A typical regeneration event in these types would be a natural moderate severity fire, or a shelterwood (DF-dominated) or group selection (PP-dominated) for a 2 aged stand. • We used Bollenbacher et al 2009 for snag sizes; and considered Green et al 1992 concerning old forest. • Reference Reynolds (1992) for goshawk habitat at a large scales; target stand conditions fit within them. • Due to root disease, we assume that no more than 30% Douglas-fir composition is achievable in the moist grand-fir group. • Pending Validation: • A narrative will be developed to further explain the qualitative fire/fuels elements • The team will review more stands in the field to verify metrics; in particular the number of overstory retention trees is of interest to review. • Additional FVS gaming should be done to incorporate more accurate root disease results. • The soils scientist and timber specialist need to review the tables. Variation 1: Douglas-fir Climax (Habitat Type Groups 2a, 3a) Table G-6: Mod Warm/Dry Douglas-fir Climax Target Stand – Vegetation Moderately Warm/Dry Habitat Type groups 2a, 3a: Douglas-fir climax types. 1-2 storied Stage Vegetation Structure Downed Wood Snags/Acre 20’+ Developmental Structural Age  Trees per Acre & Composition BA/ac Average dbh Height Canopy Closure Lg. wood 20”+/ac Tons/ac CWD 20”+ 15-19.9” Stand Initiation Seedling 1-10 150-1200, ≥ 70% PP N/A 1-2” 1-10’ N/A 2+ 5-10 2+ 3+ Overstory 100+ 10 >21” & 10>14-20” dbh 30+ 21” / 14” 60-175’ <25% Stand Initiation Sapling 10-20 150-800, ≥ 60% PP 20-50 2-5” 10-20’ 25-30% 2+ 5-10 2+ 3+ Moderately Warm/Dry Habitat Type groups 2a, 3a: Douglas-fir climax types. 1-2 storied Stage Vegetation Structure Downed Wood Snags/Acre 20’+ Developmental Structural Age  Trees per Acre & Composition BA/ac Average dbh Height Canopy Closure Lg. wood 20”+/ac Tons/ac CWD 20”+ 15-19.9” Overstory 110+ 10-20+ 30+ 21” / 14” 60-175’ <25% Stem Exclusion Pole 20-40 150-450, ≥ 60% PP 30-80 3-6” 20-50’ 30-50%  3+ 5-15 2+ 3+ Overstory 120+ 7-15+ 20+ 20”+ 60-175’ Stem Exclusion Immature saw 40-100 100-350, ≥ 60% PP 60-120 6-14” 40-120’ 40-60% 3+ 10-15 2+ 4+ Overstory 150+ 5-10+ N/A 22”+ 60-175’ Understory Reinitiation Mature sawtimber 100-150 >6” dbh 50-200, total 100-500, ≥50% PP 80-240 15+ 80-160’ 50-70% 4+ 10-20 2+ 4+ Old Forest Old/mature sawtimber 150+ >6” dbh 30-120, total 75-350, ≥ 40% PP 80-260 Overstory 21”+ 120-175’ 40%+ 4+ 10-25 3+ 5+  Table G-7: Mod Warm/Dry Douglas-fir Climax Target Stand – Wildlife Integration Moderately Warm/Dry Habitat Type groups 2a, 3a: Douglas-fir climax types (1-2 storied) Wildlife Elements Developmental Stage Structural Stage Elk Browse Flam.

Grand fir/Clintonia is the habitat type most frequently found. These habitat types are common at mid elevations on north slopes and lower slopes in slope positions or geographic areas too dry for western red cedar. The habitat types in Group 5 (moderately cool and moist western red cedar) are characterized by mixed species stands of western red cedar, grand fir, and Douglas fir, with diverse shrub and forb understories. Western white pine, larch, and ponderosa pine are less frequent components. Cedar/Clintonia is the habitat type in this group most frequently found. These habitat types are common in the western portion of the subbasin on lower slopes and northerly aspects, but become increasingly rare toward the headwaters. The habitat types in Group 6 (moderately cool and wet western red cedar) are characterized by stands of grand fir and western red cedar. Douglas-fir and western white pine are less common. They often have fern and herb understories. Cedar/lady fern is the habitat type most frequently found. These habitat types are generally limited to riparian areas along streams and moist lower slopes in the western part of the subbasin. Objectives & Discussion • Applicable wildlife habitats for this type include moose and fisher. • Restoration of seral species such as white pine, western larch, and ponderosa pine is a key objective. • Utilize variable density retention techniques. 2 acres is the maximum opening size with no dead or green trees. Retain both individual and clumps of leave trees. • Tree clumps are 7-10 green trees/acre. Leave Douglas-fir and grand fir only if no seral species are available. Use retention clumps around legacy trees or standing dead to improve chances of retention. • Retain dead and green trees across all cover types. Retention of green trees will be more evenly distributed for fire tolerant species. Fire intolerant species retention of green trees will have fewer scattered trees and more clumps. • Retain legacy trees where feasible. • Estimates of site prep loss: o Tractor Ground: Jackpot burning improves overstory retention; assume 0-10% loss of green trees due to burning. o Line Ground: Site prep burning may eliminate most standing green overstory; assume 50-60% loss of retained green trees. • Pending Validation Items: o Narratives need to be developed to explain the wildlife and fire/fuels elements.  Table G-12: Moist Mixed Conifer Target Stand – Vegetation Moist Mixed Conifer Habitat Type groups 4-6 2-storied Structural Stage Developmental Stage Age in Years Trees per Acre BA Average dbh Height Canopy Closure Stand Initiation Seedling 1-10 300-2000 of which >300 WP/WL/PP.

Western larch, whitebark pine, and Douglas-fir are less common components. Subalpine fir/menziesia is the habitat type in this group most frequently found in the subbasin. These habitat types are common and occur at upper elevations on north aspects and moist lower slopes (Green et al, 1992). These types area characterized by cool and moist site conditions. Species diversity can be high with larix occidentalis, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus monticola, Picea Engelmannii, Pinus contorta, Abies lasiocarpa and Abiesgrandis. Other sites are dominated by Pinus contorta after stand replacement burns. These sites are probably too cool for Tsuga heterophylla and Thuja plicata to play a dominant role. On the other hand, these sites are not cold enough that Pinus albicaulis is competitive and it usually does not play a major successional role (although it may sometimes be present in minor amounts). Fire history information is scarce. Fire intervals are estimated at greater than 120 years for most sites (Fischer, 1987) (Report 09-08 v1.0). Habitat type group 8 (Cool and Wet subalpine fir) is characterized by stands of subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine, with shrub, forb or graminoid understories. Subalpine fir/bluejoint reedgrass is the habitat type in this group most frequently found in the subbasin. These habitat types are uncommon and occur at upper elevations in riparian areas (Green et al, 1992). These are very wet sites. They are forested riparian areas along streams and associated with wetlands. Due to this very wet condition the fire free interval can be very long. Intervals between severe, stand replacement fires are probably much longer than the majority of fire group nine, 90-130 years and are probably in excess of 150 years. (Report 09-08 v1.0). Objectives & Discussion • Utilize variable density retention techniques. 2 acres is maximum opening size with no dead or green trees. Retain both individual and clumps of leave trees. Tree clumps are 7-10 green TPA. Retention of green will be more evenly distributed in LP and more clumpy in SAF. • Opportunistic management of tall shrubs using OSR; favor retention/regeneration of huckleberry and willow where possible. • Managing stand dead: Retain all legacy trees 17”_ dbh. Trees will primarily spruce and lodgepole, approximately 4/acre. Retain legacy trees in clumps to improve retention success. Standing legacy trees will influence where clumps are retained. • Managing down woody debris: 7-18 tons/acre. Stands will also be gaining nutrients from suppressed/intermediate tree input. • Managing Stand Green; Estimate of site prep loss 10% lodgepole pine; 25% loss subalpine fir o Site prep loss on Tractor Ground: Jackpot burning improves overstory retention, specifically mature SAF. Assume 0-10% loss of green trees due to burning. o Site prep loss on Line Ground: Burning may eliminate most green overstory; assume 50-60% loss of retained green trees. • Pending Validation: o The team needs to fill in the wildlife, soils and fire/fuels tables, and explain in narrative.  Variation 1: Lynx Habitat Emphasis Table G-15: Subalpine Fir Lynx Habitat Target Stand - Vegetation Stage Multi-Storied.

the aquatic and watershed assessments. Nez Perce Forest Plan Appendix A addresses trends in below objective watersheds with upward trend direction. Upward trend means that stream conditions determined through analysis to be below the Forest Plan objective will move toward the objective over time. The Forest Plan did not specifically intend that the improving trend be in place prior to initiation of new activities (Conroy and Thompson 2011). Only streams that do not meet Forest Plan objectives require an upward trend analysis. The following evaluation includes upward trend assessments for Pine Knob Creek, Middle Fork Clear Creek, and Clear Creek prescription watersheds. A relative cumulative upward trend analysis, although not required by the Forest Plan, was also completed for all Forest managed lands in the Clear Creek watershed for the purpose of consultation. Additional information regarding restoration projects in the remaining prescription watersheds that do meet their water quality objectives is also included. Upward trend guidance is outlined in the “Implementation Guide to Appendix A of the Nez Perce Forest Plan” (Conroy and Thompson 2011). To assess the expected trend in aquatic conditions a variety of information and tools are used to arrive at a professional conclusion. These tools include the NEZSED and FISHSED, and ECA models that focus on sediment and water yields. Information used includes the landscape setting and channel characteristics, project proposals, existing pre-project trends, other activities within the watershed, and qualitative assessment of the effect pathways between management activities and resulting aquatic conditions. Effects analyses for all proposed actions associated with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project can be found in the Aquatics and Watershed sections of the FEIS. The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project proposes a variety of watershed improvement projects to improve watershed health and function and help to achieve upward trend. The project includes: decommissioning of 13.2 miles of system road, including the removal of 8 stream crossings and approximately 3 miles of non-system road (estimated amount that would be ancillary of system roads and would be identified during system road decommissioning surveys); road reconditioning along portions of 49 miles of system road; and road reconstruction along segments of 120 miles of system road, including replacement of 69 culverts on live streams with culverts sized for a 100 year flow event. Watershed improvement needs were identified during the pre-NEPA stage of this EIS. Some of the concerns were addressed through projects that were completed under separate decision documents and were incorporated into the existing condition of this EIS or the cumulative effects analyses as a future project. Although assessed during the same pre-NEPA assessment as this EIS, it was determined that implementing these projects through separate NEPA and prior to the completion of this EIS would accelerate watershed recovery. The associated projects are described below and cumulatively summarized by project type in Table 1. South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA, 2011 Decommissioning of approximately 10 miles of system road and 73 miles of non-system road, includes removal of 21 stream crossings. No fish bearing streams were involved. Clear Creek Culvert Replacements CE, 2011 Culvert removal/replacement of 11 culverts – 9 culverts on fish bearing streams were replaced with culverts that are at or wider than bankfull width to allow for stream bank development within the structure; 1 culvert on a non-fish bearing stream were replaced to accommodate a minimum 100-year stream flow event; and 1 culvert was removed. This project opened 1 mile of previously inaccessible habitat to native fish species. Browns Spring Culvert Replacements and Road Improvement Project Letter to File, 2012 Road improvement on 1.7 miles of Road 1124 and 1.3 miles of Road 1129. Replacement of two culverts on the 286 road. Road 286N Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 Reconstruction of 0.6 miles of Road 286N, including one culvert replacements. Road 650 Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 Approximately 15.5 miles of road improvement, including replacement of 35 non-water cross drain culverts. A total of 10.5 miles was conducted by the Forest Service and 5.0 miles were completed by Idaho County. Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project CE, 2015 Proposed project to decommission approximately 65 miles of non-system road, including removal of 15 stream crossings.  Table J-1. Summary Of Watershed Improvement Projects Proposed And Implemented In The Clear Creek Watershed 2011-2015 Activity Quantity Description System Road Decommissioning 23miles Road decommissioning practices vary depending on the potential of landslides and other erosion conditions associated with the road, the land type the road is on, and its proximity to fish bearing streams. While some roads can be abandoned, most roads require full decompaction and slope recontouring. Generally, abandoned roads have no stream crossings, are well vegetated, are resistant to surface erosion, and are not prone to mass failure. Non-system Road Decommissioning 141 miles Non-system roads are old skid trails, jammer roads, or temporary roads used for past harvest activities. Soil would be decompacted and roads would be fully recontoured. Road Recondition 49 miles Portions of the total length would be treated as needed. Consists of standard maintenance, such as road blading, brushing, cleaning of culverts, removal of small cutslope failures, application of rock in wet spots and removal of obstructions such as trees, rocks, etc. Road Reconstruction 124 miles Portions of the total length would be treated as needed. Includes spot aggregate placement, blading, brushing and removal of obstructions, reshaping of drainage dips and road bed, and replacement or addition of cross drain and live water culverts. Culvert Replacements 113 On fish bearing streams, pipes are replaced with larger culverts that provide for all aquatic organism passage. They are wider than bankfull width and are open bottom arches or circular pipes with substrate added for stream simulation. On non-fish bearing streams, culverts are sized to accommodate a minimum 100-Activity Quantity Description year stream flow event. Culvert Removal 45 Culverts are removed, stream banks are sloped back, and stream channels are restored.  Vegetation management activities and temporary road construction proposed in the Clear Creek Integrated Management Project with the potential to increase erosion/sediment delivery or increase water yield are displayed in the table below.  Table J-2.

There are a minimum of 250 miles of streams on Forest Service lands and 17 miles on state/private. Roughly 65 miles are considered fish bearing on Forest Service lands and 15 miles occur on state/private. Streams throughout Clear Creek are important for chinook salmon, and steelhead and westslope cutthroat trout as well as other non-game aquatic species. There are about 23 miles of suitable chinook habitat (primarily on the mainstem), 45 miles of steelhead habitat, and 80 miles usable by cutthroat trout. Stream temperatures on Forest Service lands are considered within optimal ranges for juvenile salmon and steelhead, and cutthroat trout rearing. Temperatures on the mainstem below the Forest boundary are less than suitable for salmon and trout during the months of July, August, and early September but are suitable for the remainder of the year. The probability of finding bull trout is very low (range 9-14%) due to warmer than preferred stream temperatures throughout the watershed (Isaac, 2014). There is currently no trend data available for fish species in the watershed but based on recent observations in 2010 through 2012, fish are well distributed throughout the watershed. Stream substrates throughout the drainage vary from sand in the low gradient channels to boulders, rubble and gravel in the remaining channels. Cobbles and larger substrates dominate the streams in general. Sediment levels, using cobble embeddedness as the indicator, showed the upper Clear Creek mainstem below Pine Knob Creek at 38% in 2012. Data collected in 1988 also showed 38% embeddedness however it is not clear where the embeddedness measures were taken in 1988 or whether they were averaged across the survey. The two datasets therefore cannot be directly compared. The desired level (DFC) for cobble embeddedness is 20% or less (USDA, 1992) therefore existing conditions remain above desired conditions. Sediment levels that exceed desired conditions have likely affected the quality and quantity of habitat available for native fish species. Sediment levels based on percent surface fines were measured in 2010 during PIBO monitoring efforts. This measurement is designed to rate sediment conditions in spawning areas but does not include measurements or consideration of conditions in rearing habitat. Surface fines were 9% at the Forest boundary which is considered to be in good condition by the NOAA matrix (1998). Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted as issues affecting fish production in the middle and upper reaches of Clear Creek (USFS, survey data 1988). Aquatic habitat surveys conducted in 1993 also noted the same sediment, wood, and pool limitations. Low wood levels are considered to primarily be a result of large wildlfires that occurred over 45% of the area in the early 1900s. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent throughout the drainage in 1988, 1993, 2007 and 2010 surveys due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation and large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armor the banks against the erosive power of the streams. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on approximately 22% of Forest Service managed lands since the 1930s with an associated 190 miles of road building. The current ECA associated with management activities both on federal and private/state lands is 4%, or a good condition based on the NOAA Matrix table (1998).An assessment of aerial photos shows that no-harvest buffers were retained since the 1960s on all but about 8% (700 acres) of the units. Of the remaining 92%, buffers were a minimum of 50 to 100’wide. Since PACFISH was adopted a total of 440 acres of regeneration harvest has occurred with appropriate sized buffers retained. Streamside buffers protect aquatic habitats by limiting sediment input and providing for shade and future woody material important for aquatic habitat development. A review of vegetative successional stages within PACFISH RHCAs indicates that 9% are early successional (< 40 years old), 34% are mid-seral (41-100 years), 57% older than 100 years. The majority of mid-seral forest is located in the South Fork, lower Hoodoo and lower West Fork Clear Creeks, and is a result of the 1931 wildfire. Successional stage information combined with field reviews of the streams from 2010-2012 indicates that RHCAs are well vegetated and only minimally (9%) affected by previous timber harvest activities. There are 190 miles of Forest system roads within the project area with most occurring along or near ridgetops with mostly small headwater stream crossings. There are 147 miles (77%) of graveled and 43 miles (23%) of native surfaced road. Placing gravel on roads has been shown to reduce sediment runoff from the road surface (Meehan 1991). Burroughs and King (1985) also conducted a study on the Nez Perce Forest using simulated rainfall to generate runoff and sediment yield from forest roads, ditchlines, and fill slopes. The reduction in sediment production by graveling the road was 79% with reductions lasting several years depending on the level of road use. They also found that where dense grass cover was present on the fill slopes of the road, sediment yield was reduced by 99%. The cut and fill slopes of roads within the Clear Creek project area are densely vegetated with grasses, shrubs, and trees. The majority of ditchlines also contain grasses, which can trap sediment. These conditions, along with the perpendicular stream/road crossings mentioned previously, help to minimize the risk of roads contributing large amounts of sediment to streams. The US Forest Service, BLM, USFWS, and NOAA (NOAA 1998) have determined that watershed conditions can be rated “good” when streamside road densities are <1 mile per square mile (mi/mi2), “moderate” at 1–2 mi/mi2, or “poor” at >2 mi/mi2. A total of 20 miles of NFS system roads exist within PACFISH buffers, contributing to an overall RHCA road density of 1.2 mi/mi2. RHCA roads are currently in a moderate condition. The majority of Forest roads in Clear Creek have been constructed perpendicular to streams in headwater areas where stream size is relatively small. This design limits the negative effects from roads on streams by minimizing the interaction and connectivity between the two. Some sediment contribution is occurring because roadside ditches have been constructed to drain into live streams however the amount is not known. Roughly 75% of RHCA road miles are graveled which helps to reduce the contribution of sediment to streams from roads. Roads on landslide prone landscapes have the potential to fail and contribute large quantities of sediment to streams. These roads may remain unstable over time and may contribute to chronic sediment erosion if not stabilized. Watersheds are in a high condition when landslide prone road densities are <1 mi/mi2 (NOAA, 1998). Landslide prone road densities are <1 mi/mi2 and in a high (good) condition on federal lands. Only one road-related landslide was observed during the road surveys. The majority of roads in Clear Creek occur on stable ridgetops with minimal risk of failure. The Watershed Condition Framework (USDA 2011) was used to assess watershed condition based on a variety of factors including forest health, soil, water, and roads. Watershed ratings reflect the level of watershed health or integrity. A watershed in good condition is one that is functioning in a manner similar to natural wildland conditions. The South Fork Clear Creek was rated as having high integrity or functionality. The Upper and Lower Clear Creek subwatersheds received moderate ratings and have been targeted for integrated restoration efforts through the road-related projects previously mentioned in combination with the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. The road projects focused on the most direct long term benefits to water quality and aquatic habitats while the Clear Creek IR project focuses on forest health and diversity. The road-related projects were designed to achieve a continued long term upward trend throughout the Clear Creek drainage. Evaluations conducted during the previous Forest Plan Revision efforts in 2006 showed that the South Fork, Upper and Lower Clear Creek subwatersheds were not meeting water quality or fish habitat desired conditions. The subwatersheds were rated as a High Priority for Restoration with the number of roads being the primary limiting factor to improved aquatic habitat conditions. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The trend assessment used a variety of quantitative and qualitative data sources. Project activities and their expected influence on aquatic conditions are summarized in Table 3 and narratives below. The information when considered collectively helps to assess the expected influence of the alternatives on the aquatic conditions in the Clear Creek watershed as a whole. It does not represent an assessment of cumulative effects, or expected trend within specific subwatersheds. This assessment assumes that Alternative A is the existing condition prior to implementation of the associated watershed improvement projects. It is used to demonstrate that as a whole, the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project, with associated previously NEPA cleared watershed improvement projects, are providing for improving trends in watershed condition in the long term. Various activities are considered with respect to the variety of aquatic processes that they potentially affect. The contribution to the overall aquatic condition is estimated in terms of positive influence (denoted by “+”) where the activity is expected to contribute to an improvement in condition, and a negative influence (denoted by “-“) where the activity is expected to contribute to degradation in aquatic condition. The amount of influence a specific activity is expected to have on the overall aquatic condition (either positive or negative) is represented by a ranking of high (H), moderate (M), or low (L). Activities rated “High” are those that are expected to have a significant effect at the watershed scale (considering both scope and magnitude). Those rated as “Moderate” are those activities that are expected to have a significant local effect (i.e. at the subwatershed scale), but not result in a significant effect at the watershed scale. Those activities rated “Low” are expected to have only a negligible effect both at the subwatershed and watershed scale. All of the processes potentially affected by an activity are listed in Table 3. No ranking, or areas left blank, represent no expected influence on this process or resulting aquatic conditions from this project. The expected contribution of a specific activity on aquatic condition is considered both in terms of short-term and long-term. Short-term influence is judged to be the immediate results of implementing the activity, generally expected to be around a 5-year timeframe. Long-term influence is judged to be the influence the activity will have on aquatic condition as a result of changes in processes and resource conditions that will over time result in changes in aquatic habitat condition. The timeframe for this influence is greater than 5 years. Each of the processes and indicators in the trend analysis table functions in different time frames. For example, the effectiveness of culverts replacements at improving accessibility or fish habitat is almost immediate. At the other extreme is the effectiveness of stream side road decommissioning at providing shade and bank stability, which can take decades to achieve full potential. Between these two poles are processes such as sediment yield increases or decreases, the effects of which can range from immediate to many years, depending on the specific pathway affected. Similarly, the effects to substrate sediment can be relatively fast in terms of deposition, but can range widely in subsequent entrainment and transport.  Table J-3.

This table illustrates the general relationships between project activities and expected consequences in aquatic conditions. At the watershed scale, the three action alternatives would essentially produce the same Upward Trend conclusions. The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic condition in the Clear Creek watershed is principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. The Nez Perce Forest Plan requires the use of the NEZSED model. Results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the Forest boundary to17% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 30%. Results from NEZSED are entered into the FISHSED model to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity based on modeled changes to cobble embeddedness. FISHSED predicted a 0–3% change in cobble embeddedness in both summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. FISHSED is used to assess the effects of changes in habitat quality when cobble embeddedness changes are greater than 10% (Stowell et al. 1983). FISHSED predicted changes for the proposed actions are less than 10% therefore no substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are expected based on this modeling. ECAs in Clear Creek would range from 11% to 13% depending on the alternative. All alternatives remain in the good Matrix category (<15%) therefore no stream channel alteration from increased water yield is expected from the Clear Creek project. The expected short-term positive consequences of the project on aquatic conditions in the Clear Creek watershed are associated with restoration projects where an immediate improvement in condition results from project implementation. The greatest benefit in this category is associated with the increased habitat availability that immediately results from stream crossing improvements where fish passage is improved. Road decommissioning, road improvements, and stream crossing improvements result in some minor immediate enhancements, principally related to hydrologic process and the lowered risk for large amounts of sediment introduction. The reduced risk is associated with increased flow capacity at upgraded pipes and culvert removal sites. The expected long-term consequences of the project on aquatic condition in the Clear Creek watershed are all considered positive, with the exception of some continued minor negative effects on the hydrologic process associated with vegetation openings from regeneration harvest. All of the watershed improvement projects are expected to have positive long-term consequences on the aquatic conditions in the watershed. The greatest effect from these activities is associated with the increased habitat availability from fish passage improvements, the long term reduced risk of future crossing failures associated with the crossing improvements, and the road improvement projects which reduce hydrologic connectivity between roads and streams through the addition of cross drain culverts. The conclusions regarding aquatic trend display the consequence of subtle balances between the short-term impacts and long-term improvements. A relatively modest shift in those balances could result in a different set of conclusions regarding aquatic trends. The trend conclusions must also be tempered with knowledge of the inherently variable conditions within the watershed and the unpredictability of weather and natural disturbance events. Future trend will likely be very much influenced by future management activities and natural events. Forest Plan Prescription Watershed Upward Trend Assessments The following tables display the vegetation treatment, temporary road construction, and watershed improvement activities by prescription watershed for all actions associated with and including the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project. The associated decision documents through which actions were proposed or decisions made are indicated by the numbers below and are later referred to in the summary tables for each of the prescription watersheds: 1South Fork/West Fork Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Project EA, 2011 2Clear Creek Culvert Replacements CE, 2011 3Browns Spring Culvert Replacements and Roads 1124 and 1129 Improvement Project Letter to File, 2012 4Road 286N Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 5Road 650 Road Maintenance Project Letter to File, 2013 6Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project EIS, 2015 7Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decommissioning Project CE, 2015.  An Upward Trend assessment was conducted for each of the Forest Plan Prescription watersheds. Alternative A (existing condition) was compared to Alternative C (maximum alternative) for the short term (0-5 years) and long term (>5 years). This assessment assumes that Alternative A is the existing condition prior to implementation of the associated watershed improvement projects. It is used to demonstrate that as a whole, the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project, with associated previously NEPA cleared watershed improvement projects, are providing for improving trends in watershed condition in the long term. Activities were given a rating based on the indicators shown in Table 5. Number ranges for each of the ratings were based on the relative impact at the Prescription watershed scale. The Upward Trend determination was calculated by assigning a value to the Low, Moderate, and High ranking (L=1, M=2, H=3) and then summarized.  Table J-5.

Cobble embeddedness was measured at 44% in 2012. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA 1992), the watershed currently is at 65% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend based on fishery habitat potential. There are about 3 miles of fish-bearing and 7 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Pine Knob Creek. The stream is mostly suitable for steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout. The lower 0.5 miles may be used by juvenile chinook salmon for rearing. The substrate is generally too small for chinook salmon spawning. Steelhead trout and cutthroat have been found in in the stream during 1984 and 1993 surveys. Stream temperatures were measured in Pine Knob Creek in the summer of 2011. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning and rearing (10.7°C and 13.8°C respectively). Cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.8°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.5°C). This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed a zero probability of bull trout presence based on warmer than preferred temperatures. Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted in the 1993 surveys. The low number of pools and lack of depth is directly related to low wood levels (6 pieces/100m). Wood is the primary creator of pool habitats in this stream type. Low wood levels appear to be natural as streamside buffers of 100’ to 120+’ were retained during previous timber harvest (see management actions discussion below). FEMAT (1993) showed that the probability that a falling tree will enter the stream is a function of slope distance from the channel in relation to the tree height. The analysis showed that 100% of wood delivered to streams comes from within one site potential tree height of the stream (150’ in Clear Creek). Roughly 95% of the wood subsequently comes from within 120’ therefore wood levels in Pine Knob are considered mostly natural. The low wood levels may be due to the dominance of western redcedar that dominates the riparian areas. Redcedar is a long lived species and remains standing for long periods even when dead. Water depths and pool habitat availability are considered to be trending upward trend since buffers were retained and would provide both the short and long term wood necessary to create pools as trees die and fall into the stream. Previously harvested areas that occur within current PACFISH buffers are forested. Standard PACFISH buffers are expected to be retained during the next harvest rotation which would maintain the necessary wood component over time, thus maintaining the upward trend. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in both the1988 and 1993 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations. Stream substrate composition in Pine Knob in 1988 was composed of 38% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 20% gravel and 42% large material (rubble to boulders). Surveys in 1993 showed a decrease in fine material to 27%, an increase in gravel to 30%, and the same amount of large substrate at 43%. This would indicate an improving trend in larger substrate size and decrease in fine substrate. Although there was a decrease in fine material, cobble embeddedness was measured at 44% in 2012. Embeddedness measured in the same stream reach during 1993 also showed levels of 44%. There was one road related failure that was deposited in Pine Knob Creek; however it occurred prior to the 1993 survey. No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews nor were any other potential management-related sources. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within the drainage so determining a trend for embeddedness based on two surveys may not be appropriate. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 36% of the watershed between the 1960’s and 1988. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 11% of the area between the 1970’s and 2005. As a result ECA is currently at 3%, or a high condition. Streamside buffers were retained on all but 0.5 miles of stream in the upper portion of the drainage. Where buffers were retained they ranged from 100’ to 150’ from the stream channel. This means that based on FEMAT (1993) 90 to 100% of all wood likely to fall into the stream was retained during timber harvest. Forested stands within PACFISH buffers are aged as follows: 6% are < 40 years old, 19% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 75% older than 100 years. No future foreseeable harvest in the RHCAs is expected therefore they would be considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and bank stability in Pine Knob Creek. There are almost 20 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 0.5 miles of the RHCA roads are graveled and opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. Gravel helps to minimize sediment production from roads (Swift, 1984: Burroughs and King, 1989) as does minimizing motorized use on roads. There were no obvious signs of road surface erosion (no rilling or gullying) during culvert inventories in Pine Knob Creek. Many roads were dominated by a base rock surface topped with grasses/mosses and small trees growing along their margins. The overall watershed road density is 4.8 mi/mi2 and the RHCA road density is 2.2 mi/mi2. This is an 11% reduction from densities in 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. Prior to 2014, there were 11.5 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissions all but 0.5 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 44 acres (4 acres/mile) of road back into productive forested habitats. There are 9 stream crossings within the watershed with 8 occurring on very small seeps or streams (18-24”). Two of the crossings were identified as needing cross drain additions and 3 need to be replaced as they are undersized or are in poor condition. Roads are expected to be contributing very little sediment to streams due to an overall low number of crossings (0.5 culverts/mile of road), well vegetated/rocked road surfaces that showed very little erosion, the need for cross drains on only 2 small streams, and well vegetated ditchlines which are helping to filter out sediment to streams. There are no human caused barriers to upstream aquatic organism migration in the watershed. Appendix A Guidance (Conroy an Thompson, 2011) states that “…In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving.” A total of 10 acres of commercial thinning occurred in Pine Knob in the last 20 years (2005) and full PACFISH buffers were retained. The lack of recent timber harvest combined with few stream crossings, mostly closed roads and only one pre-1993 road failure would indicate that Pine Knob Creek is experiencing an upward trend in aquatic habitat conditions. The stream has an excellent and fully functioning riparian vegetation component, stable banks, cool stream temperatures, and increasing amounts of gravel which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic conditions in Pine Knob Creek is principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results from NEZSED indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of Pine Knob to 18% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 45%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity as previously discussed. The model predicted a 2% increase in cobble embeddedness and subsequent decrease in summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is well below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009 and 2014). ECAs would increase to 14% under all alternatives and would remain within the High (good) condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 1.8 miles of road, 0.1 miles of which is within RHCAs. This would reduce watershed road densities to 4.3 mi/mi2 and RHCA densities to 2.0 mi/mi2. The result would be a 9% reduction in overall road miles and a 6% reduction in RHCA road miles. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.5 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 2 acres of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 8.5 miles of system road (48% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through the addition of cross drain culverts. The project would also replace the 2 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. Small amounts of sediment delivery would occur as a result of the culvert replacements and would last up to 2 years. In the long run, the replacements would reduce the risk of future failure. All 8 crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 5.8 miles of road (69% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams during harvest operations. Overall Trend Summary for the Pine Knob Prescription Watershed The current upward trend for aquatic habitat conditions and fish habitat capacity is expected to continue in the Pine Knob prescription watershed because of road improvements associated with the project, the relatively intact RHCAs, the expected minimal effects of modeled sediment to streams, water yields that would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs which have been shown to be 95-100% effective (USDA Forest Service, 2009).   0.78   4.1 sq. miles (2,622 acres) Pine Knob Creek Prescription Watershed Activities RHCA sq. miles          Road Density Roads Total 1995 Road Decomm 1996-2011 Roads Total 2011 SF/WF Road Decomm1 Roads Total 2014 Clear Creek IR Project6 Roads Final Total Percent reduction miles 22.1 2.5 19.6 0.0 19.6 1.8 17.8 9.2% road density 5.4  4.8  4.8  4.3  RHCA miles 1.9 0.2 1.7 0.0 1.7 0.1 1.6 5.9% RHCA road density 2.4  2.2  2.2  2.0  Percent road reduction: 9% total miles; 6% RHCA miles      Culverts Clear Creek IR Project6  All fish bearing pipes AOP; All undersized pipes replaced    replaced 2        removed 0                 Road Reconstruction Clear Creek IR Project6 Percent of total miles       Total miles 8.5 48%        miles outside RHCA 7.4        miles in RHCA 1.1 69%                Road Recondition Clear Creek IR Project6 Percent of total miles       Total miles 5.8 33%       miles outside RHCA 5.8        miles in RHCA 0 0%                Non-System Road Decomm Clear Creek IR Project6* Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decomm7 Total      Total miles 0.5 11 11.5      miles outside RHCA 0.5 9.7 10.2      miles in RHCA Temporary roads (acres) 0.0 1.3 1.3      *estimated 25% of proposed system road decommission miles Clear Creek IR Project6 (Alt.

Cobble embeddedness was measured at 38% in 2012 and when assessed against the DFCs (USDA, 1992), the watershed currently is at 75% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend based on fishery habitat potential. This prescription watershed occurs in its entirety on Forest Service managed lands. There are about 11 miles of fish-bearing and 17 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Clear Creek. The stream is suitable for chinook salmon, steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout. All three species have been found in in the stream during 1984 and 1993 surveys. Stream temperatures were measured in Clear Creek near Pine Knob in the summer of 2011and 2012. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning and rearing (11°C and 13.1°C respectively). Cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.1°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.1°C). This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed only a 9% probability of bull trout presence on 1.6 miles of headwater stream in 1980 and a zero percent probability in 2040. Temperatures are warmer than preferred for bull trout. Pool-to-riffle ratios were noted as good (52:48) in the 1988 surveys of the mainstem below the Middle Fork. Low wood levels were also noted and are a result of the 1931 fire in that area. Surveys were not conducted in the upper reaches of the watershed. More recent observations showed well vegetated riparian areas and buffer retention along streams adjacent to harvest units. Riparian areas, and therefore wood levels, are trending up and would continue over time as intact riparian areas would provide the necessary wood component to streams over time. Stream bank stability was noted as good to excellent in the1988 surveys. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Bank stability remained in good to excellent condition based on 2010-2012 field observations which showed the same heavily vegetated banks and riparian areas as well as a dominance of cobble substrate. Stream substrate composition in Clear Creek in 1988 was composed of 12% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 2% gravel and 86% large material (rubble to boulders). Cobble embeddedness was 38% in 1988 below the Middle Fork and was 38% near Pine Knob Creek in 2012. No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within the drainage and surveys were not conducted in the same location between years. Determining a trend for embeddedness is therefore not possible given available data. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 15% of the watershed between the 1970s and 1990s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 11% of the area between the 1980s and 1990s. As a result ECA is currently at 3%, or a high condition. Buffers of 150’+ along the mainstem of Clear Creek, and 50+’ on the smaller tributaries were retained during harvest beginning in the 1970s. Forested stands within what are now PACFISH buffers are aged as follows: 13% are < 40 years old, 20% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 67% older than 100 years. The middle age classes are partly a result of a wildfire which occurred in 1931 and burned roughly 23% of the area. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the large percentage of older age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood, and stable banks in Clear Creek. There are 26 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. A total of 0.5 miles of the RHCA roads are graveled and opened to motorized traffic and the remaining are closed. The overall watershed road density is 2.3 mi/mi2 which is a 16% reduction in roads since 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. The RHCA and landslide prone road densities are 0.8 mi/mi2 and 0.04 mi/mi2, respectively. Both are considered to be in a High condition. Prior to 2014, there were 16.5 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissioned all but 0.2 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 65 acres of road back into productive forested habitats. There are 27 stream crossings within the watershed, 3 of which occur on fish bearing streams and are not barriers to aquatic organism passage (replaced in 2012/2013). A total of 17 culverts are appropriately sized and the remaining 10 crossings are undersized for the area they drain. All roads also cross perpendicular to the stream channels which limit their effects to riparian vegetation; however portions of the ditchlines leading to those crossings are draining directly into the streams. These may be acting as a chronic sediment source of sediment to streams. Ditchlines leading to the 3 fish bearing crossings currently have cross drain pipes installed and are no longer adding sediment to streams at those sites. Appendix A Guidance (Conroy an Thompson, 2011) states that “…In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving.” No harvest has occurred in the Clear Creek prescription watershed in the last 20 years (1994). The lack of recent timber harvest combined with intact RHCAs, low RHCA road densities, no fish passage barriers, and mostly closed roads would indicate that Clear Creek prescription watershed is experiencing an upward trend. The stream has an excellent riparian vegetation component, stable banks, and cool stream temperatures which would allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic conditions in the Clear Creek prescription watershed is principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results indicate sediment yield increases in Clear Creek near the confluence with the South Fork to 18% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 30%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 1% increase in cobble embeddedness and 1% decrease in summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is well below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009 and 2014). ECAs would increase to between 12% and 15% depending on the alternative and would remain within the High condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 0.6 miles of road in the prescription watershed. This would reduce watershed road densities to 2.3 mi/mi2, or a 2% overall reduction. RHCA densities would remain at 0.8 mi/mi2. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.2 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 1 acre of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 2.7 miles of system road (18% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 10 existing undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 2.7 miles of road (18% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. Overall Trend Summary for the Clear Creek Prescription Watershed The current upward trend in aquatic habitat conditions is expected to continue in the Clear Creek prescription watershed because of mostly intact riparian areas, road related activities that are expected to decrease sediment input, water yields would remain below levels where alterations in streams channels could occur, and the implementation of design features and BMPs.   Clear Creek Prescription Watershed Activities Watershed area 11.3 sq. miles (7,234 acres)  2.7 RHCA sq. miles            Road Density Roads Total 1995 Road Decomm 1996-2011 Roads Total 2011 SF/WF Road Decomm1 Roads Total 2014 Clear Creek IR Project6 Roads Final Total  miles 31.1 4.9 26.2 0 26.2 0.6 25.6  road density 2.8  2.3  2.3  2.3  RHCA miles 2.7 0.5 2.2 0 2.2 0.0 2.2  RHCA road density 1.0  0.8  0.8  0.8  Percent road reduction: 2% total miles; 0% RHCA miles           Culverts Clear Creek Culvert Replacements2 Clear Creek IR Project6 Total  All fish bearing pipes AOP; All undersized pipes replaced  replaced 3 (fish) 10 13      removed 0 0 0               Road Reconstruction Clear Creek IR Project6 Percent of total miles       Total miles 13.2 52%       miles outside RHCA 11.9        miles in RHCA 1.3 59%                Road Recondition Browns Spring Project3 Clear Creek IR Project6 Total Percent of total miles     Total miles 2.0 2.7 4.7 18%     miles outside RHCA 2.0 2.7 4.7      miles in RHCA 0.0 0.0 0.0 0%              Non-System Road Decomm Clear Creek IR Project6* Clear Ridge Non-System Road Decomm7 Total      Total miles 0.2 16.3 16.5      miles outside RHCA 0.2 14.5 14.7      miles in RHCA 0.0 1.8 1.8      *estimated 25% of proposed system road decommission miles       Other actions proposed in the prescription watershed Clear Creek IR Project6 (Alt.

Cobble embeddedness was measured at 51% in 2014. When assessed against the DFCs (USDA, 1992), the watershed currently is at 59% of habitat potential. It was at 50% of its habitat potential when the Forest Plan was written in 1987. This would be considered an upward trend in fishery habitat potential. There are about 7 miles of fish-bearing and 13 miles of non-fish bearing streams in Middle Fork Clear Creek. The stream is mostly suitable for steelhead trout and westslope cutthroat trout which were both observed during 1984 and 1993 surveys. The stream provides limited habitat for steelhead trout due to moderate to high stream gradients and limited areas of suitable spawning substrate. Stream temperatures were measured in Clear Creek in the summer of 2011. Stream temperature conditions based on NOAA matrix ratings were High for steelhead spawning and rearing (10.7°C and 13.6°C respectively). Cool temperatures are a result of well forest areas adjacent to streams (see RHCA discussion below). Temperatures were moderate for bull trout rearing (13.6°C) and low for bull trout spawning/incubation (10.2°C). This is consistent with the Climate Shield model results (Isaac, 2014) which showed only a 14% probability of bull trout presence on 1.4 miles of headwater stream in 1980 and a zero percent probability in 2040. Temperatures are warmer than preferred for bull trout. Shallow water depths and lack of pool habitat were noted in the 1993 surveys. The low number of pools and lack of depth is directly related to low wood levels (28 pieces/100m). Low wood levels appear to be natural as streamside buffers were retained during previous timber harvest (see management actions discussion below). Water depths and pool habitat availability are considered to be trending upward trend since buffers were retained and would provide both the short and long term wood necessary to create pools as trees die and fall into the stream. Previously harvested areas that occur within current PACFISH buffers are forested. Standard PACFISH buffers are expected to be retained during the next harvest rotation which would maintain the necessary wood component over time, thus maintaining the upward trend. Stream bank stability was noted excellent in 1993. This is due to the presence of dense streamside vegetation in combination with large substrate (cobble, rubble, boulders) which armors the banks against the erosive power of the stream. Stream substrate composition in Middle Fork Clear Creek in 1993 was composed of 26% fine material (sand/silt <6mm), 25% gravel and 49% large material (rubble to boulders) based on Wolman pebble counts. Cobble embeddedness was measured at 55% in 1993 and 50% in 2014. This would indicate a slight improvement in cobble embeddedness. No obvious sources of sediment were observed at road crossings or along roads within the watershed during 2010-2012 field reviews. As noted by Sylte and Fischenich (2002) cobble embeddedness exhibits high spatial and temporal variability in both natural and disturbed streams. Sampling must be intensive within streams or stream reaches to detect changes. Intensive sampling has not occurred within the drainage so determining a trend for embeddedness based on two surveys may not be appropriate. Regeneration timber harvest activities have occurred on 18% of the watershed between the 1970’s and 1980s. No regeneration harvest has occurred since then. Commercial thinning occurred on 9% of the area between the 1970’s and 1990s. As a result ECA is currently at 2%, or a high condition. About 6% of the RHCAs were affected by past timber harvest. Buffers were retained on all units with the exception 2 small headwater streams. Forested stands within the buffers are aged as follows: 7% are < 40 years old, 54% are between 40 and 100 years and the remaining 39% older than 100 years. The RHCAs therefore would be considered fully functional given the age classes and minimal disturbance within them. As a result, they are trending in an upward condition and would continue to provide for shade, wood and bank stability in Middle Fork Clear Creek. There are almost 15 miles of Forest system roads within the watershed with less than 2 miles occurring within RHCAs. All RHCA roads are graveled and are open to either seasonal or year round motorized traffic. The overall watershed road density is 2.4 mi/mi2 which is a 12% reduction in roads since 1995 and is a result of past road decommissioning projects. RHCA road density is 0.9 mi/mi2 and landslide prone density is 0.08 mi/mi2, both High ratings. Prior to 2014, there were 7.2 miles of non-system roads in the prescription watershed. The Clear Ridge project decommissioned all but 0.3 miles resulting in an almost elimination of these roads and the conversion of 28 acres of road back into productive forested habitats. There are 13 stream crossings within the watershed, 2 of which are on fish bearing streams and are passable to aquatic organisms. Four other crossings have been identified for replacement and these plus an additional 2 require cross drain additions. Roads are expected to be contributing very little sediment to streams due to an overall low number of crossings (<1/mile), low RHCA densities, and the need for the replacement of only 4 crossings. Appendix A Guidance (Conroy an Thompson, 2011) states that “…In previously degraded watersheds, especially those identified as below objective in 1987, if there have been no entries or natural disturbances over the past 10 to 20 years, it could be assumed that trend is either static or improving.” No harvest has occurred in the watershed since 1992 (8 acres). The lack of recent timber harvest combined with relatively few stream crossings, low RHCA road densities, intact RCHAs, stable banks, and cool temperatures would indicate that Middle Fork Clear Creek is experiencing an upward trend in aquatic habitat conditions. These combine to allow for the continued improvement of fish habitat capacity over time. Proposed Activity Effects to Streams The expected short-term consequences of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project on aquatic conditions in Middle Fork Clear Creek are principally related to the surface erosion process and sediment conditions. The other short-term negative consequences of the project on aquatic conditions were related to the hydrologic processes of runoff and infiltration from temporary road construction and harvest. All of the activities are expected to have a negative effect on aquatic condition in the short term based on sediment yields as modeled in NEZSED. Model results indicate sediment yield increases at the mouth of Middle Fork to 11% as a result of project activities. This is well below the Forest Plan standard of 30%. The FISHSED model was used in conjunction with NEZSED to determine potential changes in fish habitat carrying capacity. The model predicted a 1% increase in cobble embeddedness and 1% decrease in summer/winter rearing capacity for juvenile steelhead trout rearing for the action alternatives. This is well below the 10% where changes in habitat quality could occur (Stowell et al. 1983). No substantial changes in cobble embeddedness and summer/winter habitat rearing capacity are therefore expected based on this modeling and on local effectiveness monitoring (USDA Forest Service 2009a and 2014). ECAs would increase to between 7% and 9% depending on the alternative and would remain within the High condition class based on the NOAA matrix (1998) therefore no channel alterations as a result of increased water yield is expected. The Clear Creek Project would decommission an additional 1.3 miles of road in the prescription watershed, 0.1 of which is in RHCAs. This would reduce watershed road densities to 2.2 mi/mi2 and RHCA densities to 0.9 mi/mi2. The result would be a 9% reduction in overall road density and a 6% reduction in RHCA density. The Clear Creek Project would decommission the remaining 0.3 miles of non-system road resulting in the watershed and would convert 1 acre of road back into a forested condition. The Clear Creek Project would reconstruct 6.9 miles of system road (51% of the roads in the prescription watershed) which would help to reduce sediment delivery by diverting road ditchline flow away from streams through cross drain culvert additions. The project would also replace the 4 existing and remove 1 undersized culverts with those sized for a 100- year flow event. This would reduce the risk of future failure. All crossings in the watershed would be appropriately sized after project completion. The Project would recondition 3.2 miles of road (24% of the roads). Reconditioning would apply gravel where needed to minimize the amount of erosion from road surfaces during log haul operations. The use of dust abatement during log haul would also minimize road surface erosion and potential input of sediment to streams. Overall Trend Summary for the Middle Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed The current upward aquatic habitat trend in the Middle Fork prescription watershed is expected to continue because of mostly intact riparian road related activities that are expected to decrease sediment input over time, and the implementation of design features and BMPs.   Middle Fork Clear Creek Prescription Watershed Activities Watershed Area 6.3 sq. miles (4,025 acres) 1.7 RHCA sq. miles          Road Density Roads Total 1995 Road Decomm 1996-2011 Roads Total 2011 SF/WF Road Decomm1 Roads Total 2014 Clear Creek IR Project6 Roads Final Total miles 16.9 2.0 14.9 0.0 14.9 1.3 13.6 road density 2.7  2.4  2.4  2.2 RHCA miles 1.8 0.2 1.6 0.0 1.6 0.1 1.5 RHCA road density 1.1  0.9  0.9  0.9 Percent road reduction: 9% total miles; 6% RHCA miles         Culverts Clear Creek IR Project6  All fish bearing pipes AOP; All undersized pipes replaced   replaced 4       removed 1               Road Reconstruction Clear Creek IR Project6 Percent of total miles      Total miles 6.9 51%      miles outside RHCA 6.0       miles in RHCA 0.9 60%              Road Recondition Browns Spring Project3 Clear Creek IR Project6 Total Percent of total miles    Total miles 1.0 2.2 3.2 24%    miles outside RHCA 1.0 2.2 3.2     miles in RHCA 0.0 0.0 0.0 0%            Non-System Road Decomm SF/WF Road Decomm1 Clear Creek IR Project6* Total     Total miles 6.9 0.3 7.2     miles outside RHCA 6.4 0.3 6.7     miles in RHCA 0.5 0.0 0.5     *estimated 25% of proposed system road decommission miles      Other actions proposed in the prescription watershed Clear Creek IR Project6 (Alt.

Big Cedar Creek and Lower Clear Creek Prescription watersheds do not have assigned objectives in the Forest Plan. The upward trends for Clear Creek and its prescription watersheds are primarily a result of riparian areas that are intact with minimal effects from management and a majority of roads that are graveled and positioned to have minimal effects on streams. In addition, the Appendix A Implementation Guide (Conroy and Thompson 2011) states “It was assumed in the Forest Plan that implementation of instream restoration and other watershed restoration activities would result in an upward trend in carrying capacity. Where these activities have been implemented, it could be stated that an upward trend in the habitat conditions has been accomplished.” Watershed restoration activities in the form of road improvement, culvert replacement and road decommissioning have been, and continue to be implemented since 2011. These have contributed to the upward trend in fish habitat carrying capacity throughout the watershed. Although short term impacts to modeled water and sediment yield are expected with the implementation of the Clear Creek project, they are less than those that could occur under Alternative A (No Action). The No Action alternative does not address road-related sediment issues beyond what projects have already been completed. Short term (<5 years) negative impacts with long term beneficial impacts to sediment yield are expected as a result of the Clear Creek IR Project road improvement and road decommissioning activities. Modeled sediment yield using NEZSED shows an increase in all prescription watersheds but all remain below Forest Plan water quality objectives. Modeling in FISHSED shows increases in cobble embeddedness or reductions in fish habitat capacity of 1-3%. This is below the 10% where changes might occur based on the model documentation (Stowell, 1983). Upward trend of aquatic and watershed conditions, particularly related to sediment, would be realized in the long term (>5 years). The short term impacts represent the maximum potential for erosion/sediment delivery and/or increase in water yield. Best Management Practices and project specific design measures would be implemented to minimize these impacts. In summary, the Clear Creek IR Project would have minimal short term negative effects associated with modeled water yield and sediment increases but would have a long term positive effect associated with road improvements. The combined road-related projects are expected to maintain an upward trend through reduced sediment delivery and runoff from roads to streams and aquatic habitats throughout the watershed. Reduced chronic sediment delivery is expected to allow for improved fish habitat carrying capacity continued upward trend over time. The conclusions regarding aquatic trends in the prescription watersheds are the consequence of subtle balances between the short-term impacts and long-term improvements. Trend conclusions must also be tempered with knowledge of the variability of conditions within the watersheds and the unpredictability of weather and natural disturbance events. Future trend will likely be very much influenced by future events –both management activities and natural events, including climate change.  References Burroughs, E.R. and J.G. King. 1985.

This increased hydrologic connectivity may impact the timing and magnitude of streamflow response to rain events and increase the frequency and magnitude of flood flows (Beschta et al., 2000; Eisenbies et al., 2007; La Marche and Lettenmaier, 2001). These direct hydrologic connections can adversely impact water quality through increased sedimentation from road erosion sources, while increased stormwater runoff may induce stream geomorphological changes, re-mobilize existing sediment stored within the stream channel, and result in the degradation of aquatic habitat (Goode et al., 2012); [cited in Brown, et al., 2013]. Forest silvicultural operations generally cause relatively low and ephemeral increases in sediment as compared to alternative land uses (Neary et al., 1989). For example, Corbett et al. (1978) found that timber harvesting, if considered independently of roads, has minimal effects on stream sediment. However, forest roads and skid trails have significant potential to increase erosion and sedimentation (Patric, 1976, Swift and Burns, 1999, Aust and Blinn, 2004 and Grace, 2005). Forest roads can alter hillslope hydrology by creating compact and less permeable surfaces (Megahan, 1972), decreasing infiltration (Grace, 2005), and increasing drainage networks with road surfaces and ditches (Wemple et al., 1996, Croke et al., 2001, Croke and Mockler, 2001 and Jackson et al., 2005), thus resulting in increased overland flow, erosion, and sedimentation during rain events. Erosion rates have repeatedly been shown in monitoring and research studies to be higher from roads, bladed (Wade et al., 2012a) or overland (Sawyers et al., 2012) skid trails, and log landings, compared to adjacent harvested and undisturbed areas (Yoho, 1980, Rothwell, 1983, Arthur et al., 1998 and Worrell et al., 2011); [cited in Wear, et al., 2013]. Effectiveness of Road BMPs In terms of the likelihood of sediment delivery, forest road stream crossings represent one of the most direct pathways for overland flow and sediment transport to stream channels (Lane and Sheridan, 2002); [cited in Brown, et al., 2013]. It is well documented in the literature that road surfacing techniques, such as the use of gravel, are used to enhance trafficability and minimize soil erosion on active roads (Clinton and Vose, 2003; Kochenderfer and Helvey, 1987; Swift, 1984), especially at road-stream crossings [cited in Brown, et al., 2013]. Graveling of road surfaces reduces sediment production (erosion) by reducing the surface area of soil exposed to raindrop impact, tire friction, and adverse effects of vehicular weight (by redistributing its force) (Megahan et al., 1991). However, the gravelling thickness must be adequate to ensure stability (Grayson, et al., 1993). The gravel protects the road surface and roadside ditch from kinetic energy of raindrop impact, which loosens sediment material. The gravel surface also increases the roughness of the road surface, thereby reducing the runoff rate and volume. The reduction in runoff reduces the transport of sediment from the road surface (Appelboom, et al., 2002) and within the roadside ditch; as well as decreasing the rate of further sheet erosion. For example: i. Swift's (1984) study showed that placement of a 6-inch lift of 1.5-inch minus crushed rock reduced sediment production by 70 percent from the unsurfaced condition over a 5-month period. The gravel achieved this amount of protection even though this period included 6.46 inches of rainfall in 5 days. In 13.3 months, the gravel with established grass at the margins of the traveled way reduced sediment production by over 84 percent compared to 9.5 months when the road was unsurfaced; [cited in Burroughs and King, 1989]. ii. A similar study in West Virginia by Kochenderfer and Helvey (1987) tested roads surfaced with 6-inch lifts of 3-inch washed gravel (size ranged from 1.5 to 3 inches) and 3-inch crusher-run gravel. Average reductions in sediment production were 88 percent and 79 percent, respectively, over an unprotected road during the 4-year measurement period; [cited in Burroughs and King, 1989]. iii. Simulated rainfall was applied to two 100-ft bordered sections of the Rainy Day road, Nez Perce National Forest, built in "border-zone batholith" material of gneiss and schist (Burroughs and others 1985a). The reduction in sediment production by graveling this road section was 79 percent [cited in Burroughs and King, 1989]. iv. In a study that compared erosion from both bare and graveled road segments, Brown, et al. (2013) found that bare road segments generated 7.5 times more sediment than graveled road segments. When evaluating the comparison further, they found that the “problem roads”, that is, the ones that delivered the most sediment were characterized by excessive lengths in between water control structures and inadequate surface cover (Brown, et al., 2013). They concluded that it is necessary to implement BMPs for road segments that are high-risk areas for water quality impairment; and that the use of appropriate BMPs can minimize sediment contributions from forest roads, even in situations where the original road design was not ideal (Brown, et al., 2013). They also concluded that BMP recommendation to gravel road segments to the top of the approach that is contributing sediment to the stream and to redistribute stormwater runoff from the road surface at least 7.6 m before the stream crossing can minimize sediment erosion from road segments and delivery to high-risk areas for water quality impairment (Brown, et al., 2013). v. Clinton and Vose (2003) evaluated suspended sediment transport from paved, graveled, and bare road surfaces on controlled test road segments in Georgia. They found that gravel-surfacing roads reduced sediment erosion by 54%, and a 95% reduction for paved roads. vi. In a study of several best management practices for sediment reduction from forest roads in the coastal plains of North Carolina, Appelboom et al. (2002) found that total runoff volume for the new gravel road surface treatment summed for all sampled events was reduced by an average of 39% compared to the non–graveled road surface treatment (Appelboom, et al., 2002). In addition, total sediment summed for all sampled events transported to the roadside ditch was reduced by the presence of gravel on the driving surface by an average of 67% compared to the non–graveled road surface for the new graveled road surface, and by an average of 54% compared to the non–graveled road surface for the pre–existing gravel road surface (Appelboom, et al., 2002). A number of studies have also shown that road surfaces, as important hydrological pathways, affect the volume and distribution of overland flow and alter channel network extent, pattern, and processes (Harr et al., 1975; King and Tennyson, 1984; Montgomery, 1994; Jones and Grant, 1996; Wemple et al., 1996, 2001); [cited in Croke, et al., 2005]. Water control structures, such as ditches with relief culverts, broad based dips, water bars, and turnouts, are used to drain insloped road surfaces and minimize the travel length of overland flow (Keller and Sherar, 2003); such that, increasing number of cross-drains reduces drainage area that collect water, reduces erosion, and hydrologic connectivity of road segments to streams [cited in Brown, et al., 2013]. For example: i. Croke, et al. (2005) found that gully development below ditch relief culverts was related to two factors: hillslope gradient and road runoff contributing area; with flow volume and sediment erosion was increasing with both factors. ii. In a study of erosion rates from road segments in Virginia, Brown, et al. (2013) found that the highest sediment delivery rates were associated with inadequate spacing between water control structures, 90–100% bare soil conditions throughout the year, and a lack of forest cover. iii. Luce and Black (1999) determined that increases in both road length and gradient can lead to increased erosion. The interaction between length and gradient is strong. For example, increasing length has little effect if the gradient is low but has a great deal of effect on roads with high gradients. In general, erosion is proportional to the product of distance between cross-drains and the square of the slope of the road (E.LS2). This strongly suggests that reducing spacing between cross-drains, especially on steeper road segments, dramatically reduces erosion, sediment delivery, and the potential for gullying below culvert outlets. Road approach length and bare soil percentage are the most important factors controlling sediment delivery. Fortunately, road approach length and bare soil percentage are both factors that can be controlled. Therefore, study findings support contemporary BMP recommendations for the spacing of water control structures at appropriate intervals and to stabilize road approaches near stream crossings with gravel, mulch, or other suitable material (Brown, et al., 2013). The road reconstruction and resurfacing work associated with the Clear Creek Project proposes to reduce spacing of cross-drains along the length of selected sections of roads and improve the road surface by increasing the amount of gravel, especially at approaches to watercourses. We are proposing to conduct these activities at locations where sediment delivery is most problematic, as modeled in NetMap. It is expected that these activities will reduce long-term, chronic sediment delivery from roads to streams by at least 90%.  References Appelboom, T. W, G. M. Chescheir, R. W.

All three are workable and legal, if probably not equally wise. 01/04 Thank you Alternatives …if, in the end, you chose Alt C, then some serious argument will be needed to explain the sediment and poor road obliteration issues. It just does not seem obvious to me that Alts B or C are really better--in any way--than D. 01/09 The same amount of road improvement and road decommissioning would occur under all alternatives. The difference in alternatives is related specifically to the amount and types of vegetation treatment. All action alternatives stay well below the Forest Plan allowable sediment yield guideline. Sediment yield percent over base for Alternative D is 0 to 4% less than that of Alternatives B and C for the prescription watersheds (DEIS, page 141). Total routed sediment percent over base to the mouth of Clear Creek is 1% less for Alternative D compared to Alternatives B and C (DEIS, page 3-148).Under all alternatives, sediment levels in streams would be reduced over the long term as a result of road improvement and decommissioning (see Aquatics and Watershed sections of the FEIS) Alternatives The range of alternatives presented in the Draft EIS is way too narrow and the proposal does not display an adequate range of alternatives as required by National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). All action alternatives include relatively large timber harvest proposals and are not sensitive to other resource needs. All proposals include actions which put other resource values at unnecessary risk, when a more moderate proposal could avoid these potential impacts. For example there are 21 units were logging is planned in units that do not meet regional soil standards. Logging is planned for high risk landtypes and for streams that do not meet current Forest Plan standards. The fact that effects analysis for fish, wildlife and water quality and vegetation generally lump the impacts of Alternatives B, C and D also supports the contention that there is very little difference in the proposed action 06/75 See response to previous comment #01/09 regarding the difference between the alternatives as they relate to vegetation treatments and road improvement and decommissioning. Effects to soils and high risk landtypes, as well as fish, water and wildlife, were also considered and design features will be implemented in order to minimize those effects while meeting Forest Plan or Regional standards and guidelines (see FEIS Design Features section as well as the Soils, Fish, Watershed and Wildlife sections of the FEIS). Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response alternatives. One or two new alternatives which are clearly different than the three existing alternatives are sorely needed and are required by NEPA. Alternatives New alternatives could include the non-controversial items such as the 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 41 acres of grass restoration, and 1,371 acres of prescribe fire. All timber harvest could be deferred on stands not meeting regional soil standards or in stands located on high risk landtypes. Restoration of these units could be completed without timber harvest. Timber harvest could focus on drier breakland types where there is no landslide risk and the effect of fire suppression is more pronounced. More mesic old growth and mature stands in upland areas could be maintained (especially those stands dominated by western red cedar). Retention of older stands could be distributed to favor species in need of these habitats like the goshawk, pileated woodpecker, fisher and marten. Cutting could also be deferred in drainages where forest plan water quality habitats are not being achieved regardless if there is an upward trend or not. Cutting of stands that have not reached culmination of mean annual increment could also be deferred. Sensitive plant populations could be located and protected instead of just assuming that they will be OK with no analysis. Roads could be closed or obliterated in areas were elk habitat security or water quality objectives are not being achieved. Water yield (ECAs) should be kept under the 15% ECA (good condition) guideline in all watersheds. In short, more balanced alternatives are needed that protect all resources. 06/76 The Decision Maker was presented a variety of alternatives including road decommissioning without timber harvest or prescribed fire, prescribed fire only, and harvest with no temporary road construction. These alternatives were considered but not analyzed in detail (see DEIS and FEIS) because they would not, or would only barely meet the purpose and need for vegetation improvement and the production of goods and services related to tree mortality. They would only minimally meet the goals and objectives of the CFLR Act. In addition, the Clear Creek area is designated by the Forest Plan as a timber management area. The “Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study” section of the FEIS describes alternatives that were considered by the IDT, but dismissed from detailed consideration. Alternatives This project involves too much logging. 22/01 See response to comment 06/76. Three alternatives were addressed in the DEIS and FEIS with varying levels of timber harvest. Alternatives Many of the negative impacts that the Forest Service describes for Alternative A could be addressed with another alternative that includes correction of these factors and perhaps even a small amount of timber harvest. 06/16 The Decision Maker was presented a variety of alternatives including road decommissioning without timber harvest or prescribed fire, prescribed fire only, and harvest with no temporary road construction. These alternatives were considered but not analyzed in detail (see DEIS and FEIS) because they would not, or would only barely meet the purpose and need for vegetation improvement and the production of goods and services related to tree mortality. They would only minimally meet the goals and objectives of the CFLR Act. In addition, the Clear Creek area is designated by the Forest Plan as a timber management area. The “Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study” section Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response of the FEIS describes alternatives that were considered by the IDT, but dismissed from detailed consideration. Alternatives There would be no need for additional NEPA if the Forest Service included an alternative to fix problem roads and culverts and decommission all problem roads. Such an alternative could include other non-controversial items such as the 1,887 acres of precommercial thinning, 41 acres of grass restoration, and 1,371 acres of prescribed fire. Perhaps even some timber harvest could be scheduled in drainages which are truly meeting Forest Plan goals for water quality, fish and wildlife. 06/17 See response to comment #06/16. The IDT identified, and maximized the amount of road work proposed in order to provide maximum benefits to streams and to address the problem roads in the area (see FEIS Aquatics section). These activities are in addition to the already cleared culvert replacements (for fish passage) and road decommissioning in the southern end of the project area (South Fork/West Fork Clear Cr Road Decom EA). These activities are currently being implemented in the drainage. All alternatives would allow for the continued improvement of stream conditions throughout the watershed. The Forest Plan allows for harvest to occur in drainages not meeting Forest Plan water quality objectives as long as an upward trend can be shown. Clarification of upward trend has been included in the Aquatics section of the FEIS. Effects to streams from timber harvest and temporary road construction are expected to be minimal to non-existent based on past monitoring and the proposed design features (see Aquatics and Watershed sections in the FEIS). Alternatives The DEIS has not presented a reasonable range of alternatives as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). You present “no action” and three extensive timber program alternatives (61.8 mmbf to 85.2 mmbf)-- essentially, no significant difference in the action alternatives. 08/01 See response to comment #06/16. Alternatives You need to present and evaluate a timber harvest alternative in the neighborhood of 15 to 30 mmbf. 08/03 An alternative was developed that did not have openings larger than 40 acres to demonstrate the need for larger patches. This alternative would produce between 20 to 30 mmbf. Please refer to the alternatives considered but not analyzed in detail section of the FEIS for further discussion. Alternatives Alternatives should have been developed that didn’t log in old growth. 12/02 No logging proposed in old growth Alternatives Alternatives should have been developed that don’t build new roads. 12/03 A “No New Road” alternative was discussed in the DEIS on page 2-12. Alternative D was developed to address this concern. Alternatives The massive amount of logging allowed in all the alternatives but the no-action alternative is unconscionable. I believe you have violated the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by not developing alternatives other than the massive 62-85 million board feet of logging. The 10,000 acres 20/01 Reasonable alternatives to the proposed action should fulfill the purpose and need and address unresolved conflicts related to the proposed action. The alternatives presented in the FEIS satisfy these requirements, and constitute a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response of logging you propose is ridiculously high. action. Alternatives You must reject this proposal, and develop alternatives that don't log old growth forests, as well as alternatives that don't build new roads. 20/04 A “No new road” alternative was discussed in the DEIS on page 2-12. Alternative D was developed to address this concern. No logging is proposed in old growth Alternatives Conversely, some CBC members felt that further consideration of Alternative D is warranted based on strategic, efficiency, soils, and other considerations. That is, Alternative D still represents a significant level of timber harvest and landscape-scale restoration while responding to an issue with strong public interest. At the end of the day, the CBC wants to see the project implemented expeditiously, ensuring the purpose and need and other requirements are met. Some CBC members feel that incorporating some of the reduced temporary road elements of Alternative D could increase the likelihood of success and ensure timely implementation. This discussion and deliberation helps to underscore the ongoing need for internal CBC discussions with regards to forest wide road management considerations. Development of a forest wide roads analysis should assist in this process for the Forest Service, as well as for external parties. 27/09 Thank you for your comments. The Forest Supervisor will carefully consider all public input as well as the ecological, social and economic impacts of the project during the decision making process. We appreciate your interest in transportation planning and ensure we meet the Forest Plan goal of Provide a stable and cost efficient transportation system through construction, reconstruction, maintenance or transportation system management. However a Forest-wide analysis is beyond the scope of this project and would supply information that is not necessary for a decision. The IDT has done a thorough transportation system analysis for the Clear Creek drainage and separated out numerous construction, reconstruction, maintenance and decommissioning projects. We would also agree there is ongoing need for continued internal CBC discussions about National Forest Management. Alternatives  The other main concern is the integrity of the NEPA and public involvement process. It is clear that all action alternatives are very similar in that they include massive logging. How does this comply with NEPA, which requires a reasonable array of alternatives and an objective analysis before decisions are made? 28/03 See answer to 20/01. Alternatives The DEIS does not include an action alternative that stays out of old growth (so-called improvement cuts); it does not fully analyze a watershed restoration alternative; it does not analyze an alternative that would build no new roads; it doesn’t analyze an alternative that does not follow the forest plan DFCs (2-12); it does not analyze an action alternative that restricts openings from logging to 40 acres as per NFMA; and it does not analyze an alternative that won’t exceed soil standards immediately after logging. These are only some of problems with the DEIS in terms of alternatives. In sum, DEIS doesn’t analyze a reasonable alternative in terms of logging and restoration. All action alternatives are massive in the scale of change. 28/06 All action alternatives propose and analyze watershed restoration activities (road improvement and decommissioning). The activities are the same for all alternatives and address the need to provide for a continued upward trend in stream conditions. See response to #06/1, 08/03, and 12/03. An alternative that considered openings 40 acres and less was considered to show the effects of patch size and fire spread to support the regional forester request to exceed the 40 acre opening size. Please refer to the “Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study” section of the FEIS. Alternatives/Fire Please provide an alternative that eliminates units that have noxious weeds present on roads within units from fire management proposals. 03/77 Almost all roads within the project area contain spotted knapweed and some form of fire is necessary in order to treat slash loads created by logging activities. Pre-treatment of roads prior to harvest would Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response occur where necessary to reduce the seed source. Standard contract requirements for washing logging equipment prior to entering the area would also be required. Few roads occur near the boundary where prescribed fire is planned. These units have a lower risk of road-related weed spread. The cooperative weed program continues to spray along several of the main roads in order to keep weeds in check. CBC In 2010, the CBC worked with the Forest Service to submit a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) Proposal for the Selway-Middle Fork Clearwater Project, which includes the Clear Creek Project Area. We appreciate that the DEIS recognized the role of the CBC in developing this project. 27/01 We appreciate the time the CBC has spent with project level collaboration. We feel this partnership will ultimately lead more socially, ecologically and economically desirable projects that will help to strengthen the communities within the Clearwater Basin. Climate Change Disclose the impact of climate change on the efficacy of the proposed treatments; 03/33 The long-term ability of forests to sequester carbon depends in part on their resilience to multiple stresses, including increasing probability of drought stress, high severity fires and large scale insect outbreaks associated with projected climate change. Resilience would be increased by managing these forested areas. Unlike other forest regions worldwide that are a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, U.S. forests are a strong net carbon sink, absorbing more carbon than they emit (Houghton 2003; US EPA 2010, pg. 7-14; Heath, et al. 2011). For the period 2000 to 2008, U.S. forests sequestered (removed from the atmosphere, net) approximately 481.1 teragrams (Tg) of carbon dioxide per year, with harvested wood products sequestering an additional 101 Tg per year (Heath et al 2011) . Our National Forests accounted for approximately 30 percent of that net annual sequestration. National Forests contribute approximately 3 Tg carbon dioxide to the total stored in harvested wood products, compared to about 92 Tg from harvest on private lands. In 2011, timber harvest occurred on approximately 0.1% of National Forest system lands. Within the U.S., land use conversion from forest to other uses (primarily for development or agriculture) are identified as the primary human activities exerting negative pressure on the carbon sink that currently exists in this country’s forests (McKinley, et al. 2011; Ryan, et al. 2010; Conant, et al. 2007). When harvesting occurs on National Forests, the affected forests Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response remain forests, not converted to other land uses, and long-term forest services and benefits are maintained. Climate Change We also recognize that the project may provide opportunities to diversify the landscape in light of pending climatic shifts that may impact the area. 27/03 See the response to 03/33. Climate Change/Carbon Disclose the impact of the proposed project on the carbon storage potential of the area; 03/34 See the response to 03/33. Climate Change/Carbon Do unlogged old growth forests store more carbon than the wood products that would be removed from the same forest in a logging operation? 03/61 See the response to 03/33. Climate Change/Carbon What is the cumulative effect of National Forest logging on U.S. carbon stores? How many acres of National Forest lands are logged every year? How much carbon is lost by that logging? 03/62 See response to 03/33.  Climate Change/Carbon Is this Project consistent with “research recommendations (Krankina and Harmon 2006) for protecting carbon gains against the potential impacts of future climate change? That study recommends “[i]ncreasing or maintaining the forest area by avoiding deforestation,” and states that “protecting forest from logging or clearing offer immediate benefits via prevented emissions.” 03/63 See response to 03/33.  Climate Change/Carbon Storage Published scientific reports indicate that climate change will be exacerbated by logging due to the loss of carbon storage. Additionally, published scientific reports indicate that climate change will lead to increased wildfire severity (including drier and warmer conditions that may render obsolete the proposed effects of the Project). The former indicates that the Clear Creek Project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment, and the latter undermines the central underlying purpose of the Project. Therefore, the Forest Service must candidly disclose, consider, and fully discuss the published scientific papers discussing climate change in these two contexts. At least the Forest Service should discuss the following studies: Depro, Brooks M., Brian C. Murray, Ralph J. Alig, and Alyssa Shanks. 2008. Public land, timber harvests, and climate mitigation: quantifying carbon sequestration potential on U.S. public timberlands. Forest Ecology and Management 255: 1122-1134; Harmon, Mark E. 2001.

Effects of silvicultural practices on carbon stores in Douglas-fir – western hemlock forests in the Pacific Northwest, USA: 03/140 Increased resilience can maintain the overall ability of forested stands to store carbon at a very local scale (FEIS, Chapter 3, Vegetation, Climate Change). The impacts to climate change due to the short term reduction of carbon stocks from this project are expected to be miniscule on the global scale. After reviewing all of the above publications, it is reasonable to expect that under many harvest scenarios, carbon sequestration in forests would be less than if no harvest were to occur (either by thinning or by clearcutting). However, the amounts of carbon that can be sequestered from forests that are harvested and forests that are not harvested can be quite variable. Such differences depend on location, forest type, time between disturbances and type of disturbances (insects, fire, harvest rotations, disease, etc.). All the above papers were written about the Pacific Northwest where disturbances from fire, disease, insects on those forest types are much different than that in the Intermountain West. Certainly, one can conclude some basic tenets about forestry and carbon sequestration, but the magnitude of differences may be considerable. The amount of greenhouse gas mitigation that can be gained from eliminating timber harvesting on all Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response results from a simulation model.

The gains in carbon storage that can be obtained may be more theoretical than real (Gan and McCarl 2007; Murray 2008; Wear and Murray 2004, McKinley, et al. 2011; Ryan, et al. 2010; Harmon 2009). This would be especially true if global warming brings with it an increased threat of severe wildfires and other forest disturbances as some project (Galik and Jackson 2009; Dale, et al. 2001; Barton 2002; Breashears and Allen 2002; Westerling and Bryant 2008; Running 2006a; Littell, et al. 2009; Boisvenue and Running 2010). At the very least, fuels treatments will not be a major source of GHG emissions. The emissions that do occur will come primarily from relatively unstable carbon stocks (e.g. forest stands at risk to natural disturbances) and will be compensated for over time by increased radial growth in the trees left standing. A total of 1,371 acres are proposed for prescribed burning in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project under all action alternatives. The amount of carbon that could even potentially be released into the atmosphere from this project is infinitesimally small with respect to the larger issue of climate change. These articles were reviewed by members of the interdisciplinary team.. Climate Change/Carbon Storage Do unlogged old growth forests store more carbon than the wood products that would be removed from the same forest in a logging operation? 03/157 This is a duplicate comment.

As is the case here, the collaborative group is portrayed as a sample of forest users. In reality, the USFS selects each collaborative group member carefully to assure they support the project the USFS wants to 02/02 This is not true. The CBC was convened by Senator Mike Crapo and members selected by the group’s steering committee. The USFS was not responsible for member selection. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response implement. Cumulative Effects Even though ecological restoration is not the project’s priority, the NEPA document must at least identify all the existing ecological liabilities caused by past management actions. This includes poorly located or poorly maintained roads, high-risk fuel situations caused by earlier vegetation manipulation projects, wildlife security problems by open motorized roads and trails plus those that are closed but violated—and include all those impacts in the analyses. 03/114 Past logging and roads are considered in the existing conditions for the project area for each of the resources. Past and historical vegetation management practices were primarily clearcutting followed by either broadcast burning or dozer piling which eliminated a high risk fuel situation in those areas. The roads within Clear Creek occur in good locations near ridgetops and on stable landtypes (see Aquatics section of the FEIS). Field reviews show that while road maintenance may not occur on a regular basis, the roads are in excellent shape with only isolated erosion. Only 55% of the roads are open to motorized use and elk security is higher than recommended over most of the drainage. Please see the FEIS, Chapter 3 for more information. Cumulative Effects Dropping private lands for the analysis is not appropriate for considering cumulative effects and the overall importance of forest service lands for the individual species. The condition of the private land should have been at least discussed for the entire Clear Creek drainage. 06/42 Existing conditions and proposed vegetation management activities on private lands were considered and are discussed throughout the FEIS (Chapter 3). Cumulative Effects The analysis of cumulative effects was flawed and incomplete. The outdated, inaccurate NEZSED model was used for Forest Service proposed activities. However, several significant actions were not evaluated: Eastside Allotment (livestock grazing), Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning, timber harvest of Idaho state lands, and private land harvest. A credible cumulative effects analysis has to be conducted. 08/18 See response to 06/42. The Forest Plan requires the use of the NEZSED model; however professional judgment and past monitoring of similar projects was also used to assess of potential effects of proposed activities. These are discussed in the FEIS. Private lands, grazing on the Clear Creek portion of the Eastside Allotment, and Clear Ridge Road Decommissioning were considered in the aquatic habitat analysis and are included in the FEIS. Cumulative Effects/Long Term-Short Term Since many of the benefits of this project won't be realized for a century or more, a long-term vision for the landscape is necessary. There will be both costs and benefits to a variety of wildlife species in both the short and long term, and these will change over time (as described in the cumulative effects). For a particular species, what may constitute a cost today may become a benefit in the future. The necessity of forest opening for the reestablishment of early sera! tree species provides an appropriate example. Even for interior forest species, the creation of larger young patches (a short-term cost) will, in the long-term, provide larger patches of older forest with a more natural species composition (a long-term gain). 17/02 No answer needed Cumulative Effects/Monitoring For every project proposal, it is important that the results of past monitoring be incorporated into planning. All Interdisciplinary Team Members should be familiar with the results of 03/118 Monitoring of the grazing allotment has occurred and the information is briefly summarized in the Aquatics section of the FEIS and included in the project record. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response all past monitoring pertinent to the project area, and any deficiencies of monitoring that have been previously committed to. For that reason, we expect that the following be included in the NEPA documents or project files: A list of all past projects (completed or ongoing) implemented in the proposed project area watersheds. • The results of all monitoring done in the project area as committed to in the NEPA documents of those past projects. • The results of all monitoring done in the proposed project area as a part of the Forest Plan monitoring and evaluation effort. • A description of any monitoring, specified in those past project NEPA documents or the Forest Plan for proposed project area, which has yet to be gathered and/or reported. Implementation monitoring (through contract administration) has been conducted and continues on the SF/WF Road Decommissioning Project and the Clear Creek Culvert Replacement Project. Forest Plan Monitoring for consistency related to cobble embeddedness in streams is presented in the Aquatics section of the FEIS. There are no designated Forest Plan stream monitoring/evaluation sights in Clear Creek. Design Criteria Design criteria should be clarified with regards to units with high subsurface erosion potential (Design Criteria #5, page 2-5). The Design Criteria indicates that only high subsurface erosion potential units will have special considerations regarding restoration of skid trails and landings, however later in the DEIS, in Design Criteria #8 and in Sec. 3.5.6, it states that all temporary roads, skid trails and landings will be restored (decommissioned and decompacted). The CBC recommends that the design criteria be clarified to ensure that all skid trails and landings should be limited to the extent possible and that all skid trails and landings will be decommissioned. If practicability makes restoration of any harvest areas unrealistic, moderate subsurface erosion risk areas, and/or areas that exceed the 15% soil standard should be considered for special measures, at a minimum. With regards to soil Design Criteria #6 and 7, the DEIS references section 3.6.5 erroneously. 27/19 You are correct, all skid trails, landings, and temporary roads would be limited to the extent possible and would be decommissioned. Design criteria #5 was established specifically for high subsurface erosion areas. Design criteria 6 and 7 were established to minimize the extent of all new detrimental disturbance. Design criteria #8 discusses decompaction for all skid trails in all units, regardless of extent of detrimental disturbance. For Design Criteria 6 and 7, the DEIS should have referenced section 3.5. 6, pages3-43, 44). The FEIS has been updated to address this concern. See the soil report for further clarification. Design Criteria Operation of some machinery on steeper slopes may be appropriate to limit operator risk and liability. 27/20 Operation of equipment on slopes over 35% is being considered based on reviews of ground disturbance on area where this has taken place. The review indicated that this treatment had acceptable impacts under certain conditions. The intent is to allow the sales to remain flexible to accommodate modern logging techniques where they are compatible to meeting resource objectives. Soils Design Criteria #9 establishes that machinery can be operated on slopes steeper than 35% with approval of the project soil specialist. This would occur on site-specific, field reviewed locations Design Criteria/Alternatives To the extent that additional landslide prone areas are identified during project layout and implementation, design criteria should incorporate direction to adopt PACFISH 27/18 You are correct. If additional landslide prone areas are identified, the area would be excluded from harvest and a 100’ PACFISH buffer would be added. This Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response buffers for these areas as well. While it may not be required, we encourage consideration of winter logging in some of the units to further reduce soil impacts, when the ground is frozen or covered by at least 6” of snow. We recognize that operational costs (i.e. plowing) can impact the operability of winter logging; however, in some areas where anticipated detrimental disturbance is highest, winter logging should be considered to effectively mitigate those impacts. change will be added to the FEIS. Monitoring of winter logging has shown that detrimental soil disturbance is reduced as long as frozen ground or depths of snow conditions are met. Winter logging could be utilized in the implementation of this project, but would not be required. Documentation Disclose the timeline for implementation; 03/17 If an action alternative is selected by the decisionmaker, the Economics Environmental Consequences section of the FEIS indicates that the timber volume is scheduled to be sold through 5 different sales over a 5-year period, starting in 2015. Typical sale duration would be 4 years each; the last sale would be completed in 2023, for a total of about 8 years of harvest activities. Post-harvest reforestation and site preparation work could continue for up to 5 years following harvest on the last sale, creating a potential end date of 2028, for a total of 13 years of harvest plus post-harvest activities. Documentation With the very vocal proposal in Idaho to transfer USFS lands to the state, I'm sure you're aware that the public very much wants an increase in timber harvest. Frankly, I would like to see in the future a "mega EIS" along the lines of the Four Forest Initiative (4FRI) in Arizona. 05/03 Please see the response to 20/01. Documentation For a guy who has read literally hundreds of EIS's over the years, I'm very impressed with this one. It's not too long...as in not "lawsuit proofed." It's clear, concise, and loaded with relevant facts and tables. A lot of EIS's now a days hardly even mention "vegetation." The public doesn't really give a crap about MIS...but they do want to know what the forest will look like when you're done. I like the tables on "age class, tree size, successional stages." Few EIS's show "age class and tree size." Helps with the visualization. The public doesn't have a clue about successional stages, but they can visualize tree size and age. Over all, job well done. 05/20 Thank you Documentation Please assure that 1) the natural resource damage caused by this timber sale is described in detail in Chapter 3 of the final NEPA document, and 2) the documents contained in the attachments to these comments are included in the Reference section. 10/03 Chapter 3 of the FEIS includes a discussion of potential environmental effects due to timber harvest.

The DEIS does not include a Chapter titled Affected Environment (current conditions). Although initially it appeared to be missing, after review it was clear that the information is discussed in Chapter 3. For clarity, we request that Chapter 3 be relabeled Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences. 33/04 This concern has been addressed in the Final EIS. Documentation/Collaboration I've spent years reading USFS EIS's and EA's, and was drawn to this project because of it's "collaborative" nature. I was so impressed with the EIS that I felt compelled to comment on it when I read it had just been opened for comments. Frankly, I think the project should be a model for the Northern Region. 05/01 Thank you Documentation/DFC’s The DEIS states that the DEIS DFCs are consistent with the forest plan DFCs. Even so they are different. Specifically, how are the new DFCs in the DEIS the same as those in the forest plan. Why wasn’t a site-specific plan amendment done to adopt these new DFCs? Thus, isn’t this DEIS functioning as a forest plan amendment without going through the legitimate and legal amendment process? 28/04 By creating a landscape that is dominated by a diversity of plant species, age classes, and disturbance patterns that will trend the analysis area towards resistance and resilience to future change agent is directly supported by the forest plan goals objectives, and standards.

It has not been adopted into the forest plan though the DEIS vegetation goals and DFCs are based on its “recommendations.” (See page I-5). This is crucial because no alternatives to these new DFCs have been considered even though they are not part of the forest plan. The cumulative 28/05 The forest plan directly supports maintaining a diversity of plant communities, patch sizes, size classes, and age classes across the forest. The DFC’s simply quantify the range of those conditions based on ecological processes and plant community dynamics.

A Final EIS disclosing all direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the environment has been prepared. Documentation/FP Amendments The Tribe notes that the Forest's proposal to amend the Soils section of the Nez Plan meets neither the Purpose of nor the Need for Action (Section 1.3). Rather, this amendment simply facilitates, administratively, the implementation of the Project. Furthermore, amendment of the Soils section of the Forest Plan as proposed would weaken soil quality standards below that of the existing Forest Plan, facilitating treatment of three units which would otherwise be precluded from management under this proposal. The T1ibe recommends that this and other desired amendments to the Forest Plan be separated from this Project and evaluated within a separate NEP A framework. 21/14 The amendment to the Forest Plan is an administrative action. The amendment would better align Forest Plan standards with the Regional soil quality standards. Until a new Forest Plan is established, this issue will be dealt with on a site-specific, project NEPA analysis. The soils amendment does not weaken the Forest Plan standards. The Forest Plan currently does not allow any activity, including soil restoration, in units with over 20% detrimental disturbance. This amendment will allow for achieving the vegetation purpose and need, as well as improving soil conditions. Regional soil guidance allows for activities to occur in units that are not currently meeting standards in provide a net improvement in soil quality through restoration activities. By utilizing existing skid trails and landings, there would be little to no increase in detrimental soil disturbance. (FEIS, Soils section and Appendix D). Documentation/FP Amendments The Tribe notes that the Forest's proposal to amend the Nez Perce Forest Plan Appendix N definition of old growth meets neither the Purpose of nor the Need for Action (Section 1.3). Rather, this amendment simply facilitates, administratively, the implementation of the Project. The Tribe further notes that this proposed amendment does not appear in Chapter 1 of the DEIS (''Purpose of and Need for Action"). An evaluation of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of this amendment does not appear in Appendix D or elsewhere in the DEIS. Amendment of the definition of old growth as proposed would make available additional areas for treatment which would otherwise be precluded from management under this proposal. The Tribe recommends that this and other desired amendments to the Forest Plan be separated from this Project and evaluated within a separate NEPA framework. 21/15 The amendment to the Forest Plan is an administrative action. The amendment would better align Forest Plan standards with the Regional standards (Green et a 1992l). Until a new Forest Plan is established, this issue will be dealt with on a site-specific, project NEPA analysis. The Green et al definitions are regarded as the “best available science” for the classification of old growth at the site-specific level. See FEIS Appendix D for the amendment. Documentation/Maps In reviewing the harvest maps for Alternative C, it appears the over-all patch sizes are much larger than depicted with by ‘averages’. 13/06 The maps do not show all of the RHCA buffers or other retention areas within each unit. Documentation/Maps While the project maps do include system trails on the maps, the design features to protect trails are missing from the DEIS. 16/01 The system trails would be protected during harvest activities; design criteria will be developed in the FEIS to state that Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response designated trails will be protected. Documentation/Public Involvement The EPA is supportive of the Forest's collaborative effort to develop actions that would improve the historic range of variability on the landscape. The DEIS is robust and clearly describes information gathered from public scoping efforts and includes a summary of other relevant plans that affect the proposed activities (e.g., PACFISH/INFISH). 33/01 Thank you Documentation/Purpose and Need All proposed alternatives treat large acreages of stands which have presumably culminated and this level of harvest should more than exceed the purpose and need described for the project. 06/06 See response to comment 20/01 Documentation/Purpose and Need We appreciate that the project represents a shift in the management of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests towards landscape-scale restoration, with an emphasis on retention and trending the landscape towards desired future conditions, appropriate patch sizes and functioning watersheds. We also strongly support the fact that the project proposes significant levels of timber harvest to achieve local economic goals supporting increased employment, which is a primary objective in addition to restoration work of the Selway-Middle Fork CFLRP project of which Clear Creek is a keystone area. 27/02 Thank you for your comments. We have shown that responsible forest management can result in timber outputs that support the local economy. Documentation/Purpose and Need Specifically, the Forest and ID Team are to be commended for the large scale of this proposal, as it represents what many agency leaders and interested publics have been suggesting is needed to achieve some of the following benefits of a landscape level approach to national forest management: NEPA efficiency - getting more “bang for our buck,” in terms of an ongoing reduction of planning resources (dollars and personnel). Project scale significance - moving forest vegetation composition, structure and function toward desired conditions. Increased timber outputs – contributing to the objectives supported by the CFLRP proposal, and strongly supported by the CBC and local communities. Reduced cumulative effects - Management actions treat more acres and concentrates activity in shorter time frame, allowing for extended period of recovery, growth and forest development, thereby reducing the need for regular reentry and associated impacts. 27/04 We appreciate your observations. Documentation/References None of the scientific documents listed in the attachments to these comments are listed or cited in the References section of this DEIS. This is called lying by omission. 10/02 The references section of the Final EIS has been updated to address this concern. Documentation/References Please include (and cite) the source documents for the opposing views contained in the attachments to these comments in the References section of the final EIS.

The Economics section of the FEIS discloses potential economic effects associated with the proposed actions. The Clear Creek project is being considered, at least partially, as a Land Stewardship Project under Section 347 of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY 1999. This Act allows the timber stumpage to be used to pay for the non-commercial activities. As shown on DEIS page 3-19, the timber value generated from logging would cover the cost of the non-commercial projects. Economics Please evaluate all of the costs and benefits of this project. Please include a detailed list of all the costs to the agency and the public. 03/141 The costs associated with this project are displayed on page 3-19 of the DEIS. Benefits of the activities are displayed in the DEIS and FEIS as each resource area is evaluated. Economics You seem to have underestimated the cost to taxpayers of the proposed logging. Please include all costs. 03/187 The costs displayed in the DEIS and FEIS are based on current information from actual sold sales and management activities and were determined to accurately represent taxpayer costs at this time. Economics Alternative C based on Table S-1 provides an additional 223 sustained jobs and a greater harvest income. In addition Alt. C provides a greater degree of vegetative restoration which better meets the purpose and need of the project (Page 2-3, DEIS). 04/01 Economic viability is only one aspect of evaluating the best alternative. For example, each alternative reflects tradeoffs of the management direction within that proposal. Alternative C may create the most immediate jobs, but alternative B generates the most stumpage revenue that can be used on other restoration projects which in turn creates additional jobs. Economics Providing jobs and income for the local economy is a critical need of ldaho County. We request you strongly consider Alt. C. 04/02 Alternative C would generate the most immediate income to the communities. Alternative B, if implemented using Stewardship Contracting authority, which uses the stumpage value to pay for other resource work, would provide longer term income. Economics I'm impressed with the large amount of acres treated and board feet produced. I like that one of the "issues" was to make a "cost effective" EIS. The large size has to be more attractive to industry, and thus result in higher revenues for stewardship activities. 05/02 Consolidating treatment activities on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest has contributed to the fact that the Forest is receiving top dollar for their advertised sales. Economics Very impressed with the PNV. Very impressed with $1.25 million dollars for stewardship activities. Why spend budget money for road decommissioning, when you can "let the trees" pay for it. Just like the old "purchaser road credit days," but in reverse! 05/14 Stewardship Contracting has been a very effect tool on the Forest for paying for other restoration activities. As long as Congress continues to authorize use of this “tool”,the Forest will continue to use it. Economics Yours is the ONLY EIS that I've ever seen list the EIS NEPA costs. It looks low to me. Is it true that the $175,000 for NEPA costs, listed as 05/15 The NEPA costs are based on a Forest average, but would likely exceed these costs due to additional data needs spurred Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response a footnote under the PNV table on page 3-19, is the cost to prepare the EIS? It should be a requirement for the entire USFS to tell the public how much it costs to prepare an EIS. It's all about transparency. by controversy or litigation. Economics Does the USFS "pay" for the road construction costs, or is that "paid" for by the contractor? 05/16 The timber stumpage value pays for the road construction costs (DEIS, p.3-19, Table 3-3 footnote) Economics Economies-of-scale for timber sale preparation, operations (including road construction and maintenance), and site-preparation (prescribed burning) related to larger patches are neither disclosed nor discussed. Comparing estimates of the management costs associated with protecting and managing resource values should be compared between alternatives. The issue relating to “…reducing planning an implementation costs by managing on a large scale” (...am assuming both analysis area and larger patches) was not specifically addressed in the analysis. This is an important issue indicator. Addressing patch size, and other elements of scale, is not business-as-usual (ecologically, biologically, economically or operationally) for this Forest. It is important, therefore, to display the effects by alternative, to support advantages/disadvantages and refute arguments/positions to the contrary. 13/05 Completing the vegetation treatments in larger areas, such as in Alternative C which regenerates larger patches, allows for areas to be completed, than closed for an extended period of time, while the new trees grow. This reduces road maintenance costs and the continued costs of multiple entries. A discussion of this will be added to the FEIS. Economics I don’t think making jobs for Idaho permits saving it. Are the Idaho folks too lazy to make their own jobs for themselves 14/03 Jobs generated from the Clear Creek project are in support of the job market that is already established in the area. Economics The DEIS does not clearly convey the costs of the proposal. How would taxpayers be affected? Virtually every sale in this region is below cost, yet the economics section does not clearly show all the costs. 28/45 The project alternatives are clearly cost effective for sale viability and contributions to the local economy. Costs associated with additional NEPA work or litigation, which some associate with below cost evaluations, are not relevant to this analysis, because they are either sunk costs not a result of this project’s actions or are unknown. Economics I think Option C is the best and should be started ASAP, despite my other concerns. The more ground that is treated per entry -- and the more local jobs created in the process -- the better, to my way of thinking. All of the options (except A, which really isn't an option) are okay, but B and D do less and are more likely to require additional future entries into the same locations. 30/01 A discussion on treating larger areas will be incorporated in the FEIS economic section. Economics/ On page 3-15 it is stated that site preparation was modified from prescribed burning to mechanical treatment for economic reasons. How will these changes affect resource values such as soil protection, stream sedimentation and forage production for wildlife? How many units were modified in this “major” adjustment and what is the current mix of prescribed burning to mechanical treatment? 06/19 The mechanical site preparation proposed is by use of an excavator which has proven to cause less soil disturbance than the use of dozers to pile slash. The use of mechanical site preparation verse prescribed fire is projected to be about 30% mechanical to 70% burn for Alt. B; 40% mechanical to 60% burn for Alt. C; and 37% mechanical to 63% burn for Alt. D. A wildlife benefit of this adjustment Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response is the greater survival of the leave trees in the unit for longer term standing structure and forage will still be created through the pile burning. Field visits to excavator piled sites has shown that detrimental soil impacts which could contribute to stream sedimentation are minimal, because the machine stays in one place why it piles the slash within its reach. Equipment would be used on existing skid trails to the extent possible (DEIS, Page 2-6). Economics/CBC The second major concern is duplication of effort. The CBC is funded through tax dollars from the Forest Service (largely) yet its role seems little different than the Forest Service. This duplication of effort and the increased spending of tax dollars is very questionable. 28/02 The CBC’s funding sources are unknown to the ID team and have no influence on this or other projects. The CBC’s governance, structure and role is actually quite different from that of the Forest Service. They lack the technical expertise to effectively influence activities at the project level. Rather, they have been involved at a broader level, representing differing interests that seek to help guide the management of the Forests within the Clearwater Basin for the greater good. The CBC has provided some sideboards and expectations to the Forests such as: work at a large scale; do what’s right on the ground and don’t shy away from controversy. To that end, the Forests have begun to approach land management (particularly vegetation management) projects differently. Instead of doing a “piecemeal” approach and singling out opportunities where they exist, we are now looking at forest management at the watershed scale, where we can effectively mitigate forest health and fuel concerns. As we developed the Clear Creek project, we periodically presented our process, rationale and logic to the CBC and received feedback towards the social and ecological acceptance/feasibility of our proposals. We feel that the expectations, guidance and sideboards that the CFLR program and CBC provide will ultimately lead to better and more efficient land management. Economics/CFLRA I am concerned that funds generated from this project will be used beyond the analysis area for purposes not directly related to the seven CFLRA goals listed on page viii of the DEIS. The Clear Creek project represents approximately 80% of the 58,000 acre Middle Fork/Clear Creek assessment area. The proposed actions would occur on the easiest, most economical ground to manage within this area. Funds generated by the Clear Creek project need to be “banked” to support management activities in the more difficult and 13/25 Funds from timber sale receipts of the Clear Creek project may be used to implement restoration projects outside the CFLR project area, which will indeed make the program “additive” to the Forests in the face of declining budgets. Funds may also be used to help pay for the implementation of forest management in the Middle Fork area if such a project is pursued. If stewardship contracting is used, excess stumpage values generated from the sales Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response costly landscape that is the Middle Fork section of the assessment area.

Many dead trees will be encountered and I feel they should be utilized. Sold for firewood, not just given up to the public where too few can gather the majority of the free wood. Or sold to either fiber or pulp concerns and this should be in place before the timber is marketed so that the logger has the responsibility to utilize the dead wood and not just waste it or give it away. Existing markets are interested but you might have to look a bit further than the realm of Potlatch or Home Depot. And, when are we going to get rid of the Scribner scale or at least 29/05 Dead trees are generally required to be removed as a forest product if they are merchantable, unless the dead wood is needed to meet other resource objectives, such as wildlife snag retention or as woody debris for long term soil nutrition. FACA/CBC There appear to be violations of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) in the development of the proposal. According to the Federal Advisory Committee Act “the function of advisory committees should be advisory only, and that all matters under their consideration should be determined in accordance with law, by the official, agency or officer involved.” As evidenced by several statements in the DEIS, the relationship between the forest service and the Clearwater Basin Collaborative (CBC) has not followed FACA guidelines. Instead of the advisory role that is required by FACA, the CBC has been considered a “partner” and has been given both decision and oversight responsibilities for many aspects of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration Project. 06/77 We are keenly aware of your concerns regarding perceived violations of the FACA. The language in the CFLRP legislation does seem to be in conflict with that of the FACA, however to avoid violations the Forests and CBC routinely rely on guidance provided by Key Principles and Practical Advice for Complying with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (available in the project file). In this situation, the Forests did not establish nor control the CBC, we do not set their agenda, present information at their meetings by invitation only and we do not solicit advice or consensus recommendations. In fact, CBC input at the project level has remained very much from individual organizations, with many member organizations submitting their own, separate comments towards project development. As mentioned above, at the project level, the CBC has functioned as a sounding board to help develop projects that are more socially, ecologically and economically acceptable. FACA/CBC The relationship of the CBC and the Forest Service raises many additional questions. First, has the CBC been designated as a federal “advisory committee”? If not, why not and what is its clearly defined purpose? Has the establishment, purpose and charter of the CBC as a federal advisory committee been listed in the Federal Register as required by law? Why is the CBC needed when functions assigned to the CBC like ecological assessment, selection of project locations and monitoring have all 06/78 The CBC is not a Federal advisory committee. Their purpose as indicated on their website is to “Protect and Enhance Idaho’s Clearwater Basin”. The CBC has undertaken an ecological assessment at the Basin scale to help inform their internal dialogues. To our knowledge, the assessment is being given some consideration in Forest Plan revision, however, due to its scale; their assessment played no role in the Clear Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response been accomplished by the Forest Service historically and isn’t this a duplication of effort rather than an advisory role? Shouldn’t these tasks be more appropriately accomplished by the agency? Creek project development. Project level assessment, development and monitoring will always be responsibility of the Agency; however, input is welcome from ALL interested individuals and organizations. FACA/CBC It appears that the proposed action (#B) was selected long before the NEPA analysis. As requested by the CBC, it is apparent that this is a major template and step to restoring the old timber program of the 1960s and 1970s. 08/02 The ID team spent over a year developing the proposed action (alternative B), which was responsive to the needs across the Clear Creek landscape, as outlined in the desired conditions and Forest Plan direction. Selection of the final alternative is the Forest Supervisors discretion and may be any of those analyzed or a modification/combination of several. The CBC has actually advocated for parts of several alternatives as opposed to the proposed action (alternative B). Of note is that many of the stands proposed for commercial thin in this project are a result of the “timber program” of the 1960s and 1970s, proving the renewability of the resource. We would argue that the timber program in those days worked at the appropriate scale, although the design and mitigation measures used then are nowhere near the standards of today’s scientifically based, low and minimum impact techniques that maintain or provide for structure, habitat, woody debris and so on. FACA/CBC In any case, the National Public needs to know how the special interest CBC influenced the development and analysis of this proposal. 08/04 Answered below with 28/01 FACA/CBC One of the most disappointing aspects of this proposal is the inordinate influence that the special interest CBC had on its configuration and magnitude. This unethical influence comes at the expense of the National Public. It is obvious that the CBC is functioning as an ad hoc Forest Service. This contemporary change in agency behavior significantly dilutes the integrity and credibility of the real Forest Service. 08/19 See response to comment 06/77. We genuinely appreciate and can relate to your concerns; however emphasis on collaboration is a result of the passage of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 through the 111th congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 30, 2009. Title IV of the bill created the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. We cannot ascribe motives for the program’s creation but we feel its implementation may ultimately lead to better and more efficient management of the Forests, and ultimately for the “National Public”. It should be noted that project input was solicited from many individuals and groups ,not just the CBC. We can offer that our approach to public outreach and communications have improved as a result of the program and expect to better accommodate more partners/public participation in the future. FACA/CBC The so-called Clearwater Collaborative must be 20/05 The Forests have no jurisdiction over the Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response scrapped.

Scrap the Collaborative and stop violating NEPA! CBC but we would point out that their meetings are open to the public and advertised on their website. In our experience they are welcoming of visitors and allow for public input as well. Participation in project development prior to scoping is not a violation of NEPA. As mentioned above, input towards Forest Service project development is welcomed from ALL interested individuals and organizations. In fact, the Forests routinely meet with groups other than the CBC to get input towards project development (Friends of the Clearwater, Back Country Horsemen, special use permit holders, just to name a few). The Forests, in an effort to be transparent with this project, solicited input from several routine planning participants prior to engaging in the NEPA process. Some participants provided input and some declined. Regardless, the Forests will continue to solicit input prior to engaging in the NEPA process and once the process has begun per 40 CFR 1503 and 1506.6. Every participant’s input is equal and there is no special deference given to any one group or individual. FACA/CBC The development of this proposal apparently stems from the Clearwater Basin Collaborative. What the DEIS does not answer is whether this group complies with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Indeed, the agency and USDA have been evasive ion that topic. The DEIS tells the public this group is a “partner” and has been given special authority in designing this proposal not afforded to other citizens. In any case, the National Public needs to know how the special interest CBC influenced the development and analysis of this proposal. 28/01 8/04 The Clear Creek project was developed under the legislative direction of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. That direction states quite simply that projects will be collaboratively developed. We recognize that this may lead to some perceived conflicts with FACA, but as outlined above, the Forests and CBC have followed the guidance in Key Principles and Practical Advice for FACA compliance to avoid violations. For this project, the CBC was given not given any “special authority” other than access to Agency personnel time, at their request, to present project details, status and to provide feedback. The term “partner” was used as a courtesy to the CBC members who devoted a great deal of time (much of which was unpaid) towards providing feedback. The Agency routinely “partners” with many organizations, including your own, to accomplish our missions. The term “partner” in the context of this project has no legal significance. Fire Disclose the actions being taken to reduce fuels on private lands adjacent to the Project area and how those activities/or lack thereof will impact the efficacy of the activities proposed for this Project; 03/29 Fuel reduction on private grounds has been ongoing and is expected to continue as a result of funding received through the Western States Competitive Grant. Also two small timber harvest operations Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response have reduced fuels near the project boundary Fire Disclose the efficacy of the proposed activities at reducing wildfire risk and severity in the Project area in the future, including a two-year, five-year, ten-year, and 20-year projection; 03/30 Proposed activities would reduce the crown fire potential on 7% of the project area (DEIS, FEIS Fuels section) by 2022. Future reduction may be needed in the future as understory vegetation regrows. Fire If the Forest Service did not conduct its Fire Plan, please disclose the cumulative effects of Forest-wide implementation of the Fire Plan in the Clear Creek project to avoid illegally tiering to a non-NEPA document. 03/38 The Fire Plan is a programmatic issue to that needs to be addressed at the Forest level. It is not a topic for smaller site-specific projects. The Clear Creek project does incorporate the need to treat fuels within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). The Forest has also adopted areas where fire is allowed to burn to reduce risks to firefighters while allowing natural processes to occur. Fire Did the Forest Service conduct ESA consultation for the its Fire Plan? 03/40 The Forest has conducted programmatic Biological Assessments for prescribed fire and fire suppression activities. Additional consultation is conducted at the project level if proposed activities do not meet the guidance found in these documents. Fire What about the role of mixed severity and high severity fire – what are the benefits of those natural processes? How have those processes (mixed and high severity fire) created the ecosystems we have today? 03/52 Past fire history is discussed in the existing condition for fuels in the FEIS and DEIS. While they may be natural processes, the Forest Plan requires suppression in about 70% of the drainage, primarily because it occurs within a WUI. Proposed project activities will create similar patch size and age class structures as those provided by wildfire with less risk to the adjacent private lands and federal lands managed for timber harvest. Fire Over how many millennia have mixed and high severity fire have been occurring without human intervention? 03/53 Likely since the last ice age; however, humans currently live adjacent to the area and protection of private property is a concern. The Forest Plan requires suppression in about 70% of the drainage as a result. Fire Please consider that thinning can result in faster fire spread than in the unthinned stand. Graham, et al., 1999a point out that fire modeling indicates: For example, the 20-foot wind speed1 must exceed 50 miles per hour for midflame wind speeds to reach 5 miles per hour within a dense Stand (0.1 adjustment factor). In contrast, in an open stand (0.3 adjustment factor), the same midflame wind speeds would occur at only a 16-mile-per-hour wind at 20 feet. 03/110 Fuel modeling for the area indicates that current conditions indicate a large potential for passive crown fire near the Forest boundary on the west side of the project area. Proposed prescribed fire activities would alter fire behavior so that the majority would occur as ground surface fire due to the reduction in ladder fuels. Fire Also, Hessburg and Lemkuhl (1999) suggest that prescribed burning alone can be utilized in many cases—possibly here—where managers typically assume mechanical fuel reductions must be used. 03/112 Mechanical treatment (harvest) is proposed as a tool to satisfy the purpose and needs of the project and to meet Forest Plan management area direction, including fuel reduction. Prescribed fire has been proposed as a tool in some areas where mechanical methods are not an Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response option. Fire Since disruption of fire cycles is identified, the NEZ PERCE-CLEARWATER NF needs to take a hard look at its fire policies. The development of approved fire management plans in compliance with the Federal Wildland Fire Policy was the number one policy objective intended for immediate implementation in the Implementation Action Plan Report for the Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy and Program Review. In general, the FS lags far behind other federal land management agencies that have already invested considerable amounts of time, money, and resources to implement the Fire Policy. Continued mismanagement of national forest lands and FS refusal to fully implement the Fire Policy puts wildland firefighters at risk if and when they are dispatched to wildfires. This is a programmatic issue, one that the current Forest Plan does not adequately consider. Please see Ament (1997) as comments on this proposal, in terms of fire policy and Forest Planning. 03/117 Please see response to comment #03/38. Fire What about the role of mixed severity and high severity fire – what are the benefits of those natural processes? 03/147 see response to comment 03/52 Fire How have those processes (mixed and high severity fire) created the ecosystems we have today? 03/148 see response to comment 03/52 Fire Over how many millennia have mixed and high severity fire have been occurring without human intervention? 03/149 see response to comment 03/53. Fire Moving forward quickly to provide harvest opportunities before value is lost to fire or disease needs to be a high priority. 04/03 We agree and estimate that project activities could begin within the next 2 years. Fire While I agree that the amount of regeneration harvest may affect fire behavior should a wildfire occur, I do not think that fire risk will actually be reduced. Fire risk is largely a function of weather patterns, drought conditions, fuel moisture and ignition sources. The risk of fire may actually even increase as logging operations and burning operations are conducted across the landscape. Harvest operations such as commercial and pre-commercial thinning may increase risk due to drying and more uniform redistribution of fuels. The Forest Service needs to incorporate more than just the amount of regeneration harvest into its fire risk assessment in the final FEIS. 06/20 We would agree that the risk or occurrence of fire is beyond our control and is climate driven. Harvested areas are expected to reduce fire behavior, spread potential and risk of a large scale stand replacing event due to a reduction in fuel levels. We are aware that some studies have shown an increased risk of fire spread as a result of logging slash, however the risk is generally short lived (<3 years) until the slash decomposes. In this project the risk is expected to be further reduced through mechanical piling and/or prescribed fire to reduce activity generated slash. Biomass (limbs, needles, tops) utilization is also a consideration and emphasis of the CFLR program, although it is generally market driven. Further assessments of fire have been included in the FEIS Fire The use of prescribed fire should be consistent with the frequency and intensity typical of the fire regime for a given landscape. 13/10 Prescribed fire has been proposed in the Roadless Area of lower Clear Creek to reduce fuels along the private property Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response boundary and to put fire back on the landscape where it has been suppressed in the past. These lower slopes would have been expected to burn fairly frequently at a lower intensity. Depending on aspect, slope and fuel loadings, implementation of prescribed fire may need to be re-introduced at an scale or intensity less than that of normal regimes to ensure an escaped fire does not occur, particularly along the private property boundary. As fuel loadings are reduced, however, future prescribed burning may be able to be implemented at a more historic regime.  Fire Most of the lower reaches of the Clear Creek drainage and some large areas in the upper drainage are in a period of natural succession where brush varieties make up a large percentage of the vegetation. My comment concerning these areas is that broadcast burning does not produce a desired effect, but damages (again) the soil quality, regeneration, and older conifers. My suggestion, of which I am able to show on the ground examples of and deliver up a cost per acre for treatment of the same adjacent brush fields, is to mitigate, pile and burn. This process is effective, cost comparative and 100% target successful. 29/01 We would agree that slashing, piling and burning of the shrubs (fuels) is an effective technique to reducing fire behavior, particularly on smaller areas and propose to use it where appropriate and cost effective. These treatments however would be less cost effective in the Clear Creek Roadless area due to difficult access. Broadcast burning is proposed here. It is expected that prior to implementation there would need to be some mitigation work done along the private property boundary to avoid an escaped fire. Prescribed fire has also been proposed because fire is a natural part of that landscape. The conifers that are growing throughout much of the shrubfields in Clear Creek are generally shade tolerant and fire intolerant species (grand fir and Douglas-fir) with some ponderosa pine. The shade tolerant species pose a risk to the old growth Ponderosa pines as they continue to grow and provide ladder fuels. The objective would be to reduce this risk by removing the shade tolerant species with a low intensity prescribed fire. Low intensity fire also has minimal effects to the soil if timed appropriately. Prior to burning a site specific burn plan will be prepared that documents the weather conditions and other environmental parameters needed to achieve desired results. You are welcome to view the burn plan and discuss it with the fire managers prior to implementation. Fire The DEIS discusses prescribed tire and references smoke management planning through the Idaho/Montana Airshed Group-a consortium of agencies, tribes, and private organizations who coordinate prescribed bum activities to prevent public health impacts.

They assess upcoming weather patterns to determine the potential smoke impacts in order to regulate burning on a day to day basis. For more information about this group, please see their website at: http://www.smokemu.org/about.cfm Fire/Thinning In their conclusion, Graham, et al., 1999a state: Depending on intensity, thinning from below and possibly free thinning can most effectively alter fire behavior by reducing crown bulk density, increasing crown base height, and changing species composition to lighter crowned and fire-adapted species. Such intermediate treatments can reduce the severity and intensity of wildfires for a given set of physical and weather variables. But crown and selection thinnings would not reduce crown fire potential. … Since the scientific literature suggests that your thinning activities will actually increase the rate of fire spread, you need to reconcile such findings with the contradictory assumptions expressed in your scoping letter. 03/111 Project activities would change species composition to more fire resilient species and reduce crown fire potential on 7% of the area as noted in the DEIS and FEIS (Fuels section). Project activities would also reduce surface and ladder fuel loadings which would also reduce the risk for crown fire. Fire/WUI please accurately disclose the threats to private structures and people under those scenarios, for all alternatives. It must be discernable why some areas are included for treatment and others are not. 03/105 See WUI discussions below response to comment 03/107 Fire/WUI The FS must have a detailed long-term program for maintaining the allegedly safer conditions, including how areas will be treated in the future following proposed treatments, or how areas not needing treatment now will be treated as the need arises. The public at large and private landowners must know what the scale of the long-term efforts must be, including the amount of funding necessary, and the likelihood based on realistic funding scenarios for such a program to be adequately and timely funded. 03/106 The proposed actions would reduce fire risk through at least 2022 as noted in the DEIS. Future treatments are likely occur but cannot be assessed at this time as conditions are likely to change over the next decade. We are not able to determining funding scenarios or budgets that far into the future due to Congressional priorities and changes in labor technologies or other associated costs. It will likely remain a high priority area due to its proximity to private lands. Fire/WUI The FS must assess the fuel and fire risk situation across land ownership boundaries to understand, and disclose to the public, the likely fire scenarios across the area’s landscape. 03/107 Within the watershed there are several likely fire scenarios that led to the development of this proposal. Of grave concern is fire spreading from private lands onto the Forest. The drainage lines up with the prevailing winds and the terrain, slope and fuels would also contribute to rapid upslope, upcanyon fire spread. Fuels on the private lands are generally light and flashy, supportive of rapid fire spread. Of concern would be a large fire rapidly spreading into the headwaters of the Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response drainage. A stand replacing event such as this could have negative downstream effects to the watershed. Also, it would be highly likely that heavy handed and potentially resource damaging suppression tactics would be employed during firefighting operations. Fires started on NFS lands pose as big a concern the watershed as those starting on private. Much of the watershed is difficult or time consuming to access by suppression resources. As mentioned above, terrain, slope, fuels and prevailing/diurnal winds would contribute to rapid, large fire growth. Continuous vertical fuels and homogenous canopies would support a stand replacing crown fire, particularly in severe years. Cold front passage in this area typically results in a reversal of prevailing wind with strong gusty winds. Again, the drainage is situated to line up in a manner that could support large wind driven fire growth given the fuel loadings. A fire moving from the Forest towards private ground would be aggressively suppressed with primary consideration given to the private properties and other values at risk and secondary consideration to the resource values in the watershed. The lack of variable vegetative conditions on the landscape can be attributed to almost a century of fire suppression in which over 290 fires have been suppressed since the 1970s. It is very logical to assume that several of those fires, burning under natural conditions, would have transformed the landscape into something other than the existing conditions. Unfortunately, due to the proximity of private lands, management of natural fire in this particular landscape is not currently an option. This project would try to emulate, to the best of our abilities, mosaic conditions at the appropriate scale. Observations of 40+ years of natural fire in our Wilderness areas demonstrate that it is the mosaic conditions that limit fire spread, even in severe years. Fuel reduction on private grounds has been ongoing and is expected to continue as a result of funding received through the Western States Competitive Grant. Fire/WUI The FS (Cohen, 1999) reviewed current scientific evidence and policy directives on the issue of fire in the wildland/urban interface and recommended an alternative focus on structure ignitability rather than extensive wildland fuel 03/108 Dr. Cohen’s research does not apply to the Clear Creek project because the project purpose does not include fuels reduction to reduce risk of fire damage to homes located within the wildland urban Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response management: The congruence of research findings from different analytical methods suggests that home ignitability is the principal cause of home losses during wildland fires… Home ignitability also dictates that effective mitigating actions focus on the home and its immediate surroundings rather than on extensive wildland fuel management. interface. The purpose of this project is to manage vegetation and fuel accumulations at the landscape level. It does not include fuels reduction to reduce the risk of fire damage to homes in the wildland urban interface (EIS, Purpose and Need, Chapter 1). Observations of 40+ years of natural fire in our Wilderness areas demonstrate that it is the mosaic conditions that limit fire spread, even in severe years. Fire/WUI The evidence suggests that wildland fuel reduction for reducing home losses may be inefficient and ineffective. Inefficient because wildland fuel reduction for several hundred meters or more around homes is greater than necessary for reducing ignitions from flames. Ineffective because it does not sufficiently reduce firebrand ignitions (Cohen, 1999)…. That research also recognizes “the imperative to separate the problem of the wildland fire threat to homes from the problem of ecosystem sustainability due to changes in wildland fuels” (Ibid). 03/109 See response to comment 03/108 Fire/WUI The Forest Service needs to re-evaluate the fact that 94% of the area is considered WUI (page 3-21) by Idaho County Wildfire Mitigation Plan Committee (Idaho County 2009). This designation appears to be in error as most of the upper drainage is 100% National Forest and located several miles from any urban areas or other areas of human habitation. 06/20 As stated in the DEIS (pg. 3-23), Idaho County is responsible for the WUI designation. While there would be a fuel reduction benefit, it was a driver for the project (i.e. no found in the Purpose and Need). Regardless, the “fuel reduction” benefits of the project largely focus on reducing crown fire potential across the landscape to minimize the risk of a stand replacing event and associated negative downstream effects. Fire/WUI We also question the legitimacy of this being in a WUI. It isn’t under any meaningful definition. Further, when did the Idaho County plan that identifies the WUI on the national forest go through NEPA? 28/38 See the response to comment 06/20. The WUI designation does not authorize ground disturbing treatments on federal lands, therefore no NEPA is required. The Clear Creek EIS does comply with NEPA in that it analyzes the proposed action effects on fuels. Fisheries The Forest Service cites fisheries Desired Future Condition (DFC), cobble embeddedness and % fines by depth calculations from 1987 and 2012 to make this claim. However, these calculations appear to be suspect and some of the data to support the Forest Service claims appears to be very dated. First, fishery habitat potential figures for 1987 appear to have been estimated as all numbers occur in intervals of 10%. Is there any actual data for these calculations and how can you predict a positive trend if no baseline data is available? 06/11 A positive trend can be determined for current conditions using more recent data. For Clear Creek, current substrate, riparian condition, road information (condition, location, and hazard rating) and visual observations of streams were used. A more detailed clarification of upward trend has been included in the Aquatics Section of the FEIS. Fisheries Second in only one case (Solo Creek) is cobble embeddedness or fines by depth reported for more than one year. It is very difficult to predict a trend from one point. Does the Forest Service have any other data? For example, 06/12 A more detailed clarification of upward trend has been included in the Aquatics Section of the FEIS. We have clarified that upward trend is not based on sediment/cobble embeddedness alone. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response what were the cobble embeddedness levels for all of the other streams in 1993? Fisheries The Forest Service has not conducted any comprehensive study of fish densities in the project areas for twenty years (DEIS 3.15). There have also never been any surveys for pearl shell mussels or Pacific lamprey (DEIS 3.15). Such surveys could have helped to document that the project area streams are truly on a positive trend in terms of aquatic resources. 06/13 The presence, absence or densities of fish species can aid in the determination of overall stream health, however densities can be highly variable and are difficult to tie specifically to land management activities or upward trend. This is especially true for salmon, steelhead, and lamprey which migrate to the ocean then return to spawn in local streams. These species are heavily influenced by factors that occur outside of the Clear Creek watershed (i.e. dams, fishing, and ocean conditions). If adults return in low numbers, then juvenile densities would also be low and not necessarily associated with watershed conditions in Clear Creek. The Forest Plan upward trend is associated with habitat conditions and not fish densities in part due to these influencing factors. Trends in fish populations would be useful, if available, but are not required for determining upward trend (USFS, 2011). A more detailed clarification of upward trend has been included in the Aquatics Section of the FEIS. Fisheries With no recent stream surveys of fish densities or densities of other sensitive aquatic species and no baseline habitat data it is hard to know if the project streams are actually on a positive trend to recovery. Even by the data presented in Table 3.1, a positive trend based on actual data (two points – 1993, 2012) has only been shown for one stream (Solo Creek). Table 3.1 documents a negative trend for the Middle Fork of Clear Creek and two other streams (Pine Knob Creek and Clear Creek) are documented as currently not meeting Forest Plan standards. Yet, timber harvest has been proposed in all of three of the drainages. There is also no discussion regarding the overall negative trend for the mainstem of Clear Creek. 06/14 See response to Comments #06/12 and #06/13. Fisheries no timber harvest should be scheduled in streams like the Middle Fork of Clear Creek where even the low quality data presented by the Forest Service suggests a negative trend. 06/15 See response to Comments #06/12. Fisheries The FISHSED and DFC fish habitat models also need to be up-dated or replaced. Forest Service research efforts in Boise and Logan, Utah have provided new models and data. Without the use of the best available science, your depictions of upward trends for watersheds and fish habitats are highly questionable, speculative, and likely erroneous. 08/09 We are required by the Forest Plan to use FISHSED and the DFC habitat model until the Plan is Revised (which is currently under way). Please see response to Comment #06/12 regarding upward trend. Additional modeling and a review of more recent science related to potential sediment input is included in the Watershed section of the FEIS. Fisheries Factual documentation of an upward trend requires a credible set of time-series data in 08/11 Please see response to Comment #06/12 regarding upward trend. We have Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response order to deal with statistical variation (Ramsey and Schafer, 1997). Your presentation in Table 3-1 fails this requirement and is misleading. For the Solo Creek watershed, you only have two data points (1993 and 2012). This can be hardly construed as adequate time-series data. Also, if you were monitoring CE in the 1980s, where’s your data to indicate upward trends in your prescription watersheds? Having monitored cobble embeddedness extensively on the Clearwater National Forest, I need to see more data before I’m convinced that you have an upward trend in any watershed. Also, it is very critical to know if the CE parameter was surveyed with the same methodology. If not, any comparison would be invalid. clarified that upward trend is not based on sediment/cobble embeddedness alone. Fisheries The presentation of data in Table 3-1 is confusing and may suffer from a comparison of “apples versus oranges.” The DEIS displays DFC tabular values (1987 vs. 2012) from Espinosa (1992). This comparison reflects improvement in habitat potential with two composite data points. Again, this is hardly an adequate set of time-series data. If you are going to use the DFC analysis, you need to tell the public what species, habitat variables, and channel types you are evaluating. There are differences especially with the sediment and temperature parameters. 08/12 Please see response to Comment #06/12 regarding upward trend. Cobble embeddedness data collected near the mouth of the streams listed in the table was the only part of the DFC analysis used (as directed by the Forest Plan which focuses on sediment- see Aquatics section in the FEIS). The model shows that for the channel types used (B and C channels), there was no difference between fish species in the DFC for cobble embeddedness; therefore we did not include separate data for each species (steelhead, chinook, cutthroat). Bull trout were not assessed separately due to the very low likelihood that they occur in watershed. Fisheries The DEIS states that no bull trout were observed in 1993 and 2007. Why haven’t more surveys been conducted since 2007? The public needs more information. How comprehensive were the surveys? What kinds of equipment and protocols were utilized? If potential improvement of bull trout habitat is occurring, we need to see the documentation. If the Clear Creek proposal is about restoration, we need to see the prospects and objectives to restore bull trout to the system. We also need similar information and data on the spring Chinook salmon. With a hatchery near the mouth of Clear Creek, it seems that there would be more of an effort to restore spring Chinook to the system. 08/14 We relied on the surveys conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service through the Idaho Supplementation Study ISS- (2009, 2012) and data collected at the Kooskia Hatchery at the mouth of Clear Creek (C.Bretz, personal comm.). The ISS (2012) provides an estimate of spring chinook escapement into Clear Creek. Many chinook are directed into the Kooskia hatchery and not allowed to move upstream to spawn. Some are released above the hatchery but it is only a small percentage of the total that enters the mouth of Clear Creek. Data on spring chinook would not reveal increased or decreased levels due to the trapping efforts of the hatchery.  We don’t believe that Clear Creek provides quality habitat for bull trout due to naturally higher than preferred temperatures (see Aquatics section of the FEIS). Fisheries The DEIS depicts a picture of perfection in the face of a large timber program. This is unrealistic. While it is commendable that you 08/15 The Clear Creek drainage did not experience road failures during the 1995-96 flood events. This in part due to the Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response are requiring “no harvest” PACFISH buffers, they are certainly not “fail-safe.” The Forest Service only has to consult their documentation of the 1995-96 storm event in the Clearwater Basin hat resulted in hundreds, if not thousands, of road failures and landslides in developed watersheds to refute the “fail safe” contention. During this storm, PACFISH/INFISH buffers (100-300 ft.) did not effectively stop significant sediment delivery from road failures and other mass erosion events. fact that only 11% of the area is considered landslide prone. That combined with the fact that the majority of roads were built near stable ridgetops or well into the headwaters of the drainage reduced the risk of road failures. Roughly 90% of the roads were field reviewed and only one recent road related slide was noted. Most road failures on the Clearwater NF resulted from midslope roads that had log culvert structures instead of pipes. Roads in the Clear Creek drainage do not contain log structures and are a low risk for failure (FEIS, Aquatics section). Fill cracks and other issues were noted during field surveys and are incorporated into the project design (road decommissioning or improvement). Fisheries According to the DEIS, a total of only 20 miles of NFS system roads exist within PACFISH buffers, and RHCAS have been minimally affected by past timber harvest activities. If this is the case, where did all the watershed and fish habitat degradation emanate from? The Middle Fork of Clear Creek still exhibits a high level of CE (55%) and a low level of habitat potential (55%). The mainstem channel of Clear Creek also exhibits high levels of habitat degradation (DEIS, p. 3-5). It would appear that the functionality of your buffer strips is limited. 08/16 The DFCs for aquatic habitat are a one-size-fits-all prescription; however streams do not always fit into those prescriptions. For example, there are many streams in unmanaged landscapes that don’t meet the DFCs for sediment, temperature, or wood on the Clearwater NF (Lochsa Subbasin Assessment- IDEQ 1999; various Clearwater NF stream habitat surveys). They do, however meet their beneficial uses based on both habitat and biotic factors (IDEQ, 1999 and 2010). As noted in the Aquatics section of the FEIS, even though embeddedness may be higher than desired, cutthroat densities were also high in Middle Fork and the mainstem of Clear Creek as well as Pine Knob Creek. This would indicate that conditions are suitable for good fish production. It is very likely that sediment levels may have always been higher than the DFCs; however no data exists prior to management activities in the drainage. Regarding the mainstem of Clear Creek, the table on pg. 3-5 shows that the stream has improved since 1987 and that substrate levels are approaching desired conditions (see FEIS Aquatics section). Fisheries Espinosa et al. (1997) documented the failure of bmps to adequately protect salmon habitat on the Clearwater National Forest. Decommissioning and building temporary roads will still generate and deliver sediment to streams in the short term—a relative period of 15 to 20 years (pp. 3-41-3-42). When you add sediment generated from skidding, yarding, and transporting of logs, the situation can hardly be described as “fail-safe” or no impacts. 08/17 This 1997 article looked at projects that did not implement PACFISH buffers, which have been required since 1995. PIBO monitoring was designed to address the long term effectiveness of PACFISH buffers. The preliminary data shows the buffers are effective in maintaining RMOs (FEIS, Aquatics section). Since 1997, when the article was published, many of the management recommendations in the article have occurred including: removal of riparian areas from the timber harvest base, Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response retention of roadless areas, validation of BMPs through monitoring, assessing cumulative effects at the watershed scale including private/state lands, removal of riparian roads, and emphasizing watershed restoration activities (in the case of Clear Creek, road improvement and culvert replacement). Recent monitoring indicates that no sediment is moving into streams from temporary roads, skid trails or yarding corridors and that sediment from road decommissioning and log haul activities is minor and limited as discussed in the FEIS. Fisheries all the logging allowed by mgt has increased the temperature of streams so that the fish are dying and dead too. 14/05 There is no indication that management activities on Forest Service lands have increased temperatures to the point where they are causing mortality to fish. Stream temperatures are within preferred limits for chinook salmon and cutthroat and steelhead trout. Summer temperatures are above those preferred by bull trout which is likely the reason that bull trout have not been found in the drainage (FEIS, Aquatics section). Also there are no streams on Forest Service land listed for pollutants (sediment or temperature) in the EPA approved 303(d)/305 (b)2012Integrated Report by IDEQ. All streams fully support beneficial uses (see FEIS and DEIS). Fisheries These habitat conditions will affect the macro invertebrate communities by reducing species richness, mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly presence, functional groups and evenness (high species dominance). In other words biointegrity of invertebrates and fish which depend on invertebrates for food will be significantly lowered. 18/02 The IDEQ uses both physical habitat and biological data (including insects) to determine if beneficial uses in the streams are being met. Streams north of the South Fork of Clear Creek and the mainstem of Clear Creek were assessed.IDEQ (2012) has determined that the streams meet their beneficial uses based on the presence of insects and fish. Additional information has been provided in the Aquatics section of the FEIS regarding beneficial uses. Fisheries I was the fisheries biologist on the Clearwater Ranger District in the late 80s and early 90s and supervised stream surveys for fish habitat, water quality in the Clear Creek drainage. I see no reference to these surveys, the stream survey report, or the Environmental Assessment that was prepared, signed and executed in your project area. My work and the work of my crew members can be found on file at the Clearwater Ranger District Office.

I do not see detailed surveys of existing fish habitat contained in this DE IS that clearly shows an improved condition, as you claim on page 3-5 of the DE IS. 23/03 The streams in Clear Creek do not have recent habitat surveys other than those observations made by the Fisheries Biologist and Hydrologist during field reviews between 2010 and 2012. This information was combined with recent cobble embeddedness and temperature data. Other information was also used to determine improved conditions in the watershed and have been included in the Aquatics section of the FEIS. Fisheries Table 3-1 in the DEIS is not correct. Forest Plan Water Quality Objective for South Fork Clear Creek should be 90% rather than 80%. I do not see adequate survey data reflected in Table 3-1 to support your statement of an improving trend in fish habitat water quality. 23/04 We reviewed all Forest Plan amendments and none could be found that changed the South Fork Clear Creek water quality objective from 80% to 90%. The standard remains at 80% as designated by the Forest Plan; however as shown in the DEISand FEIS, the South Fork is currently at 100% of potential which meets the objective. Please see previous response to Comment 06/12 regarding upward trend. Fisheries Section 3.1.6 Environmental Consequences states "Few if any direct effects would occur to fish or their habitat from implementing the action alternatives .... ". I believe this statement to be false. Unless culvert removal and replacement has magically improved from when I did it, replacement of 77 culverts will cause measurable impacts to ESA listed fish habitat. Removal of 17 stream crossings will likely have long term benefits but also have short term impacts. A copy of this letter will be sent to NOAA Fisheries. 23/06 As noted in both the DEIS and FEIS, road decommissioning and culvert replacements are the only activities that would directly affect streams. Data from recent monitoring is provided to show the extent (amount/distance/duration) of the potential effects. The effects would be short term and minimized by BMP implementation. Consultation with the regulatory agencies (NOAA/USFWS) is ongoing. Fisheries In summary, I believe this action is Likely to Adversely Affect ESA listed steelhead and chinook in the Clear Creek drainage. I believe your assumptions of "Few if any direct effects to fish is not supported by your existing condition surveys or by your NEZSED sediment analysis 23/08 The determination of effects for consultation with NOAA/USFWS is based on physical riparian and instream habitat parameters in combination with monitoring of similar activities within the Forest. It is only minimally based on the NEZSED model analysis which is only useful for comparing alternatives in the NEPA documents. Consultation with the regulatory agencies (NOAA/USFWS) is ongoing and a preliminary determination of Likely to Adversely Affect has been made and is specifically associated with road decommissioning and culver replacement activities. The direct, indirect and cumulative effects of the proposed action are discussed in the Watershed and Aquatics sections of the FEIS and supported by monitoring of similar activities. Fisheries Do not log in any watershed not meeting forest plan standards as it would harm fish habitat. 24/02 The BMPs associated with the proposed activities have been monitored for effectiveness on the Clearwater NF since Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response 1990 and show that logging has little effect on fish habitat. Roads have the greatest potential effect on streams. Reducing impacts from roads is part of the projects purpose and need (FEIS, Ch.1). The project conducts activities to reduce the effects to streams from road-related sediment. The Forest Plan allows harvest to occur in watersheds not meeting water quality objectives as long as an upward trend can be shown. Additional information on upward trend has been included in the FEIS. Fisheries I am not convinced by the data presented in the DEIS that imperiled fish species like chinook salmon will not be negatively affected by the large amount of road building and logging in the Clear Creek drainage. Logging is also proposed to occur above a fish hatchery operated by the Nez Perce. This hatchery is already struggling due to sediment load and increased temperatures. I am opposed to this project on my national forest. 25/01 The FEIS discusses the effects of the proposed actions which would reduce road densities and conduct road improvement activities to reduce road-related sediment effects to streams. Based on monitoring logging is expected to have minimal to no effects on stream temperatures and instream sediment (FEIS, Aquatics and Watershed sections). The project activities would benefit the hatchery as activities would reduce the potential for sediment delivery to streams from roads. No effects to stream temperatures are expected (see FEIS). Fisheries The DEIS indicates that sediment yield will increase in some of the smaller streams from 16-24% over existing condition. The NFMA analysis and the DEIS noted that sediment has been a limiting factor for many area streams. Based on the information provided in the DEIS, along with historic data, some CBC members encourage you to provide additional discussion on this issue. It is unclear how the Fishery Habitat Potential listed on page 3-6 of the DEIS in table 3-1 indicated that Fishery Habitat Potential is being met for the majority of streams in the project area. 27/27 The NEZSED model indicates an increase in sediment yield; however all levels remain well below the Forest Plan allowed levels of 30-60%. The NEZSED model is used to compare alternatives and does not reflect the actual sediment yields expected from the project (FEIS, Watershed section). Monitoring of timber sales on the Clearwater NF over the last 15 years has shown little to no sediment moving from logging units to streams. The Fishery Habitat Potential assessment is explained in the footnote below the table. Additional information on streams in the project area is provided in the FEIS in order to clarify this concern. Fisheries The DEIS alleges that the area is on an upward trend. How was this determined? The chart on page 3-6 has no recent cobble embeddedness information for the Middle Fork of Clear Creek and every measure except for one creek, is for one year only. How can trend be determined by one data point? The same chart shows fishery habitat potential for 1987 in increments of 10 percent, which suggests that they were estimates. Was this based on actual data? How can you compare 1987data, assuming it is real, and other data when the protocol for the measure was developed in 1992? What about PIBO data and cobble embeddedness? Isn’t this comparing apples and oranges? 28/07 A positive trend can be determined for current conditions using recent data. Please see response to Comment #06/12 regarding upward trend. PIBO data uses a “% surface fines” measurement which is then compared to the DFC chart for % surface fines found in the Espinosa DFC Analysis (1992). It is therefore appropriate to use the PIBO data since it is being compared to % surface fines and not to cobble embeddedness. Fisheries Furthermore, has the forest plan been amended 28/08 Forest Plan water quality objective Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response to include later monitoring protocols?

Cobble embeddedness and % surface fine data is still used to determine if the objectives are being met. Forest Plan Appendix A did not describe in enough detail how to determine whether objectives were being met. It is common for Forests to write “white papers” in order to more clearly interpret Forest Plan direction that may have been vaguely written.

How much of the area was actually inventoried? What about other rare species including Chinook salmon, Westslope cutthroat, Pacific lamprey and pearlshell mussel?

Please see response to Comment # 06/13 regarding fish presence/densities. Fisheries/Cumulative Effects It is extremely important the FS disclose the environmental baseline for watersheds. Generally, this means their condition before development or resource exploitation was initiated. For example, the baseline condition of a stream means the habitat conditions for fish and other aquatic species prior to the impacts of road building, logging, livestock grazing, etc. Therefore, proper disclosure of baseline conditions would mean estimates of stream stability, pool frequency conditions, and water temperature range—essentially the values of Riparian Management Objectives along with such parameters as sediment levels. When such information is provided, comparison with the current conditions (after impacts of development) will aid in the assessment of cumulative effects of all alternatives. 03/132 No stream habitat survey data is available for the project area prior to development activities which began in the 1930s. The cumulative effects of the action are based on the current existing conditions when combined with the expected direct and indirect effects of the proposed actions. The existing condition and expected effects are based on recent monitoring, field observations, and professional judgment as discussed in the FEIS.

Stream temperatures and sediment at Kooskia Hatchery increased to the point that many fish were killed. Although the Clear Creek Watershed has made some recovery over time, the hatchery continues to struggle with water quality and temperature issues from Clear Creek These issues have caused the hatchery to spend millions of dollars on a chiller system to achieve proper water temperatures and a new intake system to try and reduce the amount of sediment that flowed into the facility ponds and water supply infrastructure. temperatures naturally increase from headwaters down to the mouth due to stream widening and lessening riparian influence. Temperatures have been compared between the Forest boundary and the hatchery for 2 separate years to show how much is gained off of Forest Service lands (see FEIS Aquatics). Temperature data at the mouth of Clear Creek is also presented from 1962 which shows that temperature regimes prior to extensive harvest and the construction of the hatchery were similar to those occurring now. No stream temperature increases are expected as a result of the project due to PACFISH buffer retention. Proposed road-related activities are designed to reduce sediment in project area streams over the long term which would benefit the hatchery. Monitoring indicates little to no sediment entering streams from logging units due to PACFISH buffer retention and other design features (see FEIS). Fisheries/Hatchery/Cum Fx The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Hatchery Review Team identified several concerns related to Kooskia's water supply. First, the limited water availability and temperature fluctuations associated with surface water (Clear Creek) pose a fish health risk to spring Chinook Ich (parasite) infections occur annually, well water is currenty limited, and the temperature of Clear Creek water exceeds maximum guidelines for spring Chinook during the summer months. The hatchery depends on a water reuse system with well water makeup because of limited water availability. A water chiller also needs to be used to reduce the temperature of the reuse water to the desired temperature for spring Chinook during the summer. 21/03 see response to Comment #21/02 Fisheries/Monitoring Please disclose in the NEPA document the results of up-to-date monitoring of fish habitat and watershed conditions and how this project will affect the fish in the project area. 03/131 The discussion of habitat conditions and recent monitoring, as well as the expected effects to fish is discussed in the Aquatic section of the DEIS and FEIS. Fisheries/PACFISH The DEIS (Section 3.1.4) assumes that retaining PACFISH buffers will prevent all harvest-related sediment from reaching streams. Two references and a personal observation are given to support this claim, but neither reference is from the peer reviewed literature and includes a sampling design to test this claim. 06/08 The assumption is based on field observations and field-based BMP audits in the local area. The DEIS and FEIS (Aquatics section) both include the results of local BMP monitoring on the adjacent Clearwater NF (before, and since, PACFISH was implemented) and have been available to the public since that time. Results indicate very high implementation and effectiveness rates based on on-the-ground monitoring using standard protocols for the survey. Participants include the Forest Fisheries Biologist, Forest Hydrologist and Forest Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response Soils Scientist. Others that often attend include representatives from Idaho Dept. of Lands and IDEQ as well as District Rangers, ID team members and timber sale contract administrators.  PIBO monitoring, which is specifically tied to PACFISH implementation, is also cited. Results indicate fine sediments are decreasing in managed landscapes (USDA, 2009). The PIBO protocols used are scientifically rigorous and monitoring occurs throughout the entire Columbia River Basin.  The Bitterroot NF has also conducted similar monitoring of harvest specifically within buffers and has found no sediment delivery to streams (BNF, 2006). The results of these studies are discussed in the FEIS. Fisheries/PACFISH The Forest Service needs to provide peer reviewed literature to support their claim that sediment is not reaching streams from harvest activities due to PACFISH. 06/09 See response to Comment #06/08. Fisheries/PACFISH Section 3.1.5.2 Management Activities Affecting Streams begins by stating “PACFISH was designed to prevent adverse effects to listed fish species in the Columbia River drainage .... " In fact, PACFISH was designed to help RECOVER these ESA listed fish. The intent of PACFISH was to design projects that made things better for fish. I do not think that disturbing 120 miles of existing road, creating 36 miles of new temporary road, and cutting 60-80 million board feet of timber will do anything but bring these ESA listed fish closer to extinction. 23/05 We agree that PACFISH was designed to help recover ESA listed fish species. The proposed road improvement activities are is designed to reduce road-related sediment delivery to streams over the long term as would road decommissioning. As discussed in the FEIS, impacts to fish from these activities are expected to occur but would be short-term in nature due to BMP implementation. Not completing these activities is counter to the intent of PACFISH and the Nez Perce Forest Plan. As discussed in the FEIS, temporary roads would have no effect on streams based on recent monitoring, and timber harvest would occur over roughly a decade. PACFISH buffer implementation has proven effective in protecting streams. We expect this project to allow for the continued improvement of ESA listed fish habitat over the long haul. Fisheries/Tribe The Tribe appreciates that the OEIS includes a section on Tribal Treaty Rights. EIS at 1-18,19. While the Tribe appreciates the Forest Service's acknowledgment of the Tribe's 1855 Treaty and Tribal Trust responsibilities in this section, the agency should include additional evaluation how it upholds Tribal treaty obligations for this Project.

This would be both positive (for the hunter) and negative (for the elk). Project activities are not expected to negatively affect the Tribes’ ability to gather important plant species and may improve conditions for some of them (ex: huckleberries and mushrooms). Road decommissioning may limit access to some areas; however the benefits would be realized in stream habitat conditions. The Tribe has been an integral part of our road decommissioning program Forestwide. Fisheries/Upward Trend A claim is made in DEIS Section 3.1.5 and Table 3-1 that all streams in the project area (except for the mainstem and Middle Fork Clear Creek) are experiencing an upward trend in fish habitat conditions. According to the Nez Perce Forest Plan, timber harvest can only proceed in streams that are below Forest Plan standards if a positive upward trend is evidenced. All project areas streams were considered to be below their standards when the Forest Plan was signed. … 06/10 The Forest Plan allows harvest activities to occur in watersheds not meeting their water quality objective as long as an upward trend is occurring. The FEIS includes additional clarifying information regarding upward trend for Pine Knob, Middle Fork and the mainstem of Clear Creek. These are the only watersheds that don’t currently meet their objective. Fisheries/Upward Trend With the 1987 Forest Plan, the critical issue is cobble embeddedness (substrate sediment, p. 3-5 DEIS). In order to determine compliance with the Forest Plan objective, you need to compare 1987 CE levels (plus additional years) with the 2012 CE data (hopefully measured with the same technique) for a valid comparison. The DFC fisheries model was developed in the early 1990s. It is unlikely that data collected prior to the 1990s and used in the 1987 Nez Perce Forest Plan could validly be utilized in the DFC model derived from different survey methodologies on the Clearwater National Forest. In any case, there is simply not enough reliable data to document a convincing argument of upward trend and compliance with the Forest Plan objective. 08/13 The DFC model uses generally accepted salmon and steelhead habitat preference information that is still valid and applicable to habitat in the current decade. The accuracy of the sampling methodologies for cobble embeddedness and % fines, however, has improved since the model was developed. We feel the sampling methodologies are therefore acceptable. Information other than cobble embeddedness is used to make the upward trend determination for streams not meeting their objectives. This clarifying information has been included in the FEIS. Fisheries/Wildlife There is no way that fish habitat and stream quality as well as the forest wildlife will not by seriously impacted by such a huge increase in this timber harvest. 31/03 The Aquatics section of the FEIS analyzes the effects on fish and their habitat. The expected effects are based mostly on recent monitoring and field reviews, as well as professional judgment. The effects to wildlife are discussed in the FEIS. Grazing Where livestock are permitted to graze, we ask that you assess the present condition and continue to monitor the impacts of grazing activities upon vegetation diversity, soil compaction, stream bank stability and subsequent sedimentation. 03/130 Additional information regarding the existing condition and potential cumulative effects of continued grazing are included in the FEIS. No monitoring associated with grazing is included in the Clear Creek project but will likely, and more appropriately occur under the Eastside Allotment EA which is currently in process. Grazing It does not appear that the effects of cattle grazing have been incorporated into the 06/73 See response to Comment #03/130.

On page 3-44 of the DEIS it is suggested that “grazing impacts could increase over a period of up to 20 years”. How have grazing impacts been accounted for in the watershed analysis? potential increases in cattle grazing within harvested units where forage is expected to increase. No additional effects to streams are expected due to PACFISH buffer retention and the steep topography in a large portion of the area where cattle do not roam. Grazing What about impacts from grazing on watershed and fisheries? 28/15 See response to Comment #03/130, Grazing My next comment concerns the grazing allotments. For decades this has been poorly managed in the Clear Creek drainage, having some passed from one rancher to the next and poorly monitored or reported. Weeds are a problem and there are no checks or certifications concerning the cattle that are moved into the drainage. Weeds are a big problem everywhere and that being said I would think it necessary to have some restraint involved on where the cattle have been before being moved to the Forest and some monies added to the lease cost to administer these rules. Or, my suggestion is get rid of the leases if we're just pretending and get to managing them at a higher level if we aren't. 29/03 See response to Comment #03/130. While cattle can and do contribute to weed presence, it is difficult to separate their effects from vehicle traffic in the drainage which also spreads weeds. These comments are more appropriately addressed in the Eastside Allotment EA (currently in process) which can address seasons of use, weed free feeding requirements prior to turn on dates, and monitoring. The Clear Creek proposal was not designed to alleviate issues associated with cattle grazing. We have forwarded your comments to the Eastside Allotment EA team leader for consideration in that project. Harvest/Layout Similarly, what prescriptions protocol will be used for logging? Will the agency mark trees or will the company be allowed leeway in determining what trees to cut? How are issues such as the likelihood of blowdown in the regeneration logging units factored into the prescriptions? 28/43 As required by law, each harvest unit will have a prescription prepared by a certified Silviculturist. The prescriptions include marking guides that enable field crews to implement the desired treatment correctly. The Forest Service will mark leave trees for retention in regeneration harvest units. The commercial thin units will either be leave tree marked or treated with a designation by description provision in a stewardship contract. The contractor selects the trees based on the written description (preferred species, size, spacing) with oversite by the Forest Service. Blow down in regeneration harvest units will be treated as accumulation of large woody debris to meet the guidelines for moist habitat types as outlined in Graham et al. Heritage This document lacks any form of cultural resource section, let alone an actual analysis. These resources are fairly richly present in the lower end of the Clear Creek drainage, probably less so up higher. The absence of this analysis is inexplicable and also unforgiveable. 01/06 An effects analysis for Cultural Resources has been added to the FEIS. Heritage The DEIS does not analyze cultural resources. Are there no cultural resources in the project area? It is hard to imagine there are none in an area over 40,000 acres. 28/46 An effects analysis for Cultural Resources has been added to the FEIS. Heritage/Tribe I think there is a serious lack of scientific insight into the role of people in the environment – both for restoration purposes, and for future proposals.

I also think you should be working hand-in-glove with the Nez PerceTribe with both of these approaches, rather than simply doing periodic "informational" presentations. The public and tribe should be more involved from the beginning of this project, and certainly during implementation and future planning opportunities. Lindberg Lake/WUI Why does the project area boundary exclude the cabins on Lindberg Lake? They are in the Wildland Urban interface. Drawing the project boundary down the middle of Lindberg Lake seems like an attempt to gerrymander the cabins out so the Forest Service doesn’t have to include the impacts of the cabins in the project analysis. 03/102 There is no o Lindberg Lake in the project area. Logging Systems Additionally, the Forest should consider staggering activities within the smaller sub-watersheds through time, allowing units to begin recovery before conducting additional activities. This may be possible with thoughtful planning. As this project is a restoration activity, consideration should be given first and foremost to accomplishing tl1e goals with the least impact possible. 21/09 Staggered treatment areas will be considered to assist in improving watershed conditions where needed. Both the NEZSED and ECA models analyzed all activities as occurring at the same time, providing a worst case scenario.. Staggering activities in time and space will help reduce potential effects. Map/Fuels More importantly, the fuel/fire hazard situation post-project on land of all ownerships within the WUI must also be displayed on a map. 03/104 see response to comment 3/111 Map/WUI Since the project’s goals are to reduce the chances that fire will destroy private structures, and harm people, the current fuel/fire hazard situation on land of all ownerships within the WUI (at least the WUI that’s relevant to this area) must be displayed on a map. 03/103 see response to comments 3/110, 3/111, 06/20 and 3/107. Maps Disclose maps of the area that show the following elements: 1.

For example, there are no Forest Plan water quality monitoring stations in Clear Creek. The most recent monitoring reports have been added to the project file. Monitoring Disclose the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest’s record of compliance with the additional monitoring requirements set forth in previous DN/FONSIs and RODs on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest; 03/12 No monitoring requirements from previous documents in the Clear Creek area were found. Monitoring requirements for NEPA projects outside the area are outside the scope and have no bearing on the Clear Creek project. Monitoring While monitoring is directed for CFLRA projects, the Forest should be judicious in clearly defining the problem/issue to be monitored. Monitoring should be carefully designed to address ONLY the problem/issue. 13/26 We are currently assisting the CBC in development of the CFLRA monitoring plan and agree that monitoring needs to address current issues. Noxious Weeds Disclose the level of current noxious weed infestations in the Project area and the cause of those infestations; Disclose the impact of the Project on noxious weed infestations and native plant communities; 03/14 Current noxious weed inventories display a low level of infestations mostly confined to existing roads. Weeds typically disperse by seed from wind, water, animals, people, and machinery. The spread of noxious weeds would be mitigated by design criteria including chemically treating any noxious weed populations along the existing road systems before and after project implementation; monitoring and cleaning any equipment of loose debris prior to entering the Project area to prevent “new invader” weed establishment; and revegetating project –related exposed soils ) i.e. landings, skid trails, road sides, etc.) using certified noxious weed free native seed mix and fertilizer (as necessary ) upon project completion. All seeding would follow Region 1 guidelines. Noxious Weeds Is it true that noxious weeds are one of the top threats to biodiversity on our National Forests? 03/45 Yes, weeds are a threat to biodiversity on national forests in general. Since the current weed density is extremely low in the treatment area, there are no species being removed from the ecosystem and thus existing biodiversity would be maintained. Noxious Weeds How can the Forest Service be complying with NFMA’s requirement to maintain biodiversity if it has no legal standards that address noxious weeds? 03/46 NFMA implementing regulations have been recently revised (2012) and make it clear that the intent of meeting NFMA is focused at the planning unit level through implementation of the Forest Plan. There are no project specific NFMA requirements except to be consistent with applicable Forest Plans. Noxious Weeds Will this Project exacerbate existing noxious weed infestations and start new infestations? 03/60 Most of the current weed infestations occur along the road systems in the project area.

The FEIS has been updated to include a section on invasive plants in Chapter 3. Noxious Weeds Roads are often the first place new invader weeds are introduced. Vehicle traffic and soil disturbances from road construction and maintenance create ideal establishment conditions for weeds. Roads also provide obvious dispersal corridors. Roadsides throughout the project area are infested with noxious weeds. Once established along roadsides, invasive plants will likely spread into adjacent grasslands and forest openings. 03/75 We would agree that roads are often the primary spread vectors for weeds, however, we disagree that weeds often spread into adjacent areas, particularly in the forested and heavily vegetated areas that typify the Clear Creek project area. Weeds within Clear Creek are generally confined to roadways where they are easily inventoried and treated; or recently disturbed sites where their persistence is limited due to reforestation or revegetation by native plants. Noxious Weeds Please address the ecological, social and ascetic impact of current noxious weed infestations within the project area. Include an analysis of the impact of the actions proposed by this project on the long and short term spread of current and new noxious weed infestations. What treatment methods will be used to address growing noxious weed problems? What noxious weeds are currently and historically found within the project area? 03/78 The FEIS has been updated to provide an analysis of the impacts of the project in relation to the potential spread of noxious weeds Noxious Weeds Please include a map of current noxious weed infestations which includes knapweed, Saint Johnswort, cheat grass, bull thistle, Canada thistle, hawkweed, hound’s-tongue, oxeye daisy and all other Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 weeds classified as noxious in the MONTANA COUNTY NOXIOUS WEED LIST. 03/79 This project is not located in Montana. A map of the current infestations is included in the project record. Idaho’s noxious weeds are plant species that have been designated “ noxious” by law in the Idaho Code (title 22 chapter 24). There are 64 noxious weed species that make up the list. Canada thistle and spotted knapweed account for most of the current inventory. Noxious Weeds Are yellow and orange hawkweeds present within the project area? 03/80 There are 4 small populations of hawkweed (some orange, some yellow); 3 near Pine Knob drainage and 1 near the South Fork Clear Creek. All are along roads. The Weed Cooperative has been notified of their presence. Noxious Weeds Please address the cumulative, direct and indirect effects of the proposed project on weed introduction, spread and persistence that includes how weed infestations have been and will be influenced by the following management actions: road construction including new permanent and temporary roads, and skid trails proposed within this project; 03/81 The FEIS has been updated to provide an analysis of the impacts to the project in relation to the potential spread of noxious weeds. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response opening and decommissioning of roads represented on forest service maps; ground disturbance and traffic on forest service template roads, mining access routes, and private roads; removal of trees through commercial and pre-commercial logging and understory thinning; and prescribed burns. What open, gated, and decommissioned Forest Service roads within the project area proposed as haul routes have existent noxious weed populations and what methods will be used to assure that noxious weeds are not spread into the proposed action units? Noxious Weeds What commitment to a long-term, consistent strategy of application is being proposed for each weed infested area within the proposed action area? 03/82 The Forest is a cooperator in the Clearwater Basin Weed Management Area (CBWMA). Commitment to this partnership ensures that inventory, treatment and monitoring of identified priority areas are accomplished at a strategic level that transcends property boundaries and makes best use of manpower and resources. The CBWMA was formed in 1995 and will continue to be the forum for strategic management of invasive plants across the Clearwater Basin. Noxious Weeds Which units within the project area currently have no noxious weed populations within their boundaries? 03/85 A map of the current weed infestations is included in the project record. Although surveys may not have found an infestation in a particular unit, that does not mean there are no weeds in that unit. The majority of weeds are found along roads. Noxious Weeds What minimum standards are in the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest Plan to address noxious weed infestations? 03/86 The Forest Plan does not define any standards for noxious weeds; however we continue to conduct weed management under the Nez Perce Forest Noxious Weed Control Program Environmental Assessment (1988) and the (2009) Biological Opinion Endangered Species Act – Section 7 Consultation on the effects of the Nez Perce National Forest Noxious Weed Programmatic. Noxious Weeds The failure to include preventive standards violates NFMA because the Forest Service is not ensuring the protection of soils and native plant communities. 03/88 The design criteria common to all alternatives is found in the FEIS in Chapter 2. Noxious Weeds Additionally, the omission of an EIS alternative that includes preventive measures would violate NEPA because the Forest Service would fail to consider a reasonable alternative. 03/89 The FEIS considers a range of alternatives. The ROD will identify the environmentally preferred alternative. Noxious weed design criteria are the same for all alternatives. Noxious Weeds Local native vegetation has evolved with and is adapted to the climate, soils, and natural processes such as fire, insect and disease infestations, and windthrow.

There is no guarantee that the money needed for the present management direction will be supplied by Congress, no guarantee that this amount of money will effectively stem the growing tide of noxious weed invasions, no accurate analysis of the costs of the necessary post-treatment monitoring, and certainly no genuine analysis of the long-term costs beyond those incurred by site specific weed control actions. 03/126 The Forests have a very successful history of weed management through our participation as a cooperator in the Clearwater Basin Weed Management Area. Inventory and monitoring is done pre and post treatment so that effectiveness can be determined and inform future management options. Funds from the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program have allowed us to accelerate weed inventory, treatment and monitoring in this project area as well as across the greater 1.5 million acre Selway Middle-Fork project area. The CFLRP is a 10 year program and it is expected that many infestations will be in a custodial mode at the end of the program as a result of the additional funding. Noxious Weeds Please disclose how the productivity of the land been affected in the project area and forestwide due to noxious weed infestations, and how that situation is expected to change in the coming years and decades. 03/134 “Land productivity” in the context of your comment is rather qualitative and difficult to measure, however the Nez Perce – Clearwater Forests have been described as some of the most productive inland forests in the country. At that level, weed infestations are not having an effect on productivity nor will implementation of the project increase weed infestations to the extent that they will have an influence on land productivity. The FEIS has been updated to include an analysis of the impacts to the project in relation to the potential spread of noxious weeds. Noxious Weeds Will this Project exacerbate existing noxious weed infestations and start new infestations? 03/156 Please refer to comment as 3/60. Noxious Weeds The DEIS does not evaluate the impacts of the Project on the establishment, spread, and/or control of invasive plant species, referencing such issues only incidentally (pp. 2-9, 3-54, 3-76). The lower Selway River corridor is known to suffer from spotted knapweed invasion, among other species. It is important that this Project be designed and evaluated in ways which at least prevent, if not reverse, the spread of this and other invasive species. The DEIS currently affords little opportunity to evaluate the effect of the Project on these species. 21/12 The FEIS has been updated to include an analysis of noxious weeds. See response to comments 3/14 and 3/74. Spotted knapweed and Canada thistle account for the largest area of infestation in the project area, with most infestations occurring along roads. Design criteria are included in Chapter 2 to minimize the spread or introduction of noxious weeds. Noxious Weeds/Alternatives Please include an alternative in the DEIS that includes land management standards that will prevent new weed infestations by addressing the causes of weed infestation. 03/87 see response to comments 3/14 and 03/78. Noxious Weeds/BMP’s How effective have BMPs been at stopping (i.e. preventing) new weed infestations from starting during logging and related road operations? 03/42 BMP’s have had good success in stopping/preventing new weed infestations on the Moose Creek District. Early Detection Rapid Response (EDRR ) is key component in the Forest Service and State of Idaho’s effort to stop new Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response invaders before they become established populations. In 2005 a small isolated population of Yellow star thistle was reported to the Moose Creek District on one of our logging roads The spot was treated and retreated to kill off any seed. Monitoring indicates that n plants have ever come back to that site.. Noxious Weeds/Fire Prescribed burning activities within the analysis area would likely cumulatively contribute to increases to noxious weed distribution and populations. As a disturbance process, fire has the potential to greatly exacerbate infestations of certain noxious weed species, depending on burn severity and habitat type (Fire Effects Information System 2004). Soil disturbance, such as that resulting from low and moderate burn severities from prescribed fire and fire suppression related disturbances (dozer lines, drop spots, etc.), provide optimum conditions for noxious weed invasion. 03/76 The FEIS has been updated to include an analysis of the impacts to the project in relation to the potential spread of noxious weeds. Design criteria are included in Chapter 2 to reduce the spread of noxious weeds. Noxious Weeds/Forest Plan Will the Forest Service be considering binding legal standards for noxious weeds in its revision of the Nez Perce-Clearwater Forest Plan? 03/41 We cannot speculate on the final product of Forest Plan revision process that is currently underway. Until that time we are guided by the current 1987 Forest Plan. Noxious Weeds/Forest Plan Why isn’t the Forest Service considering a Forest Plan amendment in this Project to amend the Forest Plan to include binding legal standards that address noxious weeds? 03/44 Design criteria have been included in the project design to minimize the spread of noxious weeds. No amendment is needed. Noxious Weeds/Monitoring What long term monitoring of weed populations is proposed? 03/83 Long term monitoring is done in cooperation with the Clearwater Basin Weed Management Area, which includes partners from the Forests, State of Idaho, Idaho County, Nez Perce Tribe and private landowners. Periodic inventory of susceptible habitats and spread vectors is accomplished by field crews and data electronically uploaded to the Natural Resource Manager database. Treatments are also entered into this database. Access to this information ensures that managers can monitor population trends over time as well as treatment effectiveness. No specific monitoring of weed populations is proposed under the Clear Creek project. Noxious Weeds/Monitoring Please disclose the results monitoring of weed treatments on the NEZ PERCE-CLEARWATER NF that have been projected to significantly reduce noxious weed populations over time, or prevent spread. 03/138 Monitoring results of treated areas are entered into the FACTS database, and reports are periodically produced from the database to determine program efficacy. Noxious Weeds/Native Plant Restoration What native plant restoration activities will be implemented in areas disturbed by the actions proposed in this project? Will disturbed areas including road corridors, skid trails, and burn units be planted or reseeded with native plant species? 03/84 Only Native tree species would be planted after logging operations are complete (including skid trails) and native grasses would be planted in the grassland restoration areas. Noxious Is it true that new roads are the number one 03/43 The use of roads provides a vector for Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response Weeds/Roads cause of new noxious weed infestations? new weed invasions; however no new permanent roads would be constructed and all temporary roads would be obliterated after use so that they are not usable to motorized traffic. Design features would be implemented to reduce the risk of weed spread or new invasions. The greatest risk for new weed infestations is the loss of native plant habitat. By restoring and keeping native ecosystems intact we promote healthy plant communities that can better withstand invasive species. Noxious Weeds/Yellow Star Thistle While the proposal discusses treating weeds along the roads in the project area it does not mention other areas of weeds and concerns…. There is a large infestation of yellow star thistle in T31N R6E Sec 3 SE ., which is not near a road. The initial infestation was reported to the forest service about 11 years ago but it was never addressed. This is part of the area where prescribed fire treatment is planned. Fields studies have shown that fires are usually not severe enough to kill yellow star thistle seed and that fire stimulates germination of yellow star thistle seed in the soil seed bank, reduces competition in the plant community, reduces the thatch layer, and exposes mineral soil. Yellow star thistle plants that germinate following fire may grow larger and have more flower heads the following year. It has been suggested that heat from prescribed fire may stimulate germination of yellow star thistle seed in the soil. While fire can be an effective treatment of yellow star thistle it has to occur at the correct time in the life cycle and must be followed up with intensive management practices. Without these parameters yellow star thistle infestations will become worse, and the infestation could spread to other tracts scheduled for burning since the newly burned areas will be more susceptible to infestation. Given the mentioned lack of concern or treatment of the initial infestation in the area I am inclined to believe little or no follow up treatment will occur after the area is burned, let alone any “aggressive” treatment. 11/01 The district has no record of this initial infestation report. Current inventories do not show any large infestations in that Section. Idaho County Weed crews are currently treating the road systems in that area and have been made aware of this old report. Old Growth Disclose the current level of old growth forest in each third order drainage in the Project area; 03/19 The Forest Plan requires that old growth levels be described by Old Growth Analysis Areas (OGAA), not third order drainages.

The numbers were intended to be minimum screening criteria for possible old growth stands from the timber stand data base. According to the Green et al. 1992 the final determination of old growth status was to be made by a qualified ecologist or wildlife biologist. Strict reliance on data base queries from the timber stand database has been shown to give unreliable results in past court cases (Iron Honey Timber Sale, Idaho Panhandle National Forest – 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, 2004) and is no substitute for field investigation by qualified professionals. 06/04 All stands that are being proposed for treatment have been field checked by a certified Silviculturist and wildlife biologist. During field verification many stands were removed from consideration for treatment due to the fact that field verification revealed that they currently meet the definition of old growth. During project development additional stands were field verified as old growth. Old Growth Your old growth analysis is somewhat difficult to understand. You have a long discussion on unverified old growth, but it is unclear how these stands fit into your old growth retention strategy. The difference between unverified old growth and verified old growth is unclear and there is no discussion on the methods that were used to determine the stands in each category. 06/29 The unverified old growth appears to meet old growth definitions based on legacy data but was never verified on the ground. Old Growth You also indicate that old growth blocks are supposed to be over 50 acres in size according to the Forest Plan, but yet 42% of the stands you have selected are less than 50 acres in size. You suggest that PACFISH buffers connect these areas, but make no mention of the condition of these buffers and do not consider that narrow connecting buffer strips may place some species at risk. The Forest plan suggests large old growth patch sizes of over 300 acres to avoid edge effects and vulnerability of species that may be attracted to these areas. 06/30 Figure 3-1 is a map showing vegetation successional stages within riparian habitat conservation areas (RHCAs) in the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project area. When combined with Figure 3-7, which is a map showing verified and unverified old growth in the project area, you can see where the two overlap. PACFISH buffers would be managed for old growth over the long-term which means in time there would be a minimum of 10,700 acres of old growth, all of which would be connected over time. Also the 9,200 acre Clear Creek Roadless Area will provide a large security minimize edge effect for wildlife species over the long term. Old Growth You state that you have used the Green et al. (1992) guidelines (Inappropriately cited as Green et al. 2008) for identifying old growth. However, you fail to mention that the Green et al. 1992 numbers are just screening criteria to identify possible old growth stands. It is suggested in Green et al. 1992 that stands be field verified by a qualified ecologist or biologist to confirm old growth status. Has this 06/31 See the response to 06/04. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response been done? Old Growth You suggest that up to two miles of temporary road will be built in old growth stands under alternatives B and C, and one mile on Alternative D. However, you dismiss these impacts and suggest “the effects would be indistinguishable when compared to natural diversity and openings in old-growth habitats”. Excuse me! A straight line road corridor, even if it has been perfectly re-contoured is still going to look like a rehabbed road prism rather than a natural opening in an old growth stand. 06/32 This comment portrays the temporary road construction as a single road through a single stand. The EIS clearly states that the average length is 0.1 miles in 17 road segments in Alternative B & C, and 13 segments in D with an average opening size 0.4 acres. This is similar to natural gap development that occurs as stands in stem exclusion stage progress towards the old growth stage. Old Growth While the timber interests will make great profits, the old growth trees should be more protected and the forest should be sustainable…Consider preservation of this resource for generations to come 07/01 Old growth has been identified and will not be harvested during implementation of this project. Old Growth Discuss old growth by geographic area (not timber compartment/sub-compartment). Based upon the stand exam data collected in the analysis area, the term ‘unverified old growth’ is unclear as to why/what this refers. What is important to disclose is the plan actions will treat some old growth to reduce the threat of uncharacteristic fire removing these stands. 13/23 See response to comments 03/19, 06/24, and 6/29. You are correct; treatments within old growth are designed to reduce fire effects which would help to retain old growth on the landscape. Old Growth all old growth should be untouched 14/01 No old growth will be harvested with this project. Old Growth is there, in fact, zero old growth left? 14/04 Currently there are 4,654 acres of verified old growth within the project area as noted in the DEIS on pg. 3-66. Old Growth The Forest Service must not allow logging of any old-growth forest here. 20/02 No old growth will be harvested with this project. Old Growth I am concerned with the impacts to old growth, as well as fragmentation of forested areas. 22/03 See response to comment 06/32. Impacts to old growth are associated with by temporary road construction. This project was designed to reduce fragmentation by creating larger patches that better represent natural patterns (FEIS, Ch. 1). Old Growth There need to be alternatives that do not involve logging in old growth habitat. Logging to improve old growth habitat creates its own problems-removing trees impacts flora and fauna. 22/06 No old growth will be harvested with this project. Improvement harvest on 330 acres is designed to retain the large trees and reduce the risk that they would be lost in a wildfire (DEIS, pg. 2-7). Old Growth Do not cut any old growth trees as it would be in violation of the Forest Plan and would harm public lands and degrade wildlife habitat. 24/01 See response to comments 07/01 and 22/06. It would not be a violation of the Forest Plan as the Forest currently meets its requirements for old growth (DEIS, pg 3-65 Old Growth Harvest of "old growth" timber remnant in the area should be discouraged, as that remnant should serve as a model for the vegetative succession we would like to see. 26/03 See response to comment 22/06 Old Growth Finally, while we understand that the proposal amends the old growth definition consistent with best available science, the FEIS should describe how the project “fully maintains the structure and composition of old growth stands (according to the pre-fire suppression character appropriate to the forest type).” 27/07 This is discussed in the Vegetation section of the FEIS. Also see response to comment 22/06. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response Old Growth Green et al. was not designed to replace either a forest plan definition or field work. It was designed as a screening protocol to aid in the identification of old growth stands. Why amend the forest plan here and not everywhere on the forest? This creates a serious policy problem. 28/22 See response to comments 21/15 and 06/03. The Forest Supervisor has decided not to do a forestwide amendment at this time. Old Growth The actual amount of old growth is a serious question. Have field surveys by qualified ecologists been done to identify the old growth stands? If not, did ecologists or foresters conduct the stand exams? How can old growth function when only 16% meet the preferred size criterion? Are all PACFISH buffers indeed intact and creating connectivity? 28/23 See response to comments 06/04 and 06/30. Old growth exists where it does based on topography, moisture and past fire regimes. Old Growth why will some old growth forests be logged? It seems that alternatives should have been adopted that don't log in old growth . 31/02 See response to comments 13/23 and 22/06. Old Growth We should not be logging old growth forest. 32/01 See response to comments 13/23 and 22/06. Old Growth/Age Classes I saw a table in the EIS that listed how what percent of the project area was in the >21" DBH category. I got a feeling that after 30 years 80% of the area will be in that category. With your rainfall, I got a feeling that the "60's clearcuts" will be in that category in 30 years. 05/06 The project area in general is trending towards older bigger trees. This assumption is correct. Old Growth/Design Criteria Design Criteria #4 states “old growth will be treated with improvement harvest.” Instead, we suggest that this element be restated “old growth could be considered for improvement harvest. It should be made clear that improvement harvest would not remove large trees and that existing old growth stands would continue to meet old growth criteria after harvest. 27/22 Your clarification is correct, old growth trees will not be harvested, however ladder fuels in the understory will be removed to reduce the risk of loss of large trees during a wildfire. Old Growth/Design Criteria Specific contract provisions (C2.3 and C6.32) should be disclosed, or a link provided with details on how snag retention will be implemented. 27/23 The design criteria in Chapter 2 describes in detail how trees will be selected for retention. Old Growth/Roads How is the creation of roads in old growth protection? This would actually negatively affect the stands by creating more edge effect, which is known to harm species such as cavity nesters. 28/25 See response to comment 03/62.Ample snags are expected to be retained in untreated areas including PACFISH buffers and the Clear Creek Roadless Area. Philosophy Disclose when and how the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest made the decision to suppress natural wildfire in the Project area and replace natural fire with logging and prescribed burning; Disclose the cumulative impacts on the Forest-wide level of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest’s policy decision to replace natural fire with logging and prescribed burning; 03/31 It is not clear what “decision” the commenter is referring to. However, the purpose and need and proposed action are consistent with programmatic direction in the Nez Perce Forest Plan. The Nez Perce Forest Plan includes goals, objectives and standards related to fuel reduction which are outlined in the FEIS. The project is designed to move the area toward those goals and the project is consistent with applicable standards. The Forest Plan is clear that the standards are intended to supplement, not replace, the National and Regional Policies, standards and guidelines found in Forest Service Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response manuals and handbooks (USDA 1987, p. II-14). The project is consistent with national and regional priorities for treating wildland urban interface areas and addressing firefighter and public safety. The description of alternatives in Chapter 2 of the FEIS discloses that 1,371 acres of prescribed burning are included in all action alternatives. The proposed treatments do not emphasize fuel conditions over ecological processes. Rather, the alternatives address the purpose and need for action. The alternatives are designed to balance competing interests. The existing condition for forest health, fuel conditions and economics is included in Chapter 3 of the FEIS. Forest health is discussed in the analysis and there will be some benefit by improving forest resiliency. The FEIS discusses insect and disease activity in the project area.  The spatial boundary for the cumulative effects analysis is defined by resource in Chapter 3. In accordance with NEPA direction, the effects analysis is limited to potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts from the proposed action and alternatives. Philosophy/Fire Specifically analyze the decision to prioritize mechanical, human-designed, somewhat arbitrary treatments as a replacement for naturally-occurring fire. 03/39 See the response to 03/31. Philosophy/Forest Plan Disclose and address the concerns expressed by the ID Team in the draft Five-Year Review of the Forest Plan regarding the failure to monitor population trends of MIS, the inadequacy of the Forest Plan old growth standard, and the failure to compile data to establish a reliable inventory of sensitive species on the Forest; 03/28 Monitoring data that has been collected for the project area has been added to the project file to address this concern.  Public Involvement/CBC Conclusion: I'm impressed with the whole "collaborative" nature of this project. I'm impressed that the Idaho Conservation League is on board with it. I read the "collaborative website," and I'm impressed with the wide range of participants. 05/19 Thank you for your observations. We feel that up front involvement with a broad range of partners will ultimately lead to improved management of our Forests. Public Involvement/CBC In general, our comments and concerns will be contained in the joint comments submitted on behalf of the Clearwater Basin Collaborative that will be submitted Monday, June 3. We do have some questions with regards to water quality, temporary roads, wildlife, old growth/large tree retention, and soils and are confident that these issues will be further discussed and disclosed in the FEIS. In general, we feel that our concerns are appropriately disclosed in the CBC comments. 19/01 Your comments were received and will be addressed through that comment letter. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response Public Involvement/Collaboration This project, and its collaborative development, represents the beginnings of a fundamental shift in the way the Forest Service is approaching timber management activities. The use of timber harvest as a tool for landscape level ecological restoration, as opposed to ecological restoration as a justification for timber harvest, may seem like a small change in semantics, but it has broad implications for management changes on the ground. For example, this project proposes both variable retention harvest methods and the landscape patch concept as a basis for treatment design. Both of these strategies put ecological need at the forefront, while using harvest and prescribed fire to meet those needs. 17/01 We appreciate you observations and concur. The ID team spent a great deal of time examining the ecological need across the landscape while at the same time assessing the tools at our disposal to create the desired conditions. We are fortunate to have a viable and competitive timber at our disposal, making harvest a viable tool that can also benefit the rural economies in the basin. We are also fortunate that the value of our timber can generate funds to be put back into other restoration projects across the Forests, a point that is extremely significant as budgets continue to decline. Rare Plants Disclose the results of the field surveys for threatened, endangered, sensitive, and rare plants in each of the proposed units; 03/13 The FEIS has been updated to include an analysis of the impacts to the project in relation to threatened, endangered, sensitive and rare plants Rare Plants Spring and early summer burns could negatively impact emerging vegetation and destroy annual plant seed. 03/91 Please see response to comment #03/13 Rare Plants What threatened, endangered, rare and sensitive plant species and habitat are located within the proposed project area? 03/92 Please see response to comment #03/13 Rare Plants What standards will be used to protect threatened, rare, sensitive and culturally important plant species and their habitats from the management actions proposed in this project? 03/93 Please see response to comment #03/13 Rare Plants Describe the potential direct and indirect effect of the proposed management actions on rare plants and their habitat. 03/94 Please see response to comment #03/13 Rare Plants Have sensitive plant species been surveyed in the area? Will they be surveyed before implementation of this project? Given the massive scale, how will sensitive species be protected? 28/42 Please see response to comment #03/13 Rare Plants/Fire Will prescribed burning occur in the spring and early summer; please give justifications for this decision using current scientific studies as reference. 03/95 Landscape burning would generally occur during drier weather patterns in the mid to late summer or early fall. We attempt to ignite these fires at times that mimic natural processes. Burning of slash piles in harvest units may, however occur during the spring, early summer or late fall periods in order to prepare sites for reforestation. Rare Plants/Tribe The DEIS fails to evaluate the impacts of the Project on plant species proposed for or currently listed under the Endangered Species Act or those classified as Sensitive Species by Region 1 of the Forest Service. In addition, the DEIS fails to evaluate the impacts of the Project on plant and fungi species considered culturally important to the Tribe, including huckleberries, various Lomatium spp., and edible mushrooms. It is important that this Project be designed and evaluated in ways which are sensitive to species 21/11 Please see response to comment #03/13. Burning is expected to improve conditions for morel mushrooms and logging appears to improve huckleberry growth for a couple of decades after harvest or until the overstory closes in and shades out the plants. Lomatium is found in rock outcrops and open habitats. Timber harvest and prescribed fire activities are likely to improve habitat for this species. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response such as these. The DEIS currently affords little opportunity to evaluate impacts to these resources. Recreation/Design Criteria The Clear Creek Trail #723 will be impacted by this project. A commercial thinning unit is within the trail corridor. We are concerned about the effects the commercial thinning will have on the Clear Creek Trail. The following design features helps to protect this trail and other trails in the project area. 1. As a part of the planning process, consider designing trail corridors to protect the integrity of the trails (i.e. do not harvest timber in the trail corridor). 2. Relocate the trails around the logging activity on either a temporary or permanent basis. 3. Provide recreationists on the trails with an alternate route around the sale during the logging activity. 4. Require in the sale contract that trails be re-established upon completion of the logging. 16/02 The design criteria in Chapter have been updated to address this concern.  Recreation/Design Criteria There are other design features that can be successfully used to allow some recreation use while the logging operation is going on. These features include not allowing weekend and holiday logging, only working on one section of the project area at a time, and removing fallen timber from the trail tread before weekend use starts….The district staff should also not allow timber skidding down the trail corridor. Skidding can widen the trail and encourage ATV use on a single-track trail. Most important is the protection of the switchback on the trail. These facilities are difficult to construct and can be several damaged by skidding activities. 16/03 The design criteria in Chapter have been updated to address this concern.  Recreation/Design Criteria The draft EIS noted on page 3-32, that the South Fork of Clear Creek Trail #130 and the Trapper Creek Trail #728 would be temporarily affected during the implementation of the prescribed fire. Prescribed fires and wildfires can negatively impact trails. The increase water flow after the fire can wash out the trail tread. Fire-killed trees can fall into the trail corridor, blocking access….The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest needs to clear the trail corridor of hazard trees after the prescribed burns. The forest should also clean out all water control devices such as water bars and drain dips to accommodate the increased water flow. These two design features will help protect these trails from the impacts of the prescribed burn. 16/06 Trails and trail structures that are impacted during prescribed burning operations will be returned to their original operating condition.  Road Decommissioning Decommissioning of 13.2 miles in this project is addition to the previous decommissioning of 85 miles and is of grave concern. Have future fire and timber access along with local use been fully considered? lt appears that the proposed action (pg 1-7) speaks to 2-5 miles of decommissioning yet the alternative are at 13.2 miles. 04/04 The ID team reviewed all roads in the project area for future needs. Timber, Fire, Silviculture, Recreation, Fisheries, Wildlife, and Hydrology were all involved and made recommendations for each road. Those not needed for future management were recommended for decommissioning. The 2-5 miles was the original proposed action that was scoped Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response prior to the completion of the full roads analysis. The roads analysis found 13.2 miles of road not needed in the future. Roadless The one exception--the small remnant roadless area--is not being proposed for any form of road construction or commercial activity, which makes sense to me. 01/03 No response required Roadless Some fire ignitions are planned in this small part of the planning unit. That seems likely a really fine idea to me, and does NOT violate the Idaho Roadless Area rule. 01/10 No response required. Roadless Disclose how Project complies with the Roadless Rule; 03/32 The Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project lies entirely within the state of Idaho. All management activities proposed for the project are consistent with the requirements of the 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule. The FEIS discusses the Idaho Roadless Rule in detail in various sections throughout Chapters 2 and 3. Roadless Please utilize the NEPA process to clarify any roadless boundary issues. It is not adequate to merely accept previous, often arbitrary roadless inventories—unroaded areas adjacent to inventoried areas were often left out. Additionally, there is a lot of public support for adding unroaded areas as small as 1,000 acres in size to the roadless inventory. 03/128 The 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule confirmed the geographic boundaries and clarified management direction for roadless areas within the state of Idaho. Roadless The Clear Creek Roadless Area is a relatively small roadless tract, which is bordered by private holdings. In my mind this makes it a very valuable, both to wildlife of all species and to humans seeking quiet solitude and nature. This is a rare area that is close to home and accessible year round. In our neighborhood it has the first wildflowers and abounds in wildlife and bird sightings. 11/04 All management activities proposed for the project are consistent with the requirements of the 2008 Idaho Roadless Rule. Roadless The DEIS states that no logging would occur in the roadless area. However, the maps are not so clear. Furthermore, the DEIS does not analyze whether any land contiguous to the roadless area is indeed roadless. Since many logging units border the roadless area, this is a major failure of the DEIS to consider whether any contiguous areas might be affected. Case law in Kettle Range Conservation Group v.USFS makes it clear the on-the-ground situation is what determines roadless nature of an area, not past analyses or documents or faulty inventories. 28/44 The roadless analysis and maps have been updated in the FEIS to address this concern. Roadless/Wilderness this entire site should get wilderness designation for protecting species. 14/06 The U.S. Forest Service does not have the authority to designate Wilderness. Roads Alternatives B and C propose a LOT of "temporary" road building, and also have a more severe impact on sediment production that Alternative D--and without vastly more in the way of commercial outputs either. 01/07 Alternatives B and C propose 36 miles of temporary road, compared to Alternative D that proposes 18 miles (DEIS, page 3-39). The FEIS document watershed and soils sections were updated to further describe effects from temporary roads. The economic impact of using less roads in alternative D is an 18 to 28% reduction Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response in volume outputs and acres treated and a $1.5 million to $2.4 million reduction in revenue generated, in part due to higher logging costs. Roads This timber sale once again reflects Brazell’s obsession with road construction in spite of the fact there is no manmade action in the forest that causes more long-term ecological damage. Since Brazell started to mismanage the Nez Perce/Clearwater National forests in 2009 his timber sales will construct and reconstruct 544.2 miles of road. 02/04 No new permanent roads would be constructed under this project. Only temporary roads would be built and then obliterated within 1-2 years of construction. In addition 13.2 miles of system roads would be decommissioned. This is in addition to the 85 miles already being decommissioned. Road reconstruction and culvert replacement is designed to reduce road-related impacts to streams. Doing no road improvement runs counter to the Forest Plan and PACFISH direction. Roads Disclose the current, during-project, and post-project road densities in the Project area; 03/09 Overall road densities and road densities within the RHCAs are presented in the DEIS and the FEIS for pre- and post- activities. Temporary roads and non-system roads are not included in the road density calculations. Roads Will this Project address all Project area BMP needs, i.e. will the BMP road maintenance backlog and needs from this Project all be met by this Project? 03/47 Proposed road improvements would allow for the majority of road backlog to be maintained. Most of roads are currently in stable shape (Aquatics section, FEIS). As outlined in the DEIS Appendix B, all roads used for timber harvest will be brought up to standards to meet BMP objectives Roads Any desire to keep a road in the project area WUI must be in harmony with the alleged priority goals (again, to reduce the chances that fire will destroy private structures and harm people), not driven by timber production goals. The analysis must show how all roads will in fact be in harmony with the priority goals. 03/115 A transportation analysis has been completed for the project area. It designated which roads were needed based on input from all resource specialists, including consideration for watershed enhancement, fire protection and vegetation management. Roads In section 3.1.6.2.1 it is documented that non-system roads were not included in the road density calculations, but in numerous locations of the DEIS road density is used to document watershed condition (NOAA 1998) and impacts to wildlife. For example, in the following Section 3.1.6.2.2 it is suggested that the RHCA road density for the entire Clear Creek watershed would move from 2.2 mi/mi2 (poor condition) to 2.0 mi/mi2 (moderate condition). What would road density be if non-system roads were included? 06/18 Most of the non-system roads are old skid trails or jammer roads that have been re-vegetated and do not have stream crossings. There is no motorized use on these roads. All non-system roads in the South and West Forks of Clear Creek are currently being decommissioned as a result of previous NEPA. The proposed Clear Ridge Non-system Road Decommissioning Project (to be scoped in the Spring of 2014) would address the remaining non-system roads in the rest of the drainage. After completion of the project, road densities will be as shown in the DEIS and FEIS. Roads In section 3.2.6.2 it is suggested that timber sales could be active for 13 years (8 years of harvest and 5 years of post-sale activity). I wonder if “temporary” roads will be open this long? The DEIS only states that they will be closed after use (Section 2.2.6.2) and does not 06/21 Design Criteria #10 describes how temporary roads would be decommissioned.

Temporary roads should be closed and re-contoured immediately after logging and not be allowed to remain open during the winter and spring to reduce erosion risk. Please clarify what will happen to temporary roads in the FEIS. immediately after their use for logging. They are not intended to be kept open for post-harvest/reforestation activities. Roads It is unclear if non-system roads have been included in the table 3-34 as previous discussion (DEIS page 3-14) suggests they have been excluded. 06/70 The road densities in Table 3-34 do not include non-system roads. The 10 miles of decommissioning noted in the tables footnote associated with the SF/WF Road Decommissioning Project are system roads. Roads The DEIS includes no summarization of past decisions and if there are additional opportunities for road closure and obliteration in the project area. If current watershed conditions could be improved such actions should be considered. 06/71 The existing condition includes all past road obliteration activities. The DEIS and FEIS describe the proposed project activities as well as the foreseeable Clear Ridge Decommissioning project. A full interdisciplinary roads analysis was completed and no further roads are proposed for decommissioning. Road closures/access were not addressed. Roads Our staff was pleased to see that none of the roads proposed for decommissioning are designated for motorized use either on a year round or seasonal basis. The project will not have a long term impact on designated motorized routes. 16/05 Most of the roads proposed for decommissioning have been impassable to motorized vehicles, due to brush, for a long time. Roads There should have been alternatives that do not involve building new roads. 22/07 See response to 12/03. Roads Some CBC members felt strongly that the lack of site-specific watershed impacts resulting from temporary road construction negated the need to further consider Alternative D, the reduced temporary roads alternative. There is widespread appreciation that none of the temporary roads cross water and are generally located on ridge tops, away from Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas. There was also discussion about how the lack of temporary roads could in fact increase impacts as a result of an increased number of excavated skid trails. Also, limiting the use of temporary road would reduce treatment acres resulting in a reduction of the vegetation objectives that would be met. CBC recommends the FEIS strengthen discussion and analysis of expected, or lack of expected, detrimental effects from temporary roads, road reconstruction, decommissioning and other road-related management activities. CBC members recognize that to access the suitable timber acres on the forest requires the existence of a well maintained system road network and strategic use of well-located temporary roads in order to provide access for treatment, while avoiding or minimizing detrimental watershed effects. A clear explanation of how this will be accomplished is 27/08 Ridge top / no water crossing temporary road locations have been an important consideration to minimize watershed impacts. Monitoring has also been conducted to verify these impacts. The FEIS document watershed and soils sections were updated to further describe effects from temporary roads. The Aquatics section has been updated with additional discussions on road improvement effects.  Implementation of Alternative D would have some additional soil impacts over not using a temporary road due to long skidding distances and trail excavation, which has been analyzed and still meets resource objective. As mentioned in the comment, a big impact is the loss of treatment areas, which equates to reduced objective accomplishments along with reduced income to the community and reduced revenue to complete other rehabilitation objectives.   Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response critically important so that the project can be implemented to achieve the purpose and need, and to build understanding and support for appropriate road management activities. Roads Roads are a big concern. How does the DEIS meet the direction to establish a minimum road system? How can roads be considered temporary when they will be on the landscape for up to 13 years? 28/12 A transportation analysis was conducted on the project following guidelines to determine a minimum road system. This resulted in about 100 miles of roads to be proposed for decommissioning, including the SF/WF Clear Creek Roads EA. Temporary roads would be used for harvest and then decommissioned either the year they are being used or the year after. If held over for the winter, they will be waterbarred to reduce erosion and prevent access by motorized vehicles. The Roads We should not be building new roads in this watershed. 32/02 New road construction is being limited to temporary roads that have a limited (1-2 years) life span and then are recontoured. Approximately 9.0 miles would be located on existing disturbed soils (old skid trails or jammer roads). In addition, the temporary roads are located in areas that have been determined to not have a watershed impact. The effects of temporary roads are discussed in the FEIS. Roads The DEIS includes information on the "prescription watershed" area, road density, road name and proposed activity in Table 3-38 that lists estimated reduction in road density from activities and Appendix B "Clear Creek Road Work." All of the watersheds include road densities above the recommended <I mi/mi2 to achieve a "good" watershed condition. The proposed decommissioning would result in a 16% reduction of roads from riparian habitat conservation areas and reduce densities in RHCAs to 1.0 mi/mi2. We support this effort and commend the Forest for the robust ongoing efforts (including past projects) to reduce road density, particularly in RHCAs. However, it is unclear how the proposed activities support the overall goal to reduce road density in the watershed and whether or not there are opportunities to minimize proposed road construction activities (e.g., similar to Alternative D) while still meeting the project purpose. The effects analysis related to roads is included in the Watershed Section, Section 3.8. The effects and cumulative effects are combined for all action alternatives. Therefore, it is unclear how impacts from Alternative D (reduced road construction) differ from the other alternatives. To better illustrate this topic, we recommend including a map of the prescription watershed, harvest treatments, and proposed road activities for each alternative. 33/02 The FEIS document was updated to address this concern. Please see the Watershed section direct effects analysis. Temporary roads are not considered in road density calculations since they are built and decommissioned within 1-2 years. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response We also recommend that the EIS include a discussion of how minimizing road construction would reduce potential impacts to the watershed. Roads/Decommissioning Are there opportunities to put one or more system roads into storage (watershed stable/closed to motorized access) not needed for timber harvest re-entry in the next 2+ decades? 13/28 No roads were proposed for storage during the interdisciplinary roads analysis. Most are currently stable and many are needed for the Clear Project. It is possible that storage could be proposed after the project is complete but would require separate NEPA. Roads/Decommissioning One of the action items common to all alternatives is 13.2 miles of system roads will be decommissioned. Frequently with these projects on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest, the amount of roads proposed for decommissioning is common to all action alternatives. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest needs to start provide a range of road decommissioning across the range of alternatives. For example, one alternative could do the vegetation treatment without decommissioning roads. 16/04 It is the goal of the Forest to decommission all roads not needed for future management (recreation, timber, silviculture, fire, administration are all considered). Road maintenance costs are increasing and budgets for maintenance are being reduced. Through decommissioning we can focus our budget focused on those roads most used by the public and the agency. An alternative that doesn’t decommission any roads was not considered in detail, because it would not meet the project purpose and need and it would not follow National direction to develop a minimum transportation system. Roads/Decommissioning there is broad support for the proposed decommissioning of unnecessary roads that are included as part of this project, and those that were recently approved as part of the South and West Forks Clear Creek Road Decommissioning Decision Notice. 27/10 Thank you. Road decommissioning has been an integral part of watershed restoration and in meeting National direction for developing a minimum roads transportation plan. Roads/Decommissioning Design Criteria #10 suggests that existing temporary road templates would be treated differently than newly constructed temporary roads. The CBC suggests that all temporary roads, whether existing or newly constructed, should be scarified, decompacted and decommissioned. 27/21 The differences between decommissioning the existing prism temporary roads and the newly constructed ones is related to how stable the soils is and how established the vegetation is. Some of these old roads are on ridge tops and are stable with revegetated fill slopes and cutbanks. To completely recontour them would promote unnecessary soil exposure and potential watershed impacts. The objectives on the old roads will be to make sure they are hydrologically stable and that they will grow trees, which means some could be recontoured while others will just be decompacted.. Roads/Noxious Weeds The actual of the local National Forests in genuinely putting an end to temporary roads is not great, and weed invasion on such sites has also been a real and continuing problem 01/08 The Forest recently has an excellent record of obliterating temporary roads so that they are not available for motorized travel. While weeds may invade, they typically survive only until the young trees shade them out. The addition of large wood and duff from the areas surrounding the roads has improved the re-establishment of native plants better than just grass seeding the area. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response Sensitive Plants There is no mention in the DEIS of possible effects on several sensitive plant species. Have any surveys been conducted for these species and what were the results of that work? How will sensitive plants be impacted by the proposal? 06/74 Please see response to comment #03/13. Information has been added to the FEIS. Silvicultre/Design Criteria Are there no Design Criteria specific to vegetation management (timber harvest; grass/shrub restoration)? 13/27 There are no specific design criteria other than meeting forest plan standards and guidelines, meeting the requirements under the National Forest Management Act, and compliance with USFS Manual and Handbook direction. The design criteria in Chapter 2 of the DEIS and FEIS do describe what vegetation is to be retained. Grassland restoration is described in the DEIS, pg. 3-39. Silviculture Regeneration has rarely been a problem here, so I think that you can safely argue that region is suited for all of the new actions being proposed. 01/02 The Nez Perce Forest Plan 2012 Monitoring report states that there is currently an 80% success rate in certification of stands being fully stocked within the 5 years required following regeneration harvest. The additional 20% is due to delays in site preparation activities due to a lack of burn windows. Silviculture Lodgepole pine is particularly subject to blowdown, once thinned. And any forest condition that is maintained through mechanical manipulation is not maintaining ecosystem function. The proposed management activities would not be integrated well with the processes that naturally shaped the ecosystem and resulted in a range of natural structural conditions. 03/116 No thinning of lodgepole pine is proposed as part of this project. The forest has been preventing the processes that naturally shaped ecosystems by suppressing fire in the project area. This project is designed to reintroduce the natural processes that would have occurred if fires were not suppressed. Silviculture The justification for regeneration harvesting of immature stands under Alternative C (Section 2.2.4) and any other proposed alternative is very weak. The Forest Service does not need to regenerate these stands until they reach culmination of mean annual increment given the large number of stands proposed for treatment that have already reached culmination. 06/05 The regeneration of younger stands, comprised of Douglas-fir and grand fir, within the focus areas was based on the need to: increase patch size and reduce fragmentation; increase the amount of early successional stands and wildlife foraging habitats; improve forest structure; and increase the distribution of early seral species. Additionally, minor incidences of root disease have been observed in the stands proposed for commercial thinning. Silviculture The figures all suggest that the upland areas are at or near “Desired Conditions”, and significantly refute the Forest Service’s claim that immediate action is needed in these types. A more moderate proposal (particularly in mesic uplands) could still meet the project purpose and need and better protect other resource values. 06/25 The current condition of the uplands in the young age class is skewed based on the broad range of ages represented within that age class. There is also a significant shift during the temporal scale of the analysis from the young age class to the mid-seral age class. This shift to mid-seral is predominantly being targeted for treatment to increase the amount of true early seral species within the project area (shrubs, forbs, coniferous seedlings, etc). Please refer to the FEIS for further discussion. Silviculture There is a major flaw in thinking presented in 06/26 We agree with your assessment that Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response the vegetative composition discussion that is leading to erroneous conclusions regarding the need for action within the project area. This error in thinking is most applicable to VRU 10 and VRU 17 where western red cedar habitat types dominate. The DEIS analysis lumps a relatively short lived species (grand fir) with one of the longest lived species in the project area (western red cedar). Western red cedar has very little problem with disease and stands composed of this species have relatively long life spans (several hundreds of years). In upland settings like are found in VRU 10 and 17, western red cedar stands can persist for long periods of time (hundreds of years). Such stands are self-thinning and are not at risk to encroachment from grand fir and Douglas fir. Fire risk in mature cedar stands is generally very low. In Northern Idaho, western red cedar is commonly associated with old growth characteristics. western red cedar is long lived species and resistant to endemic root diseases. VRU 10 and VRU 17 are dominated by western red cedar habitat types, however based on field verification is has been determined that they are dominated by the grand fir cover type. Stands that are dominated by the western red cedar cover type mostly occur within riparian areas and protected coves. Stands that meet this description have not been included in the project for treatment. Silviculture On moist sites like those found in VRU 10 and 17 species competition in the primary factor influencing stand composition and understory fire plays a relatively minor role. While other species (including grand fir) may be present for long time periods following stand replacement fire, they generally have difficulty competing with long lived and disease resistant cedar. 06/27 We agree, thank you for your observations and input.  Silviculture Please reconsider your vegetation analysis in the FEIS particularly as it relates to lumping of western red cedar and grand fir in VRU 10 and 17. I believe you have overestimated the importance of understory fire in this setting due to lumping of these two species. 06/28 See response to comment 06/26. Although some stands included in the proposal are indeed on cedar habitat types, the majority are dominated by grand fir cover types. The majority of the stands proposed for treatment are on the drier end of the grand fir habitat types. Based on field verification these stands are currently showings signs of decline and susceptibility to insect and disease change vectors. Silviculture this DEIS does not address how the proposed timber sale will damage the countless non-vegetative natural resources in and downstream from the sale area. You are well aware that most available scientific literature authored by respected scientists explains how logging and road construction will considerably harm these important resources. 10/01 The Forest Service has established a policy for using ecological restoration to manage National Forest System lands in a sustainable manner (Forest Service Manual 2020). Ecological restoration focuses on establishing the composition, structure, pattern, and ecological processes necessary to facilitate terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem sustainability, resilience, and health under current and future conditions. Consistent with this policy, the purposes of the Clear Creek Integrated Restoration project are to manage forest vegetation to restore natural disturbance patterns; improve long-term resistance and resilience at the landscape level; reduce fuels; improve watershed conditions; increase elk forage; improve early seral wildlife habitat; and Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response maintain habitat structure, function, and diversity (FEIS, Purpose and Need for Action). Timber harvest is one of the tools that will be used to achieve the vegetation objectives. The EIS and supporting documentation in the Project File demonstrate that the project will improve tree health and vigor, reduce the likelihood that treated areas will support high severity fire, improve water quality, stream function, and aquatic habitat over the long-term, will not affect the viability of sensitive plant species, will improve forage conditions for elk, and will not adversely affect wildlife species or habitat (EIS, Chapter 3, Environmental Consequences). Silviculture ban all logging. 14/02 Management activities proposed in the project area are consistent with current law, policy, and Nez Perce Forest Plan direction. Forest Plan direction is discussed in detail in the FEIS.  Silviculture Another question deals with the entry standards. The forest plan was originally envisioned as a ten year plan. Doesn’t decade mean the life of the plan until revised? There is serious question as to whether the entry requirements are being 28/13 We have no comment on the life span of the current forest plan, however forest plan revision efforts are currently underway.  Silviculture The DEIS is not clear on whether the project will meet requirements that trees be logged only after meeting culmination of mean annual increment (CMAI). Given the acreage that meets CMAI in the project area, how does the project comply with NFMA by proposing to log areas that don’t meet CMAI? 28/39 See response to comment 06/05. Forest Service Handbook 2409 allows the Forest Service variance in these situations. Silviculture Have the brush fields been inventoried recently? The number of emerging conifers within my brush fields is notable and increasing annually. Of course stronger numbers are recorded nearer the existing seed source. 29/02 Formal inventories have not been complete in the shrub fields; however the majority of the brush fields were assessed by Idaho State Fish and Game wildlife biologist who was part of the interdisciplinary team. The conifer species regenerating in the understory are dominated by shade tolerant grand fir and Douglas-fir that would have been removed during the high frequency low intensity that would have been common in the area. It is felt that reapplication of low intensity fire will restore historic fire regimes and conditions. Silviculture/Age Classes I think the biggest missing ecosystem component of forests in the Northern Region isn't old growth, it's early seral. What is the existing percentage of early seral on the Nez Perce now? 5-10%? What is the "desired" range? Is the Nez Perce meeting their goals for early seral? Isn't the USFS required by law to manage for "species diversity?" Therefore isn't the USFS "breaking the law" by not "actively 05/10 We appreciate your observations and input, we have no estimate of early seral across the forest, however, within this project there is a deficit of early successional habitats and the species that depend on them. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response managing" for early seral species? Rolling the dice waiting for a wildfire is NOT active management, especially in areas slated for fire suppression Silviculture/Age Classes throughout the Region, and I'm sure on the Nez Perce also, that the USFS is way below it's management goals for "desired" early seral. I'm guessing your forest plan calls for so much percent of old growth "per 6th order watershed" (or some such criteria); does the same apply for "early seral?" 05/11 Desired early seral habitat is defined by ecological process and vegetative dynamics on any given landscape. The forest plan supports this but does not specify specific amounts. Silviculture/Age Classes Three points to "hammer home to the public." 1-the vast majority of the logging is on clearcuts from the 60's. In 30 years the average DBH of those stands will be (?). 2-we are presently NOT meeting early seral habitat goals on forest and project area. 3- in 30 years, we will be at the "upper range" of old growth (45%), and there will be more mature forest than ever likely existed historically. 05/18 Thank you. Silviculture/Alternatives The IDT is to be commended for recognizing that the Proposed Action (Alt. B) warranted reconsideration based on silvicultural needs, leading to the development and consideration of Alternative C. Some CBC members prefer to call this alternative the “maximum silvicultural flexibility” alternative rather than “maximum species conversion.” Some feel that selection of this alternative would provide flexibility to treat root disease infected younger stands without adequate composition of seral species inside and out of focus areas with a regeneration harvest prescription rather than deferral. Deferral would result in continuance of stands outside of desired condition while Alternative C would provide increased flexibility to apply commercial thin or regeneration prescriptions where appropriate. Some CBC members prefer providing this flexibility for silvicultural implementation to help achieve desired conditions. 27/11 Thank you for your comments and suggestions Silviculture/CFLRA In general, we feel that the DEIS adequately disclosed how the project meets the intent and is consistent with the CFLRA regarding incorporation of best available science, avoiding the establishment of any new permanent roads, and ensures a commitment to decommission any temporary roads constructed. CBC members are also aware that the Selway-Middle Fork CFLRP proposal indicates that vegetation treatments will emulate natural disturbance patterns, address fragmentation results from historical harvest, and create early seral habitat through regeneration harvests with patch sizes appropriate for the forest type. At the same time, some CBC members feel that the FEIS should provide further discussion and elaboration on how the project is consistent 27/05 Thank you for your comments and suggestions.  Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response with guidance to focus on small diameter trees, thinning, fuel breaks and fire use, when a significant component of the project targets larger-diameter mature trees (101-149 years) for regeneration harvest. CBC members recognize that much of the guidance language in the CFLRA was written with dry forest types in mind where small diameter thinning would be expected to be a dominant silvicultural prescription. Some further elaboration on silvicultural prescriptions appropriate for this forest type should be included in the FEIS. Silviculture/CFLRA Similarly, the act further requires that retention of large diameter trees (appropriate to the forest type) is maximized. Some CBC members are concerned that while the project may “consider” retention of large diameter trees, that it may not adequately disclose how the project “maximizes” retention of large diameter trees. At the same time, CBC members have expressed strong support for retention of large/old long lived serals or “legacy trees” within all harvest areas regardless of silivicultural prescription. Finally, some CBC members feel that this should not be interpreted as supporting the maximum retention of large diameter grand and Douglas-fir trees that could hamstring the ability of the project to meet long-term silvicultural objectives. 27/06 Thank you for your suggestions, the FEIS has been updated to include a brief discussion on how the project is consistent with CFLRA language that requires projects “maximiz[e] the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type, to the extent that the trees promote fire resilient stands.” (emphasis added) Silviculture/CFLRA As part of the project’s design, it is critical that the FEIS provide appropriate rationale for how the project complies with tree retention requirements. Guidance suggests that the project “maximiz[e] the retention of large trees, as appropriate for the forest type.” While the CBC concurs that the project will increase structural diversity across the project area, reduce road density, increase patch size and promote restoration of long-lived seral species, some members feel that the FEIS should provide additional discussion on this key issue. 27/14 See response to comment 27/06. Silviculture/CFLRA Some also feel that while the project “considers” large tree retention, that it may fall short of “maximizing” retention of large trees. We support the use of scientifically-appropriate old growth definitions (Green et al, 1992 as amended), yet some are concerned that the regeneration prescription, in areas with mature trees, may deserve closer scrutiny to ensure that current direction is appropriately applied, and that the effects to large trees are fully disclosed and discussed, and that appropriate alternatives are developed and considered to respond to this issue. 27/15 See response to comment 27/06 Silviculture/Clearcutting This timber sale once again reflects Brazell’s obsession with clearcutting public land in spite of the fact there is no action in the forest more disliked by the public. Although the information at the following link is about 02/03 Much of the public supports the project, and timber harvest, as noted in the comments they provided.

Federal land management is generally more restrictive than that found on state lands. Silviculture/Comm Thin The plan also has a large amount of commercial thinning. However, the Forest Service claims this area will be left alone for a few decades after this project. While such a promise cannot be made, it doesn’t even seem genuine given the prescriptions for commercial thinning. It looks more like a ten year logging plan. 28/40 We would agree that future management of this landscape is beyond the scope of this document. Our intention is maximize opportunities in this entry and create conditions that are more resistant and resilient then they currently are while providing a commercial product. Timing of entry into stands that have been commercially thinned is generally on the order of 30 to 50 years. These stands will all have prescriptions written by a silviculturalist that will track the timing of what the next entry would be. It is also our intention to leave tracks for future managers as to what we are trying to accomplish with this landscape level project. We feel the unique relationship with all of our partners and the emphasis of the CFLR program will ensure our intentions are carried into the future Silviculture/Comm Thinning I think it's pretty cool that you can "commercial thin" 50 year old clearcuts, which I'm going to guess are 10-12" DBH. I read this in the press release in the Missoulian, and since I'm a land Surveyor by trade, so I confirmed it by comparing the map of "thinning units" to past regen harvests. I would constantly "hammer this home" to the public. Who could be opposed to thinning past clearcuts? 05/04 Yes, it is pretty cool that we have such a productive and resilient land base. Silviculture/Comm Thinning I would suggest including an "average DBH in 30 years" table, that would show the public what the size of these trees will be after the "thinning release." How about a photograph of a recently cut "butt slab" that clearly shows the increased size of growth rings from a thinning 30 years ago. 05/05 We have installed permanent photo plots within the project area to monitor the change and growth on the vegetation prior to and following vegetative treatments. Silviculture/Comm Thinning For aesthetic reasons, the public does have an affinity for "large diameter trees," so for future "restoration" EIS's, I would suggest you "hammer home" the benefits and results of the "thinning release." 05/07 Thank you for your comments and suggestions. Silviculture/Cumulative Effects This part of the forest has already been extensively managed for timber harvest as a commercial use of the public lands. This past management has obviously been imperfect, since some past sins are now being proposed for repair and undoing. 01/01 Thank you for your observations, management in the past was imperfect, however, as evident by the on the ground condition these stands have recovered. The biggest issue with past management was the fragmentation of the landscape which this project seeks to restore natural disturbance patterns in scale and severity. Silviculture/Desired Conditions We are aware that some outside interests may raise concerns over the application of Vegetative Response Units (VRUs) desired conditions, thresholds and benchmarks for vegetative age, size and species. As a result, the FEIS should discuss how the project is 27/12 Thank you for your comments and suggestions. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response consistent with best available science, and how benchmarks, thresholds and desired conditions were identified. The FEIS should also describe how the current trajectory of stand development will fail to achieve the desired conditions, with a focus on the predominant VRUs identified for commercial thin or regeneration treatments. Further, recognizing that the issue of regeneration harvests in areas of mature forest have the potential to raise concern, the FEIS should clearly spell out how the project will improve the function of forest stand dynamics over time (i.e. variability in stand structures, early seral restoration, old growth development and retention, protection of biological legacies/structure, etc.). Silviculture/Documentation I'm a big fan of using a "projection table" that would tell the public what the forest would look like in 30 years. You used a 5 year projection on the table on page 3-64, why not a 30 year? It was an effective visual when you projected out 5 years to show that a large amount of the present forest would be "leaving" the mid-seral range into the mature category. 05/08 Thanks for the suggestion, however, due to time constraints and sequestration this is not currently feasible. Silviculture/Documentation Use more photographs! I love the photo of the "variable retention" harvest on page 13 of the NFMA Assessment. Of course, I realize that the only people who read these EIS's are nerds like me! LOL. But I know what a variable retention looks like, a lot of people don't. I think more use of "after" photos would be helpful for the public to "visualize" what it will look like upon project completion. 05/17 Thanks for your comments. We have inserted pictures in the FEIS to depict a regeneration harvest unit. We have installed photo points to accomplish this very thing. Silviculture/Focus Areas The DEIS is unclear on page 3-71, where it states that “[a]ll activities would occur within Focus areas.” On the preceding page, upwards of 3,144 acres or commercial thin are included outside the Focus Areas (see table 3-20). Table 3-20 also indicates upwards of 3,940 acres of “[r]etention.” The FEIS should clarify whether these retention acres are PACFISH buffers, designated patches or clumps within harvest units. For the purpose of designating tree retention in regeneration units, the 14-28 trees per acre should be interior to the harvest units and PACFISH buffers should not be counted as the retention areas (Franklin and Johnson, 2011 and Perry et al, 2011). The FEIS should clarify how retention areas will be designated over time, as it is unclear whether these areas will have a special designation in TSMRS or other Forest Service databases. 27/24 Thank you for your suggestions, the updated FEIS will clarify tree retention within the focus areas. Silviculture/I&D What beneficial ecological roles do beetles play? Can the forest survive without beetles? 03/54 In the absence of fire beetles and root disease become the primary change agents within forested landscapes. We cannot speculate whether or not the forest can survive without beetles, but it is a very interesting question. We expect the beetles would always be present at some Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response level on the forest. Silviculture/I&D What beneficial ecological roles do beetles play? Can the forest survive without beetles? 03/150 See the response to 03/54. Beetles kill trees, trees fall over and create homes for ants, bears eat ants (Wuerthner 2009). Silviculture/Imp Cuts There needs to be a better description of the old forest improvement cuts described on page 2-7, item 4. How much volume will be removed and what will happen to the understory after removal of the grand fir. Will prescribed burning or other slash treatments occur? Will any of the large diameter trees be removed including large diameter grand fir and what will happen to dead snags? How will logger safety be accomplished while still maintaining dead trees? What will happen to large diameter downed logs? What are the habitat types of the stands where these treatments will occur? What is the VRU of the stands proposed for treatment? 06/33 See the vegetation section in the FEIS for a full description of the improvement cuts. The goal of the improvement cut is to remove small diameter trees in the understory while maintaining the larger diameter dominant trees in the understory. These units will produce on average 7 MBF per acre. Retention of leave will occur in leave areas and groups of green tree retention. Individual snags considered a threat may be felled for safety but will be left on site. In general the largest diameter snags are the most stable and have the highest potential to remain on site. Post-harvest evaluation will determine additional treatment needs. Also see the FEIS for maps of VRU’s and Habitat Types. Silviculture/Imp Harvest Where would cutting occur in old growth? The DEIS approves improvement cuts but later claims there would be no impact on old growth. What peer-reviewed science do you have that suggests improvement cutting works or is needed that contradicts the agency’s own research that shows thinning affects species like pileated woodpeckers (see Bull et al. 1995, PNW, GTR, 353)? What trees will be logged? Will any large grand fir be logged? What about dead snags? How will old growth characteristics be maintained given requirements for removal of dangerous trees like snags for safety reasons? Why was no forest plan amendment approved to log in old growth when the Forest Service, in the past, considered it was necessary to comply with the forest plan and MA 20? We also provided information in our scoping comments about the erroneous assumptions concerning ponderosa pine types in this area and that large fires are not unnatural, as the DEIS seems to suggest. Indeed,these cuts in old growth are justified on an irrational fear of fire. 28/24 Tree removal would occur in the understory of large old ponderosa pine and in some cases Douglas-fir. Correct. Improvement cutting is being proposed on 331 acres of a 48,000 acre project area. There may be slight detrimental effects to pileated woodpeckers on those 331 acres positive on other species like the flammulated owl and pygmy nuthatch. See above for answers about snags. We are not treating any ground in MA 20. We agree that large fires are natural and the project attempts to create conditions that improves the chances of survival of the large trees in the event of a large stand replacing fire. Silviculture/Patch Size The ‘shift in average patch size’ (Table 3-25) is ‘over-thinking’ (misleading) in the change in patch metrics. 13/03 No response necessary Silviculture/Patch Size As discussed in the vegetation section 3.6, changes in patch sizes should be addressed by VRU and focus only on stand-replacing practices. 13/04 Thank you for your comment, we feel at this time analyzing the patch size at the project scale is sufficient to show the effects of the proposed actions. Changes in patch size are focused on regeneration activities as these are the only activities that affect patch size. Silviculture/Patch Size It would be worthwhile to disclose if vegetation management practices were altered (for example deferring to commercial thinning in 13/07 See the response to 13/04. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response lieu of stand-replacing timber harvest) to retain one or more patches within the desired range. Silviculture/Patch Size Although the Forest's modeling indicates that over the entire project area there should be little impact, the Tribe is concerned with large-sized regeneration harvest patches concentrated in very small watershed sub basins. The Tribe is concerned with the largest patches and their potential to change the magnitude of overland and stream flows, causing "blow outs" in these small sub basins and producing sediment that may migrate downstream and interfere with the operation of the Kooskia Hatchery. There is also concern that the timing of stream flows may be altered, affecting stream temperatures or flow levels which may impact fish. 21/07 Anywhere from 14 to 28 trees per acre would be left within all harvest units. On average, that would be a tree every 50 to 100 feet. They would occur as clumps and as individual trees. In addition, patches will be bisected by 150 to 300 PACFISH buffers and other no treatment areas within the larger patch. The FEIS document watershed section discussing water yield was updated to address this concern. Water yields remain well below the threshold where flow alterations may be seen and channel changes could occur. Additional information on temperatures and the potential effects on the hatcher are included in the Aquatics section of the FEIS. Silviculture/Patch Sizes The discussion on patch size (page 3-74 and 3-75) is very misleading. The implication given to the reader is that patch sizes for all successional stages are larger after implementation of Alternatives B, C and D. In reality, “average” patch size only increases because several small patches of older forest are harvested from the existing landscape. There is no real change in size of the largest patches and the only real change is that stand initiation patches are now bigger and there is less old forest because the small patches have been removed. Please drop this misleading discussion from the FEIS and explain what is happening in a more upfront manner. 06/34 Thank you for your comment, however we feel that the discussion is presented adequately and disagree that it is misleading. Silviculture/Philosophy Why is logging that removes all/almost all trees considered regeneration (and not loss of existing forest), when a stand-replacing fire is considered loss of the forest (and not regeneration)? 03/56 This is not necessarily true. Stand replacing fires can also lead to regeneration. A major difference with regeneration cuttings is that the timing, extent, and location are chosen by the agency to meet multiple objectives and provision is made for the species and stocking levels demanded by the Forest Plan. Stand replacing fires consume the resource without public benefit and may cause other detrimental effects that can impact adjacent ecosystems and private land owners. The Silviculture section of the EIS discusses regeneration harvest.  Silviculture/Philosophy Why is logging that removes all/almost all trees considered regeneration (and not loss of existing forest), when a stand-replacing fire is considered loss of the forest (and not regeneration)? 03/152 See response to comment 03/56  Silviculture/Species Comp In our scoping comments we provided significant information about the interface between fire and vegetation in this area.

The conversion away from cedar to other species is misguided. Cedar is a very resilient species, supposedly the criterion for this project. Is such a massive type conversion legal under NFMA? our field trip last fall are examples of the stands we will be treating. Silviculture/Tree Retention The DEIS (Pg. 3-71) indicates that overall residua] tree retention will range between 14 and 28 trees per acre. If these large harvest areas are necessary, the Tribe recommends retention of the greatest number (28 (or more) trees per acre) of the largest and most biologically diverse trees available. Leave trees should not be chosen merely by desired species, but rather, by those trees best suited to the soils, elevation, topography, and aspect of the area. All leave tree designs and physical marking of the trees should be completed by qualified Forest personnel. Leave trees should be arranged within units to minimize the potential effects of increased snow accumulation, snow melt, and loss of root strength. Harvest should be avoided on any landslide susceptible areas. Riparian areas need to be laid out according to PACFISH guidelines and harvest activities such as yarding corridors across streams should be avoided OR there should be a requirement for full lift so that riparian vegetation is left unharmed by harvest activities. 21/08 Site specific silvicultural prescriptions will be prepared and include specifications for green tree retention that incorporates areas of 100% retention and RHCAs. All design criteria for soils and water described in Chapter 2 of the FEIS will be incorporated into these site specific silvicultural prescriptions. No yarding corridors across streams are proposed. Silviculture/VRU’s The DEIS suggests that all upland areas are currently meeting of very near the “Desired Conditions” for the amount of young forest, but the Forest Service still thinks more is needed. In VRU 7 it is stated on page 3-55 that the “young forest stage is in excess of the desired condition by 150 acres”. The Forest Service response is to basically double the amount of harvest over the desired amount of 250-500 acres (Table 3-24 – Page 3-74). Various action alternatives harvest an addition 253 to 427 acres over the existing amount of 590 acres (Table 3-24 – 2017 values). 06/22 The current condition of the uplands in the young age class is skewed based on the broad range of ages represented within that age class. There is also a significant shift during the temporal scale of the analysis from the young age class to the mid-seral age class. This shift to mid-seral is predominantly being targeted for treatment to increase the amount of true early seral species within the project area (shrubs, forbs, coniferous seedlings, etc). Please refer to the FEIS for further discussion. Silviculture/VRU’s In VRU 10 the Forest Service states that there “is the need for a slight increase in the young forest”. The current condition is reported at “9%” and the desired condition is reported at “10-20%” in Table 3-13 (Page 3-56). For some reason, the Forest Service does not report the amount of young forest that will be harvested in VRU 10. These figures should be displayed in the FEIS. 06/23 See the response to 06/22. Silviculture/VRU’s In VRU 17 the Forest Service states on page 3-57 that “No departures from desired conditions occur”. Under the action alternatives harvest of an additional 1233 to 2349 acres is proposed over the existing situation of 2744 acres (Table 3-24 – 2017 values). Are such extensive actions really needed in an area where there are “no departures from desired conditions”? 06/24 See the response to 06/22. Silviculture/VRFor many of the VRUS, existing conditions are 27/13 See the response to 06/22. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response U’s within the range of desired conditions, with some exceptions. For instance, both young and old forest in VRU 3 and 7 are well outside their range, for VRU 8: mid-seral is outside the desired range. However for VRU 10 and 17 existing conditions are within the desired range for all size classes. It is important to note that VRUs 10 and 17 make up 59% of the project area. Similarly, of the proposed regeneration treatments, 59% occur in VRUs 10 and 17. At the same time, the CBC does recognize that while age classes may be within desired ranges, current species, patch sizes, composition and/or structure may be outside of natural ranges due to past management, fire suppression and fragmentation. It would be helpful in the FEIS to display acres of commercial thinning and regeneration logging by VRU in tabular format. Silviculture/Whitebark Pine What surveys have been conducted to determine presence and abundance of whitebark pine re-generation? If whitebark pine seedlings and saplings are present, what measures will be taken to protect them? Please include an alternative that excludes burning in the presence of whitebark pine regeneration (consider ‘Daylighting’ seedlings and saplings as an alternative restoration method). Will restoration efforts include planting whitebark pine? Will planted seedling be of rust-resistant stock? Is rust resistant stock available? Would enough seedlings be planted to replace whitebark pine lost to fire activities? Have white pine blister rust surveys been accomplished? What is the severity of white pine blister rust in proposed action areas? 03/101 Whitebark pine is not present in the project area. Restoration of whitebark pine is not part of the purpose and need of this project. Snags 14-28 standing trees/ac: What is the source/rationale for 14-28 standing trees/ac Per 2009 Snag Analysis for Northern Idaho (I believe this represents the document), during early-seral conditions on low/mid-elevation moist forests, an average of 5.5 snags/ac (>15” dbh) and 2.6 snags/ac (>20”dbh) are appropriate. I would assume that live culls (both existing snags and future recruitment for snags and large, down wood) would be included in this density and that legacy trees would be either included. It is both difficult and unrealistic to expect that designating dead trees to remain standing on-site will meet these densities. 13/24 The Nez Perce-Clearwater Target Stand guide (2012) was developed by an interdisciplinary team and incorporates fire, wildlife, timber, silviculture, and soil recommendations and can be found in the project file. The retention of 14-28 tpa is for future recruitment of downed woody material needed for soils, as well as for providing snags for wildlife. The target stand development also incorporated information from the 2009 Snag Analysis for Northern Idaho.  Soils Brazell proposes to amend the Nez Perce National Forest plan soil standard because the Clear Creek timber sale will violate the current soil standard that has done the job since 1987. He proposes to weaken the standard to allow more detrimental soil disturbance resulting from logging. 02/05 See response to #21/14 Soils Disclose the amount of detrimental soil disturbance that currently exists in each 03/15 There was very little ground disturbance associated with livestock grazing noted in Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response proposed unit from previous logging and grazing activities; Disclose the expected amount of detrimental soil disturbance in each unit after ground disturbance and prior to any proposed mitigation/remediation; Disclose the expected amount of detrimental soil disturbance in each unit after proposed mitigation/remediation; the field surveys.

The existing soil detrimental disturbance ranges from 0 to 22%. For those units currently over the 15%, they would initially exceed 15% after timber harvest implementation.

The Forest Service should be working to meet existing standards, instead of modifying the standards to accommodate increased levels of management activity. 06/02 See response to #21/14 above. Soils The analysis of the Clear Creek proposal has not utilized the best available science. Watershed, fish, and wildlife analyses have used old, tired science. Much more recent, accurate models with credible analytical procedures and data are available. The use of NEZSED is very limited. 08/07 We are required by the Forest Plan to use NEZSED and FISHED to compare alternatives for impacts to watersheds and streams in relation to Forest Plan sediment yield guidelines. Recent monitoring and newer literature was used to discuss the potential effects of the proposed activities on those resources and can be found in the FEIS. Further discussion on NEZSED is also provided in the FEIS Watershed section. Soils Logging impacts soils and fauna and flora. 22/04 No response required Soils I would hate to see this area become deserving of interpretive signs along the roadway like those on US 12 at Lolo Pass, noting the desertification of the areas logged by Plum Creek Timber, where the thin soils have vanished without the forest to hold them in place. 26/04 Design criteria have been created to reduce the likelihood of impacts to soils (FEIS, Ch.2).

Why was there no alternative that excluded logging in places where soil standards are exceeded? 28/18 See response to comment #21/14 and 03/16. There was no need for an additional alternative – if the final decision does not include the soil amendment, a total of three units would be excluded from treatment. Soils The need to allow activities to occur in areas with over 20 percent detrimental soils disturbance is precisely the reason the standard exists, to prevent that from occurring. This is akin to beating up a mugging victim while in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. It makes no sense. Rather, if any amendment would be offered, it would defer logging in the units that exceed 15 percent detrimental soil disturbance and only do real restoration work in those areas. Several other projects have had a similar amendment. There seems to be a pattern that repeats itself. Furthermore, the DEIS notes that mechanical site preparation would be used instead of burning. How does that affect the amount of detrimentally affected soils in the units? 28/19 See response to comment #21/14.  Mechanical piling or mastication would occur primarily on tractor ground areas (less than 35% slope). Mechanical treatment allows for better leave tree survival and downed wood retention, but could increase soil detrimental disturbance. Equipment would be used on existing skid trails to the extent possible (FEIS, Design Criteria). Soils/Alternatives How does logging in landslide prone areas meet NFMA requirements and regional soils standards? Why are there no alternatives that don’t log in those areas? 28/20 No harvest activities would occur in landslide prone areas. Design criteria #4 was established so that no harvest or road activities would occur on landslide prone soils. Soils/Amendment The proposal to make a site specific amendment to modify regional and forest plan soil standards is self-serving and does not meet the intent of regional and forest plan guidelines. The proposal merely allows more timber harvest from previously logged areas that currently do not meet not meet the regional guidelines. There is no good reason why these areas could not be restored to regional standards prior to additional timber harvest. 06/01 See response to comment #21/14.  The soil amendment does not modify Regional standards. Regional soil guidance allows for activities to occur in units that are not currently meeting standards in order to achieve multiple resource objectives while also providing a net improvement in soil quality. By utilizing existing skid trails and landings, there would be little to no increase in detrimental soil disturbance. Soils/Amendment I object to the proposed site-specific amendment to soil quality standard #2 for the Clear Creek project area.

The socioeconomic analysis should include economic factors unique to the Tribe and its treaty rights and resources.

The FS has not provided the Tribe with copies of the survey reports, nor did they consult with the Tribe prior to the survey projects being conducted, so the Tribe cannot evaluate the effectiveness of the survey coverage or methodology. However, the archaeologists only found 2 pre-contact lithic scatters and two historic trails, one of which is the Southern Nez Perce Trail. The agency did not identify traditional cultural properties, so the agency cannot consider these properties when making decisions. The Tribe recommends that additional work be performed for Southern Nez Perce Trail. It would be helpful to get Tribal staff out to this section of the Trail to identify cultural features and locations, as well as an ethnographic review to help identify non-archaeological resources. 21/22 The survey coverage and methodology has been approved by the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office following the “North Idaho” Programmatic Agreement (PA). The PA was crafted between the Idaho State Historic Preservation Office and the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.

Road improvement and decommissioning work will have long term positive effects on sediment in streams. Providing a variety of forests age classes and patch sizes will provide habitat for a large number of wildlife species when compared to monotypically forested areas. Watershed We request the FS design a restoration/access management plan for project area streams that will achieve recovery goals. The task of management should be the reversal of artificial legacies to allow restoration of natural, self-sustaining ecosystem processes. If natural disturbance patterns are the best way to maintain or restore desired ecosystem values, then nature should be able to accomplish this task very well without human intervention (Frissell and Bayles, 1996). 03/127 The ID team recognizes that the greastest effects to streams are roads. We conducted an extensive roads analysis for the project area (see response to comment #04/04).

This is a massive sale with 500-acreclearcuts producing possibly 80 mmbf; that won't help water clarity in the watershed. 09/01 No old growth will be harvested; however small trees around old growth would be removed in order to reduce ladder fuels around those legacy trees. Only temporary roads of short duration would be built. Approximately 9.0 miles would be located on existing disturbed soils (old skid trails or jammer roads). These are located in areas where no effects to streams are expected.  The FEIS provides a picture of what current regeneration harvest areas look like after harvest. We will be leaving 14 to 28 trees per acre within the units as well as retaining PACFISH buffers and other no- treatment areas.  All action alternatives stay well below the Forest Plan allowable sediment yield guideline. Instream beneficial uses in Clear Creek and Middle Fork Clearwater River would be maintained. Watershed No logging should take place in any watershed not meeting forest plan water quality or fish habitat objectives. 12/01 See response to comment 24/02. Logging can occur concurrent with watershed improvements in watersheds not meeting Forest Plan objectives. Watershed There is no way you are going to log from 62 to 85 million acres of land without seriously impacting Clear Creek and the Middle Fork. Sediment erosion will cover the substrate, fill pools with fines, cover submerged logs that serve as fish shelter, affect width/depth ratios, and create unstable bank conditions. 18/01 The DEIS and FEIS both provide information and monitoring of previously harvested areas that have shown little sediment effects to steams or stream channels. Design features and proposed road improvement and decommissioning activities will protect or help to improve instream conditions over the long term. Watershed The Forest states that all major streams in the project area would have improved or maintained water quality conditions (EA pg. 3-129) and that all activities should maintain or improve water quality (DEIS pg. 3-131). The Forest goes on to explain that NEZSED and FISHSED were the models used to analyze potential sediment created through this proposaL Unfortw1ately, both NEZSED and FISHSED are limited in their modeling abilities. The DEIS (pg. 3-15) states that culvert replacements or decommissioning activities cannot be modeled in NEZSED or FISHSED. The Forest's Implementation Guide to Appendix A (pg.18) clearly documents that NEZSED is invalid for "Road use for recreation or log hauling; the model only evaluates presence or absence of roads, not level of use." Therefore, use of roads for log haul and associated maintenance activities, culvert replacements, and decommissioning activities have not been evaluated for potential sediment 21/05 The Aquatic and Watershed sections of the FEIS were updated to address these concerns. Additional literature was also cited regarding log haul, road decommissioning and the effects of culvert replacement on instream sediment. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response input to the stream systems. This causes concern for the Tribe when models exist (such as WEPP and GRAlP) that could predict sediment from these activities are available and currently used by the Forest for other projects. Watershed Concerns are magnified when the amount of timber harvest and associated haul are considered. The project seeks to cut between 65 million board feet to 85 million board feet depending on alternative. This will result in an estimated 27,000 to 38,000 round trips by log trucks. Additionally, there will be increased traffic to the area by other heavy equipment needed to carry out operations and daily trips during harvest activities by logging personnel Before a final decision is made, the Tribe recommends more robust analysis of the potential sedimentation caused by log haul and increased traffic. This analysis should provide an overall estimate of the increased amount of sediment generation by this project, as well as, identification of potential problem areas that could be specifically addressed before any harvest activities take place. 21/06 All the main haul roads associated with the timber harvest have a gravel covering to reduce surface erosion. Any areas lacking surfacing will be upgraded to bring it to required standards. Some of the roads will require additional surfacing to bring them up to a high quality standard. In addition, the roads will be treated with an environmentally friendly dust abatement solution to eliminate dust that could potentially contribute to stream sedimentation. Watershed I am concerned with impacts to water quality and fisheries. Some of the watersheds may not be meeting water quality standards. 22/02 Please see response to Comments #23/06 and #24/02 Watershed Logging should not occur in watersheds not meeting water quality or fish habitat standards or objectives. 22/05 See response to Comment #06/12 Watershed I am familiar with the NEZSED model having used it to assess impacts to fish habitat, water quality from 1988 to 2008 when I retired.

I would like to see how mitigation was applied to land disturbing activities. How long will the 36 miles of temporary road be modeled to exist on the landscape and what language will be applied to the timber contract to assure applied mitigation measures will be contractually required? 23/07 The FEIS document was updated to address this concern in regards to NEZSED.All design criteria outlined in the DEIS and FEIS Ch. 2 have been reviewed and accepted by the project timber specialist and the Forest contracting officer and will be incorporated into the timber sale contract. Watershed No timber harvest should occur in any watershed not meeting forest plan objectives for water quality, and for fish habitat, which is an indicator of water quality. 26/02 See response to Comment #06/12 Watershed The chart on page 3-6 shows the forest plan water quality objective.

What about the fact that non system roads were not analyzed in terms of road density calculations? What about the lack of analysis of impacts from national forest logging on Big Cedar Creek in terms of sediment even though logging is proposed there? What about the analysis for sediment at the mouth of Clear Creek only being from the national forest? How is this a cumulative impacts analysis? This is a particularly important issue as there are downstream interests, including private residences and a fish hatchery, which could be affected by impacts to water quality in Clear Creek(including sediment and temperature) from this timber sale and other cumulative actions. 28/14 Non-system roads are not used in road density calculations because they are not generally accessible, can be grown over, and usually have minimal effects to the environment as a result of lack of use. In the case of Clear Creek they will all be physically decommissioned through the SF/WF Clear Cr Road Decom (already NEPA cleared and being implemented) and Clear Ridge Road Decom Projects (to be scoped in the Spring of 2014 with implementation in 2015 and beyond). The cumulative effects analysis for Watershed and Aquatics did include state and private, as well as federal lands in the drainage as noted in the DEIS and FEIS. Additional information has been included in the FEIS. Watershed/ ECA Why are ECAs that exceed 15% considered for the analysis? According to the DEIS, ECAs of 15% are considered good and ECAs 15-30% are considered moderate. In all action alternatives, Upper Clear Creek is allowed to move into the moderate category under all alternatives. Lower Clear Creek moves to the moderate category under Alternative C. 06/72 The FEIS was updated to address this concern. Watershed/ Fisheries Disclose the baseline condition, and expected sedimentation during and after activities, for all streams in the area; 03/35 This information is provided in the DEIS and FEIS under the Watershed and Aquatics sections of the documents. Watershed/ Fisheries We request a careful analysis of the impacts to fisheries and water quality, including considerations of sedimentation, increases in peak flow, channel stability, risk of rain-on-snow events, and increases in stream water temperature. Please disclose the impacts to bull trout and other TES species. Please disclose the locations of seeps, springs, bogs and other sensitive wet areas, and the effects on these areas of the project activities. 03/129 This information is included DEIS and further clarification occurs in the FEIS. All springs, seeps, bogs, and other wet areas will be buffered using PACFISH buffer guidelines therefore there should be no impacts to them. Watershed/ Fisheries The DEIS notes FISHSED and NEZSED were used to model impacts from various alternatives. However, the aquatics section does not include any quantitative information about FISHSED. There is a NEZSED section in the watershed. Why doesn’t the DEIS discuss the weaknesses of FISHSED and NEZSED in terms of analysis including critiques of the model(s) such as was done by Gloss (see Gloss1995), the critique contained in the agency’s own implementation guide to Appendix A, how these models don’t consider sediment produced from log hauling, and how NEZSED was found inadequate (Memorandum Decision Order, page 18, of CASE NO.CV 04-28/10 See response to comments #08/07 and 21/05. FISHSED results were discussed in the DEIS andt the FEIS was updated to address these concerns. Extensive road surveys were conducted and crossings examined and discussed in the Aquatics section of the DEIS and FEIS. Project activities would reduce sediment input from log haul through dust abatement, road decommissioning and road reconstruction activities. A recent decision on the Little Slate Project upheld the use of both NEZSED and FISHSED as they are required by the Forest Plan (Memorandum Decision and Order Case Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response 447-S-MHW, an injunction issued against the Whiskey South Integrated Resource Project)? What about other models the agency itself has developed including WEPP? What about inventory techniques developed by the agency including GRIAP to assess the impacts that roads have on watersheds (used in O’Hara Creek, for example)? No. 3:12-cv-00466-MHW). Watershed/ PACFISH The DEIS suggests that 250 acres of landslide prone areas have been included in the harvest units and suggests that PACFISH buffers will be maintained in these areas to avoid known landslide risks (Section 2.2.6.1). No data is presented to justify that PACFISH buffers will be effective in preventing landslides. If landslides do occur the impacts could have detrimental and unforeseen impacts on the watershed, fish and other aquatic resources. The impact of landslides has not been included in the watershed analysis and one landside could make all of the conclusions of the watershed analysis and impacts to aquatic resources mute. Timber harvest and road construction should be avoided on all landslide prone areas. 06/07 As noted in the DEIS and FEIS, no harvest activities would occur in landslide prone areas. Only one road-related landslide was noted the drainage (Aquatics section FEIS). Design criteria #4 was established so that no harvest or road activities would occur on landslide prone soils. Watershed/ PACFISH Are PACFISH buffers intact? If not, how does that affect issues like projected sediment yield, habitat for MI and TES aquatic species, soils stability, and other factors in terms of watershed/aquatics and soils. 28/21 The DEIS and FEIS show that roughly 91% of the buffers are intact. A discussion of the status of PACFISH buffers and the expected effects of proposed activities on watershed and aquatic species/habitat is found in the Aquatics and Watershed sections of the DEIS and FEIS. Watershed/ Roads I would encourage this plan to develop alternatives that would take advantage of existing roads, which evidently have remained stable over the years, to minimize cost to contractors and/or the public, rather than to construct new roads that would pose additional hazard to slope stability and increase silt and debris loading of watercourses. 26/01 All alternatives will use existing roads. Only temporary roads would be constructed, meaning they will be recontoured following use. Also any new road would be located on ridge tops or other areas that do not pose threats to water quality or slope stability. The current road system is very well located as noted in the Aquatic section of the DEIS and FEIS. Watershed/ Forest Plan Standards Your agency should not even consider any logging when that watershed cannot now meet Forest Plan objectives for water quality and wildlife habitat. 20/03 Please see response to Comment #06/12 and #06/17 regarding water quality objectives.

Snags would continue to be available in both treated and untreated areas throughout the project area. In many situations, we are able to retain snags by leaving them in areas where they present less of a safety hazard to logging operations, such as in clumps or near the edges of units away from yarding corridors. Wildlife Please disclose whether you have conducted surveys in the Project area for this Project for whitebark pine, bull trout, wolverines, pine martins, northern goshawk and lynx, grizzly bears as required by the Forest Plan. 03/66 See response to comment 03/101.

The Forest follows regional direction for these species which is based on the best available science. Wildlife For the proposal to be consistent with the Forest Plan, enough habitat for viable populations of old-growth dependent wildlife species is needed over the landscape. Considering potential difficulties of using population viability analysis at the project analysis area level (Ruggiero, et. al., 1994), the cumulative effects of carrying out multiple projects simultaneously across the NEZ PERCE-CLEARWATER NF makes it imperative that population viability be assessed at least at the forestwide scale (Marcot and Murphy, 1992). 03/119 See response to comment 03/97.

How about birds, insects, butterflies, rodents, etc. It stands to reason, that with the extreme lack of early seral, especially as it relates to the HRV, there are possibly less glamorous "early seral" species that are threatened with extinction. 05/13 The Forest is required to assess potential effects on Forest MIS, sensitive, and federally listed species. Early seral species have not been identified that are threatened with extinction, otherwise they would be assessed. Wildlife The methods used in the wildlife analysis (Section 3.7.4) appear to be very questionable. The entire analysis appears to be based on stand exam queries and includes very little information on actual habitat use of the various species of concern within the study area. Many of the suitable habitat numbers presented in table 3-28 don’t appear to be consistent with numbers presented in the vegetative section of the DEIS. For example, the tables in the vegetation section suggest that there are 16,387 acres (All VRUs) of stands 21 plus inches in diameter, yet only 8,160 acres of nesting habitat is displayed for the pileated woodpecker and 06/35 See page 3-85 for methodology rationale. The wildlife habitat numbers differ from the vegetation numbers in part due to canopy cover requirements. The vegetation data only extracted the stands with trees over 21” without assessing canopy cover, while pileated woodpeckers and other habitat queries include it. Acres can also differ based on the primary tree species as noted in table 3-28. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response 2,066 acres of nesting habitat for the goshawk. Both of these species are known to be associated with older and larger diameter stands for nesting and it is hard to believe that more of the existing stands are not potential nesting habitat. Suitable habitat acreage for several other species appears to have been grossly underestimated. For, example the table only identifies 510 acres of upland habitat that would be suitable for the Western Toad in the entire 43,700 acre project area. Wildlife A habitat analysis (Bush and Lundberg 2008) that was done for the entire Nez Perce Forest is referenced for many of the species. However, no updates are given for this report despite the fact that it is reported that over 200,000 acres burned in 2012 on the Nez Perce and Clearwater National Forests and there have been numerous logging projects since 2008. No information is given on how the report relates to the project area and if the habitat acreages reported for the various species in the DEIS are the same as those used by Bush and Lundberg (2008). 06/36 The Bush and Lundberg study was used in concert with regional information to discuss viability and potential trends in several species. A relation is presented in the DEIS/FEIS by looking at those numbers in relation to the acres within the project area, Viability is best discussed at the Forest and Region level, not the project level. No update to the Bush and Lundberg report has occurred since 2008. See pages 3-22 to 3-23 for Fire Occurrence, History & Risks. See page 3-61, table 3-15 for Past Harvest Activities in the project area.  Wildlife A report by Samson (2006) is also referenced. This publication is an internal Forest Service document that has never been published in a peer reviewed journal. According to the DEIS this report is supposed to calculate the acreage that would be required to support a viable population of the various species in the 25 million acre Northern Region. The numbers presented in the DEIS appear ridiculously low if species are to be maintained across their existing and historical ranges as would be required if any of the species were listed under the Endangered Species Act. 06/37 See response to comment 06/36. None of the species are listed under the ESA therefore viability must be being maintained at the regional level.

The proposed rule found that dispersed recreational activities, infrastructure development, transportation corridors, and land management activities do not pose a threat to wolverines. Thus, the land management activities in the Clear Creek project for the action alternatives are not considered a threat to wolverine. Alternative activities include vegetation management, fuels reduction, prescribed fire, road improvement, grassland restoration, temporary road construction and road decommissioning projects.  Wildlife The amount of existing habitat for all bat species appears to have been significantly underestimated.

Yet, the DEIS only identifies 8,157 acres of potential habitat for the long-eared and long-legged myotis bats and 192 acres for the fringed myotis bat. These figures suggest that the amount of suitable habitat for these three species has been significantly underestimated. This in turn has resulted in significant underestimates of potential habitat loss for all three of these bat species. 06/43 See response to comment 06/35. See DEIS Table 3-28 on page 3-84 for estimating habitat criteria. Wildlife Second, the importance of suitable habitat on National Forest lands has likely been underestimated by the failure to examine nearby private lands in the analysis. Areas along lower Clear Creek would likely be attractive to bats because of the increased insect abundance that would be found along the stream. 06/44 That is quite possible; however we do not have vegetation data for private lands which limits our ability to calculate available acres there. We agree that foraging habitat is available, cannot verify roosting habitat. Wildlife Third, there appears to be an overestimation of the impacts of fire suppression on bat habitat for the no action alternative. 06/45 We do not agree. Dense stand conditions can lead to high severity fire and the loss of bark on fire killed trees. The DEIS does not estimate acres of potential loss, only describes the process that might occure. DEIS; pp. 3-87 & 3-88 Wildlife Again there seems to be a great deal of underestimation of potential black-backed woodpecker habitat in the project area and the analysis suggests there are only 2,357 acres of potential habitat. Again this is despite the fact 06/46 See response to comment 06/35. As noted in the DEIS, black backed woodpeckers prefer post-fire areas within 1-6 years of a burn.

What has happened to those 700,000 acres since 2008? Has any of it been logged? How much of the 700,000 acres will be affected by the Clear Creek proposal? Are the acreages identified by Bush and Lundberg (2008) the same as those identified in the DEIS? How has the 200,000 acres of wildfire mentioned in the DEIS affected the existing stands identified by Bush and Lundberg? Have some stands been eliminated because the fire burned too hot or has more habitat actually been created in new areas? I have no real idea from the information presented in the DEIS. 06/47 See response to comment 06/36. The DEIS, pgs 3-89 to 3-91 discusses how many acres are expected suitable habitat in the Clear Creek project area and how many of those would be affected by the project. Wildlife No real cumulative effects analysis has been done nor have any site specific estimates of population loss for each of the alternatives been conducted.

Are there portions of the area that are no longer suitable habitat? Do activities on nearby private land cause greater importance to be assigned to the National Forest? For example, have snag and diseased tree density been significantly reduced on private land? 06/49 Please see DEIS and FEIS Chapter 3 for information on this species. These woodpeckers prefer recently burned habitats. Habitat acres are used in lieu of the number of birds. We are unaware of the amount of available habitat on private lands. Wildlife The approach presented for the fisher appears to be very similar to that which was conducted for other species. The whole analysis is based on database queries that supposedly identify suitable habitat. However, it this case suitable habitat is split into summer habitat which the authors classify as older forest stands exceeding 13 inches in DBH and winter habitat which the authors suggest is saplings and other young stands. While the older forest stand designations (summer habitat) make sense for this species, the winter habitat designations do 06/50 See DEIS: 3-99 for fisher observations. This information has been updated in the FEIS.  Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response not. Fishers have been consistently tied to older forest stands in most studies and even by the author’s own admissions the availability of large downed logs over 21 inches DBH are particularly important in the winter. These types of downed logs don’t occur in sapling and other young stands. Even the study cited in the DEIS (Jones and Garton 1994) found that 54% of fisher use during the winter was in mature/old growth forest…. The winter range analysis seems completely inconsistent with the current literature for this species. I suggest it be completely revised with more recent literature citations in the FEIS. My remaining comments will only deal with the summer habitat conditions detailed out in the DEIS as I regard the winter range analysis to be in complete error and contrary to the existing literature for this species. Wildlife Once again suitable summer habitat values appear to be underestimated, but not as badly as for some of the other species. In this case 10,037 acres of old forest is identified as suitable summer habitat. Recall that the vegetation analysis shows over 16,000 acres in size class exceeding 21 inches and almost 11,000 acres in the 9-21 inch size class. 06/51 See response to comment 06/35.

Availability, distribution and sustainability of seasonal forages (winter browse and spring/fall grasses/shrubs) is the issue. Progressing toward desired vegetation conditions would, by default, provide for spring/fall forages. On the winter range, however, specific practices (dry season prescribed fire) must be applied to achieve the desired browse forage conditions. 13/02 See response to 13/01. Wildlife Wildlife Analysis This section of the DEIS seems disproportionate to the analyses documented for the other resources (The wildlife section included approximately 42 pages within the environmental consequences section of the EIS. Between 3 and10 pages were reported for all of the other resources). The wildlife analysis should address only the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the availability, distribution, arrangement and sustainability of selected (T&E, Sensitive and MIS) species habitats. The scale and conclusions related to the cumulative effects analysis is well beyond the Line Officer’s authority to consider or conclude effects of the planned actions of species viability. Wildlife species should be addressed similar to that for fisheries/aquatics/watershed. Much of the 13/22 Thanks for the observation. Other commentors would like to see more analysis. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response wildlife assessment is irrelevant to the analysis and should only appear in a specialist report as supporting documentation. Wildlife A combination of prescribed burning, commercial and pre-commercial thinning~ forest 'improvements', and regeneration harvest are predicted to variably reduce habitat for several wildlife species dependent on late-seral forest conditions and/or large-diameter forest structure, notably northern goshawks, pileated woodpecker, flammulated owl, pygmy nuthatch, Canada lynx, fisher~ American marten, moose, and three species of bats. Foraging habitat for several of these species is predicted to increase in some cases. The DEIS relies heavily on the retention of suitable features and habitats within R1parian Habitat Conservation Areas (RHCAs), Roadless areas, and through silvicultural prescriptions to ensure the persistence of these species under the Proposed Action. Unfortunately, no information is presented quantifying the overall(%) reduction in habitat or the distribution of remaining habitat in the Project area for many of these species. It is therefore difficult to evaluate the impact of the proposed habitat reductions on populations of these species, including their persistence and distribution in the Project area. 21/16 The direct and indirect effects for each of the analyzed species discuss the acres of habitat affected by the treatment. Additional percentages of affected habitat is present is most of these discussions in the DEIS. Wildlife The DEIS references a 2008 report done for the Nez Perce National Forest and a2006 internal agency document that was not published in a peer-reviewed publication. There are assumptions that fail logic and science, including assumption that very little habitat is needed to maintain species (the 2006 report) across the entire region (for example, see page 3-90 for black-backed woodpeckers). It also seems the broad habitat estimates are different than the ones used in the DEIS and they don’t take into account recent logging and fires. For example, the DEIS recognizes 700,000 acres of black-backed woodpecker habitat on the Nez Perce National Forest (about 30 percent of the forest), yet less than 2,400 acres in the project area (about six percent of the project area). Another example is marten, where the amount of mature stands proposed to be clearcut are greater than the amount of habitat lost. It seems there are apples and oranges comparisons when looking at habitat on the larger scale versus on the site-specific scale. These problems are not confined to black-backed woodpeckers (or martens), but also include goshawks, pileated woodpeckers, fisher, the two bat species, and the western toad. 28/27 See response to comment 06/35 and 06/36. DEIS: 3-22 & 23 discuss fire occurrence and history.

The FEIS discusses the amount of suitable habitat for marten and the potential effects of proposed activities on them. Wildlife In essence, the DEIS fails to look at habitat actually used by the species like fisher, marten, goshawk, black-backed woodpeckers, and pileated woodpeckers. Forest plan monitoring has not been done (or reported) and this may be a reason for the inconsistency with the DEIS analysis of wildlife. Without on-the-ground field work, the agency cannot adequately project impacts to species either on a site-specific or cumulative level. 28/30 The DEIS and FEIS discuss habitat parameters assessed for each if these species (Wildlife section). A recent judgment on the Little Slate Project confirmed that population viability is best considered at the forest or regional level, not the project level (Memorandum Decision and Order Case No. 3:12-cv-00466-MHW). Wildlife The DEIS dismisses any analysis of wolverine, bald eagles, and Coeur d’Alene salamanders. Are there no spray zones in the entire project area for salamanders? What about Idaho giant salamanders? Bald eagles use the Clearwater River and may inhabit the project area. Wolverine may use the project area as well, especially in winter searching for carrion. 28/34 See response to comments 3/66, 6/39, 6/40 and 6/41. Idaho giant salamanders appear to be common and have been found in association with culvert replacements in Clear Creek; they are not listed as MIS or sensitive species. Wildlife My comment concerning wildlife habitat is that concerning Elk and Deer it isn't of much use anymore. The IFG has so poorly managed the Clear Creek basin that there are few elk left and having so few numbers left they are almost defenseless against large predators and therefore have basically moved close to town. The wolves are catching the blame and I agree that they do have ongoing impact but many of us forget that hunters legally and illegally shot the herds down using extended hunts, multiple weapons hunts, controlled hunts, depredation hunts, cow tags and a variety of other bull cow ratio data, which for the most part centered on the bull concerning elk management and now we are suffering decades of three month long hunting seasons and blaming it on the wolves. Habitat is good for those that need it and I feel there is plenty of it out there that suits the purpose just fine. 29/04 Thank you for your comments Wildlife/ Alternatives Alternative C does the most to trend the project area toward desired conditions described in the purpose and need section. This alternative would provide the earliest successional habitat, a feature that is drastically below desired levels, while variable retention harvest would assure retention of structural elements necessary for a wide variety of wildlife in both the short and long-term. By regenerating stands that are not composed of early seral species and are within the focus areas, this alternative creates the most opportunity for reestablishment of early seral species while maintaining patch size. 17/03 Thank you for your comments. Wildlife/BABE Disclose the biological assessment for the candidate, threatened, or endangered species 03/07 The BE and the BA is included with the FEIS. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response with potential and/or actual habitat in the Project area; Disclose the biological evaluation for the sensitive and management indicator species with potential and/or actual habitat in the Project area; Wildlife/ Cumulative Effects The cumulative effects analysis is weak or non-existent for all wildlife species. A cumulative effects analysis should have at least been completed for the Clear Creek drainage. The fact that private land data is not readily available is no excuse for not conducting a cumulative effects analysis. The results of the analysis likely would have been much different if the impacts of past and proposed activities on nearby private lands had been included in the wildlife analysis. 06/38 The FEIS includes activities on private lands adjacent to or within the project area. Wildlife/ Cumulative Effects The importance of the Clear Creek Roadless Area as bird habitat becomes much more consequential when the cumulative effects of landscape treatment by surrounding landowners is taken into consideration. Private landowners in the surrounding area have been strongly encouraged to aggressively treat ALL of their property for “fire mitigation” which includes clearing all the brush from large tracts of land. This despite the fact that numerous studies have shown that treatment beyond a 100 ft. radius of a structure bears little safety advantage in a fire event. Since bird habitat has already been severely compromised on private holdings the cumulative effects of further habitat destruction needs to be addressed. Song birds are in decline worldwide and destroying their strongholds puts further stress on populations. 11/03 DEIS page 1-3 shows about 33% of project area is privately or state-owned. Not all private land has been is treated for fire mitigation as seen in Google Earth. Project activities would create a mosaic of vegetation structure that would provide habitat for songbirds and their prey base of insects or plants. Wildlife/ Cumulative Effects The DEIS ignores the adjacent private land in terms of impacts to wildlife species.

Without vegetation management, range forage quality & quantity will decrease. Part of the purpose of the project is to maintain or increase forage habitat. Maintaining elk numbers would continue to provide hunting opportunities for tribal members. Wildlife/Elk The DEIS states that an overall decline in calf:cow ratios may be related to reductions in forage quality (poor condition of cows and low calf weights), high predation rates, less security area, and greater human disturbance and/or hunting pressure" (p. 3-120; emphasis added). However, the Proposed Action would reduce elk hiding cover by 10% through regeneration harvests and a further 9% through prescribed burns on MA 16 Winter Range (p. 3-124). Hiding cover on elk summer range would be reduced 10% as well under Alt. B. Factoring in the anticipated benefits of increased forage availability to elk, overall summer range Elk Habitat Effectiveness (EHE) would still decline by an average of 5%. It is therefore unclear how "elk populations are expected to respond favorably to proposed treatments due to increased foraging opportunities" (p. 3-124) in the face of static or increasing tribal and non-tribal harvest pressure, a 10-19% decrease in hiding cover on the winter range, and a 5% average decrease in overall summer habitat effectiveness. On the contrary, model results indicate that the net effect of the Proposed Action on elk will be negative. 21/18 In every alternative, all elk analysis units would remain above 50% in habitat effectiveness, see table 3-31 in DEIS. The prescribed burns on MA-16, Winter Range are maintenance burns to promote vigor in elk forage. Hunting (‘pressure’) is regulated by the state. Wildlife/Elk Large forest openings, though a natural characteristic of forests exhibiting mixed-and high-severity wildfire, can pose problems for a number of wildlife species. Such areas can impede dispersal, reduce foraging opportunity, and increase vulnerability to predators and/or human harvest relative to smaller forest openings, even if the overall burned acreages are equal. The presence ofRHCAs in low-lying portions of the units may provide little benefit for upland species. Conversely, riparian-associated species may be impacted through the loss of forest cover connecting discontinuous riparian zones. For some populations already facing demographic stress due to other factors, the added stressor of large forest openings may threaten viability…For elk, these openings are expected to increase sight distances and thus vulnerability in areas which are already heavily 21/19 See the FEIS, Appendix A.

However, even the research cited in the DEIS notes the need for old growth during both winter and summer. Thus, it seems the DEIS underestimates the impacts to fisher. Given the high level of accidental trapping of this species in the region, it is of grave concern. 28/28 Both GIS analyses for winter and summer habitat included all old growth as fisher habitat. Wildlife/ Fisheries What evidence do you have that this logging will make the forest healthier for fish and wildlife? 03/51 As discussed in the DEIS and FEIS, logging is expected to have no effect on fish species. Road decommissioning and improvement will benefit aquatic habitats over time. The only expected direct Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response effects to fish would come from these activities where culverts are removed or replaced.Heterogenous habitats offer more opportunities for wildlife than homogenous habitats. Logging in this project would create more diverse habitats for wildlife. Wildlife/ Fisheries What evidence do you have that this logging will make the forest healthier for fish and wildlife? 03/146 See response to comment 03/51. Wildlife/ Flammulated Owl, Pygmy Nuthatch, Ringneck Snake, Mt Quail I agree that all of these species would find limited habitat in the analysis area and that the areas of primary importance occur on project area breaklands (VRU 3). I encourage treatments that favor the retention of larger Douglas fir and ponderosa pine in VRU 3 and to some extent in VRU 4 and feel that such treatments will be particularly important for the flammulated owl and the pygmy nuthatch. However, I am concerned when such treatments are extended into moister upland habitat types in the name of restoration 06/54 Prescribed fire treatments should be beneficial to the habitat. Regeneration would leave 14-28 tpa/acre as clumps or individuals. The harvest in moister units would remove the shade tolerant species, and favor ponderosa Pine or Douglas-fir. Wildlife/ Goshawk Once again the amount of available nesting habitat appears to have been significantly underestimated. The idea that only 2,066 acres out of the available 16,387 acres of forest over 21 inches DBH and 10,786 acres of forest between 9 and 21 inches DBH doesn’t make any sense. It appears that impacts to goshawk habitat have been significantly underestimated as a result of this estimate. There is also no discussion regarding the distribution of this habitat which is likely critical to a territorial species like the goshawk. For example, if the entire nesting habitat is located in one area it will only be useful to the goshawks nesting in the territory that contains that nesting habitat. 06/59 See response to comment 06/35. Goshawk nesting habitat is well distributed around the perimeter of the project area. A map is available in the project file. Wildlife/ Goshawk Second the same approach that has been cited for several other species is presented once again. The study by Bush and Lundberg (2008) suggests there are 275,000 acres of post-fledgling habitat on the Nez Perce Forest. Again, there is no analysis how this study relates to the project area and determinations of suitable habitat actually used in the analysis. In fact there is not even any discussion regarding post-fledgling habitat in the DEIS as only nesting habitat is considered. No attempt has been made to track how this habitat may have changed since 2008 and once again I see assertions that only 30,147 acres of post-fledging habitat is needed to meet the requirements of goshawks across the 25 million acre Northern Region (Samson 2006). Such an assertion again seems fairly ridiculous given the current range and distribution of the species. 06/60 See response to comment 06/36. See DEIS 3-84 for analysis methodology and Table 3-28 for habitat criteria. Post fledgling habitat is mentioned on page 3-116. Wildlife/ Goshawk The analysis talks about estimated population size of goshawks in Idaho (5,600 birds) and the Northern Rockies (3,900 birds), but makes no 06/61 Not all the acreage is contiguous, and not all the goshawks are paired up, which makes a simple approximation Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response mention of how many nesting pairs of goshawks could be supported in the project area. As territorial species with territory sizes of approximately 4000-6000 acres (Reynolds et al. 1992) this should be a relatively easy calculation for the project area. unrealistic. Wildlife/ Goshawk I believe the current goshawk analysis is inadequate because it fails to account for how the project area is actually being utilized by goshawks. There is not attempt to figure out existing habitat use and how that use might be impacted by the project proposal. The analysis presented in the DEIS relies on nebulous habitat assessments that are neither current nor accurately reflect the existing habitat potential for this species. Under this approach, no timber sale will ever impact goshawk habitat because there is always habitat “somewhere else” that will support the species. However, no actual accounting of this habitat and its changing condition is ever presented. 06/62 Refer to the Response to Comment 06/60. Also, design criteria in the DEIS Chapter 2 discuss retention of trees that provide potential goshawk habitat, as well as reporting to the biologist if den or nest sites are discovered during activities. Conservation measures would be implemented if nesting goshawks are found. The FEIS discloses how much suitable habitat, based on vegetation requirements of the species, would be affected by the project. Wildlife/ Goshawk As an alternative method to the weak analysis presented in the DEIS, I suggest an approach that identifies potential goshawk territories in the study area. 06/63 Thanks for your suggestion. Wildlife/ Goshawk “…maintain a minimum 40-acre yearlong no-treatment buffer around occupied goshawk nest trees. No ground disturbing activities would be allowed inside occupied post-fledging goshawk areas from April 15 to August 15.” Please check/verify R1-C6.316, this is truly a standard. Goshawks typically have low nest-fidelity, year-to-year, moving nests each year. The analysis did neither disclose nor addressed the low-fidelity and attributes associated with a post-fledging area (400-600 acre forest patches). There is nothing in the DEIS relative to goshawk to support this design criterion. 13/14 Thanks for your comment, The design criteria is appropriate if a nest is found during operations. The biologist can mitigate for the impacts on the raptor, which aims for success of the clutch. These can be timing restrictions and/or the retention of more canopy. Post fledging areas are only important when there is an associated nest. Wildlife /Grizzly Bear A grizzly was recently illegally killed (2007) on the Clearwater National Forest. The two forests are administratively combined and are within the Bitterroot recovery zone for grizzly bears. Why wasn’t any mention of grizzlies made in the DEIS? 28/35 See response to comment 03/66 and refer to DEIS, page 3-82 and 3-86. Wildlife /Grizzly Bears The DEIS says there are no grizzly bears in the area. A grizzly bear was killed in Kelly Creek on September 3, 2007. The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest is now known grizzly bear habitat and it is a violation of NEPA to not disclose this. It is also a violation of NFMA to not ensure a viable population of grizzly bears in the project area and is a violation of the ESA to not formally consult with the US FWS to see if this project will adversely affect grizzly bears. 03/165 The grizzly bear killed in Kelly Creek was over 45 miles to the northeast of Clear Creek. See response to comment 03/66 and 28/35 and the DEIS pg. 3-86 regarding the potential presence of grizzly bear in the project area. Wildlife/ Grizzly Bears I saw a large grizzly bear crossing Highway 12 around 11:00 p.m. on August 3rd about 20-25 miles west of the Montana-Idaho border. 03/166 Thanks for your comment.

What surveys have you done to prove this? 03/168 See DEIS: pages 3-91 and 3-92. Wildlife/Lynx This is violation of the ESA and an internal Forest Service memo according to Jim Claar from the Regional Office in Missoula. Mr. Claar told Arlene Montgomery from Friends of the Wild Swan, one of our member groups in a phone conversation that the Forest Service is directed to follow the Northern Rockies lynx management direction in historic lynx habitat. The project area is historic lynx habitat which means it is suitable habitat. 03/169 See response to comment 03/167. The project was analyzed according to the NRLMD. See DEIS: pages 3-91 to 3-93. Wildlife/Lynx The fact that continued implementation of the Forest Plans constitutes a “taking” of the lynx is not disclosed in the EA or in the EA’s Biological Assessment. Such taking can only be authorized with an incidental take statement, issued as part of a Biological Opinion (B.O.) during a Section 7 consultation. The FS must incorporate terms and conditions from a programmatic B.O. into a Forest Plan amendment or revision before projects affecting lynx habitat, such as the North Butte Salvage Project, can be authorized. 03/170 The Clear Creek project is being conducted under an EIS, not an EA. The Biological Assessment will be prepared and available with the FEIS. See response to comment 03/96 and 03/169. Wildlife/Lynx The Programmatic BA’s “likely to adversely affect” conclusion was based upon the following rationale (p. 4), all of which apply here. Forest Plans within the Northern Rockies: generally direct an aggressive fire suppression strategy within developmental land allocations. …this strategy may be contributing to a risk of adversely affecting the Lynx by limiting the availability of foraging habitat within these areas; allow levels of human access via forest roads that may present a risk of incidental trapping or shooting of Lynx or access by other competing carnivores. The risk of road-related adverse effects is primarily a winter season issue; are weak in providing guidance for new or existing recreation developments. Therefore, these activities may contribute to a risk of adverse effects to lynx; allow both mechanized and non-mechanized recreation that may contribute to a risk of adverse effects to lynx. The potential effects occur by allowing compacted snow trails and plowed roads which may facilitate the movements of lynx competitors and predators; provide weak direction for maintaining habitat connectivity within naturally or artificially fragmented landscapes. Plans within all geographic areas lack direction for coordinating construction of 03/171 Completing an amendment for Forest Plans within the Northern Rockies is beyond the scope of this project. The Clear Creek Project is consistent with NRLMD analysis and guidance (see response to comment 03/167) Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response highways and other movement barriers with other responsible agencies. These factors may be contributing to a risk of adverse effects to lynx; fail to provide direction for monitoring of lynx, snowshoe hares, and their habitats. While failure to monitor does not directly result in adverse effects, it makes the detection and assessment of adverse effects from other management activities difficult or impossible to attain; forest management has resulted in a reduction of the area in which natural ecological processes were historically allowed to operate, thereby increasing the area potentially affected by known risk factors to lynx. The Plans have continued this trend. The Plans have also continued the process of fragmenting habitat and reducing its quality and quantity. Consequently, plans may risk adversely affecting lynx by potentially contributing to a reduction in the geographic range of the species; The BA team recommends amending or revising the Plans to incorporate conservation measures that would reduce or eliminate the identified adverse effects to lynx. The programmatic conservation measures listed in the Canada Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy (LCAS) should be considered in this regard, once finalized. Wildlife/Lynx The BA notes that the LCAS identifies the following risk factors to lynx in this geographic area: Timber harvest and precommercial thinning that reduce denning or foraging habitat or converts habitat to less desirable tree species; • Fire exclusion that changes the vegetation mosaic maintained by natural disturbance processes; • Grazing by domestic livestock that reduces forage for lynx prey; • Roads and winter recreation trails that facilitate access to historical lynx habitat by competitors; • Legal and incidental trapping and shooting; • Being hit by vehicles; • Obstructions to lynx movements such as highways and private land development. 03/172 See response to comment 03/167 and the DEIS pages 3-94 to3-99. All measures of the NRLMD would be met for this project. Wildlife/Lynx It is clear, then, that the FS must do more than follow its Forest Plans to protect lynx. Nonetheless, and in spite of the inadequate analysis population viability following adverse modification of habitat perpetuated by the Project, the North Butte Salvage Project BA concludes that the implementation of the proposed action would result in a determination of “may affect but not likely to adversely affect.” 03/173 The comment is not referring to the proposed Clear Creek Project. Wildlife/Lynx The Programmatic BA’s analysis of the ability of the Forest Plans, as ‘amended’ by the LCAS, to prevent a “taking” of the lynx is based upon the Forests’ meeting management standards. As the Lolo NF has not adequately shown that it is in compliance with its old growth 03/175 The Clear Creek Project does not occur on the Lolo NF. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response standards, or that it even has valid old growth standards, as detailed elsewhere in this appeal, the project BA and EA are not in compliance with the LCAS. Wildlife/Lynx The NRLMD failed to consider the cumulative impacts of the loss of key winter lynx habitat on viability, and thus the BiOp for this NRLMD that is being applied to the Project is invalid. 03/176 This comment addresses the NRLMD and is not specific to the Clear Creek project. It is beyond the scope of this project. Wildlife/Lynx The NRLMD failed to consider the cumulative impacts of the loss of key winter lynx habitat on viability, and thus the BiOp for this NRLMD that is being applied to the Project is invalid. There is no analysis, however, of the impact of this past logging on lynx. In the big game section of the EA, it was noted that past logging on private lands in the landscape peaked in 1917 (EA 3-334), and that logging on PCTC peaked in the 1980s (EA 3-344). Although it was noted in this big game section that lands in the Swan Valley landscape have fragmented forest cover as a result of past logging (EA 3-344), this fragmentation is never discussed for lynx or for critical habitat. The Project EA does note, however, that historic lynx foraging habitat is well below (5%) the 19% historic levels (Table 3-72 at 3-243), although the loss of lynx winter foraging habitat in old multistoried forest stands was not identified 03/177 See response to comment 03/175 and 03/176. Comment concerns another project. Wildlife/Lynx The Project Area is noted to be important lynx habitat. Chapter 3 of the DEIS notes that the Clear Creek area has important for lynx; this landscape is important for the recovery of lynx but apparently the DEIS concludes that it is alright to destroy lynx habitat because the Forest Service claims there are no lynx here even though there has been very little effort to survey for them. Thus application of the NRLMD to the Project will not ensure persistence or recovery of lynx in violation of the ESA, and NFMA. 03/178 Please see the lynx analysis in the DEIS pages 3-91 to 3-99. Limited habitat is available in the project area. Wildlife/Lynx There is no analysis in the NRLMD FEIS on the fragmentation impacts of clearcutting and forest thinning on lynx habitat use. This lack of analysis is not due to the availability of science. Squires et al. (2006) noted that clearcuts provide movement barriers to lynx in the winter. The adverse impacts of these barriers was not addressed by management criteria in the NRLMD, or the BiOp for the NRLMD. There is no limit to the percentage of the landscape that may provide movement barriers to lynx within a given LAU. The winter period is the most critical for lynx (Squires et al. 2010), so the impact of barriers in young forest created by logging will clearly affect the ability of lynx to survive and avoid winter starvation. The barrier effects of young forests on lynx is 03/179 See response to comment 03/176. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response clearly demonstrated via radio-telemetry studies on lynx. Appendix B of this appeal includes 3 figures from McMillion 2009, Squires et al. 2006, and Squires et al. 2012 that show avoidance of logged areas by lynx. Wildlife/Lynx Although there is a limit within LAUs that no more than 30% can be in the stand initiation phase, there is no analysis as to why this standard was developed. Why is 30% of the landscape in movement barriers to lynx in the winter acceptable, and what is the basis for assuming that this will ensure persistence? 03/180 See response to comment 03/176. Wildlife/Lynx The NRLMD and associated BiOp and ITS, including as is being applied to the current Project, is invalid because the agencies did not address or consider the cumulative impacts of habitat fragmentation and loss of lynx winter habitat on lynx persistence in a given landscape. 03/181 See response to comment 03/178. Wildlife/Lynx The NRLMD and associated BiOp, as well as the updated BiOp for the Project on 2/13/2013, failed to address the fragmentation impacts of clearcutting and heavy forest thinning as barriers to winter lynx movement. The most obvious failure of the agencies to address this fragmentation is the failure of the NRLMD to define at what stage a clearcut no longer provides a movement barrier to lynx in the winter. This criteria is critical to management of lynx winter habitat. 03/182 See response to comment 03/176. Wildlife/Lynx Applying the NRLMD BiOp to the Clear Creek Project is clearly invalid as lynx persistence is not ensured by application of this conservation plan. Protection of the most key factors in lynx habitat (lynx winter habitat and fragmentation barriers) are not even addressed. Application of the NRLMD as a “proxy” for lynx persistence is invalid. 03/183 See response to comment 03/178. The Forest is required to follow the NRLMD (DEIS, pg3-91). Wildlife/Lynx The NRLMD and associated BiOp cannot ensure the viability of the lynx because recruitment of key winter habitat is not protected or required, and the impacts of logging younger forest stands on lynx is misrepresented; it is described as a beneficial impact when in fact it is highly detrimental. 03/184 See response to comment 03/176. Wildlife/Lynx The DEIS for the Project is invalid because the degradation of lynx habitat via clearcutting and forest thinning is incorrectly defined as “short term;” the long-term impacts of the Project on the lynx require an environmental impact statement using the best available science and formal consultation with the US FWS. 03/185 The project is being assessed under an environmental impact statement as noted by the commenter.

In general, 27/25 Refer to lynx environmental consequences in the FEIS. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response it appears that the limited impact on “travel habitat” is consistent with the 2008 Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction. At the same time, some CBC members question whether the limited number of acres in lynx habitat are critical to meet the project’s purpose and need. Wildlife/Lynx While the DEIS does discuss lynx, it does not come to any solid conclusions, nothing inconsistences in lynx data and information. However, the DEIS does not discuss the adequacy of the NRLMD nor does it discuss the recent federal court decision in Montana that affects lynx and how the agency is supposed to deal with lynx habitat. Connectivity for lynx and other species is important and such a large timber sale will have negative impacts on connectivity. 28/36 The adequacy of the NRMLD is beyond the scope of this project. The effects to Lynx habitat is small (0.5%) in this project. See DEIS, 3-99. Wildlife/ Marten Your stand exam queries appear to have done a better job predicting marten habitat, but the impacts still seem to be low considering the size of Alternatives B, C and D. You regenerate over 2200-4,200 acres of mature stands with Alternatives B, C and D, yet only 800-1200 acres of suitable marten habitat is impacted. 06/57 The difference is that not all mature stands are over the 100 years of age as analyzed in the criteria for suitable marten habitat. Wildlife/ Marten Once again the prediction by Samson (2006) that 17,297 acres would provide enough habitat to meet a minimum viable population estimate appears to be ridiculous. According to your analysis you could maintain the entire Northern Regions marten population within the project area since you supposedly have 17,328 acres of suitable habitat. I also have the same problems with the million acre estimate of suitable habitat from Bush and Lundbergh 2008 report that has been previously discussed for many of the other species. 06/58 See response to comments 06/35 and 06/26. Wildlife/ Monitoring Also, temporal considerations of the impacts on wildlife population viability from implementing something with such long duration as a Forest Plan must be considered (id.) but this has never been done by the NEZ PERCE-CLEARWATER NF. It is also of paramount importance to monitor population during the implementation of the Forest Plan in order to validate assumptions used about long-term species persistence i.e., population viability (Marcot and Murphy, 1992; Lacy and Clark, 1993). 03/120 The Forest Plan provides some temporal considerations on impacts to wildlife populations (NPNF LRMP 1987; Appendix 0).

The Forest Plan directs that steep slopes be classified as unsuitable timber ground and that patches be limited in size. Because of the potential inconsistency with the project, and because Alternatives B, C and D propose only 130, 161 and 29 acres of regeneration harvest, respectively, some members of the CBC suggest that these acres be reconsidered to determine whether they are essential to meet the project’s purpose and need. Other CBC members suggest further elaboration in the FEIS is warranted to disclose impacts to moose winter range from proposed treatments. The CBC supports specific measures be considered to maintain and enhance vegetative attributes beneficial for moose, especially if moose use is evident in the proposed treatment area. Chapter 3 wildlife section of the FEIS will disclose the effects of the proposed activities on moose and moose winter range. Wildlife/ Myotis Bats this is overactive mgt and it is killing the myotis bats. this species cannot take the logging pressure. 14/07 As noted in the DEIS and FEIS analysis for myotis bat species, the project would have both positive and negative effects. Wildlife/ Patch Size The patch size and opening sizes are of great concern. There are some huge blocks of regeneration logging (clearcutting), some of them a few hundred acres in size. How does this meet NFMA? What about the transition between old growth and clearcuts? How does this kind of contiguity, which occurs in some areas, affect the effectiveness of old growth habitat? 28/41 See response to comments 13/05, 3/22 and 6/30.

Again this could be easily estimated based on the average home range size of this species which has been listed at approximately 1,200 acres (Mellen et al. 1992). 06/65 Not all of the woodpeckers may be “paired.” The family unit is what determines the ‘home range’ size, not the individual. Wildlife/Public Involvement Solicit and disclose comments from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game regarding the impact of the Project on wildlife habitat; 03/04 Comments on the DEIS that were submitted by IDFG for the DEIS and during scoping are included in the project file.

If snag densities are not able to be met, then green recruitment or dying trees will be left on site as snag recruitment trees. See DEIS 2-7, 2-8. Wildlife/Snags Snag densities recommended by experts to support cavity-nesting birds range from 2.1 to 11 snags per acre of greater than 9” dbh. Please note that the fact that more recent science has called into question the lower snag densities cited in the earlier research, and the more recent science implies that about 4 snags per acre may be the minimum required to insure viability. 03/122 This project is using target stands for the forest, which recommends 4 or more snags per acre (average). See DEIS 2-7, 2-8. Additional snags will be available within PACFISH buffers which will retain all live trees and snags. Wildlife/Snags After snags are cut down for safety for OSHA requirements will there still be enough snags left for old growth sensitive species? 03/155 No harvest would occur in old growth or within PACFISH buffers. Any unit not meeting snag densities would leave green trees for snag recruitment. Wildlife/ Song Birds Much of the Clear Creek Roadless area slated for fire treatment is currently prime bird habitat. While a few species of concern are identified in the plan, the area is teeming with bird species, most of which nest in the proposed burning areas. As an avid birder I use the roadless area frequently to observe birds (a partial list is included). Burning out the underbrush will destroy much of this habitat. 11/02 Burns will happen over time, allowing animals in that area a chance to disperse to other favorable habitats. Fire can also stimulate vigor in shrubs and provide habitat for many bird species. Wildlife/ Vegetation The wildlife habitat and the vegetation sections seem to be inconsistent. Some of the numbers in the chart on page 3-84 don’t match the descriptions of vegetation. For example, the VRU tables suggest more acreage of stands of trees 21 inches and greater than is habitat for pileated woodpeckers or goshawks, which are old growth indicator species or for the two bat species, who use these older trees. This problem exists for other species. 28/26 See response to comment 6/35. Wildlife/ Viability The FS should firmly establish that the species that exist, or historically are believed to have been present in the analysis area are still part of viable populations. Since Forest Plan monitoring efforts have failed in this regard, it must be a priority for project analyses. Identification of viable populations is something that must be done at a specific geographic scale. The analysis must cover a large enough area to include a cumulative effects analysis area that would include truly viable populations.

Our disagreement is supported by the analysis in the Fuels section of Chapter 3 of the EIS. When fuels are reduced, fires burn with less intensity and have shorter flame lengths. Consequently, firefighting forces are more likely to be able to control a fire. It logically follows that a less intense fire burning in light fuels will produce fewer firebrands, resulting in a slower rate of spread. Fire Dr. Cohen states “Ecosystem restoration treatment and fuel treatment are not synonymous.” How does the Clear Creek timber sale differ such that Dr. Cohen’s conclusion is not true in this timber sale location? 10/34 The comment is unclear.

The authors discuss the differences between high, mixed, and low severity fire regimes and the different forest types characteristic of each one. They conclude that fire regimes, climate, fuel type and abundance, and stand structure vary significantly across the Rocky Mountain region and thus suggest that a “one-size-fits-all” approach to reducing wildfire hazards in the Rocky Mountain region is unlikely to be effective. Within mixed severity fire regimes, the authors conclude, “fuel reduction treatments (mechanical thinning and prescribed burning) may effectively reduce fire severity under moderate weather conditions, but these treatments may not effectively mitigate fire behavior under extreme weather conditions.” The fuel modeling conducted for this project suggests that treatments will be effective at modifying fire behavior to reduce the potential for high severity crown fire within treated areas under normal summer conditions. Fire Dr. Schoennagel is a research scientist in CU-Boulder's geography department.

The Fire and Fuels section of the EIS shows that post-treatment areas would be unlikely to initiate or sustain a crown fire. It is the infrequent dry, hot, and windy conditions (97th percentile) that any fuels treatment is ineffective at reducing fire behavior due to long spotting distances, extremely dry fuel beds, and stands still being able to initiate and sustain crown fires. Topic Comment Letter/ Comment Response Silviculture/ Logging The public expects the men and women who they pay to care for their national forests to understand how national policies created by a timber lobbyist (Mark Rey) appointed by bush to increase the cut from national forests is still driving the agency to do things the public abhors 10/45 This is the commenter’s opinion. Fire The Clear Creek timber sale directly contradicts the truths stated by a person with a Ph.D. who specializes in fire and protection from fire damage, 10/46 The cited article is opinion commentary written 10 years ago about the implementation of the National Fire Plan, which has little relevance to the this project. Public Involvement This timber sale is inconsistent with what the public wants the agency employees administering the national forest to do as documented in the USFS-authored document: Gen.

The survey also indicated there is wide support for the strategic goal of promoting ecosystem health and conservation using a collaborative approach to sustain the Nation’s forests, grasslands, and watersheds (page 2). This project is consistent with the strategic plan objectives supporting this goal: a) improve and protect watershed conditions; b) provide ecological conditions to sustain viable populations of native and desired nonnative species; c) increase the amount of forests and grasslands restored to or maintained in a healthy condition with reduced risk and damage from fires, insects and diseases, and invasive species. Public Involvement There is no “timber famine” as the USFS has been so fond of predicting for many decades. There is no shortage of raw materials for paper and wood products in the United States otherwise the owners of private timberland would not be exporting their lumber.
