Abstract: This Final Environmental Impact Statement documents the analysis of two alternatives,
including the “no action” alternative, that were developed for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project. The Notice of Intent to prepare this document was published in the Federal Register on
December 12, 2012. The Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on
March 28, 2014, for public review and comment. Comments that were received, including names and
addresses of those who commented, are part of the public record for this project and are available for
public inspection. Comments were used to develop the alternatives considered in this Final
Environmental Impact Statement. The alternatives, including design and mitigation measures, respond to
public comments regarding rehabilitation actions, fish habitat, water quality, cultural, soil and mineral
resources, and frame the issues related to this decision. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
proposes to improve fish habitat by restoring channel and floodplain functions, restoring instream fish
habitat complexity, and improving water quality along approximately 2 miles of the Crooked River in the
Crooked River Valley, Idaho. Alternative 2 is the preferred alternative.
This Final Environmental Impact Statement will be accompanied by a Record of Decision that will
identify the alternative selected by the Forest Supervisor for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project.

Organization of the Final Environmental Impact Statement
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Final Environmental Impact Statement (Final EIS) is
organized into six chapters and six appendices:
• Summary.
• Chapter 1 (Purpose and Need for Action). Chapter 1 describes the purpose and need of
the proposed project, the history of the affected area, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Forest Service (Forest Service) and Nez Perce Tribe’s proposal to achieve the purpose and
fulfill the need. This chapter also describes how the Forest Service, Nez Perce Tribe, U.S.
Department of Energy Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), and U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) informed the public of the proposal and how the public responded.
• Chapter 2 (Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative). Chapter 2 provides a more
detailed description of the Forest Service and Nez Perce Tribe’s proposed action and the
alternatives for achieving the stated need. These alternatives were developed with
consideration of significant issues raised by the public and other agencies. This chapter also
describes the mitigation measures to be implemented for the action alternative and provides a
summary table of the environmental consequences associated with each alternative.
• Chapter 3 (Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences). Chapter 3
describes the existing conditions of various resources and discusses environmental effects of
implementing the alternatives, including the preferred alternative. It is organized by resource
topic (e.g., fish habitat and species, watershed, soils, and cultural resources).
• Chapter 4 (List of Preparers, Public Involvement Consultation, Distribution List).
Chapter 4 provides a list of preparers, summary of public involvement, the agencies
consulted during the development of this Final EIS, and the distribution list of this Final EIS.
• Chapter 5 (Laws and Regulations). Chapter 5 provides a summary of laws and regulations
that guided the development of this document.
• Chapter 6 (Acronyms and Glossary). Chapter 6 provides a glossary of terms and
acronyms used in the Final EIS.
• Appendices. The appendices consist of supporting information for the Final EIS and include
the following: Appendix A – conceptual drawings of the proposed stream restoration
actions, Appendix B – Clean Water Act 404(b)(1) analysis, Appendix C – cumulative
effects, Appendix D – proposed Forest Plan amendments, Appendix E – best management
practices for mercury collection from Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project,
Appendix F – Comments received on the DEIS and responses, and Appendix G –
references used in preparing the Final EIS.
• Index.
Additional documentation, including more-detailed analyses of project-area resources, may be
found in the project record located at the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests office in
Grangeville, Idaho.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

SUMMARY
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, in cooperation with the Nez Perce Tribe,
Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), has
prepared this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) to disclose the potential effects of
the proposed Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, in compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 United States Code [U.S.C.] 4321 et seq.) and other
relevant federal and state laws and regulations. This Final EIS discloses direct, indirect, and
cumulative environmental consequences and irreversible or irretrievable commitments of
resources and alternatives, including the preferred alternative.
The proposed Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project consists of restoring and improving
2.0 miles of Crooked River, known as the Meanders. The project area is located in the Crooked
River watershed, within the Red River Ranger District in the Nez Perce – Clearwater National
Forests in north-central Idaho, approximately 5 miles west of Elk City, Idaho. The project
boundary extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho
Department of Fish and Game intake weir) to approximately 2.0 miles upstream.
The project would help restore Crooked River and its floodplain that have been significantly
degraded by past land management activities, most importantly mining and road construction.
These activities have substantially affected the sediment regimes (various physical processes that
affect sediment) in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream, riparian and floodplain
functions in the main stem of Crooked River. Fire suppression, mining, road construction, and
timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural hydrologic and geomorphic processes
in the watershed. Over the long term, this shift has led to changes in streamflows and a reduction
in the amount of large pieces of wood and rock in the stream. The area surrounding Crooked
River was mined for mineral resources from the early 1900s through the 1950s. Mining waste
(also referred to as mine tailings) is concentrated in the valley bottom, altering the physical
condition of the stream system, restricting the natural migration pattern of the stream and other
changes in channel morphology (channel size, form, and function), and impairing the
recolonization of riparian vegetation and its function as a natural buffer. These alterations
resulted in a significant reduction of productive aquatic habitat for listed fish species. Within the
project area there are Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed Snake River Basin steelhead
(steelhead) and Columbia River bull trout (bull trout); and the Forest Service sensitive species
listed spring/summer Chinook salmon (spring Chinook salmon)(USDA Forest Service 2011b).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Purpose and Need for Action
Historic mining activities have altered the Crooked River valley and have led to degraded fish
habitat, causing inadequate densities of fish in Crooked River. The Forest Service needs to
restore the Crooked River valley to improve fish habitat and water quality in Crooked
River. The proposed action would achieve goals and objectives in the Forest Plan, improve
habitat conditions in a below objective watershed, improve habitat for ESA-listed and sensitive
fish species, and respond to objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe. To meet the purpose and need,
the proposed action is to restore channel and floodplain functions, restore instream fish habitat
complexity, and improve water quality in the Crooked River valley. These actions should
rehabilitate the valley to a state where the hydrologic and geomorphic processes sustain more
appropriate habitat condition for fish in Crooked River.
The Crooked River watershed contains important aquatic resources and identified with high
aquatic potential (90%), but existing habitat conditions cause the Lower Crooked River
watershed to be below this objective, established in the Nez Perce National Forest Land and
Resource Management Plan (also referred to as the Nez Perce Forest Plan, and as Forest Plan in
this document [USDA Forest Service 1987a, as amended]). Crooked River provides habitat for
steelhead and bull trout, which are listed as threatened species under the ESA, and is designated
as critical habitat for both species. It also provides habitat for westslope cutthroat trout, resident
rainbow trout (redband), and spring/summer Chinook salmon, all considered by the Forest
Service to be sensitive fish species in the Nez Perce National Forest (USDA Forest Service
1987a; USDA Forest Service 2011b). Crooked River also supports whitefish and nongame
species such as sculpin. Pacific lamprey have not been found in the project area in recent years,
but the lower reaches of Crooked River are likely historic habitat (NPCC 2005).
The proposed action responds to the goals and objectives outlined in the Forest Plan and would
improve conditions in the project area and move the area toward the desired future conditions.
The Forest Plan provides direction for the management of the Crooked River project area and
defines the habitat conditions necessary for salmonid spawning and rearing. In addition, the
proposed action responds to the objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe by protecting, restoring, and
enhancing watersheds within proximity of their ceded territory. The existing conditions were
determined using field data collected by River Design Group, Inc. (RDG), for the Design
Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation and Design (RDG et al. 2012), the Final
Design Report (RDG et al. 2013a), the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project Wetland
Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012), and the South Fork Clearwater
River Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998). The reports that resulted from these
studies are not decision documents; therefore, the recommendations provided in the reports were
considered as recommendations only, rather than direction.

Public Involvement
This project was first listed on the Forest Schedule of Proposed Actions on January 1, 2012 and
has been updated quarterly. Project information on the Nez Perce National Forest website was
created on November 13, 2012 at: http://www.fs.fed.us/nepa/nepa_project_exp.php?project=40648.
On this website, the forest has posted public letters, notices, and documents overtime as they
became available.
The Notice of Intent for the project was published in the Federal Register (Volume 77, No. 239,
Page 73976) on December 12, 2012, with a 45-day comment period. In addition, as part of the
public involvement process, the Forest Service mailed the scoping letter with a description of the
proposed action to 395 potentially interested parties on November 30, 2012. To solicit input on
the proposed action the Forest Service held two public meetings: January 17, 2013, in
Grangeville, Idaho; and January 28, 2013, in Elk City, Idaho. Twenty-eight comment letters
were received. As an opportunity for a site visit to the project area, two field trips were
scheduled in June 2013, one with those who comments on the scoping letter and one with
regulatory agencies.
The legal notice of the Draft EIS’s public availability was published in the Lewiston Morning
Tribune on March 27, 2014, and the official Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was
published in the Federal Register on March 28, 2014. To solicit input on the proposed action the
Forest Service held two public meetings: May 6, 2014, in Grangeville, Idaho; and May 8, 2014,
in Elk City, Idaho. A copy of the federal register and legal notice was posted on the project
webpage. Twenty-seven comment letters were received (See Appendix F).
A detailed description of public involvement and consultation is presented in Chapter 4.

Issues
The Forest Service worked closely with the public to identify issues and concerns. These issues
were grouped into the following categories: aquatic resources, water quality, cultural resources,
mineral resources, and recreation. The following alternatives were developed to address these
grouped issues. Chapter 2, describes issues and concerns in more detail.
The following alternatives were developed to address these issues.

Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
The action proposed by the Forest Service and the Nez Perce Tribe is to improve fish habitat in
Crooked River by implementing the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. Two
alternatives in this document were analyzed by their effects to substantive issues. Nine other
alternatives were considered but eliminated from detailed study. Detailed description of
alternatives, comparison of alternatives, and a summary of the effects are provided in Chapter 2.
The Narrows Road component of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project was removed

from detailed study in this EIS by the deciding official in December 2013. See Chapter 2 for
more details.
No Action (Alternative 1)
This alternative provides a baseline for comparing the environmental consequences of other
alternatives as required by NEPA. Under the No Action alternative, no project actions, including
funding from BPA, would be implemented by the Forest Service and the Nez Perce Tribe, or
permitting decision(s) by the USACE would be implemented. No rehabilitation of Crooked
River would occur.
Proposed Action (Alternative 2)
This alternative was developed in response to the purpose and need for action identified from
existing conditions to improve fish habitat and water quality, which have been altered as a result
of past mining and other activities. It was presented for public scoping in December 2012.
Alternative 2 would move the project area towards habitat considered optimal for salmonid
spawning and rearing, and the desired future condition as identified in the Forest Plan, including
the water quality/fish objective.
Alternative 2 proposes to rehabilitate the lower 2.0 miles of Crooked River, known as the
Meanders. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the
mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir) to approximately
2.0 miles upstream. The valley width includes Road 233 on the east side of the valley to the base
of the hillslope on the west side of the valley. This alternative would rehabilitate up to 115 acres
of floodplain by moving existing dredge tailings, reconstructing approximately 7,400 feet of
stream channel, installing woody bank structures, constructing more than 2,700 feet of side
channels, creating conditions for 64 acres of wetlands, and replanting the valley bottom with
native and approved non-native plant species. This alternative would construct, use and
decommission a temporary bypass channel/haul road of approximately 6,000 feet. The project
would be implemented over approximately 6 years (2015–2021).
The design of the new river channel and floodplain was developed to provide a landscape
capable of sustaining geomorphic processes to support desired aquatic habitat and vegetative
conditions. The desired future geomorphic condition includes restoring river and floodplain
functions by reducing channel entrenchment, establishing pool development processes,
addressing stream flows and ponding, and modifying the channel hydraulics to produce flows
that would support a mobile gravel bed (produce spawning areas). The proposed design provides
these conditions. The shape of the new river channel and overall valley bottom was determined
through successive iterations of hydrologic analysis, terrain model development, earthwork
analysis and hydraulic modeling. The Design Criteria Report (RDG et al 2012) and Final Design
Report (RDG et al 2013) provide the parameters used to develop the design and the model
results. As stated in Chapter 2, an infinite number of river configurations could have been

developed, all of which would produce similar results and effects because the functions of the
valley bottom would be restored.
The river channel through the valley was historically dynamic and likely occupied all areas of
the valley bottom at one point or another through lateral migration. Historic photos would
provide a single snapshot of where the river existed at that point in time. Although the proposed
design may not restore the channel to the exact condition as it was just prior to the mining
activities, the processes that formed and sustained the river channel historically would be
rehabilitated.
This alternative would require two project–specific forest plan amendments (cultural resources
and soil resources).

Major Conclusions
Major conclusions related to potential consequences from proposed activities include:
•

Proposed activities would move the Lower Crooked River watershed towards the Forest
Plan Fishery/Water quality objectives identified in the Forest Plan. Proposed activities
would provide improvement to fish habitat conditions by improving pool quality,
increasing large woody debris recruitment, and increasing spawning habitat and higherquality rearing habitat. These changes would improve overall fish habitat complexity in
Crooked River from the existing condition.

•

Proposed activities would have a short-term potential to adversely affect Endangered
Species Act(ESA)-listed threatened fish species (steelhead and bull trout), and may
impact five sensitive fish species (westslope cutthroat trout, interior redband trout, Pacific
lamprey, western pearlshell mussel, and spring Chinook salmon). ESA, Section 7,
consultation with federal agencies have come to closure with the determinations in the
Biological Assessment. When the Forest receives the Biological Opinions, consultation
will be completed for ESA listed fish species.

•

Proposed activities would have a short term direct effect on instream turbidity levels, but
design and mitigation measures would be implemented to minimize turbidity increases
during instream activities. Activities would be performed in compliance with the terms
and conditions set forth in the NPDES permit and CWA Section 401 water quality
certification, which provide reasonable assurance that the Idaho State Water Quality
standard for turbidity would not be exceeded.

•

Proposed activities would have a short- and long-term effect on the geomorphology of
the lower 2 miles of Crooked River. Channel morphology and sediment transport/bed
mobility would be improved.

•

Floodplain function would be improved by increasing the floodplain area, with the
bankfull floodplain area increasing and upland floodplain decreasing. Interaction
between the stream channel and floodplain would be restored with floodplain inundation

occurring more frequently at flows greater than the 1.1-year recurrence interval, and
sustainable floodplain morphology would be established that is capable of supporting
aquatic habitat and desired vegetation communities, which would provide more
ecological functions than currently exist. All required permits would be obtained prior
to implementation.
•

Proposed activities would have a short- and long-term effect on wetlands. The proposed
activities would adversely impact 31 of 52 total acres of wetland during construction, and
create 42 acres of wetlands. The result would be an overall increase from 52 acres to
64 acres of wetlands in the long term, which is a net increase of 12 acres of wetlands.
Wetlands are expected to increase in both area and diversity with the proposed action.
The Forest would apply for a Joint 404 Permits and Stream Alteration Permit, from the
Idaho Department of Water Resources and USACE.

•

Proposed activities would have a short- and long-term effect on water quality. Design and
mitigation measures, including compliance monitoring for turbidity, would be
implemented to minimize turbidity and prevent the Idaho State water quality standard for
turbidity from being exceeded. Water temperature in Crooked River currently exceeds
Idaho State water quality standards. The proposed activities to restore channel and
floodplain functions and re-establish vegetation would move toward meeting
requirements in the South Fork Clearwater River Total Maximum Daily Load in Crooked
River to reduce water temperatures in the long term (IDEQ and EPA 2003).

•

Proposed activities would have both short- and long-term effects on one National Historic
Register site. Measures meant to recover significant values of the site have been
identified. All cultural properties in the project area have been evaluated for their
National Register eligibility. Consultation with the Idaho State Preservation Office
would be completed prior to signing the decision. A project-specific Forest Plan
amendment is proposed.

•

Proposed activities would change the conditions of the Meanders area to have desired
plant communities that would improve soil conditions over time. Both the alder and
mixed shrub communities (riparian) would increase substantially compared to the
existing conifer/tall forb communities (upland/ tailing piles). Proposed activities would
lay the foundation to rebuild soil functions, including chemical and biological properties
adjacent to Crooked River.

•

Proposed activities would change the amount of detrimental soil disturbance from a level
that currently exceeds the Forest Plan standards. By implementing proposed activities
the amount of detrimental soil disturbance would decrease from 65 to 4 percent, over the
next 20 years. A project-specific Forest Plan amendment is proposed.

•

Proposed activities would have no effect on one threatened wildlife species (lynx). The
proposal may impact four sensitive wildlife species (western toad, gray wolf, harlequin
duck, and fisher). Western toads are present in the project area and the project would

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

have short-term direct effects to this species and their habitat. A loss of potential
breeding habitat and mortality during construction could occur. Non-breeding habitat
would increase and overall habitat conditions would improve as the floodplain functions
are restored.
•

Proposed activities would displace Forest Plan management indicator species (elk,
moose, pine marten), and other species in the short term. A long-term reduction in
ponded foraging moose habitat would occur with channel and floodplain restoration;
however, foraging habitat in the floodplain would improve over time. No change to elk
habitat effectiveness level would occur in any elk units.

•

The proposal may impact one sensitive plant species (Idaho barren strawberry) following
the restoration of the floodplain, which would make the habitat too wet for the species.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area does not contain habitat or
populations of threatened or endangered plant species.

•

Proposed activities would have a short-term effect on two developed and 18 dispersed
recreation sites in the project area, for up to 6 years during implementation. In the long
term, the same number of existing dispersed and developed sites would be available for
use. Fishing access would be limited during construction because of the area closure, but
in the long term the public would have walking access to fishing in the restored Crooked
River stream channel. No changes to the recreation opportunity spectrum would occur,
and visual quality objectives would be met.

•

Proposed activities would have negligible impacts to air quality.

•

Proposed activities would have the potential to have a short-term effect on access to some
mineral claims and an increase to placer claim reclamation bonds in the future. There
would be no effect on actual mineral resources.

•

Invasive plant species are present and the extent of weed spread following
implementation would depend on the implementation and effectiveness of design and
mitigation measures. Proposed activities would create a more fully functioning hydraulic
condition, and is expected to cause a decline in non-native invasive plant species
populations over time.

•

Proposed activities would have short-term effects to the public during construction in the
form of traffic delays and a Forest Supervisor area closure that would be in place for up
to 6 years.

•

Proposed activities would have potential beneficial short-term effects for employment
and long-term recreation-based economic benefits. It was estimated that Alternative 2
could contribute approximately 24 jobs and provide just under million in labor income, or
4 jobs and $161,000 in labor income each year, over 6 years, The cost of the project is
estimated at $2.5 million and would potentially be funded through the BPA Fish and
Wildlife Program.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION

Purpose and Need
Historic mining activities have altered the Crooked River valley and have led to degraded fish
habitat, causing inadequate densities of fish in Crooked River. The Forest Service needs to
restore the Crooked River valley to improve fish habitat and water quality in Crooked River.
The proposed action would achieve goals and objectives in the Forest Plan, improve habitat for
Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed and sensitive fish species, improve stream conditions in a
below objective watershed, and respond to objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe. To meet the
purpose and need, the proposed action is to restore channel and floodplain functions, restore
instream fish habitat complexity, and improve water quality in the Crooked River valley. These
actions should rehabilitate the valley to a state where the hydrologic and geomorphic processes
sustain more appropriate habitat condition for fish in Crooked River.
The activities proposed by the Forest Service and the Nez Perce Tribe consist of restoring and
improving 2.0 miles of Crooked River, known as the Meanders. The project area is located in
the Crooked River watershed, within the Red River Ranger District in the Nez Perce –
Clearwater National Forests in north-central Idaho, approximately 5 miles west of Elk City,
Idaho. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends from 0.1 miles upstream from the
mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir) to approximately
2.0 miles upstream. The valley width includes Road 233 on the east side of the valley to the base
of the hillslope on the west side of the valley. The location is Township 29 North, Range 7 East,
Sections 25 and 36; and Township 28 North, Range 7 East, Section 1. A vicinity map depicting
the location of the proposed activities is shown in Figure 1-1.

Existing Condition
During the 1930s through 1950s the entire main stem of Crooked River was heavily impacted by
dredge mining, which left large tailings piles and deep ponds throughout the valley bottom.
Physical changes to the valley bottom have altered stream and riparian processes, and have
affected aquatic and terrestrial habitat conditions that resulted in degraded ecosystem conditions
relative to historic conditions. The lower 2.0 miles have been altered so drastically that
hydrologic and geomorphic condition resemble that of a spring-fed creek instead of a snow-melt
dominated system, instream complexity is low, the majority of the streambed is armored, and the
recolonization of native riparian vegetation has been impaired. The existing habitat conditions
cause the Lower Crooked River watershed to be identified below the established habitat potential
(50%, a below the objective watershed) in the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987, as
amended).

Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Desired Condition
Desired aquatic habitat in the project area is a rehabilitated landscape and stream corridor
capable of supporting natural aquatic processes and sustaining the habitat requirements of the
focal aquatic species (steelhead, bull trout, spring/summer Chinook salmon) for a range of life
stages and seasonal behavior patterns. This would include an accessible and functioning
floodplain, natural stream meanders, complex fish habitat, healthy riparian vegetation, and
improved water quality (USDA Forest Service 1987a). The Lower Crooked River watershed
contains important aquatic resources and with high aquatic potential (90% fishery/water quality
objective) established in the Forest Plan. Crooked River is designated critical habitat for
steelhead (70 FR 52630) and serves as habitat for Chinook salmon, cutthroat trout, whitefish and
bull trout. Crooked River should provide habitat requirements for steelhead, which includes
clean, unembedded gravels, large woody debris, riparian cover, and hydraulic complexity, and
are similar habitat requirements for the other mentioned species. Comments on the Draft EIS
asked for more information on the historic conditions of the project area and the alignment of the
proposed river channel. The desired condition of the channel and floodplain would be based on
hydrologic, hydraulic, terrain and earthwork analysis in the project area to support desired
functions. The desired condition is not to restore the valley to its exact condition prior to mining
activities, but a channel, floodplain and valley with the hydrologic and geomorphic processes to
sustain more appropriate habitat condition for fish.

Proposed Action
The proposed action is to reconstruct 2.0 valley miles of Crooked River. Restoration of the
valley bottom and stream channel would provide habitat for ESA-listed fish. This would be
achieved by: grading the majority of the tailings piles and reconstructing the river and its
floodplain to create natural stream sinuosity and morphology; restoring floodplain and
hydrologic functions; constructing instream channel structures to provide spawning and rearing
habitat for steelhead, spring/summer Chinook salmon, bull trout, and cutthroat trout; improving
water quality; and restoring riparian areas.
In addition, the proposed action would maintain campsites in the project area and preserve
heritage resource areas as identified by the Forest Service Archeologist through consultation with
the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO).
Primary elements of the proposed action would include:
•
•
•

Salvaging existing material onsite (trees, brush, rocks, etc.) to use in the reconstructed
channel and floodplain.
Constructing a temporary bypass channel to provide fish passage during construction.
Constructing a temporary access route for the movement of heavy equipment through the
project area.

Creating stream morphology features, including stream slope, meanders, and pool/riffle
ratios, that would provide quality habitat for fish and allow for a more natural hydrologic
function to maintain these features in the future.
Balancing earthwork quantities to maximize bankfull floodplain area by filling in tailings
ponds and developing a sloped valley bottom along the east edge of the project area
without removing material from the project area.
Stabilizing re-constructed streambanks using woody material and brush.
Creating areas that would support wetland development over time.
Re-vegetating the floodplain with native and approved non-native vegetation, and
maintain for several years after project completion through replanting and protection
from browse.

The design of the new river channel and floodplain was developed to provide a landscape
capable of sustaining geomorphic processes to support desired aquatic habitat and vegetative
conditions. The desired future geomorphic condition includes restoring river and floodplain
functions by reducing channel entrenchment, establishing pool development processes,
addressing stream flows and ponding, and modifying the channel hydraulics to produce flows
that would support a mobile gravel bed (produce spawning areas). The proposed design provides
these conditions. The shape of the new river channel and overall valley bottom was determined
through successive iterations of hydrologic analysis, terrain model development, earthwork
analysis and hydraulic modeling. The Design Criteria Report (RDG et al 2012) and Final Design
Report (RDG et al 2013) provide the parameters used to develop the design and the model
results. As stated in Chapter 2, an infinite number of river configurations could have been
developed, all of which would produce similar results and effects because the functions of the
valley bottom would be restored.
The river channel through the valley was historically dynamic and likely occupied all areas of
the valley bottom at one point or another through lateral migration. Historic photos would
provide a single snapshot of where the river existed at that point in time. Although the proposed
design may not restore the channel to the exact condition as it was just prior to the mining
activities, the processes that formed and sustained the river channel historically would be
rehabilitated.
Details of the current condition and proposed action (e.g., stream channel dimensions) are
provided in Chapter 3, in the Aquatic and Water Resources sections, Appendix A, and the project
record.

Scope of Analysis
The scope of this proposal is limited to activities related to the purpose and need as well as
measures necessary to mitigate the effects these activities may have on the environment. Direct,
indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of past, ongoing, and reasonably foreseeable
future actions are analyzed in Chapter 3 for all of these activities. Cumulative effects are also
discussed in Appendix C.

Decision Framework
Based on the effects of the alternatives, the responsible Forest Service official would decide the
following:
•
•
•
•

Should the lower Crooked River valley be rehabilitated or not, and if so, to what extent?
What design and mitigation measures would be included?
What, if any, monitoring and evaluation would be included?
Whether the decision requires any Forest Plan amendments, and if so, what elements of
the Forest Plan are to be amended for this project?

Following the Forest Service decision:
•

BPA would decide whether or not to fund the proposed project.

•

USACE would decide whether or not to provide authorization for the project.

Project Background
The Crooked River valley bottom was dredge mined with a bucket dredge from the 1930s
through the 1950s, which left large tailings piles and ponds. Mining waste (also referred to as
tailings piles) is concentrated around the stream corridor, altering the physical, hydrologic, and
geomorphic conditions of the stream system; restricting the natural pattern of stream migration
and other changes in channel morphology (channel size, form, and function); and inhibiting the
recolonization of native riparian vegetation.
In the Crooked River watershed, past land management activities, most importantly mining and
road construction, have substantially affected the sediment regimes (various physical processes
that affect sediment transport) in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream, riparian and
floodplain function in the main stem of Crooked River. Fire suppression, road construction, and
timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural processes in the watershed. For
example, disturbances shift from less frequent events of mixed severity to chronic events (such
as mass erosion). Over the long term, this shift has led to changes in streamflows, greater
deposition of sediment in streams, and a reduction in the amount of large pieces of wood and
rock in streams. These alterations have included degraded channel morphology and reduced
quantity of productive aquatic habitat.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The Forest Plan guides all activities related to the management of natural resources and
establishes management standards for lands administered by the Nez Perce National Forest
(USDA Forest Service 1987a, as amended). The Forest Plan describes resource management
practices, levels of resource production and management, and the availability and suitability of
lands for resource management. The Forest Plan identified the need to improve fish habitat
conditions in the project area. The Lower Crooked River watershed was identified as a below
objective watershed with plans for direct habitat improvement for anadromous fish (Forest Plan,
Appendix A).
On February 24, 1995, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management signed a decision
adopting an interim strategy for managing anadromous-fish-producing watersheds on lands
administered by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in eastern Oregon and
Washington, Idaho, and portions of California, commonly referred to as PACFISH (USDA
Forest Service and USDI BLM 1995). This decision amends regional guides and forest land and
resource management plans that guide the management of lands in the National Forest System.
Where compatible, the decision also provides management direction that is consistent with
Bureau of Land Management land-use plans and, thereby, establishes interim goals, objectives,
and standards and guidelines for these anadromous-fish-producing watersheds. The intended
effect of the decision is to provide additional protective management of the watersheds in the
affected areas to avoid limiting the choice of reasonable alternatives that may be developed in
geographically specific environmental analyses of long-term management strategies.
Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) is designated on
Crooked River pursuant Sec 305 (b) 50 CFR 600.920 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery
Conservation and Management Act. The act defines habitat as all streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands
and other currently viable water bodies and most of the historically accessible habitat to Pacific
Salmon Species. Crooked River is also ESA section 7 designated Critical Habitat for both ESA
Threatened Snake River steelhead and Columbia River bull trout. Designated Critical Habitat for
these species (70 CFR 52630, 50 CFR 17) is defined as specific areas within the geographical
area occupied by the species, if they contain physical and biological features essential to
conservation and features require special management consideration and protection.
The South Fork Clearwater River Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998)
characterized the ecological and social conditions in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin
and provided the context for subsequent ecosystem analyses, including Crooked River. Within
the Crooked River Ecological Reporting Unit, the integrated area theme for lower Crooked River
was identified as Restore Aquatic Processes (Map 48). Review of the existing conditions in
lower Crooked River identified the primary departure from historic disturbance regimes in
Crooked River as being associated with the riparian and instream processes of the mainstem
channel. A very high priority rating was identified with the aquatic theme for lower Crooked
River for the restoration of stream/riparian processes and the sediment regime in the main
channel of Crooked River. Restoration in the lower watershed was recommended to focus
Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

primarily on restoring, to the extent possible, the hydrologic and riparian processes of the
mainstem channel, with aquatic habitat creation being the end result. This type of restoration
would provide increased habitat potential for steelhead and spring Chinook, along with
subadult/adult rearing habitat for bull trout and westslope cutthroat in the upper subbasin.
Restoration of this channel would greatly improve the connectivity to the rest of the subbasin of
the existing good habitat and populations in the upper watershed. This document also identified
that the historical range of steelhead was from the Pacific Ocean to head headwaters of the
Rockies in most streams, both perennial and intermittent. Steelhead historic spawning and
rearing habitat included the lower reaches of the mainstem South Fork Clearwater River
tributaries where, “Johns Creek, Newsome Creek, Tenmile Creek, and Crooked River provided
the most optimal spawning and rearing habitat for this species” (SFCWR-LA, p. 70). This
document also provides the historic ranges of Chinook salmon and bull trout, which includes
Crooked River.
The Clearwater Subbasin Management Plan (NPCC 2005) was the first of approximately
60 subbasin plans intended to provide an up-to-date biological assessment of fish and wildlife
populations, a synthesis of past and ongoing fish and wildlife management activities, the
identification of factors currently limiting fish and wildlife production, a description of strategies
to address the limiting factors, and a prioritization framework for future fish and wildlife
activities in the face of limited resources for each subbasin. The document was intended to guide
future fish and wildlife projects in the Clearwater River Subbasin.
The Snake River Steelhead Recovery Plan for the Clearwater Subbasin (NMFS, 2011)
emphasizes the importance of riparian restoration on Crooked River. This plan identified priority
areas for restoration primarily associated with major spawning areas (Snake River Steelhead and
associated designated critical habitat in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin) including the lower
Crooked River and Meanders section. Direction to meet these recovery goals include restore
stream channel and riparian function in these reaches impacted by historic dredging. The lower
reaches of Crooked River are not just identified by the Snake River Steelhead Recovery plan as
important spawning habitat but, could be utilized by juvenile steelhead at some stage in their
freshwater rearing stage as they prepare for outmigration to the Pacific Ocean. The plan
identifies Crooked River important for riparian habitat restoration and integral to steelhead
recovery (p.3-61).
The South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and Total Maximum Daily Loads (IDEQ
and EPA 2003) addresses the water bodies in the South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin that
have been placed on the Clean Water Act, Section 303(d) list, including Crooked River.
Crooked River has a TMDL for sediment and water temperature.
The American and Crooked River Project Environmental Impact Statement and Record of
Decision (USDA Forest Service 2005a) analyzed the environmental consequences of reducing
forest fuels through various timber harvest methods and implementing watershed improvements

in the Crooked River watershed. Most of the projects addressed by that EIS have been
completed.
The Design Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012),
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental
Consulting 2012), and Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG
et al. 2013a) summarize an investigation and evaluation of the lower 2 miles of Crooked River
that are being considered for restoration. These studies were commissioned to document the
existing conditions within the stream system, provide a design and the appropriate criteria for
restoring the stream, riparian corridor, and floodplain, and evaluate the ability to mitigate the
environmental disturbance of past mining within the watershed.
The Crooked River Archaeological Survey (Desert West Environmental 2013a) describes the
heritage resources in the project area. The Gnome Townsite above the project area was fully
surveyed and documented as mitigation for the proposed action and is covered in this survey.
The Native Materials Inventory: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG and Geum
Environmental Consulting 2012) describes the inventory of existing native materials, such as
soil, trees, rocks, and instream habitat structures in the project area. The purpose of the
inventory was to estimate the quantity of native material available for use in proposed
rehabilitation efforts.
Similar restoration work has been completed in the Clark Fork River in Montana, Pine Creek
near Coeur d’Alene, Idaho and local restoration on the forest in Newsome Creek, Red River and
American River. The local restoration projects that are similar to Crooked River include
Newsome Creek and Red River Narrows projects. The goals of Newsome Creek project was to
restore 4 miles of stream to improve habitat for fish, by removing tailings piles to create
floodplain and installing large woody debris. Since 2011, this project has restored about 2.25
miles of Newsome Creek. So far, it has been documented that this type of work has been
successful at promoting stream functions that we are striving for in Crooked River, such as
gravel sorting to providing spawning gravels, and complex instream pool habitat (NPT, 2014).
The Red River Narrows project was similar in that it removed tailings piles, reconstructed the
stream channel, added large woody debris and re-planted vegetation. This project has been very
successful in providing habitat for Chinook salmon. The large woody debris provides pools with
overhead cover for adults and the river is sorting gravels that provide appropriate spawning
areas.
Other projects in have been implemented, monitored and documented that these types of
rehabilitation efforts for fish habitat have been successful (Baldigo et. al 2008; CH2MHill 2013;
Crandall 2009, Crandall 2010; Ogston et. al. 2015; Roni and Quinn 2001; Roni et. al. 2008; Roni

Cooperating Agencies
Nez Perce Tribe
The Nez Perce Tribe is responsible for reviewing and providing comments on the EIS. The Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests and the Nez Perce Tribe would be responsible for
implementing the decision, including mitigation and monitoring.

Bonneville Power Administration
BPA is responsible for reviewing and providing comments on the EIS and determining whether
to provide funding for the project following the Forests’ decision.
The project would meet BPA’s objectives mandated under several federal laws. BPA is a federal
power marketing agency that is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. BPA’s operations are
governed by several statutes, such as the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and
Conservation Act of 1980 (Northwest Power Act) (16 U.S.C. 839 et seq.). Among other things,
the Northwest Power Act directs BPA to protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife affected
by the development and operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). To
assist in accomplishing this, the Northwest Power Act requires BPA to fund fish and wildlife
protection, mitigation, and enhancement actions consistent with the NPCC’s Fish and Wildlife
Program. Under this program, the Northwest Power and Conservation Council’s (NPCC) makes
recommendations to BPA concerning which fish and wildlife projects to fund. The NPCC
determined that this project was consistent with the Fish and Wildlife Program, and BPA will use
the analysis in this EIS to decide whether to fund the project.
Additionally, this project would help BPA meet its obligations under the Endangered Species
Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) by fulfilling commitments to implement Reasonable and Prudent
Alternative 35, which calls for identifying tributary habitat restoration projects in the 2008
FCRPS Biological Opinion, as amended by a Supplemental Biological Opinion in 2010 and 2014
(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries 2008, 2010, 2014).

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a federal agency in the U.S.
Department of Defense. The USACE administers permitting and permit compliance under
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Under Section 404, a Department of Army authorization is
required for the discharge of dredge/fill material into waters of the United States, including
wetlands. The USACE has jurisdiction under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act with respect to
the Crooked Valley Rehabilitation Project EIS project alternatives that would involve the
discharge of dredged or fill materials into wetlands and open waters in the Crooked River
floodplain, including man-made remnant gold dredge ponds.
The USACE role in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project EIS is to assist the Forest
Service and other partners in reviewing information for the preparation of the environmental

analysis in regards to the permit review process under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. This
entails reviewing portions of the EIS or supporting documents, and advising the Forest Service
with respect to project compliance under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

Public Involvement
Since January 1, 2013, the project has been listed in the Nez Perce National Forest’s NEPA
Schedule of Proposed Actions (SOPA) on a quarterly basis. Project information, including letters
to the public, notices of public meetings, the Draft EIS, and additional project information were
posted regularly on the Forest’s webpage at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/nepa/nepa_project_exp.php?project=40648.

The Notice of Intent for the project was published in the Federal Register (Volume 77, No. 239,
Page 73976) on December 12, 2012, with a 45-day comment period to January 26, 2013. In
addition, as part of the public involvement process, the Forest Service mailed a scoping letter
describing the proposed action to 395 potentially interested parties on November 30, 2012. To
solicit input on the proposed actions the Forest Service held two public meetings: January 17,
2013, in Grangeville, Idaho; and January 28, 2013, in Elk City, Idaho The Forest received
twenty–five comment letters on the proposed action, and 6 late letters. As an opportunity for a
site visit to the project area, two field trips were scheduled in June 2013, one with those who
commented on the scoping letter and one with regulatory agencies.
The interdisciplinary team (IDT), including cooperating agencies used the comments from the
public, State, Federal, and other agencies to identify the scope of issues to be addressed and to
determine the relevant issues related to the proposed action.
The legal notice of the Draft EIS’s public availability was published in the Lewiston Morning
Tribune on March 27, 2014, and the official Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS was
published in the Federal Register on March 28, 2014. A copy of the federal register and legal
notice were posted on the project webpage. In addition, as part of the public involvement
process, on March 21, 2014 the Forest Service mailed the Draft EIS and letters to groups or
individuals that had commented on the proposed action and those potentially interested parties.
To solicit input on the Draft EIS the Forest Service held two public meetings: May 6, 2013, in
Grangeville, Idaho; and May 8, 2014, in Elk City, Idaho. The public comment period for the
Draft EIS closed on May 12, 2014. The Forest received twenty-six comment letters on the Draft
EIS (See Final EIS, Appendix F).
The interdisciplinary team (IDT), including cooperating agencies used the comments from the
public, state, federal, and other agencies to identify the scope of issues to be addresses and to

Issues Used to Develop Alternatives to the Proposed Action
Crooked River Meanders
Issues identified about the proposed Meanders alternatives included: effects to fish and fish
habitat, effects to water quality, floodplain and channel function, stream shading and large
woody debris input, limited construction window, channel instability between construction
seasons, other channel configurations, cost of implementation and Forest Plan standards (soils
and cultural resources).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Some commenters were supportive of the Meanders valley and stream restoration proposed
action. Some commenters stated the project would restore anadromous and resident fish habitat
and proper hydrologic functions.
Some commenters stated this action would be an appropriate use of funds. Others stated it would
not, and the cost was too high.
Some commenters thought that the Meanders valley and stream should be left alone. Several
stated the existing mining dredge piles, an National Historic Register site, should not be
disturbed and remain entirely intact. Comments were received about the need to protect the
historic and cultural sites in the project area instead of completing the proposed Alternative 2.

One comment was received about the need to do a Forest Plan amendment for soils, suggesting
that the Forest Plan be changed to inhibit the project. One comment was received in support of
the Forest Plan amendment for soils.
One comment suggested mining claimants help move the material first to help with the project to
cut costs and make the holes for the project.
Crooked River Narrows Road
Issues identified about the proposed Narrows Road alternatives included: safety, seasonal
access, road maintenance, road decommissioning, access to historic roads, trails and rights-ofways, amount of disturbance , wetlands, cultural resources, and cost of implementation.
Some comments were in support of moving the Narrows Road (Road 233) out of the valley
bottom, but most were in support of leaving the road in its current location and improving the
road condition. Alternative B (see Appendix C and the project record) addresses this concern.
Concerns also were expressed about the potential relocation of a portion of Road 233.
One comment was that the proposed action for the Narrows Road (Alternative B as described in
Appendix C and the project record) would not provide enough benefit and that the Narrows area
of Road 233 should be decommissioned or converted to a foot trail. Alternative C (see
Appendix C) was developed to address this concern.
During analysis, the Narrows Road component of the project was considered but eliminated from
detailed study in the Draft and Final EIS. Reasons for elimination are described in Chapter 2.
The Narrows Road component of the project may be implemented in the future (5 years or more)
and the potential effects from implementing this project are included in the cumulative effects
sections in Chapter 3 and Appendix C.

One comment on the Draft EIS acknowledged the Narrows Road alternatives were eliminated
from detailed study in the Final EIS.

Issues Addressed in Effects Analysis
Issues about the potential effects to natural resources or the public are addressed in the Final EIS
and grouped into the following areas: aquatic resources (fish and fish habitat including
threatened, endangered and sensitive fish species), water resources (water quality,
geomorphology, floodplains, wetlands), cultural resources (historic sites), soil resources, wildlife
resources (sensitive and management indicator species and moose), rare plants, invasive plants,
recreation (fishing access), air quality, mineral resources, transportation (access, maintenance,
safety, and costs), social and economic resources, cumulative effects, and Forest Plan
amendments.
Issues about the design and historic conditions of Crooked River, as well as Alterative 2’s
design and effectiveness were identified. Some comments were received about the risk of high
flows on the temporary bypass channel during implementation.
Issues about the effects to waters and wetlands, including CWA Section 404(b)(1) analysis were
identified.
The following issues identified the level of scope of the analysis, but did not drive the
development of an alternative. This document discusses potential effects to threatened,
endangered, wildlife and plant species, effects on moose and elk habitat, effects on invasive
plants, effects on air quality and effects on social economics.

Issues Addressed Through Design and Mitigation Measures or
Monitoring
Various issues were addressed through design or mitigation measures. They including: the
effects to fish and fish habitat (listed and sensitive), water quality (sediment, temperature,
turbidity, mercury, toxins), soil resources, re-vegetation, transportation, control of invasive
species, effects to sensitive plants and wildlife (western toad), access to mining claims, access
for public recreation, and cultural resources (including effects to one National Historic Register
Site), traffic delays.
Alternative 2 presented in the Final EIS was updated to include additional design and mitigation
measures to address public comments and during consultation with other agencies. Briefly,
Design and Mitigations Measures 1, 6, 7, 11a, 11b, 11c, 32a, 32b, 32c, 45, 48, 52 and 53 were

Regulatory Framework
As part of the analysis for this project, the Interdisciplinary Team evaluated various alternatives
under the laws, regulations, and requirements relating to federal natural resource management.
Several of the design features presented in Chapter 2 were developed and incorporated to ensure
that these requirements would be met. Additional details can be found in Chapters 2 and 3 (by
resource area), Chapter 4, and the project record.

Forest Plan Direction
Although the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests were administratively combined in
February 2013, management of the lands formerly within the boundary of the Nez Perce
National Forest will continue to be guided by direction found in the Nez Perce Forest Plan until
the plan is revised. The Nez Perce Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, as amended)
includes goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines that direct management of forest resources.
Forest Plan direction is established at two scales: (1) Forest-wide direction is applicable
throughout the Forest, and (2) management area direction ties specific goals, objectives, and
standards to the unique capabilities of given parcels of land.
Nez Perce Forest Plan standards apply to National Forest System (NFS) lands within the Nez
Perce National Forest boundary. The standards are intended to supplement, not replace, national
and regional policies, standards, and guidelines found in Forest Service manuals and handbooks
and the Northern Regional Guide (USDA Forest Service 1999a).
The development and analysis of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project was guided by
the goals, objectives, standards, guidelines, and management area direction within the Nez Perce
Forest Plan. The Forest Plan provides direction for the management of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project area and defines the desired future conditions. The proposed action
responds to the goals and objectives outlined in the Forest Plan, including improving a below
fishery/water quality objective watershed. This project would improve conditions in the project
area to bring them more in line with the desired future conditions described in the plan. In
addition, the proposed project responds to the objectives of protecting, restoring, and enhancing
watersheds within proximity of the ceded territory of the Nez Perce Tribe. The need for this
project was identified by comparing the existing conditions in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project area with the habitat objectives considered optimal for salmonid spawning

Tribal Treaty Rights
American Indian tribes are afforded special rights under various federal statutes: National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (36 CFR 800), National Forest Management Act (NFMA),
Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (43 CFR 7), Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA [43 CFR 10]), Religious Freedom
Restoration Act of 1993 (P.L. 103141), and American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (42
U.S.C. 1996, 1996a) (AIRFA). Some of these statutes and federal guidelines direct federal
agencies to consult with tribal representatives who may have concerns about federal actions that
may affect religious practices, other traditional cultural uses, or cultural resource sites and
remains associated with tribal ancestors. Any tribe whose aboriginal territory occurs within a
project area is afforded the opportunity to voice concerns for issues governed by NHPA,
NAGPRA, or AIRFA.
Federal responsibilities to consult with tribes are enumerated in the NFMA; and Executive
Orders (EO), 12898, 13007, and 13175. EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs federal
agencies to focus on the human health and environmental conditions in minority and low-income
communities, especially in instances where decisions may adversely impact these populations.
EO 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites) requires consultation with tribes and religious representatives on
the access, use, and protection of sacred sites by land management agencies. EO 13175
(Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) directs federal agencies to
consult and collaborate with tribal officials on policies or actions that have tribal implications.
NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500–1508) invite tribes to participate in forest management projects
and activities that may affect them.
The Crooked River watershed is a part of the more than 13 million acres in central Idaho,
northeastern Oregon, and southeastern Washington included in the pre-treaty area of use by the
Nez Perce Tribe. Prior to the treaty of 1855, the Nez Perce used Crooked River and the South
Fork Clearwater River Subbasin for hunting, fishing, gathering food, horse pasturing, and other
cultural uses (Spinden 1964; USDA-FS 1998).
In 1855, the United States negotiated a treaty with the Nez Perce Tribe: Treaty of June 9, 1855,
12 Stat. 957. In Article 3 its 1855 Treaty with the United States, the Nez Perce Tribe explicitly

Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

reserved for itself certain rights, including the right to fish, hunt, and gather within the Nez Perce
– Clearwater National Forests, including Crooked River watershed. Crooked River lies entirely
within the ceded territory of the Nez Perce Tribe.
Federal courts have recognized that “it is undisputed that Indian tribes have legally protected
interests within their aboriginal Territory” (Idaho v. Forest Service, No. CV 99-611-N-EJL, slip
op. at 3 [D. Idaho Sept. 8, 2000]). By virtue of its treaty and trust obligations to the Nez Perce
Tribe, the United States and its agencies, including the Forest Service, have substantive duties to
consult with the Nez Perce Tribe and to implement measures necessary to protect and enhance
tribal resources (Klamath Tribes v. U.S., 24 Ind. Law Rep. 3017, 3020 [D. Or. 1996]). Treaty
tribes, such as the Nez Perce, have been recognized as managers of their treaty-reserved
resources (U.S. v. Washington, 384 F. Supp. 312, 339-40, 403 [W.D. Wash. 1974]). The Nez
Perce Tribe has devoted substantial time, effort, and resources to the recovery of treaty-reserved
resources within its ceded territory. To guide these efforts, the Nez Perce Tribe, through its own
fisheries programs and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC), has
developed and implemented a comprehensive salmon recovery plan (CRITFC 1996).
The Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests lie within the Nez Perce Tribe’s ceded territory are
central to both tribal and federal efforts to recover imperiled species. The Nez Perce Tribe
believes that projects in National Forests, such as the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project, are needed to enhance efforts to recover and restore anadromous fish species and their
habitat.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project has been discussed with the Nez Perce Tribe at
quarterly staff-to-staff interdisciplinary meetings since January 2013. See Chapter 4, Tribal
Consultation.

Project Record
This EIS incorporates by reference, pursuant to 40 CFR 1502.21, the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project Record, which contains specialist reports and other technical
documentation used to support the analysis and conclusions in this EIS.
Relying on specialist reports and the project record helps implement the CEQ regulations’
direction to reduce NEPA paperwork (40 CFR 1500.4). This EIS also incorporates documented
analyses by summary and reference where appropriate. The intent is to furnish enough sitespecific information to demonstrate a reasoned consideration of the environmental consequences
of the alternatives and how these consequences can be mitigated, without repeating detailed
analysis and background information available elsewhere. The project record is available for
review at the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests office, in Grangeville, Idaho.

CHAPTER 2. ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE
PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE
Introduction
This chapter compares the alternatives being considered for the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project. It defines the differences between the alternatives and provides a clear
basis for the deciding official and the public choosing between them. The choice will be based
on the design of the action alternative, as well as the environmental, social, and economic effects
of implementing each alternative.

Alternatives Considered in Detail
In response to issues raised by the public, the Forest Service has developed two alternatives to be
considered in detail: no action and proposed action. The decision to proceed with the proposed
action could include the entire proposed action or less than what has been proposed in the
proposed action alternative.
NEPA requires the inclusion of a no-action alternative when federal agencies enter into the
decision-making process to consider the environmental, historical, and cultural consequences of
a proposed action. Alternative 1, no action, provides a mechanism for evaluating the potential
effectiveness of the existing management policy as well as considering the implications of a
hands-off approach. Alternative 1 does not necessarily preclude further action or plausible
changes in management policy; instead, it represents the continuation of the existing
management strategy.

Alternative 1 – No Action
Under Alternative 1, no stream rehabilitation would occur. BPA would not provide funding
toward the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project; the USACE would not grant appropriate
permits; and the Forest Service and NPT would not implement the project. This alternative
provides a baseline for comparison of environmental consequences of the proposed action to the
existing condition, and is a management option that could be selected by the Responsible
Official. The results of taking no action would be the current condition as it changes over time
due to natural forces. Current management plans, such as the Forest Plan, and ongoing activities
would continue to guide the management of the project area (see Appendix C for more details).
No rehabilitation of Crooked River Valley would occur.
Following a Forest Service decision to choose Alternative 1, BPA would not provide funding
toward the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project and USACE would not authorize a
Section 404 permit.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action (Preferred Alternative)
Under Alternative 2, the lower 2 miles of the Crooked River valley and Crooked River would be
rehabilitated to improve fisheries habitat (Figure 2-1 and Appendix A). This alternative would
follow the specific Design and Mitigation Measures identified in this section in the Final EIS
below. Additional measures may be identified during consultation or from public comments and
may be included in the decision.
Alternative 2 project area spans from the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir intake
structure, which is approximately 0.1 mile upstream of the Crooked River confluence with the
South Fork Clearwater River, to about 2.0 miles upstream where the valley narrows. The valley
rehabilitation/reconstruction is proposed to address the areas that have been adversely impacted
by historic dredge mining.
Alternative 2 proposes to re-grade approximately 115 acres of floodplain by moving dredge
tailings. No dredge material would be removed from the project area. Approximately 6,000 feet
of temporary bypass channel/haul road would be constructed, used and decommissioned.
Approximately 10,960 feet of current channel would be filled in and approximately 7,400 feet of
new stream channel would be reconstructed, using onsite material including old mine tailings.
The new stream channel would have woody bank treatments added to provide stability. Large
woody debris would be added along approximately 9,400 of stream channel to provide habitat
complexity. More than 2,700 feet of side channels would be constructed. The stream channel
would be constructed so as not to interfere with Road 233 in the lower 2 miles. An illustration of
the proposed floodplain features, including the side channels and vegetation communities, is
provided in Figure 2-2.
This proposed action alternative is based on designs and design criteria provided in the Final
Design Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a) and the Design
Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012). The stream
restoration is proposed to address areas of impact in the lower 2 miles of Crooked River. For
engineering design details on the proposed action, see Appendix A. The design of the new river
channel and floodplain was developed to provide a rehabilitated landscape capable of sustaining
geomorphic processes to support desired aquatic habitat and vegetative conditions. The desired
future geomorphic condition includes restoring river and floodplain functions by reducing
channel entrenchment, establishing pool development processes, addressing stream flows and
ponding, and modifying the channel hydraulics to produce flows that would support a mobile
gravel bed (produce spawning areas).
The actions proposed in Alternative 2 are describe in six construction phases that could be
accomplished within annual budget allocations. Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 include: bypass channel
construction, floodplain grading, channel construction and bank/floodplain treatments, bypass
channel reclamation, and re-vegetation. Two Phases (termed Options 1 and 2) include floodplain
grading, large woody debris placement, and re-vegetation. The phasing sequence is summarized

in Table 2-1 below, Figure 2-1 below, and depicted in Appendix A in Figures A-1a and A-1b
(RDG et al. 2013a). A bypass channel station or channel station listed as in Table 2-1 is the
linear distance in feet along the channel in the design plan and on figures in FEIS, Appendix A
(RDG et al. 2013a).
Project Phases were developed in order to meet water management (bypass channel)
requirements, temporary stabilization measures of unconsolidated material required to transition
from each phase to prevent flood damage to newly constructed features, earthwork volumes
(balancing cut and fill), and environmental compliance considerations (fish passage). Project
Phases 1 through 4 must be constructed consecutively to meet these measures and reduce the
overall environmental impact of the project, as outlined below. Options 1 and 2 were developed
to be constructed any time: before Phase 1, during the construction of Phases 1 through 4, or
after completing Phase 4. These were developed as Options to allow for flexibility in the
construction timing and based on available funding overtime.
Implementation of all six phases is dependent upon funding over time. Funding from BPA would
be used for this Alternative. Other grants or funding could also be used. The amount of the
construction bids for each phase would determine how and when they are implemented. It is the
Forests’ intent to complete all six phases of construction to meet the purpose and need of the
project.
Following the Forest Service decision, USACE would decide whether to authorize a Section 404
permit and BPA would decide whether to provide funding toward the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project. These permits and funding allowance are critical to implement this
project. Without them this project would not be able to be implemented in the planned time
frames.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Detailed Actions
Detailed actions of Alternative 2 are described in this section. Based on public comments on the
Draft EIS, this section was updated (see Chapter 1, Changes between Draft and Final EIS; and
Appendix F).
Temporary Bypass Channel Construction. Alternative 2 proposes to construct a temporary
bypass channel on Crooked River to reduce the direct impacts of construction to water quality,
fish, and aquatic organisms during rehabilitation. The temporary bypass channel would be
constructed prior to any instream or floodplain work, and remain in use until completion of the
new floodplain and stream channel (3-4 years). Cofferdams and/or headgates would be
constructed in the mainstem channel to divert Crooked River into the temporary bypass channel.
This temporary bypass channel (about 6,000 feet) would be constructed along the east side of the
valley using existing mining ponds to pass water, fish and aquatic organisms during construction
of the project. The temporary bypass channel would be constructed to contain a 10-year flow
event (Q10 - 1,061 cubic feet per seconds-cfs) of Crooked River and would allow a spillway into
the newly constructed channel if flows reach a 25-year event (1,316 cfs). The probability of a 25year event occurring in any given year is 1 in 25, which was considered low risk since the bypass
channel would only be in place for 3-4 years. Fish and aquatic organism salvage would occur in
the main channel, ponds, and temporary bypass channel before de-watering actions. Following
construction, the new channel of Crooked River would be slowly re-watered during low flow,
cofferdams or headgates removed, and the temporary bypass channel reshaped into the
floodplain.
Temporary Access Road/Levee. Alternative 2 proposes an approximately 6,000 foot long
temporary access road/levee in the project area to reduce the impact to Road 233 and the public
traveling on Road 233 during river rehabilitation. Approximately 23,200 cubic yards of material
would be excavated for the bypass channel and the material would be used in construction of the
temporary access road. There are three existing access roads into the project areas: these areas
would be used to access the valley bottom from Road 233. Stream crossing structures would be
installed on these existing access routes in three locations over the temporary bypass channel
(see FEIS, Appendix A). Following construction of the channel, the temporary access road
structures would be removed and the temporary road decommissioned (Phase 4). Existing access
roads would be retained for recreational use.
Floodplain Re-grading. Alternative 2 proposes to re-grade approximately 115 acres of
floodplain including existing dredge tailings. No dredge material would be removed from the
project area. Trees, shrubs, and rocks would be removed and stockpiled in designated staging
areas. This salvaged material would be used in bank and floodplain treatments. Floodplain
grading includes dredge pile excavation, pond filling, and upland construction. The total

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

estimated earthwork quantity is 190,000 cubic yards for all Phases and Options. The floodplain
was designed to flood frequently to allow for moderate disturbance and distribution of sediment.
The new floodplain would be re-graded so that about 50 acres would seasonally flood every 1.5
years, which would create conditions for the formation of approximately 64 acres of wetlands,
including 14 acres of open water. This would provide a net increase of 12 acres of wetlands in
the project area. The floodplain would be constructed with secondary features, which include
swales and depressions, and would also contribute to the development of wetland features.
FEIS, Appendix B provides the Clean Water Act 404(b)(1) analysis that describes the Least
Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative for the alteration of wetlands. The 404(b)(1)
provides an analysis of the alternatives considered as well as the no action and proposed action,
and their potential impact to wetlands.
The new floodplain would be roughened (approximately 49 acres) to provide microtopography
such as ridges and furrows. Large woody debris would be partially buried on the floodplain.
This would help create stability in the floodplain by breaking up flow paths across the surface,
provide depositional areas for sediment and recruited seeds, and increase water holding capacity
in the floodplain. An illustration of the proposed floodplain features, including the side
channels and vegetation communities, is provided in the FEIS, Chapter 2, Figure 2-2.
New Channel Construction. Approximately 10,960 feet of the current channel would be filled
in and approximately 7,400 feet of new stream channel would be reconstructed. The new stream
channel would have woody bank treatments to provide stability. Large woody debris would be
added along approximately 9,400 feet of the stream channel to provide habitat complexity. More
than 2,700 feet of side channels would be constructed (three segments). The stream channel
would be constructed so as not to interfere with Road 233 in the lower 2 miles.
Re-vegetation. The valley bottom would be replanted with native plant species, including alder,
willow and spruce, to facilitate the continuous and natural recruitment of wood and instream
substrate material. Vegetation communities were identified that would fit the ecological site
potential, maximize aquatic habitat function, and be sustained by channel processes.
Rehabilitation treatments (floodplain features) would create the conditions necessary to support
development of vegetation communities over time. However, the floodplain would be replanted
to speed up the recovery efforts. The floodplain will be planted with alder, cottonwoods, spruce,
willows, and dogwood plants grown in 1-to-8 gallon sized containers. Sedge plugs and willow
cuttings would be used in the swales and depression to help form wetlands. Figure 2-2 shows the
plant community types for the new floodplain. Figure 2-3 shows a cross section of distribution of
floodplain vegetation communities.
Sedge plugs and willow cuttings would also be used in the depressions and swales to provide
wetland habitats. Large plants (>5-gallon sized container) would be planted on the southern
banks of the new channel and at the areas on the meander bends that would have the greatest

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

shear stress. Smaller plants (1 to 3 gallon sized container) would be planted along the remaining
banks and side channels. Planting efforts would focus on areas adjacent to the stream channel
first, within the depressions and swales, and then on the upland areas last. The overall number of
plants used in revegetation efforts depends on the size of individual plants. Larger plants (5 and
8 gallon sized container) would be spaced at about 6 to 8 feet apart and clumped. Smaller plants
(1 and 3 gallon sized container) plants would be spaced about 2 to 3 feet apart. Sedges and
rushes (10 to 20 cubic inches) would be spaced at less than one-foot intervals and willow
cuttings would be used along the banks. Approximately 20,000 plants of the various sizes would
be planted.
Species would be planted on the floodplain based on their community type. For example, bare
colonizing species, such as herbaceous and woody species (coyote willow, Drummond willow,
water sedge) would be planted in depositional areas along the channel, while alder, spruce, and
black cottonwoods would be planted in low floodplain areas with a focus near the stream and
side channels. Alders would be planted on the low floodplain along with black cottonwoods, a
variety of willow species, red-osier dogwood and spruce. The uplands would be planted with fir,
spruce and pine species. To increase plant productivity, soil material would be salvaged during
floodplain construction and used within the upper foot of the new floodplain to provide rooting
material for the plants. Woody material and wood chips would be distributed throughout the site
to improve soil productivity.
Material Stockpiling. Materials such as large woody debris, rock, wood chips, and soil would
be stockpiled in the dispersed campsites near Campground 4, requiring the temporary closure of
four dispersed sites (about 1.5 acres) prior to beginning construction. These dispersed campsites
would be closed for the duration of the project. Campgrounds 3 and 4 may also be closed yearround for the duration of the project to store materials and ensure public safety. Much of the
material would come from within the project area, but some would be imported. Soil would
come from within the project area. Large woody debris and wood chips would be imported from
the Crooked River watershed from the American and Crooked River project (USDA Forest

Protection project (USDA Forest Service 2011c), or other local projects evaluated through a
NEPA process. See FEIS, Appendix C for more details. Large woody debris would be added to
the stream channel for habitat complexity, and to the floodplain to provide microsites and
roughness. Wood chips and soil would also be added to the floodplain to increase water
retention in the substrate in order to improve plant survival.
To provide nutrients and a food source for fish, cobble substrate and large woody debris may be
added to the newly created channel from the temporary bypass channel.

Design and Mitigation Measures by Resource Area
The following project design and mitigation measures have been developed to eliminate or
reduce to acceptable levels the effects of proposed activities. Their potential effectiveness is
described in italics, in Chapter 3, and in more detail in the project record. Effectiveness is rated
as being high, medium or low or a combination thereof (i.e. medium to high). Many of the
mitigation measures described below are commonly used by the Forest Service and the
effectiveness is based on how well the mitigation measure performed on past projects.
Soils, Water Quality, and Fish Habitat
1.
Complete ground-disturbing activities during low-flow conditions. Adjust instream
work dates site-specifically through coordination with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team
(USDI Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration-National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA-NMFS), USDA Forest
Service, and USDI Bureau of Land Management) and other agencies. Follow all
conservation measures outline in the Biological Opinions from NOAA-NMFS and
USFWS. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
2.
Thoroughly wash and inspect all equipment used in stream restoration activities before
it enters the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests to help prevent the introduction of
chemicals to the site. Keep all equipment in a well-maintained condition to minimize
the likelihood of a fluid leak. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
3.
Stage all construction equipment in a location and manner to minimize soil and water
pollution. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
4.
Require a Spill Prevention, Control, and Containment Plan that is approved by the
Forest Service contracting officer representative for handling and storage of petroleum
products. Keep any storage of petroleum products in excess of 200 gallons within
constructed containment structures that have an impervious liner with a capacity equal
to or larger than the storage container. Locate the containment structure at least 150
feet from live water. Before being used within 300 feet of the stream reconstruction
site, inspect all heavy equipment or other machinery for hydraulic leaks or other leaks.
Do not use leaking or faulty equipment. Clean equipment that has accumulations of oil,
grease, or other toxic materials prior to use in these areas. Do not permit disposal of
petroleum products on national forest land. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
5.
Fuel and lubricate equipment at least 150 feet from all waterbodies. Service and refuel
in a manner that avoids spills and overfills. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
6.
Require a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and National Pollution
Prevention Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, approved by the
Environmental Protection Agency prior to commencing construction activities. Ensure
that erosion control measures are in place before construction or staging of erodible
materials begins. Follow all conservation measures outlined in the SWPPP, NPDES,

Section 404 permit, and 401 certification. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on
experience)
7.
Divert or pump stream around work site. Place screens on pump intakes following
NMFS fish screen criteria (NMFS 2011). (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on
experience)
8.
Install silt fences, straw bales, and/or sand bag windrows as needed before excavation
occurs to separate the disturbed areas from the live water and prevent eroded soil from
entering the stream channel. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience [Clarkin et al.
2003])
9.
Stabilize any road cuts, fills, and treads with a cover of annual rye and/or mulch where
roads would remain for more than 1 year. (Effectiveness: Moderate, based on
experience)
10. Grade and shape all disturbed sites to allow drainage. Seed disturbed sites as needed
immediately upon completion of work in that area with certified weed-seed-free seed.
Replant any small trees excavated from the work sites on the rehabilitated disturbed
areas to help stabilize the soils. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on experience)
11. For fish and aquatic organism salvage operations, drive or remove fish, amphibians,
and mussels (referred to as fish salvage) from area. Removal would be done so as to
result in minimal injury or disturbance to behavior. Ensure that a fisheries biologist is
present onsite during dewatering and all salvage operations. Reduce water volume
using pumping or diversion. Set up block nets to isolate areas to ensure that all species
are moved. Conduct electroshocking only when a biologist with at least 100 hours of
electrofishing experience is onsite to conduct or direct all activities associated with
capture attempts in accordance with Guidelines for Electrofishing Waters Containing
Salmonids Listed under the Endangered Species Act (NMFS 2000) and Best
Management Practices for Pacific Lamprey (USFWS 2010). (Effectiveness: Moderate
to High, based on experience)
11a. All water bodies, especially ponds, would be checked for amphibians prior to and during
construction of any work associated with the temporary bypass channel, side channel,
temporary road, floodplain, and new channel, etc. All life stages of amphibians would
be collected and immediately translocated to the pond near channel station +110.00
(pond being retained and western toad breeding area). Western toads tend to lay eggs
in shallow water with emergent vegetation and facing a certain exposure. Take note of
the conditions surrounding the egg masses and mimic those conditions when the egg
masses are translocated to the new pond. It may be possible to translocate the new egg
masses immediately adjacent to the egg masses in the identified pond (Effectiveness:
Moderate, based on experience).
11b. Sanitize, clean and inspect equipment (machines, waders, nets, etc) of invasive aquatic
organisms. Do not dump water from water tenders directly from one stream or pond to
another. Disinfect/decontaminate all gear, clothing, equipment, and waders, with a

10% bleach solution prior to entering any water bodies in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project area to prevent spread of fungal pathogens. Standard disinfection
protocols would be followed (Maxell no date, Phillot et al. 2010). (Effectiveness:
Moderate, based on reference and experience).
11c. In some instances, disposable gloves have been shown to cause mortality when handling
certain life stages of amphibians, especially tadpoles. If disposable gloves are
necessary for aquatic organism salvage operations and handling of aquatic organisms in
the translocation process, follow steps outline by Cashins et al. 2008 and Greer et al.
2009 to minimize exposure and reduce incidental mortality of amphibians to
pathogens/toxins from the gloves. (Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience).

14. Contact appropriate utility companies to locate and move or avoid underground
powerlines prior to ground-disturbing activities. Restore all utility lines upon
completion of the project so that no loss of power occurs. (Effectiveness: High, based
on experience)
15. Stage sanitary facilities such as chemical toilets at least 150 feet from waterbodies to
prevent contamination of surface or subsurface water. (Effectiveness: High, based on
experience)
16. Obtain and comply with all appropriate permits prior to ground-disturbing activities
(such as Joint Application for Permit, 401 Water Quality Certification, National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, Storm Construction General Permit). Adjust
any mitigation or monitoring through coordination with regulatory agencies.
(Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
17. Within productive riparian areas, build soil and plant substrate suitable for restoring
expected vegetation types. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience)
18. Conserve plants and active soil materials for re-use in valley and roadside reclamation
and upland restoration activities. (Effectiveness: High, based on experience and Final
Design Report [RDG et al. 2013a])

including natural mulch from residual vegetation slash, chipping/masticated material,
and/or transplanted trees and shrubs. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on
experience)

Forest native plant coordinator, immediately upon completion of the project.
(Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience)
26. Apply only certified weed-seed-free mulching material and seed. Seed inspection
testing is to be completed by a certified seed laboratory against the state noxious weed
lists and documentation of the test provided to the contracting officer representative or
designated inspector. Mulch material would be state certified weed free.
(Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience)
27. Soil, gravel, rock, and any material hauled to the project area must come from sources
determined to be weed free. Sources would be approved by a contracting officer
representative or designated inspector as weed free. (Effectiveness: High, based

28. Following implementation, monitor to detect invasive and noxious weeds. Treat
identified weed infestations following the Nez Perce National Forest Noxious Weed
Environmental Assessment (EA)(USDA Forest Service 1988a), Biological
Assessments (USDA Forest Service 2013b draft), and Biological Opinions for
Herbicide Treatment of Invasive and Noxious Weeds on the Nez Perce National Forest
(2013–2022) (NMFS and USFWS 2013 draft) when applying herbicides within 50 feet
of sensitive plants to reduce potential for incidental contact of spray compounds with
non-target species of concern and to avoid potential harmful exposure. Adjust
treatment through coordination with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team. (Effectiveness:

Other Specific Design and Mitigation Measures
45. Fish and aquatic organism salvage operations from the mainstem channel would occur
after July 15 when steelhead and Chinook salmon have emerged from redds and bull
trout would not be migrating in the project area, for each phase requiring dewatering of
the mainstem channel or bypass channel. Fish and aquatic organism passage would be
provided at all times. (Effectiveness: Moderate, based on experience and Final Design
Report [RDG et al. 2013a])
46. During dewatering, floodplain grading, or temporary bypass channel or new channel
construction, if “quick” conditions occur, halt activity until condition stops or other
sufficient mitigations occur. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on experience)
47. Keep natural soils in place onsite or stockpile them for future use. (Effectiveness:
High, based on experience)
48. Operate dewatering within the construction area continuously until project construction
has been completed to minimize turbidity and sedimentation. Turbid water may be
pumped to the floodplain or settling ponds to keep areas dry during construction and to
reduce sediment input delivery to Crooked River and the South Fork Clearwater River.
Water bypass channel and new channel slowly to prevent turbidity from reaching 50
Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTUs) above background 300 feet downstream.
Monitor turbidity during watering, and if turbidity levels approach 50 NTUs above
background 300 feet downstream, reduce flow in channel until turbidity levels recede to
10 NTUs above background. Follow design and mitigation measure 6, as required with
approved permits. (Effectiveness: Moderate to High, based on experience)

bypass channel in 2 to 3 locations prior to watering the bypass channel. Decommission
haul/access road following use, but retain existing access roads for recreation.
(Effectiveness: High, based on Final Design Report [RDG et al. 2013a])
Ensure that Road 233 remains clear of debris and equipment during construction.
(Effectiveness: High, based on Final Design Report [RDG et al. 2013a])
Store mulch piles to reduce combustion hazard. (Effectiveness: Moderate, based
on experience)
Construct temporary bypass channel of Crooked River to pass water, fish, and aquatic
organisms during construction. Construct temporary bypass channel prior to any
instream or floodplain work, and use until completion of the new floodplain and stream
channel (2–3 years). Construct a spillway on the cofferdam or headgates to spill any
flows greater than the Q10 (1,062 cfs) into the new channel to reduce the potential for
bypass channel failure at high flows. If the new channel is activated at high flows, fish
would be salvaged following Design and Mitigation Measures 11, 11a, 11b, and 11c.
The bypass channel would be evaluated for stability through cross section and
longitudinal analysis prior to watering and at the end of each construction season.
Slowly re-water the newly constructed channel during low flow. Remove cofferdams
or headgates and reshape the bypass channel into the new floodplain. (Effectiveness:
High, based on experience [i.e. observations and work in Red River Narrows and Mill
Creek]).
Ensure sands and gravels are properly mixed into the new channel to prevent water
from going subsurface. Inspect the new channel when rewatering to ensure flows do
not go subsurface. If flows are lost, wash fine sediment into the substrate to seal
interstitial spaces. If water loss continues, turn off rewatering efforts and remix
substrate with an excavator. Bentonite may be used if water continues to go
subsurface. Follow all measures for watering the new channel as outlined in the
Biological Assessment (ROD, Appendix C). (Effectiveness: Moderate, based on
experience of RDG on other restoration projects).
Install wood catchment structures to prevent large woody debris from moving at high
flows and interfering with structures the downstream of the project area (e.g. IDFG fish
intake and weir). Wood catchment structures would be anchored in at the lower end of
the project area in the new flooplain, incorporate large boulders and designed to
withstand high stream flows (greater than Q50). (Effectiveness: Moderate based on
similar applications on the Tucannon River in Washington (Dave Karl, Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife.Pers.com, 2013).

the project record.
The Forest Service and Nez Perce Tribe would inspect the projects during implementation for
implementation and compliance to ensure that the actions are completed per contract
specifications and to ensure that design and mitigation measures are being followed. The project
would also be monitored for effectiveness to ensure that mitigation activities are meeting or
working towards the desired condition.
A fish biologist and/or other qualified personnel (stream restoration specialist, hydrologist, etc.)
from the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests or Nez Perce Tribe would ensure that the
design and mitigation measures are being adequately implemented. The Forest Service
Contracting Officer’s Representative would be present most days during construction, and a
designated inspector would be onsite. Any last-minute changes made to accommodate sitespecific conditions must be within the range of effects analyzed in the EIS or Biological
Assessment, or authorized by permits to be prepared for this project. A fish biologist or other
qualified personnel would conduct compliance monitoring that tier to regulatory documents,
including Biological Opinions, Clean Water Act Section 404 permits, Section 401 water quality
certification, NPDES permit, and SWPPP.
Monitoring for vegetation, floodplain and wetlands would be done as part of the Clean Water
Act Section 404 permit. A vegetation monitoring report would be completed and provided to the
USACE annually, for 5 years after construction activities are completed. The floodplain would
be monitored for function and deposition. Wetlands would be inventoried throughout the project
area.
Monitoring for vegetation survival and invasive plants would occur in the longer term.
Vegetation would be monitored following methods outlined in Protocol for Monitoring
Effectiveness of Riparian Planting Projects (Crawford, 2011). The monitoring goal is to
determine if riparian plantings are effective at restoring riparian vegetation for the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project. Monitoring would include tracking the number of original plants
remaining alive in Year 1 and 3. After 3 years, it is difficult to distinguish between planted
plants and natural recruitment. If at least 50% of the original plantings are not surviving by year
3, a site condition evaluation would be conducted to determine the mode of failure and the site
would be replanted after adaptive management is applied (e.g. fencing or watering of plants).
After Year 3, the percent of riparian cover would be used to determine project effectiveness.
The project is deemed effective if there is at least a 20% increase in mean canopy density by year
5. Monitor in year 10.
Invasive weeds would be monitored and treated at years 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 if new infestations are
found.

Monitoring of the floodplain and channel would be done using photos, at established points,
taken prior to and post construction to document changes. The Nez Perce Tribe may contract
aerial photography prior to construction and post construction to document the overall changes in
the valley bottom.
Groundwater levels would be monitored during implementation, and post- implementation for a
minimum of three years.
Monitoring of large woody debris, entrenchment ratios, cobble embeddedness, and temperature
may be conducted over the long term to document changes in the project area from the proposed
project.
Proposed Forest Plan Amendments
See Appendix D for details of the project-specific proposed Forest Plan Amendments following
the 1982 planning rules.
Soils
Past mining activities have altered soil conditions in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project area. The current Forest Plan standards and the Forest Service Region 1 soil quality
guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. A proposed project-specific
amendment would exempt this project from Forest Plan Standard #2, allowing for activities to
occur on areas with greater than 20% soil detrimental disturbance, as long as soil improvement
activities are implemented.
Based on current soil conditions, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for
Alternative 2 to allow the Meanders stream restoration of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project.
Cultural Resources
Past mining activities along the Crooked River have created cultural properties and historic sites.
The current cultural resource Forest Plan standards provide direction to: identify sites and
protect on a site-by-site basis (Standard #2), and to protect and preserve National Register and
National Register–eligible cultural resources (Standard #4). In addition, Management Area 3 –
Standard #4 directs the Forest to protect National Register and National Register–eligible sites
from deterioration or destruction. The proposed action would not protect the large majority of
identified cultural properties in the project area and would have adverse effects on these
properties.
A proposed project-specific amendment would exempt this project from Cultural Resource
Forest Plan Standards #2 and #4, or Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource Standard #4,
allowing for activities to impact or destroy National Register and National Register–eligible
cultural resources. To mitigate effects on cultural resources, as part of the proposed action
several representative areas of historic dredge mining would be preserved and interpretation

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study
Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all
reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that
were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the
solicitation of comments on the proposed actions in December 2012 and January 2013 suggested
additional alternatives for achieving the project purpose and fulfilling the need for the project.
Some of these alternatives were outside the scope of the project, did not meet the purpose and
need, or duplicated the components of the alternatives considered in detail. These alternatives
and others were considered but dismissed from detailed consideration, for reasons summarized
below:

Meanders
•

Reconnect ponds to the river; no floodplain grading. This alternative was dropped
from further analysis because it did not meet the purpose and need of the project. Past
restoration activities in the Crooked River Meanders section included connecting the
river to the ponds. The ponds act as sediment sinks that impair overall fish habitat and
the gradient of the river channel is currently too low to adequately sort necessary
substrate for spawning and rearing habitat. This alternative would also continue to limit
the re-establishment of riparian vegetation that is necessary for shading, large woody
debris inputs, and food sources for aquatic organisms.

•

Reconstruct 11,000 feet of stream channel and 115 acres of floodplain; maintain
1-year bypass channel. This alternative would include reconstructing the stream
channel in the lower and upper ends of the project area along with the proposed stream
channel construction. This alternative would also regrade the floodplain such that
material would be terraced along the road side of the valley so that flooding would occur
only during a 500-year event. A bypass channel would be constructed and
decommissioned each year to pass water and fish. Under this alternative, there would be
fewer areas of wetlands being created than filled, there would be a high risk of adversely
affecting the Idaho Department of Fish and Game weir downstream, and the phasing of
the project and the regraded material could not be redistributed within the constraints of
the construction season (June through September). Constructing a 1-year bypass channel
would mean conducting fish-salvage operations twice each year for each phase of
construction, which would likely increase the amount of take of ESA-listed fish. This
alternative was dropped from further analysis because it was un-constructible within the
construction window, posed high risks of damaging structures downstream, and
potentially increasing impacts to ESA-listed fish.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

2-21

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

•

Remove mine tailings from valley and use for road material; maintain river channel
and ponds. This alternative would entail using large equipment to remove tailings piles
from the valley bottom and build up a road base for Road 233 through the Narrows.
This alternative was dropped from further analysis because the material in the tailings
piles is unsuitable as road base material, the cost of hauling the material would be
prohibitive (>$6 million), and maintaining the current pond features would impair
substrate distribution, and hydrologic functions, and would not improve stream
temperatures of the river; thus, this alternative would not meet the purpose and need of
the project.

•

Phase the project with four reaches and complete all aspects of an entire reach
during one construction season. This alternative would entail completing all aspects of
an entire reach, including constructing a temporary bypass channel, regrading the
floodplain, reconstructing the new channel and bank stabilization structures, installing
large woody debris, rewatering the new channel, and decommissioning the bypass
channel during one construction season.Temporary stabilization measures would be
required for the first three phases in the newly constructed stream channel and floodplain
to prevent downcutting of the new channel during high spring flows. Temporary
stabilization measures would include grade control structures to step down the new
channel 3 feet into the existing channel and address the risk of head-cutting back
upstream into the new channel. Similarly, temporary stabilization measures would be
required to transition the new floodplain to existing ground and prevent floodplain
erosion. These structures would prevent fish passage through the project area between
construction phases. Constructing a 1-year bypass channel would mean conducting fishsalvage operations twice each year for each phase of construction, which would likely
increase the amount of take of ESA-listed fish. This alternative was eliminated due to
channel in-stability (due to high flow) between construction seasons and the risk of
increased impacts to ESA-listed fish.

•

Various small fixes to the stream channel to improve fish habitat. Alternatives such
as adding large woody debris to the current channel and cutting off Meander bends to
increase the stream gradient, as well as reconnecting some of the ponds to the main
channel, were considered but dropped from further analysis. These types of projects have
been implemented over the last 35 years in the Crooked River watershed and the South
Fork Clearwater tributaries. Periodic monitoring of these efforts indicate that small,
piecemeal restoration projects have failed to substantially restore the fisheries; therefore,
it was determined that these types of actions would not meet the purpose and need of the
project. A long-term improvement to instream habitat and the overall fisheries in the
watershed requires restoring the hydrologic functions of the watershed. This requires
stream channel-floodplain interactions, which cannot be achieved without floodplain
regrading.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

•

Regrade 115 acres of floodplain and reconstruct up to 7,400 feet of stream channel
in other configurations. Some commenters requested analysis of the same concept of
floodplain regrading and channel reconstruction, but with various alternatives to the
proposed layout of the stream channel. The stream channel was developed to exhibit a
meandering pattern and a range of riverbed elevations to support development of variable
flow condition, which would in turn maintain instream habitat features (riffles and pools)
for aquatic habitat. The stream channel could have been designed to meander on one side
of the valley or the other. There are an infinite number of configurations for the new
channel. All of these configurations would have met the purpose and need of the project;
however, designing each of these configurations would be cost prohibitive and the overall
benefits to resources from the small changes in channel location would be similar in their
effects. Therefore, the alternative involving analysis of various stream channel
configurations has been dropped from further analysis.

•

Forest Plan Amendment - Soils. One comment suggested to amend the Forest Plan to
inhibit Alternative 2, as presented in the Draft EIS. The Nez Perce Forest Plan directs the
Forest to prevent permanent impairment to soil productivity by following soil quality
standards to control the areal extent of detrimental soil disturbance impacted by
management activities (Forest Plan, page II-22, USDA Forest Service 1987a). This
alternative was eliminated from detailed study because Alternative 1 – No Action
addresses this issue.
Miners to help do work. One comment suggested mining claimants help move the
material first to help with the project to cut costs and make the holes for the project.
Forest Plan, Management Area 10 – Riparian Areas, Fish and Wildlife Habitat
Management, Standard 2, directs the Forest Service to rehabilitate riparian areas before
any further nondependent resource use of the immediate area is permitted (USDA Forest
Service, 1987a, as amended; page III-31). Alternative 2 would complete rehabilitation of
the Crooked River riparian area and meet this Forest Plan standard. This alternative was
eliminated from detailed study because it could not be implemented under a Forest
Service construction contract. It would be very difficult to coordinate contractor and
claimant actions to meet the design specifications outlined in the contract. Also this
would be a liability for the contractor and not feasible to implement under a Forest
Service contract.
Protect more Dredge Tailings. Several comments suggested not completing Alternative
2 to protect historic and cultural sites, including one National Historic Register Site
(SHC-32). Alternative 1 – No Action addresses this issue and would not disturb the
existing cultural resource sites. Alternative 2, identified specific design and mitigation
measures to mitigate the adverse effects to cultural resources in the project area.
Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 provide a wide range of actions that could affect cultural
resources for the deciding official to consider; therefore no additional alternatives were
developed to address this issue.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Develop accessible fishing access to Crooked River. A comment suggested developing
accessible fishing to Crooked River. This alternative was considered but eliminated from
detailed study because the purpose and need is focused on rehabilitation of Crooked
River. The Line officer felt the rehabilitation work should be completed before access
could be developed with another project in the future.

Narrows Road
The Narrows Road component of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project was removed
from detailed study in this EIS by the deciding official in December 2013. The reasons for
removing the Narrows Road component include the priority to directly improve habitat in the
Meanders area. The Narrows Road design plan is also currently at 25 percent so more
information and planning is necessary to analyze impacts and complete the required
environmental analysis for compliance with NEPA, Endangered Species Act consultation and
Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting efforts in a timely manner. Moreover, the Narrows Road
project is a separate action from the Meanders and not dependent or connected to the Meanders
proposed actions so the NEPA analysis for the Narrow Road component, referred to as the
Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement Project, could be completed in the future (Appendix
C).
Because the Narrows Road component was removed from this EIS, the alternatives listed in this
section were eliminated from detailed analysis. The following is a summary of the alternatives
considered for the Narrows Road.
•

No Action (Alternative A). This alternative was eliminated because it is not needed for
this analysis.

•

Proposed Action (Alternative B). Leave the 3 miles of Road 233 in the valley bottom
through the narrow canyon, but re-align sections to be out of the 2- and 50-year
floodplain. All material excavated to move the road would be used in the construction of
the new road base. This alternative is considered as a future foreseeable action once
more planning and design is completed and is considered in the cumulative effects
analysis in sections of this EIS and Appendix C.

•

Re-route Access Using Deadwood (Alternative C). Re-route access from Road 233
and use Roads 1803 and 522 (Deadwood Road) as the main access route. This alternative
would decommission 3 miles of Road 233 into a non-motorized trail.

•

Decommission all roads in the watershed. Some commenters advocated
decommissioning more or all of the roads in the Crooked River watershed. Some access
to the watershed needs to be maintained for private property, recreation, fire suppression,
and other future management activities. This alternative was not considered in detail
because it would not meet the purpose and need of the project and management

objectives of the Forest Plan and is of larger scope than this project. This alternative
would also be cost prohibitive.
•

Relocate road out of the 100-year floodplain. The Forest Service reviewed an
alternative for moving Road 233 out of the 100-year floodplain, but maintaining it in the
valley bottom. This alternative would require disturbing more than 30 acres and
removing more than 650,000 cubic yards of material, and be cost prohibitive (> $6
million). This alternative was eliminated due to the excessive impact on the environment
and prohibitive cost.

•

Relocate road onto the near (east) hillside, constructing 4.8 miles of road. The Forest
Service reviewed an option for moving Road 233 onto the near (east) hillside. This
would disturb more than 30 acres and remove more than 395,000 cubic yards of material
and have road grades greater than 12%. This alternative was eliminated due to the
excessive impact on the environment and prohibitive cost (> $5 million).

•

Relocate road onto the near (east) hillside, constructing 5.6 miles of road. The Forest
Service reviewed an alternative for moving Road 233 onto the near (east) hillside. This
would disturb more than 30 acres and remove approximately 470,000 cubic yards of
material, and have greater than 12% road grades. This option was eliminated due to the
excessive impact on the environment and prohibitive cost (>$5 million).

•

Relocate road onto hillside across the river. The Forest Service reviewed an
alternative for relocating the road across the river onto the far hillside. This would have
the same environmental and economic consequences as relocating the road out of the
100-year floodplain, as well as the impacts and cost (>$ 5 million) of constructing two
additional bridges across Crooked River; thus, the option was eliminated.

Meanders and Narrows Road
•

Administratively withdraw mineral activities in the project area. Some commenters
advocated the withdrawal of mining claims and actions within the project area. This
alternative was not considered in detail because it is more appropriately considered in the
current Forest Plan revision effort than at a project level and is, therefore, outside the
scope of the project and this EIS.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Summary of Short-term Impacts
The short-term adverse effects that could be caused by the proposed project include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increased turbidity in Crooked River due to instream restoration work and culvert
replacement/removal
Potential increased water temperature due to removal of existing riparian vegetation for
channel reconstruction and temporary bypass construction
Reduction in shading due to removal of existing larger trees in the Crooked River
riparian area
Disturbance of individual fish and macroinvertebrates
Disturbance of existing wetlands
Modification of wildlife species habitat and distributions of sensitive and management
indicator wildlife species
Adverse effects due to direct mortality or displacement of individuals, and loss of habitat
(western toad)
Modification of habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive plant species
Increased dust and vehicle emissions
Temporary travel restrictions due to road reconstruction and improvement activities
Burying of existing rock, soil, and vegetation by regrading of mining dredge tailings and
blasted rock
Exposure of locatable minerals.

Summary of Long-term Benefits
The long-term benefits to be gained through the implementation of the proposed project include
the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Improved fish habitat in Crooked River by restoring stream and floodplain function,
restoring instream fish habitat complexity, and improving water quality
Recovery of natural processes in the Crooked River floodplain, which would improve
habitat conditions (cover and forage) for many of the wildlife species using this area
Decreased soil compaction and surface/substratum erosion problems in the watershed
Improved fish habitat due to reduction in sediment yield, increased pool habitat quality,
and improved health of the riparian plant community
Reduced water temperatures in Crooked River with potential attainment of water
temperature criteria and removal from the §305(b) list for temperature impairment.

Summary of Unavoidable Adverse Effects
Under Alternative 2, there would be impacts on fish within the project area and downstream to
the South Fork Clearwater River. Efforts would be made to work within the in-water work fish
“window” as designated by the USFWS and NMFS, and to reduce sediment and turbidity during
construction. Fish would be provided migratory passage for the duration of the project. Under

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

2-36

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2, there would be direct mortality to amphibians egg masses, tadpoles, and juveniles
during construction of the temporary bypass channel and dewatering/rechanneling of existing
open water ponded environments; construction of the temporary bypass road; dewatering of the
main Crooked River channel; dewatering of the temporary bypass channel; regrading/reshaping
of the valley bottom, stream channel, and tailing piles; and equipment traffic. The alternatives
are consistent with Forest Plan direction to the extent that proposed management actions would
not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive wildlife populations.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
Alternative 2 would result in the irreversible and irretrievable commitment of heritage resources.
Mining waste and associated artifacts are not only physical representations of history, they—
even when newly created—give a visual sense of history. Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act makes reference to this visual sense of history when allowing that historic
properties may still be eligible for listing even when they have been newly modified, as long as
they maintain their visual sense of place. Nowhere is this more applicable than to historic
mining areas, known as historic vernacular landscapes. The mining waste and associated
artifacts are irretrievable. Once removed from their contextual resting places, artifacts lose their
archaeological value as information resources, and if restoration were to take place, the inability
to recreate the tailings piles exactly as they were would be irreversible.
Cutting of live and dead trees from the project area for channel construction and floodplain
development would be an irreversible commitment of that resource. Areas stripped of trees
would be replanted or allowed to regenerate.
Human resources would be used for the construction and maintenance of the project. Economic
commitments are also an irretrievable investment. The estimated approximate cost of the
preferred alternative is $2.5 million. Funds have already been committed or spent for planning,
design, environmental studies, and drafting the environmental impact statement.
Implementation of any action alternative would commit an undetermined amount of fossil fuels
in order to transport material and implement other activities.
The project implementation would result in some loss of fish and wildlife habitat and
displacement of fish and wildlife during construction. Stream habitat lost would be replaced by
construction of a new channel. Wetland habitats and their associated functions and values lost as
a result of the project would be replaced with other wetland habitats.
Proposed project activities would modify wildlife species habitat and would result in short-term
changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive and management indicator wildlife
species. The project would result in some loss of wildlife habitat and displacement of wildlife
species during implementation of project activities. There would be an irretrievable commitment
of resources with the loss of potential breeding sites (ponds) for western toads.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Preferred Alternative

2-37

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The loss of native vegetation to new or expanding weed infestations would be a possible
irretrievable effect if active restoration to native species is not pursued. Intensive invasive
treatments and native plant restoration work would improve habitats and plant communities,
which would minimize and avoid irreversible effects.
The commitment of resources is based on the belief that the condition of the natural environment
in the watershed would be improved by the proposed project. The primary benefits would be
improved fish habitat and water quality.

Scope of Analysis
This chapter describes the existing conditions of the environment, in and adjacent to the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project area on the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, that
may affect or be affected by the alternatives presented in Chapter 2. This chapter also describes
the potential environmental consequences of implementing each of the alternatives. Effects are
quantified where possible, and/or are qualitatively discussed. The individual discussions are
organized by issue and resource concern. Appendices A through F present additional drawings,
plans, maps, and other information used in this analysis.

The scientific and analytical basis for comparison of alternatives
Direct and indirect, short and long-term, irreversible and irretrievable, and cumulative
effects
Ways in which potential adverse effects would be reduced or mitigated
How past decisions and directions were considered and relate to this project (e.g., Nez
Perce Forest Plan FEIS, other past project EAs or EISs, project-specific resource reports,
and other sources of information, as indicated).

Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects
Environmental consequences form the scientific and analytical basis for comparison of
alternatives, including the proposed action, through compliance with Forest Plan standards and a
summary of monitoring required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the
National Forest Management Act (NFMA). The discussion centers on direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects along with applicable mitigation measures. Irreversible and irretrievable
effects are also discussed. Effects of each action can be neutral, beneficial, and/or adverse. The
terms are defined as follows:
•
•
•

Direct effects are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place.
Indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or further removed in
distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable.
Cumulative effects are those that result from the incremental impact of the action when
added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.

Irreversible effects are permanent or essentially permanent resource uses or losses; they
cannot be restored or returned to their original condition. Examples of irreversible effects
include minerals that have been extracted or soil productivity that has been lost.
Irretrievable effects occur when a resource is removed or consumed.

Pursuant to CEQ’s NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500.1(b) and 1500.4), this document
summarizes the completed analysis and forms the scientific and analytical basis for the

Consideration of Past, Ongoing, and Reasonably Foreseeable
Activities
The CEQ has provided guidance to federal agencies on the consideration of past actions in
cumulative effects analysis (CEQ 2005).
Cumulative impact is defined in CEQ’s NEPA regulations as the “impact on the environment
that results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, ongoing, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions…” (40 CFR 1508.7). CEQ has interpreted this regulation
as referring only to the cumulative impact of the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action
and its alternatives when added to the aggregate effects of past, ongoing, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions (CEQ 2005).
As CEQ stated, “The environmental analysis required under NEPA is forward looking, in that it
focuses on the potential impacts of the proposed alternatives that an agency is considering.
Thus, review of past actions is required to the extent that the review informs agency
decisionmakers regarding the proposed action.” As the CEQ further stated, “Generally, agencies
can conduct an adequate cumulative effects analysis by focusing on the current aggregate effects
of past actions without delving into the historic details of individual past actions” (CEQ 2005).
While CEQ found that cataloging past actions and specific information about the direct and
indirect effects of a past project’s design and implementation could in some contexts be useful to
predict the cumulative effects of the proposal, the regulations do not require the Forest Service to
catalog or exhaustively list and analyze all individual past actions (CEQ 2005).
There is a marked difference between past and current Forest Service land management practices
and policies. This evolution in land management practices (including those related to stream
rehabilitation and road management projects) is the result of the application of scientific
principles/research science and our ongoing monitoring actions.

During the analysis process and subsequent preparation of this Final EIS, the Forest Service
determined what information regarding past actions was useful and relevant to the analysis of
cumulative effects. We have provided a discussion of known past activities and their general
effects by each resource area, with more detail in Appendix C and the project record. The
aggregate effects of past, ongoing, and future foreseeable actions are reflected in the description
of existing resource conditions in this chapter and have been considered in the analysis of effects.

Aquatic Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project alternatives
on aquatic resources, including aquatic species that are listed as threatened and endangered under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Forest Service sensitive species and management
indicator species (MIS).
The geographic scope of the analysis for aquatic resources focuses primarily on the Crooked
River watershed, but also includes Deadwood Creek sub-watershed, a tributary to Red River.
Crooked River drains north into the South Fork Clearwater River, approximately 57 miles
upstream of Kooskia, Idaho.
Analysis Area
The proposed project and direct and indirect effects analysis area consists of 2 miles of stream
restoration. The project boundary extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked
River and includes the entire valley bottom. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends
from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game weir) to approximately 2.0 miles upstream. Indirect effects are considered throughout the
entire Crooked River watershed as bull trout and steelhead, along with numerous sensitive
species, inhabit and migrate throughout the Crooked River watershed (Figure 3-1). The project
area is within Lower Crooked River, a Forest Plan prescription watershed. This watershed is
currently below the established fishery/water quality objective of 90 percent (USDA-FS 1987,
as amended).
Cumulative Effects Area
For aquatic resources, the cumulative effects area includes the project area, the Crooked River
watershed, as well as the South Fork Clearwater River from the mouth of Crooked River
downstream to the Forest Service boundary at Mount Idaho Grade bridge. See Appendix C,
Figures C-1 and C-2, for a display of watersheds used in this analysis.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Information for this analysis has been gathered from a variety of sources. The Nez Perce –
Clearwater National Forests and Nez Perce Tribe have conducted site-specific inventories of fish
habitat conditions and population status throughout the watershed. Several studies that directly
relate to Crooked River and its aquatic resources were completed, including the Design Criteria
Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Crooked River Wetland
Delineation Report (Geum 2012), and Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
Design (RDG et al. 2013a). The Design Criteria Report summarizes an investigation and
evaluation of approximately 2 miles and 115 acres of lower Crooked River valley being
considered for restoration. Additional temperature data were collected through the summer of
2013 by the Nez Perce Tribe. In addition, peer-reviewed scientific literature has been used as the
primary source of information regarding the life histories and habitat requirements of the aquatic

organisms of Crooked River and the effect of natural and human-caused disturbance upon
those organisms.
Appendix A of the Forest Plan specifies beneficial uses and Fish/Water Quality Objectives
(Objectives) for each prescription watershed on the Forest, which are expressed as percent fish
habitat potential and range from 70% to 100% depending upon the primary beneficial use
(fisheries and/or municipal water supply) and planned land management for that watershed. The
indicators used in this analysis contribute to the carry capacity of Crooked River and the fish
habitat potential. Lower Crooked River prescription watershed was assigned an anadromous
fishery beneficial use with a 90 percent Fish/Water Quality Objective, with 50 percent current
fishery habitat potential in the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan states that Lower Crooked River
prescription watershed is: a) being below carrying capacity due primarily to a lack of diversity
(pool structure); b) this problem is caused by the removal of all large boulders and woody debris
from the stream through placer mining; and c) these habitat components will be replaced through
direct habitat improvement projects (USDA Forest Service 1987, as amended, in Appendix A).
The analysis compares the effects of the alternatives using the following indicators:
Pool Quality/Quantity
• The ratio of pools to riffles (pool:riffle ratio) is an indicator of habitat quantity, and
complexity, both of which are important elements for salmonid fishes in streams. In
addition, the quality of pools is an important consideration. Pool quality is generally
indicated by pool volume and pool depth. However, in this project area, indicators of
habitat quality or complexity are pool-forming processes such as large woody debris
(LWD) input, lateral migration of channel potential (entrenchment), and flow
acceleration from riffle-pool morphology. Riffles are fast and shallow; runs are fast and
deeper; pools are slow and deep; and glides are slow and shallow (Figure 3-3).
Habitat features (large woody debris, spawning and rearing habitat, fish passage,
floodplain connectivity)
• Large woody debris provides habitat complexity and cover, and assists in pool creation
and maintenance in stream systems, as well as macro-invertebrate habitat.
• Spawning and rearing habitat are analyzed through flow velocities, depth, cover,
substrate quality and quantity, and off-channel refuges.
• Ability for all life-stages of fish to move, unimpeded, to spawning, rearing, and
overwintering habitat, is critical for the survival and continuance of migrating species.
• Fish passage was analyzed through hydraulic modeling of maximum velocities and
comparisons with literature review of fish swimming abilities.
• Floodplain connectivity is important for sediment transport and deposition processes;
riparian vegetation growth and recruitment; and juvenile fish refugia at high flows.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Temperature
• Water temperature, which controls the rate of biologic process, is of critical concern for
fish populations and is a primary indicator of habitat conditions. The South Fork
Clearwater River is included on the 1998 Idaho Department of Environmental Quality
(IDEQ) Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list (IDEQ 1998) of water-quality-limited water
bodies because of temperature. Decreases in streamside shading in riparian habitat
conservation areas result in increases in water temperature. Changes in shading can be
due to a variety of factors, including vegetative succession (the replacement of one plant
community with another over time), mortality, and/or project activities.
• Potential increases or decreases in stream temperature were analyzed by assessing the
conditions and the nature and extent of activities in riparian areas that may result in
increased or decreased solar radiation to streams and connected wetland areas.
• Groundwater maintains a near constant temperature, and interaction with the stream can
influence and benefit nutrients and temperature in the channel.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
This section includes a description of existing conditions in the Crooked River watershed and the
direct and indirect effects on aquatic resources in Crooked River within the project area
(Figure 2-1 in Chapter 2). This section also includes a discussion of species in the project area
that are included on the list of threatened and endangered species established under the
Endangered Species Act and species in the project area that have been designated by the Forest
Service as sensitive species or MIS.
Pool Quality & Quantity
Pools offer important habitat functions for most life stages of the listed and sensitive fish species
present in Crooked River. Juveniles utilize pools and pool margins for rearing and
overwintering; adult anadromous fish use pools during migration as resting zones; and resident
ESA-listed and sensitive fish overwinter in pools, as well as use pools for depth cover.
Riffles are dually important for salmonid species. Salmonids feed mainly on the
macroinvertebrates that live in the riffle habitats. Also, most salmonids spawn at the tailout of
pools (shallow crest at downstream end of pool) or in riffle-type habitats where the eggs will be
sufficiently aerated and stay free of deposited sediments. Juvenile steelhead and all westslope
cutthroat typically prefer riffle habitats during summer where the preferred food is available
(Everest et al. 1985).
As anadromous and fluvial adult fish move into the tributary systems, many hold in pools in
close proximity to suitable spawning habitat (riffles, glides, tailouts) until they are ready to
spawn (Spence et al. 1996).
The current pool:riffle ratio of Crooked River is 63:37. In the South Fork Salmon River drainage,
the highest numbers of salmonids were associated with a pool:riffle ratio of about 30:70 (Platts

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

1974). A lower pool:riffle ratio can create a diverse habitat structure with more spawning habitat
for Chinook salmon and steelhead
The quantity of pools in the 3.1-miles of Crooked River through the project area is fairly high
(n>70). Many are the result of past rehabilitation efforts of connecting dredge ponds or are
legacy from the dredging activity. These pool types can be deep, but due to the lack of
functioning hydraulics, most act as sediment traps for fine sediments and will eventually fill in.
Additionally, the pools lack cover or complexity preferred by focal fish species (i.e. steelhead
and bull trout).
Snorkeling observations in September 2013 (conducted by Nez Perce Trib and Nez Perce –
Clearwater National Forests) indicated very low numbers of all fish in the lower reaches of the
project area (Figure 2-2). In Reach 4, five larger westslope cutthroat trout were observed in a
pool formed by a small jam of large woody debris. Reach 4 had 5 pools/100 meters with an
average residual pool volume of about 2,000 ft3 (RDG et al. 2012). In Reach 3, one large
cutthroat was observed in a mid-channel scour pool, with a very small number of juvenile
chinook and whitefish also in the lower portion of the pool. Reach 3 had 10 pools/100 meters
with an average residual pool volume of about 9,500 ft3. Reach 2 had the highest density of fish
observed, with a much higher species and size class diversity. Two large bull trout, as well as
juvenile bull trout were observed; all seemed to be associated with LWD complexes. In
addition, a very large school of adult whitefish, schools (n>20) of juvenile spring/summer
chinook, two adult cutthroat, and a few adult brook trout were all observed within one meander
wavelength (see Figure 3-2). Reach 1 was not surveyed. Reach 2 had 9 pools/100 meters and an
average residual pool volume of about 5,000 ft3.
Pool-forming and maintenance processes are lacking through most of the project area. The
current conditions include: a disconnected floodplain; lack of large woody debris recruitment
potential; limited lateral migration, and the inherent lateral scour is restricted due to the tailing
piles; and lack of stream bed complexity. Field observations indicate the hydraulics, due to the
dredge activity, are forced into 90-degree corners in these large meanders. The stream channel
has been so drastically altered standard pool-forming and maintenance processes are hardly
present; water eddies on the outside corner and flows back upstream. This causes the majority of
the flow to be pushed to the inside corner. This translates to fine sediment settling on the
upstream side of the outside of the bend. Snorkeling surveys indicated very little fish use in the
these large pools and eddy areas. Macroinvertebrate communities could shift from one
associated with cobbles and gravels (which are highly available to fish due to drift) to one
consisting of more burrowing insects, which would be unavailable to salmonids. See Figure 3-2.
Large woody debris complexes and potential recruitment is very low. Conifers are the dominant
overstory throughout the project area, but very few are close enough to the stream to provide
effective shade or contribute terrestrial invertebrate prey to aquatic organisms. There is little
interaction between the woody species and the stream, due to distance from the stream and a

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

disconnected floodplain. In Figure 3-2, woody species and distance (both horizonally and
vertically) to stream can be seen. See more discussion about large woody debris in Habitat
features section below.
Entrenchment can be a surrogate for lateral migration potential on a stream system.
(Entrenchment quantifies the accessibility of the floodplain; it is the ratio of the floodplain width
to the bankfull width—the lower the number, the greater the entrenchment.) Through the
Crooked River project area, entrenchment varies from 1.7–2.5. The greatest entrenchment value
(1.7) was measured within the severely meandered section with the very high dredge piles. This
accounts for approximately one-third of the project area. In a functioning system similar to
Crooked River, entrenchment values would be greater than 2.4 (Rosgen and Silvey 1996),
indicating a low, wide floodplain.

One Meander Wavelength

A ratio of pools to riffles can begin to quantify habitat complexity. Overall in the project area,
pools are the dominant habitat type with up to 63% of the morphology consisting of pools. With
over 60% of the habitat in one habitat type, the current condition lacks complex bed form.

Meanders.
Figure 3-2 shows flow eddies at nearly every 90-degree corner of the Crooked River Meanders.
Fish densities, as observed during snorkeling, were very low in this reach. Also, note low
potential for woody (evergreen) species interaction with the stream and lack of instream woody
debris. Finally, from this picture (July 2012), note minimal shade occurring in and potential to
occur on the stream.

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the Meanders section of Crooked River in a manner that would minimize future
disturbance or degradation of aquatic resources, but there would be no actions to improve aquatic
habitat. Under this Alternative, BPA would not provide funding toward the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project; the USACE would not grant permit authorization; and the Forest Service and
Nez Perce Tribe would not be able to implement the project as described. The natural recovery
processes would be the only mechanism for improvement to the channel or floodplain.
Pool habitat would remain in the highly altered condition that currently exists in Crooked River
under Alternative 1. The pool:riffle ratio would remain at the existing conditions (63:37),
maintaining many pools with low complexity. LWD input would remain limited. Entrenchment
would remain at current conditions at 1.7–2.5.
The natural recovery process would result in a gradual adjustment to an equilibrium state
(sediment inputs equal to sediment outputs), with a more natural ratio of pools and riffles
throughout the project area; however, these processes would be extremely long term. Major
flood events would slowly undercut the dredged materials, scouring and redistributing the piles
of mining waste. The redistribution of these materials would result in the formation of a more
naturally sinuous channel with pool habitat occurring on the corners, at large woody debris jams,

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

or against bedrock outcrops. Through these natural processes, under Alternative 1, the area
would eventually return to a more natural condition; however, in Crooked River, the expected
rebound would be very slow. From hydraulic analysis, it is estimated that a 500-year flow event
would be necessary to move the material in the tailings piles (RDG et al. 2012). A feasibility
study conducted on Newsome Creek, a heavily mined tributary to the South Fork Clearwater
about 10 miles downstream from the mouth of Crooked River, estimated that natural recovery
within the project area would require between 1,000 and 5,000 years or more (Clear Creek
Hydrology and North Wind 2004). Aquatic habitat would remain degraded and hamper fish
recovery efforts in Crooked River during this recovery process.
Two events that were at or near 100-year return interval flows have occurred in the Crooked
River watershed since the dredging ceased: one in the 1970s, and the most recent in 1996–97.
Very little change was observed following these flows. Of note, a restoration project was
completed in the upper end of the project area in the 1980s that removed the floodplain dredge
materials but retained the tortuous meander pattern (part of Reach 2). Little to no change to the
channel planform has been observed in this section in the past 20–25 years, even with two very
large flow events. Figure 3-8 shows a comparison of intact dredge piles and stream channel (leftReach 3) and the area of past dredge pile removal and stream channel (right-Reach 2). Because
the high flows can access the floodplains (decreasing in-channel velocities), fine sediment can
settle out in the channel. The channel is shallower, but no change has occurred to the planform
of the channel, as it is still in a tortuous meander pattern. Also, few woody species have
recolonized the floodplain. There is nearly 100% solar radiation on the stream channel where the
dredge piles were removed and either no planting occurred or planting was unsuccessful.
The natural recovery of stream morphology and riparian conditions would be very slow due to
the extreme level of alteration across the entire valley bottom. The slow pace of recovery would
do little in the short term to improve habitat complexity and aid in the recovery of sensitive,
threatened, or endangered species within the project area. There would be no short-term direct
or indirect effects such as those that are associated with Alternative 2.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 activities would include building a temporary bypass channel around the project
area to pass fish and water while the floodplain and new channel are being constructed to
minimize impacts to fish and water quality. The temporary bypass channel would be constructed
by connecting the ponds on the east side of the valley. This would create a fairly diverse habitat
structure; however, spawning and rearing would not be expected nor planned for in the
temporary bypass channel design because it would be used for a short duration (3-4 years). The
temporary bypass channel was designed using HEC-RAS modeling to ensure fish passage and
water holding capacity for flows up to the Q10 (about 1,000 cfs; the amount of streamflow based
on a 10 year return interval) (RDG et al. (2013a). See Glossary for description of terms related to
streamflow return interval (Q). In the temporary bypass channel, maximum velocities at this

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-11

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

flow level would range from 1.6 to 11.3 feet per second (ft/s) with an average of 6.9 ft/s.
Velocities along the margins would be much lower (0.1 to 2.5 ft/s). With lower flows (≤ Q2),
velocities would likely be considerably lower and could support juvenile rearing habitat. The
current ponds are 2–6 feet deep, which would allow for potential rearing and rest for migrating
adults. The temporary bypass channel has been designed to not inhibit up- or down-stream
anadromous and fluvial fish migration patterns. Additionally, there is little spawning in the
majority of the project area by steelhead or Chinook (Kiefer and Lockhart 1997; Hall-Griswold
and Petrosky 1998). Most Chinook redds are observed in the upper reach of the project area
(Reaches 1), where wood could be added and floodplain dredge piles removed but where there
would be no dewatering or new channel building.
Under Alternative 2, a more natural sinuous channel would be constructed with floodplain
connectivity, woody debris habitat features, channel spanning woody debris cover, and
revegetation of native species. All of these elements would enhance pool habitat by increasing
pool-forming processes, thermoregulation, and protective cover necessary for aquatic species.
The proposed design incorporates 30% pools, 40% riffles, 10% runs, and 20% glides (see
Figure 3-3), creating a diverse habitat structure with much more spawning habitat for Chinook
salmon and steelhead. In the South Fork Salmon River drainage, the highest numbers of
salmonids were associated with a pool:riffle ratio of about 30:70 (Platts 1974). Glides, or, in
most cases, pool tailouts have the highest spawning site selection among Chinook salmon and
steelhead (Sommer et al. 2001). Riffles are important macroinvertebrate producing habitat types,
and are sometimes selected for spawning if not too shallow or fast (Platts et al. 1983).
Roni and Quinn (2001) observed much higher steelhead and cutthroat trout densities in the
winters following large scale stream rehabilitation and large woody debris placement, especially
as riffle area increased. The designed channel would increase fast water habitat by 33%,
increasing potential cutthroat and steelhead preferential habitat by the same amount.
Also, with a more natural meander wavelength and structure than in the current condition, the
stream slope would be doubled, from the existing 0.003 to 0.006 (ft/ft) through the valley. By
increasing the slope towards the natural slope of the valley, sediment transport processes would
be regained in the system. Proper slope for sediment transport processes is important to minimize
aggradation (sediment deposition) or down-cutting in a stream system, as well as to create clean,
unembedded spawning gravels. This design creates the opportunity for variable hydraulics to
maintain the bedform and a highly complex habitat to increase spawning potential and higherquality rearing sites.
Recruitment of large woody debris would be expected to increase following floodplain and
stream rehabilitation due to proximity of the riparian area proposed planting, and establishment
of riparian vegetation. The proposed riparian community would be a spruce/alder-dominated
system. Both of these tree species are hydrophilic (water-loving) and would thrive on the newly

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

created floodplain. In roughly 30–50 years, trees would be large enough to begin to influence
pool-forming and maintenance processes if they entered the stream course. Floodplain grading
and channel reconstruction would increase the entrenchment value to 2.5–10 throughout the
project area, thus decreasing entrenchment (Table 3-1). Figures 3-4 and 3-5 depict the difference
in floodplain access between the current condition and the proposed design of Crooked River at a
2-year return interval stream flow (Q2). Floodplain access has many benefits, including
deposition of fines, decreased shear stress in channel/on banks, off-channel refugia for juvenile
salmonids, high potential for allochthonous inputs (sediment or rock originating at a distance)
into the stream system, and seed dispersal.

Habitat features (large woody debris, spawning and rearing habitat, fish passage,
floodplain connectivity)
Large woody debris (LWD) provides habitat complexity and cover, and assists in pool creation
and maintenance in stream systems. It also has the added benefit of increasing diversity in the
macroinvertebrate habitat and species (Hrodey et al. 2008). The extreme level of past
disturbance in Crooked River has left the project area devoid of LWD and recruitment potential.
Stream surveys yielded 2–5 single pieces and 1–2 aggregates of LWD per 100 meters of stream
(Table 3-2). Similar river systems without the level of disturbance of Crooked River contain over
20 pieces of LWD per meter of stream (Beechie and Sibley 1997).
Large woody debris increases the ability of stream habitat to support and produce salmonid
species through pool creation and maintenance (Cederholm et al. 1997), added cover and hiding
from predators (Fraser and Cerri 1982), refuge from high-velocity flows (Bustard and Narver
1975), creation of visual isolation from other fish (Spencer et al. 1996), and greater macroinvertebrate diversity (Hrodey et al. 2008; Rogers 2003). The heterogeneity that large woody
debris contributes to the stream (in flow, food, and cover), creates microhabitats allowing
multiple species to coexist. Instream large woody debris and boulders maintaining hydraulic
complexity allows fish to use less energy, if tucked in behind a boulder or log, to continue to
feed in the adjacent fast water (Spence et al. 1996).
The past dredge mining activities removed all of the woody debris and vegetation throughout the
valley bottom. The highly disturbed valley and dredge tailing piles have naturally re-vegetated
with lodgepole pine providing little shade or large wood recruitment (Geum 2012). Although
conifers compose 30% of the project area, they are growing on top of the dredge piles and not
recruiting wood or contributing shade to the stream. Three greenline surveys were competed

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-13

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

along the first perennial vegetation that forms a lineal grouping of community types on or near
the water’s edge (Winward 2000). These surveys yielded seven mature trees (>10 years old)
along the greenline of the stream, and in total only 18 conifers were counted in the greenline. No
dead trees, considered near-future LWD recruitment, were counted in the surveys.
Spawning and rearing habitat were analyzed using five components: flow velocities, depth,
cover, substrate quality and quantity, and off-channel refugia. Existing condition spawning
habitat, as modeled by using substrate size class 50–75 millimeters (mm), is less than 2 acres
(Table 3-2; RDG et al. 2013a). This is less than the potential for the area based on the altered
flow velocities and habitat complexity to transport and sort the necessary substrate sizes. It is
also very limited to the upstream and downstream ends of the Meanders project area. The
Meanders section has very little potential spawning gravels due to the altered flow velocities.
Rearing habitat, modeled with parameters of depth less than 1 foot and velocity less than 1 foot
per second, was quantified at 2.45 acres (Figure 3-6) through the project area (Hillman et al.
1987). The modeled juvenile-rearing area does not take into account overhead cover,
temperature, and substrate; therefore, this number is likely high. Most of the ponds in the project
area, created by past mining, are not connected at low flow, which limits juvenile rearing to the
main channel.
Ensuring close proximity of spawning and rearing habitat is critical for most salmonids. Once the
alevins are out of the redd, they need slow water habitat nearby, preferably habitat without too
many predators.
Upstream and downstream passage is critical to most fish species in the South Fork Clearwater
drainage. Salmon, steelhead, bull trout, and lamprey depend on uninhibited upstream passage to
the cold headwaters streams to spawn during the fall or spring and seek refuge during the hot
summer months. Juvenile salmonids and other native fish species utilize Crooked River and its
many tributaries for refuge during high spring flows on the South Fork Clearwater. Cutthroat
trout move in and out of the tributaries, moving for desired temperature, increased feeding
opportunities and spawning habitat (Dobos, 2014, unpublished data).
Crooked River through the Meanders reach has highly altered hydraulics and runoff hydrology.
Spring flows are attenuated through the unnatural morphology of the valley bottom, namely the
highly porous and conductive tailings and ponds adjacent to the river. During base flow, there
are areas of atypical flow patterns (Figure 3-2) where flow eddies in large pools, or large
backwater areas in the main channel. Fish are currently passing through the area, but few have
been observed staging in the project area, waiting for the right water conditions or cues to move
up to spawning areas.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, habitat complexity and spawning and rearing areas in the Meanders project
area would remain in the current condition, or decrease over time. New conifer growth potential

in the riparian area is low due to the steep, nutrient-poor slopes of the dredge piles. Future LWD
recruitment would remain very limited. Levels of LWD would remain about the same (2–5
single pieces and 1–2 aggregates of LWD per 100 meters of stream) (see Table 3-2).
Spawning and rearing habitat, under Alternative 1, would remain in a similar condition and of a
similar amount (less than 2 acres spawning and 2.45 acres juvenile-rearing habitats) or decrease
over time (Table 3-2). Cobble embeddedness in the riffles and pool tailouts is very high
compared to areas that have not been altered by dredge mining, resulting in a reduction in quality
spawning and overwintering habitat. Hydraulic complexity would remain low and, therefore,
lead to increased sedimentation, thereby decreasing suitable salmon, steelhead, and bull trout
spawning area. Overwinter rearing habitat would decrease at the same rate as sedimentation of
the cobbles occurred. Off-channel rearing would remain low, and possibly decrease due to
sedimentation over time. There is potential in the very long term that recovery of the valley
bottom could occur, but would take up to thousands of years.
Under Alternative 1, fish passage would remain in the current condition through the Meanders
reach. Because there are no barriers, it is assumed that fish mostly use the Meanders as a
migratory reach.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Activities proposed under Alternative 2 would have short and long term effects to fisheries in
Crooked River. The bypass channel, as stated above, would not be designed or built for specific
fish habitat needs. The bypass channel would potentially reduce the amount of spawning and
rearing habitat; however, there is very little spawning presently occurring in the proposed
instream impact area (IDFG redd surveys). Also, extremely low densities of juvenile steelhead
were observed during a snorkeling survey in 2013 (two juvenile steelhead in three 300-foot
snorkel lengths). Other fish densities were low as well, although there were large (n>20) schools
of juvenile Chinook observed in Reach 2. The pools in the bypass channel could serve as
surrogate rearing habitat for the short term (3–4 years) while floodplain and channel construction
is occurring.
Under Alternative 2, habitat complexity would be immediately increased following proposed
rehabilitation activities. Addition of large woody debris is proposed under this alternative, and it
would be expected to increase through the project area up to and greater than 100 pieces per
100 meters (Table 3-2). The cover and habitat complexity created by addition of large woody
debris would result in creation of debris jams similar to those that existed prior to the dredge
mining. Large woody debris-fish population data from similar stream reaches in undisturbed
watersheds show juvenile fish densities are much higher in areas where large woody debris was
added (Cederholm et al. 1997).
Photographs from the 1980s show conifers just beginning to become established on the dredge
piles and near the stream. From that evidence, the conifers planted would result in a shadeproducing overstory, and provide a source of large woody debris in about 30 years. As shown in
Figures 3-2 and 3-8, the 30- to 50-year-old vegetation is adding little shade to the stream channel
through the project area. In 30–50 years following the project with a connected floodplain,
natural meander pattern, and heavy woody revegetation efforts, the vegetation should be
interacting with the stream for both shade and LWD recruitment.
The hydraulic complexity created through a more natural meandering pattern and the LWD
component would increase spawning habitat from less than 2 acres to nearly 3.5 acres (RDG et
al. 2013a) through the project area; juvenile-rearing habitat would be decreased from 2.45 acres
of low- to marginal-quality habitat to 1.94 acres of better quality rearing habitat (Table 3-2;
Figure 3-7). Off-channel alcoves and side channels would offer higher-quality rearing potential
than the margins of the current condition of Crooked River.
Juvenile-rearing habitat was modeled using parameters of depth less than 1 foot and velocity less
than 1 ft/s; Figure 3-7 shows that 1.94 acres would be developed in the main channel (RDG et al.
2013a). These numbers do not include the constructed side channels or ponds. The designed
channel has alcoves and side channels throughout; when alevins leave the gravels, they would be
close to an ideal rearing area until they are strong enough to enter the main channel.
The quality of rearing habitat would also be increased due to proper substrate sorting,
overhanging riparian vegetation, reduced instream temperatures, and improved instream

complexity from increases in large woody debris (Fraser and Cerri 1982, Bustard and Narver
1975). Additionally, 2,700 feet of side channels and about 10 off-channel alcoves would be
constructed, both for the purpose of increasing beneficial juvenile rearing habitat and providing
high flow refugia (Figure 3-7).
Under Alternative 2, fish passage could be altered temporarily if extreme high flows (>Q10)
occurred while water is routed in the bypass channel. The temporary bypass channel was
modeled to design a stable channel capable of carrying a Q10 flow (1061 cfs) plus 1 foot of
freeboard (distance from the water surface to the top of the levee; RDG et al. 2013a). The
primary risks are lateral and vertical stability. The model results suggest that the presence of
large cobble and larger material (150–300 mm) would result in fairly stable conditions. Recent
observations of existing site conditions indicate that the 150–300mm material is common on site
and reinforcement would not be needed for the entire channel. In addition, the bypass channel
would flow through several existing ponds, which would serve as pools and areas of lower risk
of instability.
Because of lateral constraints posed by the Crooked River Road 233 and the project area, the
bypass channel requires building up a berm along the west bank to prevent flow from entering
the project area. The berm height would vary up to 4 feet above the design floodplain elevation.
The proposed berm cross section would have a top width of 16 feet with side slopes at 2:1. The
berm would serve multiple purposes, including use as a haul road during construction and use as
a staging area for material that would eventually be used to fill the bypass channel after
floodplain and channel construction is complete.
The temporary bypass channel should provide fish passage for a range of flows. The range of
mid-channel velocities at a Q10 flow would be 1.6–11.3 ft/s (RDG et al. 2013a). The average
mid-channel flow velocity of a Q10 flow would be about 7 ft/s. Margin velocities should be
much less (0.1-2.5 ft/sec at Q10). The bypass channel would be constructed with fish passage as
a primary design criterion, mostly with large boulders for grade control and velocity breaks and
grade control (>340 mm, maximum mobile particle size at Q10; RDG et al. 2013a). Fish access to
existing spawning and rearing habitat upstream would continue through the temporary bypass
channel during implementation (NPT surveys 2013, Kiefer and Lockhart 1997; Hall-Griswold
and Petrosky 1998).
The existing ponds would provide areas of lower velocity and deeper water to facilitate
movement up and down the bypass channel. The bypass channel would be inspected following
large flows in order to assess channel changes that could affect fish passage and stability.

Temperature
This Aquatic Resources section addresses the effects of stream temperatures on fish, while the
Water Resources section addresses temperature in relation to water quality and the South Fork
Clearwater River and Crooked River established Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) (IDEQ
and EPA 2003).
Water temperature is a critical concern for cold water fish such as trout and salmon and is a
primary indicator of habitat conditions in north central Idaho (IDEQ 2013).Water temperature is
controlled by many factors including shading, groundwater inputs, width-to-depth ratios, and
velocities. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) developed a matrix of pathways and indicators of watershed condition for Chinook,
steelhead, and bull trout (NMFS and USFWS 1998). The document provides appropriate
temperature conditions for ESA-listed species adapted to the South Fork Clearwater River (Table
3-3).
Water temperatures were monitored in the Crooked River watershed in 2005 by the Forest
Service (USDA Forest Service 2005a) , in 2012 by River Design Group (RDG et. al. 2013a), and
in 2013 by the Nez Perce Tribe (NPT 2013c). Water temperature was monitored by installing
standard continuous data loggers on the bottom substrate of the river and ponds. River Design
Group monitored three ponds in the project area and three river locations in the project area. The
Tribe monitored three river locations in the project area and three river locations in the upper
watershed (Figures 3-9 and 3-9a).
Late-summer temperatures in lower Crooked River exceeded 20 degrees Celsius (ºC) for
numerous days when monitored in 2005, 2012, and 2013. Temperatures in the Crooked River
project area are well above temperature ranges considered optimal for steelhead and bull trout
spawning, rearing, and migration (optimal temperatures shown below in Table 3-3). Monitoring
also showed temperatures much greater than 13ºC through September, during critical times for
Chinook spawning (13ºC is the upper optimum temperature limit for Chinook spawning). Bull
trout are known to use the Crooked River project area for migration, juvenile rearing, and
possibly overwinter habitat for the larger adults. Mean summer temperatures also exceed the
cold water requirements for spawning and rearing (Table 3-3).
Bull trout spawn in September and October in the upper Crooked River watershed. The
temperatures in the upstream reaches are cooler than the lower reaches (Figure 3-9).
Additionally, steelhead spawn in April and May, when stream temperatures throughout the
watershed have not warmed to unacceptable levels. The temperatures through the project area are
above the acceptable levels for rearing juveniles, and therefore, juvenile bull trout and steelhead
move out of Crooked River into the South Fork Clearwater River in search of cooler water.

Considering the entire Crooked River watershed, water temperatures tend to increase from
upstream to downstream (from Orogrande to the mouth), with a slight cooling through the
project area (top of the project area to the mouth). Temperature data collected in 2013 indicated
that the greatest thermal inputs are within about a 2 mile stretch of river from Relief to where the
narrow canyon begins (upstream of the project area). This area of the valley has also been
dredge mined, but does not have the severe meanders. There are several shallow ponds along the
river in this area that likely contributes to the increased water temperatures. Within the project
area, elevated temperatures are likely due to the severely altered riparian condition and the
overly wide river channel throughout the watershed from past activities (Appendix C). Also
within the project area, the stream is over-widened with little riparian shade or cover in the
stream. The high hydraulic conductivity through the dredge tailings in the lower section
contributes to the influx of groundwater, which explains the slight cooling from the top of the
project area to the mouth. Diurnal fluctuations of 10 to 15º C were common instream, as 5 to 8º
C fluxes were recorded in the ponds in 2012 (RDG et. al. 2013a).
Although the ponds have lower temperatures and less diurnal flux than instream, their potential
as rearing habitat for Chinook and steelhead is low due to access limited to only high flows. For
the most part, ponds are not connected on an annual basis. Except for a few ponds that are
connected year-round, fish could not escape if the temperatures were too warm or too cold; some
ponds appear to freeze solid, as they are not very deep. During the winter, there is high
likelihood that the conditions in the ponds, such as low dissolved oxygen due to vegetation decay
and ice, are not conducive to fish survivability. Very few ponds have fish. Ponds that do
support fish are usually connected at all or most flows.
Potential increases or decreases in stream temperature were analyzed by assessing the conditions
and the nature and extent of activities in riparian areas that may result in increased or decreased
solar radiation to streams and connected wetland areas.

Solar radiation is the radiant energy emitted by the sun, of which a portion is available for energy
uptake on the earth in the form of light and heat. Solar pathfinder (instrument used to measure
the amount of solar radiation available to the ground) monitoring in 2012 yielded an average of
75% solar radiation available for the summer months (May through September; Table 3-4; RDG
et al. 2012). Readings in the heavily dredged areas with little to no vegetation increased up to
93.2%. Reed canary grass comprised the largest area of survey and ranged from 63.2 to 90.4%
solar radiation availability. Herbaceous plant communities recorded the highest percentage of
available solar radiation, and conifer-dominated communities recorded the lowest available solar
radiation readings. However, only 3% of greenline vegetation communities are conifers. Due to
their steep slopes, the dredge tailings typically do not support conifers; therefore, trees are
typically located a number of feet, both horizontally and vertically, from the edge of the channel,
so provides little shade to the channel (See Figure 3-8).

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, there would be no immediate changes to shade or other temperature-altering
processes in the project area. The lack of vegetation, over-widened stream conditions and slow
water velocities, and minimal shading would continue to impair stream temperatures in the
project area. Dredge tailings would continue to restrict riparian growth in the project area.
Leaving the tailings in place would allow the large trees currently growing among the piles to
remain in place; however, these trees currently provide little shade to the stream.
The existing amount of solar radiation available to the ground would continue in the short term
(up to 93% solar radiation), with an average of 75% solar radiation available for the summer
months (May through September) (Table 3-4). In the long-term, this would decrease as conifers
would continue to grow slowly in the nutrient-poor cobble tailing piles.
Temperature data collected in 2012 (August to November) and 2013 (June to October) , suggest
groundwater influence and hillslope interception. However, the stream temperature is fairly
warm. Figure 3-9 shows the stream temperatures throughout the Crooked River watershed, from
Orogrande to the mouth (Figure 3-9a location of samples). Crooker River near Orogrande
exhibits the coolest temperatures, which is typical of stream higher in the watershed. The river
warms as it travels towards the mouth. Notably, the water temperatures in the middle of the
meanders exhibited much cooler water temperatures that did not show much fluctuation
throughout the day or summer. Temperature at this site is most likely influenced from hillslope
water that is expressed in the river at this site. These types of hillslope and groundwater
expressions contribute to the slight cooling of surface water from the top of the project area to
the mouth. Although there is a slight cooling of water temperatures in the project area, water
temperatures are still above temperature indicators for steelhead and bull trout.
Water temperatures affect salmonids in various ways throughout their life cycle, including
spawning, juvenile rearing, migration and adult holding. Water temperatures in the project area
are not likely limiting steelhead spawning since spawning occurs in April through early June;
however, summer temperatures in the project area are likely limiting for juvenile steelhead,
Chinook salmon and bull trout rearing. Increased stream temperatures effects growth,
distribution, susceptibility to disease, and the overall survival of juvenile salmonids (Myrick and
Cech, 1998). Increased stream temperatures affect how juveniles feed; typically reducing overall
feeding (Beschta et al 1987). Increased stream temperatures can adversely affect holding adult
Chinook salmon by causing females to produce smaller offspring (EPA 1999). These are only a
few of the documented effects of increased water temperatures on salmonids and a full synthesis
of effects can be found in “A Review and Synthesis of the Effects of Alterations to the Water
Temperature Regime on Freshwater Life Stages of Salmonids, with Special Reference to Chinook
Salmon” by EPA (1999). Water temperatures in Crooked River are on the upper end of the
thermal regime that would reduce the productivity and survivability of salmonids. These
conditions are not likely to change under Alternative 1.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The Forest recognizes the existing water temperatures in Crooked River, in the project area, are
above ranges considered optimal for steelhead and bull trout spawning and migration (Table 33). Water temperature is not the primary limiting factor for steelhead spawning in the project
area. It is the lack of spawning substrate. However, temperatures in the project area, as well as
the lack of complex habitat are likely limiting juvenile salmonid summer rearing.
Due to the extremely altered valley bottom, surface water and hyporheic flow are not as
connected as in an unaltered state. The 2013 temperature data suggest that there are points of
hyporheic expression within the stream channel through the project area; however, the valley
bottom ponds are most likely intercepting the majority of the subsurface flow. Under
Alternative 1, the valley bottom would likely remain in the current condition for up to 5,000
years (Clear Creek Hydrology and North Wind 2004); subsurface cool water would interact with
the stream on a minimal scale, as compared to the stream intercepting the majority of the
subsurface flow.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, there would be a short-term direct effects to solar radiation by removing the
small amounts of riparian vegetation that are contributing to shading along Reach 2 and 3 in
Crooked River. Figure 3-8 shows Reaches 2 and 3 in July 2013. However, Reaches 2 and 3
(Figure 3-8) currently have minimal shade available, so the increase in solar radiation would be
negligible (see Water Resource section). Reaches 1 and 4 would not be realigned; therefore,
much of mature vegetation would remain along the banks to continue to provide shade to
Crooked River (Figures 3-4 and 3-5). Following construction of the new floodplain and channel,
stream-side vegetation would be established to provide ecological site conditions along the banks
that would support riparian vegetation. Long term, rehabilitation activities would be expected to
slowly decrease water temperatures through the project area via groundwater interaction in the
stream and increased shading from planting overstory vegetation, particularly in Reaches 2 and
3. Alternative 2 would result in a long-term reduction in solar radiation by 83% (Table 3-4).
As described above, temperature monitoring conducted in 2012 and 2013 suggests substantial
subsurface flow through the valley bottom (RDG et al, 2013; Nez Perce Tribe, 2013c). Grading
the floodplain and creating a pathway for the hillslope water to enter the valley and Crooked
River would increase the likelihood of cold water springs or seeps to influence subsurface and
surface water.
Water temperature data collected in shallow groundwater wells in the project area in July 2013,
showed 2–4ºC difference between subsurface water and surface water, with subsurface being
cooler (NPT 2013c). This indicates that there is potential for hyporheic exchange, which is the
water flowing just below the stream and floorplan surface. Grading the floodplain would
potentially reestablish a more natural surface and hyporheic water interaction , and likely
contribute to cooler instream temperatures through this exchange. In only one of eight locations,

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-29

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

the subsurface and surface water differed by less than 0.5ºC, suggesting high exchange between
surface and hyporheic water (NPT 2013c), however, most of the existing water in the current
condition is exposed to solar radiation near the surface of the water due to the numerous tailings
ponds.
In the project area, there are over 20 acres of open water, primarily as dredge ponds. The lack of
shade inputs can be seen as well as solar radiation potential in the ponds. These ponds intercept
groundwater and hyporheic flow in the project area. The ponds, although warm in the summer
months, have a less exaggerated diurnal flux that the river exhibits. This suggests that the ponds
are influenced by groundwater. Since, the ponds are not well shaded and are generally stagnant
and exposed to solar radiation, they heat up during the summer months. The majority of these
ponds would be filled under Alternative 2, which would greatly reduce the amount of surface
water exposed to solar radiation, and thus, allow the cooler groundwater to be intercepted by the
river rather than the open ponds.
The slope and length of the channel would be reduced in Alternative 2. This would also reduce
the amount of time surface water is exposed to solar radiation. The overall surface area in the
new river channel would be reduced by providing a narrower and deeper river channel. The
channel would be returned to a more natural sinuosity that would improve hyporheic exchange.
By increasing water velocities and reducing the width to depth and improving hyporheic
exchange, stream temperatures would not warm as quickly since the stream is not exposed to
solar radiation as long.
Another avenue of reducing stream temperatures is to reduce solar radiation is to increase
shading through re-vegetation efforts. Following grading, the project area would be re-planted
with 1- to 5-gallon alder, willow, dogwood, and spruce along with understory species. These
plants would have access to groundwater due to re-grading the floodplain and there would be
greater water holding capacity of the floodplain material due to the addition of woodchips and
soil material in the floodplain. This would provide greater growth potential for these species.
Vegetation planting would lead to shade over the stream channel as well as other surface water
areas like the remaining and created wetlands. With increased vegetation growth and connection
with Crooked River, the solar radiation availability should decrease over time, which could lead
to decreases in stream temperature. The Water Resources Section fully describes the effects of
shading on water temperatures.
There have been other similar restoration projects that have planted vegetation in cobble
substrate; all of them using different planting techniques, and with varying success. Planting
methods most similar to the proposed planting in Crooked River were used on the Clark Fork
River in Montana, and on the Pine Creek in northern Idaho. Both projects used dense willow
cuttings along the banks. The Clark Fork project used vegetative soil lifts, where willow cuttings
were planted between the lifts. Within two years, dense willow stands that are approximately 5
to 6 feet in height have formed along the banks (Sacry, Geum, Inc. Pers. comm., 2014). The
Pine Creek project used 1-gallon willow and alder plants that were installed via trench planting.
Two to three plants were installed per foot along the stream channel in cobble substrate. One-

gallon plants are approximately 1 to 2 feet tall. The plants grew about 4 to 5 feet within a couple
years of planting (Stevenson, BLM, Pers. comm., 2012).
Under Alternative 2, instream water temperatures should decrease over time due to increased
shade and groundwater connectivity. Amount of temperature change is very difficult to predict;
however, Meadow Creek, a tributary to the South Fork Clearwater, had a 3ºC decrease over
10 years following extensive riparian planting on approximately 2 miles of streambank (NPT
2013c). These types of decreases would be expected over the long term in Crooked River from
the proposed project. Similar results would move the Habitat Condition Rating from low to
moderate for juvenile steelhead rearing and migration.
Alternative 2 would reduce solar radiation and improve temperature conditions for steelhead
spawning and bull trout migration, in addition to improving other limiting factors (spawning
substrate, juvenile salmonid summer rearing habitat, and habitat complexity) in lower Crooked
River.

Fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) are listed as Threatened under the

14653 [57 FR 14653]). The listed evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) includes all natural
populations of fall-run Chinook salmon in the mainstem Snake River and the following river

basins: Tucannon River, Grande Ronde River, Imnaha River, Salmon River, and Clearwater
River. Critical habitat for fall Chinook salmon has been designated in the Clearwater subbasin
and includes the mainstem Clearwater River from Greer, Idaho, downstream to its confluence
with the Snake River, including all river reaches currently and historically accessible. Fall
Chinook salmon spawn and rear in the mainstem Clearwater River, as well as the lower reaches
of the South Fork Clearwater River downstream of the project area.
Fall Chinook salmon have not been documented in Crooked River or in the South Fork
Clearwater River within 30 miles downstream of Crooked River. Because of the distance of the
project area to the nearest occupied habitat, direct or indirect effects to spawning and rearing
habitat for fall Chinook salmon are not expected.
Snake River Steelhead Trout/Interior Redband Trout
Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) found in the Clearwater River and Salmon
River subbasins, including Crooked River, are part of the Snake River ESU currently listed as
threatened under the ESA (62 FR 43937). Steelhead trout are a Management Indicator Species
(MIS) in the Nez Perce Forest Plan. Interior redband trout, which are the resident form of O.
mykiss, are designated as a Forest Service sensitive species in Region 1 but are not currently
ESA-listed. In Crooked River, the O. mykiss population is largely anadromous, but there may be
a small component that is resident, primarily at the headwaters of smaller tributaries upstream of
the project area. Additional effects to resident O. mykiss, other than what is discussed below for
anadromous steelhead, are therefore not expected.
The South Fork Clearwater River subbasin and all accessible tributaries were designated as
critical habitat for steelhead (70 FR 52630), including Crooked River from its mouth to the
headwaters. Steelhead trout use Crooked River for both spawning and rearing purposes; the
naturally reproducing population has been supplemented with hatchery fish and is considered a
naturalized population due to supplementation efforts. Steelhead supplementation by IDFG in
Crooked River occurred in most year up to 2010
(http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/fish/stocking/).
Adult steelhead trout generally arrive at the mouth of the Clearwater River from September
through November, and migrate to tributary streams from January through May. Spawning
occurs from mid-March through early June, typically on a rising hydrograph and prior to peak
stream flows (Thurow 1987; Columbia River DART 2013). Fry emergence typically occurs
during June in the upper South Fork tributaries, and juveniles rear for 2 or 3 years in freshwater,
typically out-migrating in the spring high flow (Mullan et al. 1992).
Crooked River was probably a historic stronghold for steelhead spawning and early rearing
(USDA Forest Service 1998). Habitat degradation, including changes in aquatic habitat related
to mining activity and road building, limit habitat potential for steelhead trout in lower Crooked
River. Historic dredge mining activities have substantially reduced habitat potential (relative to

historical conditions) in some areas of the watershed through changes in channel structure and
function and substrate availability and distribution. Threats to steelhead include predation,
competition with invasive species, migration barriers, habitat degradation, and harvest (Ford
2011). Habitat degradation is probably the most substantial limiting factor to steelhead trout
within the Crooked River watershed. Much of the accessible habitat area for steelhead has been
altered by dredge mining, resulting in a loss of summer and winter rearing habitat. Alteration of
riparian communities from mining and other disturbances resulted in less woody debris available
to fall into the stream, lost floodplain function, and altered hydrologic regimes.
IDFG parr monitoring data from 1985 to 2003 in Crooked River suggest variable mean densities
across years, with a high of 12 fish/100 square meters (m2) in 2002 and a low of 0 fish counted in
1987. Mean densities generally ranged between 5 fish/100 m2 and 1 fish/100 m2 (Kiefer and
Lockhart 1997). Although these numbers are typical for many streams within the South Fork
Clearwater subbasin, they are much less than densities observed in Gedney Creek, a tributary to
the Selway River, Idaho, (Byrne 1994) and other wilderness and roadless streams, where
densities are frequently 25 fish/m2 and higher (Nez Perce National Forest unpublished data).
In addition, examination of fry data (undifferentiated salmonid fry other than salmon) suggests a
highly variable but general decline in mean densities from the 1980s and early 1990s. Although
data are inconclusive, they do suggest variable but low levels of recruitment in naturally
produced steelhead (Kiefer and Lockhart 1997).
Redd count data are available for a limited number of years in the Crooked River watershed
(South Fork Clearwater TMDL, IDEQ et al. 2004). 1990 surveys resulted in the highest number
of redds counted (over 25), with 4 redds counted in 1991, 1 redd in 1992, and 2 redds in 1993,
1994, and 1995. It should be noted, however, that accurate counts of steelhead redds are difficult
to obtain because detection may be compromised during high water conditions.
Adult steelhead trapping data are also available from 1990 to 2000 (South Fork Clearwater
TMDL, IDEQ et. al 2004). Total number of returns each year reached about 50–55 adults from
1990 to 1993. Following 1993, number of returns declined to less than 15 from 1994 to 1999. In
2000, 17 steelhead were trapped. Seven adults were trapped in 2001, and 13 were trapped in
2002 and 2003. It is possible that there are greater returns of adults to Crooked River than
indicated by trapping data, if adults are migrating outside the trapping period.
Adult Habitat Requirements:
As adult steelhead migrate up the tributaries, pools, and particularly pools with complexity, are
essential. Prior to spawning, steelhead hold in pools to rest in their upstream migration. Large
woody debris and boulders provide hydraulic complexity and vertical and lateral structure within
pools. This creates areas with very low velocities for adults to conserve energy. In addition,
pool forming and maintenance processes are hinged on the presence of wood and boulders.

Naturally maintaining pools are an important feature of the stream system to ensure the holding
area for the adults as they prepare to spawn.
Clean, well-aerated spawning gravels are necessary for successful steelhead spawning. Gravels
near holding pools are selected more often for spawning. Sites with cover nearby are also
selected more often than sites without cover (Spence et al. 1996). Woody debris and riparian
vegetation are important components for adult steelhead. Both can help maintain water
temperatures, as well as create hydraulic complexity and cover.
Juvenile Habitat Requirements:
Juvenile steelhead utilize every part of a complex channel at some stage in their freshwater
period. Hatching and emergence from the redd is dependent upon many factors; the most
important being the maintenance of clean, unembedded, yet stable, gravels in the redd. This
ensures adequate oxygenation of the eggs, removal of waste, and ability for fry to emerge from
the gravels. When fry are out of the intragravel environment, they seek refuge on stream
margins or in alcoves where water velocities are very slow. Again, cover and woody debris are
important components of these habitats for visual isolation and hiding from predators.
Once the fry become large enough, they move into riffle type habitats for the summer months
(Roni and Quinn 2001). They feed on macroinvertebrates in drift. As the water becomes colder,
they begin to move into pools for the winter. The added complexity from woody debris allows
fish to use less energy to still be able to feed. When winter is at its peak, steelhead parr seek
refuge in the interstitial spaces among unembedded cobbles (Bustard and Narver 1975). Lastly,
side channels, alcoves, and floodplain areas are highly used during high flow events as velocity
and turbidity refugia (Fraser and Cerri 1982, Bustard and Narver 1975).
Effects:
Alternative 1 would not result in additional direct or indirect effects to steelhead trout.
Alternative 1 would be expected to maintain existing conditions with no habitat improvement in
the foreseeable future. The Meanders section would not support additional spawning or rearing
habitat and juvenile steelhead densities would remain relatively low. The Meanders section
would likely continue to degrade through increased sedimentation of cobbles and gravels, and
the pools would likely fill in with sediment over time.
The pools could provide holding areas for adults, and possible rearing areas for juveniles.
However, there is little to no complexity among most of the pools. Moreover, the substrate in
the project area is armored, limiting spawning areas and overwintering cobbles for juveniles.
Alternative 2 would result in direct and indirect effects to steelhead trout. Direct effects would
primarily occur during the project construction phase. Juvenile steelhead would likely be present
when Crooked River is de-watered and would therefore be subjected to disturbance, handling,

and potential mortality, although design criteria and salvage are expected to minimize mortality.
In addition to fish densities data collected during parr monitoring, recent snorkel surveys suggest
densities of juvenile steelhead are very low. Based on these observations, when the channel is
de-watered, the number of fish affected is expected to be low as well. Although individual
juvenile steelhead would be affected by the project in the short term during implementation,
effects to staging or spawning adult steelhead and redds would be limitied because of the timing
of the de-watering events (after July 15th). There would be minimal effects to emergent fry due
to few redds predicted within the project reaches and with design measures intended to reduce or
eliminate the potential to affect adults and/or de-watered redds.
There would also be direct effects to steelhead once the bypass channel is decommissioned at the
end of the channel reconstruction phase through dewatering efforts. Fish immediately
downstream of the bypass channel would be temporarily affected by short-term increases in
suspended sediment when it is initially watered, and again when the new channel is watered
following reconstruction and decommissioning of the bypass channel. However, these effects
would be minimal since turbidity levels would be kept below 50 NTUs during the watering of
the channels. Adult and juvenile steelhead are expected to use the bypass channel for migration
during the channel construction phase; additional direct effects could include compromised
migration or navigation through the project area. The bypass channel was designed purely to
maintain fish passage for the duration of the project.
Indirect effects to steelhead would generally include long-term improved habitat conditions tied
to the indicators previously discussed, such as cover, spawning and rearing areas, and potentially
lower stream temperatures. Alternative 2 proposes an increase in riffle habitat with a decrease in
pool habitat; however, the quality of pool habitat would be improved with the addition of large
wood complexes and potential decreases in stream temperatures due to riparian cover and
increased groundwater connections. Unlike cutthroat and bull trout, juvenile steelhead are more
often associated with riffle habitat for both feeding and rearing (Roni and Quinn 2001; Everest
and Chapman 1972); however, juvenile steelhead can undergo seasonal habitat redistribution and
pool habitat with large wood complexes could be a winter time habitat preference for juvenile
steelhead (Swales et al. 1985; Meehan and Bjornn 1991). Riffle habitat is ideal for juvenile
steelhead since they thrive in habitat with increased velocities, decreased water depth and
increased unembbeded cobble substrate used primarily for cover. Given the increase in riffle
habitat under the proposed action and documented affiliation to unembedded substrate in riffle
areas, juvenile steelhead densities would be expected to increase within the project area. During
winter months, juvenile steelhead may stay closely associated with riffle areas or could take
advantage of improved pool habitat. Improved pool habitat would be utilized seasonally by
returning adult spawners and increased riffle habitat could increase spawning habitat within the
project area. The proposed increase in riffle area would most likely increase spawning and
rearing, and increases to steelhead recruitment would be expected.

Proposed side channel and alcove areas would increase rearing habitat and provide refugia for
juveniles during high flows. The side channel is designed to be activated above baseflow
(approximately flows greater than 50 cfs). Given the existing stream channel is highly
entrenched with little to no floodplain interaction it is unknown how these additional habitat
features would be utilized by juvenile salmonids. Previous research in intermountain streams of
British Columbia suggests that side channels with complex habitat and off-channel ponds were
commonly utilized by juvenile salmonids during peak discharge, as refugia during increasing
summer water temperatures, and in some cases, primary overwintering habitat due to warmer
temperatures compared to the main channel (Swales et al. 1986; Swales and Levings 1989).
Proposed side channels and swale areas are expected to be activated at flows greater than 50 cfs
so, it is expected that primary benefits to juvenile salmonids would be refugia during high flows.
Duration of active side channels would be dependent on spring flows. Since the side channel
would be activated above baseflow, side channel habitat may also provide additional spawning
habitat. Side channel activation time is unknown and would most likely change annually; there
may be unintended risk to steelhead redds if steelhead do spawn in the side channel and flows
become too low (stranding of redds before fry emergence).
Steelhead, as well as, spring/summer Chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat and bull trout have
the potential to be vulnerable to climate change in the Colombia River Basin. Modeled
responses to climate change in the Columbia River Basin include a shift from a snow melt
dominated system to a rain dominated system, diminished snow packs in all but the highest
elevations, increased peak streamflow and increased stream temperature (ISAB 2007; ISAB
2011; Clark and Harris 2011). Changes in timing of peak flow are also likely to occur (Croizer
et al. 2008), with spring runoff occurring earlier and summer base flows likely to be lower in the
future. These hydrologic changes can have significant impacts on salmonids. Increased peak
flows can scour redds, and change overall stream channel morphology (increased width to depth
ratio). Changes in flow timing can alter smolt outmigration and lower base flows can lead to
increased energy expenditure for migrating adults and reduce potential holding areas (Croizer et
al. 2008).
Indirect and beneficial effects of the proposed project include increasing habitat diversity,
restoring hydrologic and hydraulic processes towards a more natural state, and providing
resilience capacity within the system to future stressors. As stated by the Independent Scientific
Advisory Board (2011):
It is important to consider the diversity, spatial array, and connectivity of habitats
for conserving and restoring the diversity of movement patterns and life histories
in this age of climate change. The suitability of different habitats will change due
to increasing temperatures in both fresh water and the ocean (ISAB 2007), to
changes in the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling, to rising sea levels and to
increasing ocean acidity. This diversity is therefore a hedge against uncertainty

and climate change that threaten the resilience and productivity of many
populations.
The proposed project has several features that, when implemented, would serve to ameliorate the
adverse effects that climate change could have on fish and their habitat. Floodplain restoration
and riparian restoration have the obvious benefits of attenuating peak flows and providing stream
shading. Providing streambank capacity of water storage can allow for a slow release of water
during low summer base flows. Improving instream complexity by providing quality pools,
overhead cover (large woody debris), and sinuosity would provide more holding areas for adult
salmon prior to spawning and for juveniles during rearing. Improved sinuosity can also improve
hyporheic flow and groundwater interaction to reduce stream temperatures (NPT, 2013c,
unpublished data).
Under Alternative 2, ESA consultation with NMFS on the actions and potential effects would
occur. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Biological Assessment (BA) was prepared in
accordance with the following guidance and direction:
• Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (as amended),
• 50 CFR § 402.12 (Interagency Cooperation, Biological Assessments),
• Endangered Species Consultation Handbook (USFWS and NMFS, March 1998),
• Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (§ 305(b)) and it’s
implementing regulations (50CFR § 600).
Under this consultation NMFS would issue an incidental take statement for direct effects to
individual steelhead trout. This project is consistent with habitat restoration goals outlined in the
draft Snake River recovery plan for salmon and steelhead (draft NMFS 2011).
Columbia River Bull Trout
Columbia River bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) were listed as a threatened species under the
ESA in 1998 (Federal Register, Vol. 63, No. 31647). Broad scale bull trout declines in
distribution and abundance over the past century led to no harvest regulations and the Threatened
ESA listing. All populations of this char in the contiguous 48 states were designated with
Threatened status on November 1, 1999 (64 FR58910). On October 18, 2010, the USFWS
designated critical habitat for bull trout throughout their U.S. range, which included the
Clearwater River and many of its tributaries, such as Crooked River (50 CFR 17).
Bull trout are widely distributed throughout the South Fork Clearwater River, including parts of
the Crooked River. To date, the South Fork Clearwater has the most comprehensive data set for
bull trout within the Clearwater recovery unit. Five local populations have been identified (Red
River, Crooked River, Newsome Creek, Tenmile and Johns Creek) along with 2 potential
populations (American River and Mill Creek). The trend in data for the South Fork Clearwater
River indicate that bull trout were declining in the mid 1990’s but appear to be stable (IDFG
2005a; Meyer et al. 2013; Ardren et al. 2011) in most core areas in Idaho. Although considered
stable, the USFWS 2002 recovery plan states that due to a large migratory component (fluvial

life-history) of bull trout in the South Fork Clearwater River core areas, these populations are
considered at intermediate risk. Although research is limited on certain tributaries, such as
Crooked River, many are considered to have very high habitat potential for bull trout (USDA
Forest Service 1998; IDFG 2005a-Appendix D). Upper Crooked River (East and West Forks of
Crooked River) is considered a habitat stronghold for spawning and early rearing.
Adult Habitat Needs:
Screwtrap data collected from IDFG (BA Appendix B, Gross, 2014a) support that there is a
strong fluvial life-history component present within the Crooked River bull trout population.
This is also consistent with Ardren et al. (2011) genetics study as well. These data suggest that
bull trout rear in headwater streams, and migrate to larger rivers between ages one and four years
to mature, which is generally consistent with many other studies documented in Rieman and
McIntyre (1993). Most likely, adult bull trout in Crooked River begin to migrate to natal streams
beginning with higher stream flows in early summer with higher flows to avoid migration during
low flow and high summer water temperatures. This migration behavior has also been well
documented in Schoby and Keeley (2011) in the Upper Salmon River system. Temperatures in
Crooked River during this time are above the optimum for bull trout; however, temperature
monitoring has shown areas of cool water inputs (from subsurface flow entering the stream) and
migrating fish could find cool water relief in these microsites (Nez Perce Trib, 2013c,
Unpublished data). Spawning usually occurs during late summer and early fall (SeptemberOctober), with young emerging the following spring (Ratliff 1992). Spawning typically begins
when water temperatures reach 5 to 9 °C, along with certain stream flow and photoperiod
conditions (Shepard et al. 1984). Suitable water temperatures for spawning range from
approximately 2 to 4 °C and should not exceed 8 °C (Weaver and Fraley 1991). Optimal
spawning conditions occur in lower gradients, typically in pool tailouts in loose gravels and
cobbles, with water depths averaging 12 inches (Fraley and Shepard 1989). Schoby and Keeley
(2011) also document that spawning bull trout may quickly return to lower stream reaches by
early fall to take advantage of egg deposition from the spawning Chinook salmon. Egg and
carcass material are rich in nutrients and lipids important for overwintering salmonids (Bilby et
al. 2001; Wipfli et al. 2010).
Juvenile Habitat Needs:
Along with cold water temperatures, bull trout require complex habitat with large wood
contributing to pool formation. Large wood provides cover, important for bull trout of all
different age classes, and provides substrate for increased invertebrate production and nutrient
inputs to the stream. Ideal juvenile rearing occurs throughout a drainage where suitable water
temperatures (< 15 °C) and overhead cover (LWD) are present (Leider et al. 1986; Fraley and
Shepard 1989; McPhail and Murray 1979; Liknes and Graham 1988; Saffel and Scarnecchia
1995). Bonneau and Scarnecchia (1997) document that juvenile bull trout have a strong
affiliation with stream substrate. The interstitial space between substrate was highly utilized by
juvenile bull trout, particularly during the winter months and primarily during the day.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Macroinvertebrate production and sediment levels can also dictate available bull trout rearing
habitat within a stream.
Effects:
Under Alternative 1, improvement in habitat condition for bull trout would not occur into the
foreseeable future, and current conditions would be maintained; there would be no additional
direct or indirect effects to bull trout. There is limited snorkel survey data in the lower reaches
of Crooked River; the pool habitat that is present provides marginal overwintering/rearing
habitat for juvenile and adult bull trout and serves as a migration corridor for spawning adult bull
trout during the early summer months and fall when they return from their spawning grounds.
The Meanders reach would remain unchanged and provide only marginal migratory habitat for
adults and rearing/overwintering habitat for juvenile bull trout due to temperature and substrate
conditions.
Alternative 2 would result in both direct and indirect effects to bull trout. Similar to steelhead,
direct effects would occur during the project construction phase and migration through the
bypass channel. It is possible that adult and juvenile bull trout could be present when Crooked
River is de-watered and could be subjected to disturbance, handling, and potential mortality.
Design criteria for fish salvage and dewatering of the channel after July 15th are expected to
minimize mortality. Given timing of juvenile outmigrants, movement of adult spawners to
headwater reaches, and past snorkel data (BA Appendix B), the number of bull trout affected
within the project area during de-watering and construction phases is expected to be low.
Similar to steelhead, indirect effects to bull trout would generally include long-term improved
habitat conditions tied to the indicators previously discussed. In particular, stream temperature
reductions following implementation would benefit bull trout, as they are among the most
thermally sensitive fish species in coldwater habitats (Rieman and McIntyre 1993). It is
expected that a long term decrease in stream temperatures due to increased riparian cover,
improved hydraulics, and potential reconnectivity with groundwater inputs would also improve
overall pool quality by providing thermal refugia. Bull trout have a very narrow thermal “niche”
and would be most affected by improved stream temperatures. Cooler water temperatures would
benefit migratory adults in the summer and fall and possible groundwater inputs and deep pools
would benefit both adults and juveniles that may be overwintering in the lower reaches of
Crooked River (Dunham et al. 2003).
Bull trout are more closely associated with pool habitat instead of riffle environments and
spawning occurs in headwater tributaries of Crooked River. Improved pool quality and increases
in habitat complexity from addition of large woody debris would be expected to create additional
holding areas for migrating bull trout and rearing areas for juveniles. Although there would be a
small loss in pool habitat under Alternative 2, the placement of large wood would provide cover
preferred by both adult and juvenile bull trout; large wood is currently lacking within the project
area. With the addition of large wood and improved hydraulics, recruitment of large,
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

unembedded substrate would also be expected. Unembedded cobble substrate is ideal cover for
rearing/overwintering juvenile bull trout and many studies have documented bull trout associated
with substrate feeding primarily on benthic invertebrates (Nakano et al. 1992, Bonneau and
Scarnecchia 1998).
Similarily to steelhead, side channel and alcove use by bull trout would be primarily used during
high flow events and provide refugia for outmigrating smolts or juveniles within the project area.
It is expected that increases in habitat complexity and improved connectivity to cold water
refugia in upper Crooked River would help fluvial bull trout populations become more resilient
to climate change events.
Given adult bull trout are highly piscivorous, higher densities of fish overall within the project
area would be expected to benefit bull trout as available prey would increase. Long term
improvements in habitat condition in this section of Crooked River would contribute to
improving migratory passage and overwintering habitat, preserving fluvial life history, and
moving towards recovery for this species; particularly due to its importance in the South Fork
Clearwater subbasin.
Maintaining this migration corridor and overwintering habitat in the lower Crooked River is
essential, considering the additional threats to bull trout. Changes in stream morphology, habitat
complexity, temperature, and LWD to increase pool quality (lack of cover), are believed to limit
habitat potential for bull trout in the lower Crooked River. There are few additional
anthropogenic barriers in the watershed that interfere with bull trout migration. Additional
threats to bull trout in the Crooked River and the greater South Fork Clearwater River include
possible hybridization and competition with brook trout, isolation/fragmentation of populations
from anthropogenic barriers across other areas of the South Fork Clearwater River subbasin, and
threats from wildfire disturbance given isolated populations within many of the smaller
tributaries and effects from climate change.
Climate change is an uncertainty when considering threats to bull trout in the South Fork
Clearwater River subbasin. There have been warming stream temperatures in portions of the
bull trout’s range in Idaho since at least 1980 and bull trout are expected to have the greatest
sensitivity to warming streams given their need for cold water temperatures (Isaak et al. 2010;
Rieman and Isaak 2010; Wenger et al. 2011; Isaak and Rieman 2013). There has been some
research that has shown that milder winter conditions over the last several decades and possibly
into the near future may result in increased fall-to-spring growth. However, increased winter
flow from intense precipitation events can cause amplified flow regimes causing streambed scour
and disturbance to spawning sites (Isaak et al. 2012).
This project is consistent with habitat restoration goals outlined in the draft recovery plan for
Columbia River bull trout (draft USDI-FWS 2002) and is prepared in accordance with ESA
Section 7(a) consultation.

Spring Chinook Salmon
Spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are present in the South Fork Clearwater
River and many of its tributaries. Indigenous Chinook salmon in the Clearwater subbasin were
eliminated by the Lewiston Dam in 1927, which functioned as a barrier to Chinook salmon
migration until the early 1940s (Matthews and Waples 1991), but naturalized stocks exist in
Crooked River and other areas of the subbasin as a result of reintroduction efforts. Due to their
reintroduced status, spring Chinook salmon in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin are excluded
from ESA-listings encompassing other spring and summer Chinook salmon stocks throughout
the Snake River basin (NOAA Fisheries 2003). Spring Chinook salmon are, however, included
as a sensitive species in Region 1, U.S. Forest Service, and are a management indicator species
(MIS) for the Nez Perce National Forest (USDA 1987; USDA Forest Service 2011b).
IDFG operates a weir and trapping facility for spring Chinook salmon near the mouth of
Crooked River, downstream of the project area. IDFG parr monitoring indicates variable
densities from the mid-1980s through 2003, with an overall decline from the late 1980s (Kiefer
and Lockhart 1997). Numbers are somewhat stable from 2000 to 2013, with relative stability
attributable in part to hatchery supplementation. Redd count data and adult return data (taken at
the collection weir near the mouth) suggest an increased number of adult returns after 2000,
which are correlated with increased counts of spring/summer Chinook at Lower Granite dam and
likely reflect increased survival of both juveniles and adults at dams in the Columbia and Snake
Rivers, and consistent hatchery supplementation supported by IDFG’s Crooked River’s rearing
and propagation facility (IDFG 2010b).
Adult spring Chinook salmon numbers returning to Crooked River range from around 350 fish to
about 800 fish (IDFG 2010b, 2011, 2012) with the exception of 654 adult Chinook Salmon that
were captured at the weir in 2004. Of the adult fish that are trapped annually, only about 30 fish
are passed above the weir because of the Idaho Supplementation Study, which, is a hatchery
program for spring Chinook salmon, (IDFG 2010b, 2011, 2012); half of those were females or an
undetermined sex. Redd counts in the watershed ranged from 4 to 17 from 2007 to 2011, which
corresponds to the number of females and unknown sexes that were passed above the weir.
Considering the combined risks of temporal variability, population size, and growth and survival,
spring Chinook salmon are at moderate risk of extinction (NOAA Fisheries 2003). Hatchery
propagation lend a measure of stability and insurance against extinction; however,
supplementation comes with its own risks including loss of wild gene pool, reduced wild
spawning escapement from the collection of broodstock, mixed hatchery and wild stock
fisheries, and transmission of disease. Hatchery supplementation can be viewed as both
insurance against extinction and a potential liability towards genetic integrity, depending on
implementation. Although hatchery supplementation has most likely boosted adult returns,
habitat restoration is an essential key component to ensuring increased numbers of spring
Chinook salmon in the South Fork Clearwater River. Historic mining activity on Lower

Crooked River has resulted in the loss of habitat complexity and restoration of these lower
reaches may improve rearing and migration through these lower reaches.
Under Alternative 1, the No Action alternative, no project actions would be implemented. As a
result, there would be no additional direct or indirect effects to spring Chinook or their Essential
Fish Habitat and would therefore, not result in effects to species viability. Currently, the stream
reaches within the proposed project area provide low-quality spawning habitat and warm
summer water temperatures; there would be limited potential for habitat improvement under this
alternative. Warmer water temperatures encourage adult spring Chinook salmon to return to
freshwater earlier and warmer freshwater temperatures also delays spawning timing; therefore,
adults spend more time in freshwater, which increase pre-spawning mortality (Croizer et al.
2008).
Alternative 2 would result in direct and indirect effects to spring Chinook salmon. The proposed
action would have short-term direct effects on spring/summer Chinook habitat, primarily during
construction of the floodplain and new channel. Juvenile salmon would likely be present when
Crooked River is de-watered and would be subject to disturbance, handling, and potential
mortality, although design criteria and salvage are expected to minimize mortality. Direct
handling would most likely occur when the bypass channel is decommissioned at the end of the
channel reconstruction phase. Individual fish immediately downstream of the bypass channel
would also be temporarily affected by short-term increases in suspended sediment when it is
initially watered, and then again when the new channel is watered following reconstruction and
decommissioning of the bypass channel. However, mitigation measures would keep turbidity
levels below 50 NTUS, which would reduce the overall impact of sediment on downstream fish.
In addition, adult and juvenile salmon are expected to use the bypass channel for migration for
the duration of the channel construction phase, so fish passage would continue to occur.
There are short term effects to adult fish; spawning areas used by spring Chinook salmon in
Reach 2 would be unavailable during construction of Phases 1 and 2. Reach 2 in the project area
supports the highest number of spawning Chinook in the lower Crooked River and a mile stretch
of river above the Narrows provides the second highest area of redds. One redd was counted in
Reach 3 in 2010. These are the only reaches within Crooked River that currently support spring
Chinook spawning. The number of spring Chinook returning to Crooked River has been low
over the past 10 years and many spring Chinook were not passed above the weir due to the Idaho
Supplementation Study (ISS) (IDFG 2009-2011). As a part of this study, only non-fin clipped
females were passed above the weir. The greatest number of females passed above the weir in
the past 10 years was 6. The number of redds counted each year corresponded to the number of
females passed above the weir. Because the number of females being passed above the weir
each year is low, it is likely that these females would find sufficient spawning areas above the
project reaches, even with Reach 2 being inaccessible. Therefore the effects of excluding salmon
from the project area during construction are minimal.

Although individual juvenile salmon would be affected by the project for the short term during
implementation, and limited mortality could occur, effects to staging or spawning adult salmon
and salmon redds are not expected because of the timing of the de-watering events, and lack of
redds documented in the past in the project area. It may be necessary to truck Chinook salmon
that arrive at the weir before the dewatering of the main channel and before the bypass channel is
activated above the project area to avoid additional short term impacts to spring Chinook.
Similar to steelhead and bull trout, indirect effects to salmon would generally include long-term
improved habitat conditions tied to the indicators previously discussed, such as cover and
spawning and rearing habitat. Chinook spawn in larger, low gradient streams and would benefit
greatly, from the proposed increase in overall riffle habitat. Due in part to the ISS program, many
smolts use existing pool habitat within the project area to rear and overwinter. Improved pool
complexity, large wood structures and constructed side channels and alcoves would provide
more ideal rearing habitat especially during high peak flows. Wood cover provides safety from
predators, where off channel habitat provides refuge from spring high flows. Loss of some pool
habitat may intensify competitive interactions with other native fish. Studies have suggested that
juvenile spring Chinook and steelhead of the same size use relatively the same space; however,
given differences in time of spawning, there are discrete interactions between size/age groups of
pre-smolts (Everest and Chapman 1972). Pool habitat complexity would also be increased under
Alternative 2, which would allow more fish to use these pools without increasing competition
(Fausch 1993; Imre et al 2002). The size differences and increase in habitat complexity
minimizes potential for competitive interactions.
Compared to other native salmonids such as bull trout and cutthroat, juvenile spring Chinook are
more tolerant of high water temperatures. It is unclear if juvenile Chinook would further benefit
from decreased stream temperatures especially given timing of migration during high flows.
Given the increase in spawning habitat and continued supplementation efforts more juvenile
salmon would be expected to be present in the project area.
Short-term direct effects to spring Chinook salmon populations in Crooked River and the upper
South Fork Clearwater River are expected to be minimal due to low fish densities. First,
implementation of project design criteria and fish salvage operations are expected to minimize
direct mortality of juvenile salmon. Second, high numbers of juvenile salmon have not been
observed in reaches proposed for de-watering during snorkel surveys conducted in 2013; so the
potential to affect large numbers of juveniles is low. Third, IDFG collection, propagation, and
supplementation practices in Crooked River provide a source of locally adapted smolts that are
stocked in high numbers annually in Crooked River. Lastly, connectivity to other source
populations of spring Chinook salmon in the upper South Fork Clearwater is high and IDFG
supplementation program will be ongoing.

Westslope Cutthroat Trout
Westslope cutthroat trout are widely distributed across the South Fork Clearwater subbasin, in
the river and the most accessible tributaries. Collectively, the various subpopulations are
considered to comprise an important metapopulation in the Clearwater River basin (USDA
1998). This species is not currently ESA-listed, but is included as a sensitive species in Region 1,
U.S. Forest Service, and was declared a MIS in 1987 under the Nez Perce Forest Plan (USDA
1987; USDA Forest Service 2011b). The USFWS was petitioned to list the species as threatened
throughout its range in June 1997. In April 2000, the USFWS published findings that the species
is not likely to become either threatened or endangered within the foreseeable future (65 CFR
20120).
The South Fork Clearwater subbasin has high inherent capacity to support westslope cutthroat
trout, based on general features such as climate, elevation, relief, and geology (USDA 1998).
Historically, the distribution of westslope cutthroat in the South Fork Clearwater River is
unknown. Currently in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin, westslope cutthroat trout exist
primarily as subpopulations in the upper reaches of streams and their tributaries such as Crooked
River. Cutthroat trout are widely distributed but population strength is highly variable. Although
numerous subpopulations exist, the fluvial component of this metapopulation is either very
depressed or essentially nonexistent, probably due to past angling pressure and habitat
degradation in the lower reaches of larger tributaries such as Newsome Creek and Crooked River
(USDA 1998). Establishment of restrictive harvest regulations by IDFG in both the South Fork
Clearwater River and Crooked River should result in increased abundance of larger fish (DuPont,
IDFG. Pers. comm., 2014). Cutthroat trout in the subbasin are part of small, resident populations
located in the headwaters of most tributaries, with fewer fish migrating or overwintering in the
South Fork Clearwater River itself (Dobos, University of Idaho. Pers. comm.,2014; Gross,
IDFG; Pers.comm. 2014a; USDA Forest Service, 1998). Although these resident populations are
generally not isolated from the mainstem by physical barriers, migration may be impeded by
high summer temperatures and/or high flow events.
Specific to Crooked River, westslope cutthroat trout spawn and rear in most tributaries in upper
Crooked River. IDFG parr monitoring data show no definitive trend in westslope cutthroat trout
densities (DuPont, IDFG. Pers.comm., 2014). Mean densities appear to be less than other
tributaries in the South Fork Clearwater, including Newsome Creek and Red River. Highs of 1.8
and 1.6 fish/100 m2 were documented in 1989 and 2001, respectively; mean densities ranged
between 0 and 0.6 fish/100 m2 in all other years where data are available (1985–2003). It should
be noted, however, that monitoring sites are not located in the areas of the watershed with the
highest known cutthroat densities, such as West and East Fork Crooked Rivers. Monitoring sites
are limited to mainstem areas (Kiefer and Lockhart 1997). Limited density data are also available
from the Nez Perce National Forest database, but these data were taken in largely the same areas
as IDFG parr monitoring data and indicate similar mean densities. Although it is generally
understood where the population strongholds exist, density data are not available.

Movement and position in a drainage is signaled by diel shifts, seasonal/annual cycles to feed,
grow and reproduce and seek refuge from unfavorable environments. As documented data show
that the headwater reaches provide strong rearing and spawning habitat components, but
connectivity between heterogeneous habitats in the lower South Fork Clearwater reaches for
fluvial cutthroat is important (USDA Forest Service 1998). Lower Crooked River provides that
connectivity; however, timing and movement of fluvial cutthroat trout is largely unknown and is
currently being researched by IDFG in cooperation with the University of Idaho. Additional
information needs to be obtained but, the mean home range of fish released in Crooked River
was 14,462 meters with the majority of tagged fish moving into the South Fork Clearwater
(Dobos 2014, unpublished data). As summer time temperatures increased in early July, fish
generally moved great distances up into tributaries (Crooked and American rivers and Newsome
Creek) over a short period of time (2-3 days). As water temperatures decrease, fluvial adults
descended into large pools within the mainstem Crooked River. Screw trap data (DuPont, IDFG,
Pers.comm., 2014) indicate that juvenile migration is timed with the predictable high spring time
flows and fall precipitation events, along with cool temperatures.
Current distribution of habitat and population strongholds in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin
is strongly correlated with low or no road density (USDA 1998). This correlation is probably due
to lower sediment effects associated with roads and angler access, which, would be lower in the
absence of roads. Harvest of cutthroat trout, habitat disruption, and introduced species are likely
the most important factors affecting cutthroat trout in the subbasin. Brook trout, which are
present in many of the same areas as cutthroat, may displace cutthroat trout through competitive
interaction (Peterson and Fausch 2003, Peterson et al. 2004). In addition, hatchery rainbow trout,
which have historically been stocked in both streams and lakes in the subbasin, may hybridize
with cutthroat trout. Portions of Upper Crooked River that provide viable spawning and rearing
habitat for cutthroat would be/are directly affected by past and future timber harvest activities,
forest fuel treatments, and temporary road construction associated with these projects.
Westslope cutthroat trout are at a lower risk of extinction based on the survival and growth
population characteristics in specific areas throughout its range, including the South Fork
Clearwater River, that remain relatively unaffected by human activity. Available data indicate
extremely low fluvial adults in both the main river and mainstem tributaries (DuPont, IDFG.
Pers. comm., 2014). Subpopulations exist in near isolation with limited opportunities for
recolonization in the event of a local extinction. In addition, climatic variability and watershed
disturbance can alter food availability, growth and habitat connectivity and may alternately favor
or discourage movement.
Effects:
Under Alternative 1, no project actions would be implemented. As a result, there would be no
direct effects of the proposed activities to westslope cutthroat trout or their habitat; however, the
indirect effects of maintaining or degrading the current condition could result in effects to

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-45

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

species viability. There would be little opportunity for habitat improvement in the short or long
term and the lower reaches would continue to provide limited habitat complexity.
Under Alternative 2, short term effects from the proposed actions are similar to those for bull
trout and steelhead and include a compromised migration route for fluvial cutthroat trout.
According to screw trap data (DuPont, IDFG. Pers. comm., 2014), there are variable numbers of
fluvial cutthroat, and in more recent years, limited adults have been detected migrating from the
mainstem Crooked River. Lower Crooked River primarily serves as a migration corridor for
fluvial adults spawning in Crooked River headwaters or seeking refuge from high water
temperatures in the South Fork Clearwater River (USDA Forest Service 1998). Given past data,
numbers of fluvial fish are often highly variable and most cutthroat remain resident and isolated
in headwater tributaries to Crooked River.
Dewatering of the main channel and diversion to the bypass channel would occur during the
instream work window at low flow (July 15th). Effects from construction of the bypass channel
on fluvial cutthroat should be minimal although there is potential of individual cutthroat to be
subject to disturbance, handling or mortality during dewatering and fish salvage of the main
channel. In addition, there could be direct disturbance to individual fish downstream of the
project site upon rewatering of the channel from increased sediment inputs. However, these
effects would be minimal since turbidity levels would be kept below 50 NTUs during the
watering of the channels. Recent data suggest most fluvial juvenile cutthroat out-migrate prior to
this date and fluvial adults have migrated to upper portions of the watershed to either spawn or
avoid high water temperatures. This assumption is based on IDFG screw trap data, previous
USFS stream surveys, and research conducted through University of Idaho (DuPont, IDFG. Pers.
comm,, 2014; Dobos 2014, unpublished data). Once constructed, the bypass channel would
allow for unimpeded migration for fluvial fish.
Overwintering and movement by cutthroat in the lower reaches of Crooked River have been less
studied, and winter time habitat occupation by cutthroat in the Meanders reaches is largely
unknown. Dobos’ work, ongoing through University of Idaho, found that once stream
temperatures began to drop (September-October), fluvial cutthroat began to migrate to large
pools in lower Crooked River including parts within the project area. These fish were not later
detected in the South Fork Clearwater River and were presumed to hold and overwinter in lower
Crooked River. There would be pools in the temporary bypass channel, but the quality and
quantity are unknown. Again, the bypass channel would be built for fish passage and not
necessarily for spawning, rearing, or overwintering habitat. There would be a reduction in pool
habitat, mostly years 2 through 4 of implementation, as that is when the full bypass channel
would be active. It is unknown what effects the reduction of pool habitat would have on
overwintering fluvial cutthroat. It is assumed that the lower reaches provide some viable
wintering habitat, and during construction phases of the main channel, a small number of
overwintering adults could be displaced to the South Fork Clearwater River in the short term and
possibly until adequate pool habitat has been reestablished. In the long term, pool habitat and
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

pool forming processes should be active throughout the project area to maintain ideal
overwintering habitat for adults.
Under Alternative 2, there would be a change in pool:riffle ratio with increased pool complexity.
Thus, acres of rearing habitat would decrease but, quality of pool habitat would improve (depth,
pool formation processes, complexity, cover, temperature, etc.). Large wood contributing to pool
formation would create dynamic instream structure. Dynamic structures would allow for varying
degrees of substrate aggradation. This constant shift in substrate composition or stability of
aggraded substrate in some cases, allows for substrate that can offer refugia for a juvenile
salmonid (Bonneau and Scarnecchia 1998). Large wood provides important cover for cutthroat
(Roni and Quinn 2001) and provides substrate for increased invertebrate production and nutrient
inputs to the stream. Complexity, like large wood in pools, creates visual isolation for fish,
reducing their territory size; this allows for potential growth increases as less energy is used
defending territory, and a potential for reduced direct competition if fish are visually isolated
(Imre et al. 2002).
As mentioned above, recent studies have observed limited cutthroat occupation in the pools
during the summer months and overwintering in lower Crooked River is largely unknown but
assumed to be utilized primarily by fluvial fish, mostly by adults with some juvenile migrants.
The amount of overwintering/rearing habitat for fluvial cutthroat may be compromised in the
short term but, quality of habitat would be improved in the long term.
Many studies have demonstrated that salmonids undergo niche shifts in microhabitat use and/or
changes in food selection in presence of interacting species (Nakano et al. 1992). Past studies
(Schoby and Keeley 2011; Nakano et al. 1992; and Bonneau and Scarnecchia 1998) have shown
bull trout and cutthroat tend to partition habitat use and food resources with cutthroat generally
occupying the water column to drift feed during the day, while bull trout generally prefer to feed
along the substrate or prey on fish at night. Large wood structures are preferred cover by both
adult bull trout and cutthroat; substrate cover is primarily used by both juvenile bull trout and
cutthroat, especially during winter months. Resource partitioning is no different for bull trout
and cutthroat trout that coexist to a certain extent in lower Crooked River where they both prefer
selected pool habitat over riffles (Bonneau and Scarnecchia 1998; Nakano et al. 1992; Roni and
Quinn 2001; Schoby and Keeley 2011). Again, visual isolation is an important benefit of large
wood, which can reduce competition (Imre et al. 2002).
In summary, current research suggests that there is limited use by fluvial cutthroat in lower
Crooked River; however, the extent of overwintering habitat utilized by fluvial cutthroat has
been less studied. Preservation of this fluvial life history is an important component in
maintaining viable westslope cutthroat populations in the Upper Crooked River and greater
South Fork Clearwater subbasin. Improving habitat complexity in the lower Crooked River
utilized by fluvial cutthroat could improve genetic resilience for isolated resident populations
that can be threatened by fire disturbance, climatic changes, and other catastrophic events.

Competitive interactions between fish that use the project area would likely change, however,
these interactions are difficult to quantify. The newly constructed channel would provide
improved quality pool habitat and an increase in riffle habitat that may provide additional
overwintering habitat ideal for juvenile fish.
Pacific Lamprey
Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) is designated as a USDA Forest Service sensitive
species and a State of Idaho endangered species (USDA Forest Service 2011b). Pacific lamprey
are a keystone species for the Nez Perce Tribe culture, being used for subsistence, ceremonial,
and medicinal purposes.
Pacific lamprey is one of the oldest of all vertebrates (Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish
Commission 2013). Adult lamprey migrate to the ocean where they spend 1 to 2 years before
returning to freshwater to spawn. They enter freshwater between April and June, migrating to the
Clearwater River by late summer (Moser and Mesa 2009). They hold over winter, come to final
maturity and spawn (April-July) and then die (Clemens 2011).
Spawning substrate requirements are similar for lamprey, steelhead and Chinook (Stone 2006).
Like steelhead and Chinook, they prefer to spawn in low gradient riffles and pool tailouts
(Gunckel et al 2009). Fecundity of an adult female lamprey is between about 90,000 and 230,000
eggs (Stone 2006). Due to the sheer number of eggs produced, there can be overflow out of the
nest, creating a highly nutritious food source for juvenile and adult fish in the system. This
species is an important component of the ecosystem, serving as a prey base and a source of
marine-derived nutrients in freshwater habitats (NPT 2013a).
Lamprey juveniles (called ammocoetes) burrow in mud and sand in freshwater habitats where
they undergo metamorphosis over 5 to 7 years into adults. Ammocoetes are found primarily in
backwater alcoves and on stream margins. Research and observations have shown ammocoete
densities are much higher in areas near large boulders surrounded by sand (Claire et al 2006).
Similar to other anadromous fishes, the distribution and abundance of Pacific lamprey has been
reduced by the construction of dams and water diversions as well as degradation of spawning
and rearing habitat. Lamprey are excluded from large areas where they were historically present,
including upstream from Hells Canyon Dam on the Snake River and Chief Joseph Dam on the
Columbia River (USDA Forest Service 1998).
Lamprey are anguilliform swimmers (movement like a snake) without pectoral fins. They can
use their mouth as a suction disk to maintain location or to move through high velocity areas
(Moser and Mesa 2009). Dams, weirs, and culverts can be passage barriers for lamprey as they
cannot jump but they can use the suction to make their way up and over some of these structures,
if the structure is made out of material to which they can get suction. The bypass channel would
have a gravel/cobble/boulder bottom and would not have abrupt velocity jumps. Adult lamprey
critical swimming speeds are very similar to bull trout (Moser and Mesa 2009). Passage through

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

the project area should not be impeded by the bypass channel, as velocities are not enough to
preclude upstream adult lamprey migration. Moreover, the natural bottom is a suitable surface
for attachment with the oral disk for rest and slow upstream movement.
Sampling in the South Fork Clearwater River conducted in the early 2000s indicated the
presence of juvenile lampreys in the South Fork Clearwater River and lower reaches of Red
River (Cochnauer and Clair 2003). Similar sampling conducted in Crooked River in 2001 did
not identify any lampreys (Cochnauer and Clair 2001, 2002). No lamprey ammocoetes have
been captured in the IDFG juvenile screw trap near the mouth in the past 10 years (Gross, IDFG,
Pers. comm., 2014). However, the lower reaches of Crooked River were likely historic habitat
for lamprey (NPCC 2005).
Although long-term trend data have not been collected, all available data regarding
presence/absence in the South Fork Clearwater River and trends of returning adult lamprey to
Snake and Columbia River mainstem dams indicate the population is severely depressed and has
declined substantially from historic levels. As cited in Cochnauer and Claire (2003), habitat
degradation in the Columbia and Snake River basins associated with mining, livestock grazing,
stream channelization, logging, road construction, and urbanization, in combination with
hydroelectric impacts, are implicated as the major factors contributing to the declines of Pacific
lamprey (Close et al. 1995; Jackson et al. 1996; Jackson et al. 1997). Hydroelectric dam
upstream passage ladders are difficult structures for adult lamprey upstream migrants to navigate
(Vella et al. 1997).
The Nez Perce Tribe is actively restoring Pacific lamprey population in the Upper South Fork
Clearwater River. Lampreys have been released in Newsome Creek and Red River (E. Crow,
personal communication, 2012); however, no lamprey have been released in Crooked River to
date.
Under Alternative 1 there would be no direct or indirect effects to Pacific lamprey and would
therefore not result in effects to species viability.
Alternative 2 would not result in direct effects to lamprey since they are not present in the project
area. Although they have not been found in the project area in the past 10 years, surveys would
still be conducted prior to implementation of this alternative to confirm absence. If lampreys are
found, best management practices to reduce the effects of instream projects would be
implemented according to direction in USDI-FWS (2010). Effects to viability of lampreys are
therefore not expected.
Long-term benefits would be provided by rehabilitating the valley bottom processes and
functions to benefit lamprey spawning and rearing if any were to return or be released to spawn
in the river. The Lamprey utilize similar substrates as steelhead and salmon for spawning;
spawning gravels/cobbles are likely to increase in the project area. Also, alcoves and sandy river

margins are the preferential habitat for ammocoetes. The design of this project includes
numerous alcoves.
Western Pearlshell Mussel
Western pearlshell mussels (Margaritifera falcata) are designated a sensitive species in Region 1
of the U.S. Forest Service (USDA Forest Service 2011b). This species lives in cold streams and
prefers stable sand and gravel substrates where boulders increase bed roughness and stability
(Stone et al 2004). Large boulders are an important habitat feature, stabilizing the habitat type.
Mussels are sedentary in their adult stage and are reliant on native salmonid hosts during the
commensalistic larval portion of their life cycle (termed glochidia). Hosts can include westslope
cutthroat trout, juvenile steelhead and Chinook, and resident rainbow trout (Jepsen et al, n.d.).
Individuals reach sexual maturity between 9-15 years (Toy 1998; Allard et al 2012) and can live
many years (>75), leading to populations existing for many years without successful
reproduction occurring (Montana Field Guide 2013). Although mostly sedentary, adult mussels
are capable of making short movements, and if disturbed can burrow back into substrates.
Mussels can reproduce annually or biannually, releasing thousands of glochidia at a time (Jepsen
et al, n.d.). However, a fertile female mussel must filter sperm released into the water column by
a male within a given timeframe of becoming ready to release glochidia (Allard et al 2012). The
glochidia form within the female before being released in a mass into the water column to find a
host fish. The release of the glochidia aggregate mimics a worm so as to be consumed by a fish.
If a suitable fish intakes the glochidia mass, the mass breaks apart and the glochidia attach to the
fish’s gills to feed on plasma (Thomas 2008). If a suitable host is not found within days to a
couple weeks, they perish. Althrugh glochidia cause the formation of a small cyst on the host’s
gill, they do not harm their host. After a few weeks or months, the glochidia metamorphose into
tiny mussels and drop from the gills to burrow into the sediment to begin filter feeding and their
adult life stage (Jepsen et al, n.d.).
Western pearlshell mussels are known to be present in Crooked River, including the Meanders
reaches, and the South Fork Clearwater River near the mouth of Crooked River. The population
in Crooked River is low compared to the robust population in American River and Red River.
Trends on and viability of populations are not known, but available information suggests mussels
are widely distributed in the South Fork Clearwater River and in American River and Red River.
According to Dobos (2014), cutthroat trout in the upper tributaries travel into the South Fork and
into the other tributaries. Being the key host species of the western pearlshell, the cutthroat could
pick up glochidia in their originating stream or a nearby tributary and move mussels amongst the
different watersheds.
Additionally, Limm and Power (2011) discussed the benefits of the presence of mussels on
juvenile lamprey growth and ecosystem processes. Mussels filter fine particles to feed on, while
lamprey can filter slightly larger particles. The action of mussels filtering water, stirs the water

and nutrients and the mussels excrete nutrient rich material into the water column and
surrounding sediments. They also act as substrate, stabilizing sediments preferred by lamprey.
The interactions between these two species and each of their habitat and life history needs would
benefit from rehabilitation of the river floodplain and channel.
Alternative 1 would not result in direct effects to Western pearlshell mussel; however, the
indirect effects of maintaining or degrading the current condition could result in effects to
species viability in Crooked River. There would be little opportunity for habitat improvement in
the short or long term and the lower reaches would continue to provide limited suitable substrate
and reduced fish populations needed for reproduction.
Alternative 2 would result in direct effects to mussels where they are present within the
Meanders reaches of Crooked River, and where de-watering and reconstruction are proposed.
Mussels would perish if buried in dense sediments. Design criteria specify removal of any
stranded mussels and placement upstream when de-watering occurs. Although effects to
individuals would occur, it is expected that viability would be maintained. Only a short section
of stream would be de-watered (relative to the entire occupied area), any stranded individuals
would be moved to watered areas (not the bypass channel), and mussels continue to be present
up and downstream from the affected area. A small portion of the entire population in Crooked
River and the upper South Fork Clearwater River would be affected. Cope et al. (2002) moved
mussels to nearby suitable habitats to enumerate the survivability of the mussels during
relocation. Survival ranged from 80-100% up to three years following relocation. In addition,
robust colonies located nearby in the South Fork Clearwater River could serve as source
populations following restoration in Crooked River. Long term improvement in habitat
conditions would benefit mussels, as well as their host fish.
Table 3-6 summarizes information regarding these TES and provides preliminary determinations
of effect for Alternative 2. The effects analysis and determination rationale would be described
in a Biological Assessment/Biological Evaluation under this alternative.

Cumulative Effects
Geographic Boundary: For aquatic resources, the cumulative effects analysis area includes the
entire project area, as well as the South Fork Clearwater River from the mouth of Crooked River,
downstream to the Forest Service boundary at Mount Idaho Grade bridge.
Time frame: These effects are considered for the aquatic species potentially affected by this
project from 2015 through the proposed and reasonably foreseeable future (approximately 10 to
20 years).
Past actions: The primary management activities that have influenced aquatic habitat in the
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation area include past timber harvest and supporting road
construction, instream and floodplain restoration, recreation, wildfires, and mining. Of these
activities, mining has been extensive in the past and has resulted in highly altered aquatic
conditions. Past actions include timber harvest, mining, recreation, fire and road building. The
most extensive and lasting of these was mining. The entire valley, from the South Fork
Clearwater River to Orogrande, and even in the uplands and up the tributaries, shows signs of
varying degrees of mining. Fire has also had a strong impact on the Crooked River watershed.
Since 1996, nearly 10,000 acres have burned in the watershed. Most are in the upper portions of
the East and West Forks of Crooked River, which are nearly roadless areas.
The changes in condition and abundance of specific habitats important to these species are
largely unknown, but can be inferred through stream reaches in the Upper South Fork Clearwater
River that have incurred much less impact than Crooked River. Therefore, the effects of these
past projects can be qualified only through general discussions. However, the results of past
projects contribute to the current condition, which can be used to discuss and quantify effects of
proposed activities on fisheries.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The effects of these past projects can be qualified only through general discussions.
Ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed activity areas consist of recreation, road
maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and weed
treatments.
Future actions: The two specific reasonably foreseeable actions are the Orogrande Community
Protection project and the Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. Both projects are
upstream and adjacent to the proposed action.
Refer to Appendix C for a complete list and details of past, present, and foreseeable future
actions.
Discussion of cumulative effects for fisheries is addressed through the general trend of the
suitable habitat required by these species as a result of past, present, and future management
actions.
Alternative 1 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, additional effects to fisheries or their habitat would not occur in
the project area, as compared to past activities. No cumulative effects on fisheries or their
habitats would occur because there are no direct or indirect effects from the No Action
alternative. The effects of the past activities and extreme valley and stream conditions would
continue, including altered hydrologic regime and function, directly affecting fish habitat and
productivity in the project area. Alternative 1, while presenting no short-term risks, would not
result in significant long-term improvement in watershed condition or the indicators analyzed
above. Pools, habitat, and woody debris would all improve slowly, but would take many years.
Under Alternative 1 there would likely be very slow vegetation growth and due to the valley
condition, shade inputs would probably not increase substantially so there would likely be a
long-term impact on temperature. Alternative 1 could cause slow changes but would take
many years.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Alternative 2 would have cumulative effects with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable
activities in Crooked River.
Sediment inputs of the Meanders project, sediment inputs and alleviations of the proposed
Crooked River Narrows Road project, along with harvest, thinning, burning, and road building in
the Orogrande Community Protection project, would be increased during parts of
implementation. The sediment inputs of the Meanders actions would be at discrete times, as
permitted by regulatory agencies. The predicted Orogrande Community Protection project
sediment inputs could overlap with the implementation of this project. However, though the
projects would overlap in time, there would be very little direct overlap in space. The proposed
Crooked River Narrows Road Project would yield a long term decrease in the sediment inputs
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

upstream of the Meanders; the project would occur after the completion and upstream of the
Meanders. The Meanders would improve sediment transport processes to deposit sediment in
the most natural, beneficial locations in the stream system (i.e., inside of stream bends). The
short-term impacts of sediment should be outweighed by the long-term benefits of more
naturally functioning instream and floodplain processes. Impacts are expected to decrease, and
sediment conditions area expected to improve in the ensuing years, resulting in a habitat
condition that is improved compared to the current condition. Alternative 2, while presenting a
moderately high short-term increased risk of sediment inputs, would have a long-term benefit of
proper sediment transport processes and long-term improvement in watershed condition.
Stream temperature is also an indicator at high risk of cumulative impacts, given the stream’s
existing condition. Alternative 2 would reduce temperature in the long term through increased
floodplain function, groundwater connection, and increased riparian and instream cover.
Pools, habitat, and woody debris would all improve throughout the project area under
Alternative 2. There are many miles of stream throughout the watershed that have drastically
reduced habitat features from legacy mining impacts; by improving the lowest 2 miles of valley
bottom, fisheries habitat should increase exponentially locally and could beneficially impact
upstream species with a more connected system to the South Fork Clearwater River.
South Fork Clearwater River

Substantial physical changes to aquatic resources in the Crooked River and South Fork
Clearwater River have occurred since the initiation of human disturbances in the 19th century.
Specific activities included construction of mainstem dams, in-channel mining in the mainstem
rivers and tributaries, timber harvest throughout the subbasin, road construction and
encroachment on streams, domestic livestock grazing, home construction and private land
development, agriculture and cultivation, fire suppression, and many other activities. Water
quality and habitat in the South Fork Clearwater River is in a degraded condition, both from
sediment and temperature impacts (USDA Forest Service 1998; USDA Forest Service 1999b).
As described in this section, dredge mining and hydraulic mining caused significant erosion in
the tributaries, and accelerated sediment deposition in the mainstem river.
Fish passage in the South Fork Clearwater River has been impacted by mainstem dams since the
early days of settlement. The first dam reported in the South Fork Clearwater River was the
Dewey Mine Dam, which was in place by about 1895. This dam was reported to be 6 to 8 feet
high and located about 3.3 miles above the Harpster Bridge. The dam was in place for a few
years with no documentation of fish passage conditions. Lower in the South Fork, near the town
of Kooskia, was the site of the Kooskia Flower Mill Dam. This dam was in place from 1910 into
the 1930s. The dam was estimated to be about 6 feet high. The Washington Water Power Dam
on the South Fork of the Clearwater River near Stites, Idaho, was reportedly built in 1911
(Siddall 1992). This dam was a total barrier to fish migration; a fish ladder was constructed in

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

1935 but was washed out in 1949. This dam was reported to be 33 or 56 feet high, depending on
the source. It was removed on August 3, 1963. The existing salmon and steelhead populations
are a result of fish stocking, likely supplemented by straying adults from the Clearwater River.
Current land uses occurring on private lands include livestock grazing, timber harvest,
agriculture, residence construction, road construction, sewage treatment, and water withdrawals
for domestic use and irrigation. Increases in general land uses would likely occur in the next
decade. Additional information on private land activities is found in the South Fork Clearwater
River Biological Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1999b).
Given all the above information, the South Fork Clearwater River is at high risk for cumulative
impacts, especially from additional sediment and increased water temperature. The Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project is designed to improve overall fish habitat by reducing nonpoint sediment sources and improving instream fish habitat. Sediment increases from instream
restoration and road improvement activities would, however, increase sediment in the short term.
In general, the level of activity on federal lands is currently substantially less than in recent
decades, and many federal actions contain watershed improvements as part of the projects
(USDA-FS 2005a, 2006, 2015). Proposed mining activities may contribute to the conditions in
the subbasin, but mitigation for these projects is expected to reduce some of these impacts.
Proposed timber sales on National Forest lands are subject to similar mitigation and upward
trend requirements (USDA-FS 1987a) as the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, and
although spikes of sediment may occur, in general stream habitat is expected to improve at
least locally.
The South Fork Clearwater River TMDL for sediment and water temperature would govern
activities on state and private lands as well as federal lands (IDEQ et al. 2004). Under this
guidance, aquatic conditions should continue to improve in the South Fork Clearwater River.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The following design and mitigation measures are to be implemented for the action alternative.
The measures are specified in full in Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures.
Sediment/Turbidity
The following design and mitigation measures related to sediment and turbidity would be
implemented for Alternative 2: #1, 6–10, 13, 16–19, 46–49, and 52.
Aspects of the proposed project that have the potential to elevate turbidity and increase sediment
include: construction of temporary bypass channel and road; clearing of vegetation; preparing
staging areas; watering the temporary bypass channel; and re-watering the stream. Floodplain
grading activities and new channel construction would increase sediment production; however,
sediment basins would be constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle out
sediment. Design and mitigation measures, such as installing sediment barriers (#8) and

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-55

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

mulching/stabilizing side slopes (#19), would reduce the overall amount of sediment that reaches
live water, but would not prevent all sediment from reaching the stream.
Sediment effects of fish are dictated by timing, duration, intensity, and frequency of exposure
(Bash et al. 2001). The extent of the effect is higher when turbidity is increased and particle size
is decreased (Bisson and Bilby 1982). Protective mucus levels of individual fish are lower
during periods when instream sediment backgrounds are lower (i.e., low flow work window),
which may increase turbidity effects on fish during this period (Bash et al. 2001). Watering the
temporary bypass channel and re-watering the newly constructed channel are the activities that
would increase turbidity the most. The project area is primarily composed of larger cobble since
most of the fine sediment was washed out during the dredging activities, which would reduce the
overall amount of sediment produced during construction activities. Timing of watering the
temporary bypass channel would be coordinated with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team (ESA
Section 7 Consultation Team) and other agencies to reduce the impacts on ESA-listed fish (#45).
The temporary bypass channel may be watered during high flows (April–May) when turbidity
background levels are naturally higher to reduce the impacts on fish. Re-watering the newly
constructed channel would likely occur during low flow. However, since fine sediment is
already lacking in the project area, the amount that is mobilized during the re-watering process
would be reduced.
Mill Creek Restoration on the mid-South Fork Clearwater River implemented a head gate
structure and bypass channel for about one month in 2011. Turbidity monitoring occurred every
15-45 minutes when instream activity was occurring. While water was in the bypass channel,
activity in the main channel created very slight turbidity downstream (2-5 NTUs over baseline,
600 ft downstream). While rewatering the main channel after restoration, turbidity spikes in
exceedance of 900 NTUs over baseline occurred; however, the turbidity cleared up quickly (<1
hour to near baseline condition if no more water was released; USDA Forest Service,
unpublished data 2012a). SedimatTM (burlap in the stream to catch fine sediment), sediment
catch basins, and incrementally turning the water into the new channel are the mitigation
measures used to minimize turbidity effects in Mill Creek. All of these methods would be used in
Crooked River.
Long term (>1 year) bypass channels have not been implemented in the local area. However,
they are utilized in the region. The Milltown Dam Removal project on the Clark Fork River in
western Montana utilized a large bypass channel while the dam was removed, contaminated
sediments were dredged out of the historic floodplain, and the new channel was created,
including large woody debris placement and riparian planting. The water was in the bypass
channel for 2.5 years and there were no associated problems. The bypass channel was designed
for a Q100 flow. The largest flow seen during bypass use was about a Q10 (Martin, MDNRC .
Pers. comm., 2014). The Milltown project was subject to a Q35 flow the first year following full
watering of the channel, before bank stabilization was complete. One meander bend avulsed into

a side channel, but was able to be reconstructed and, using bank stabilization treatments, has not
reverted to that channel.
Providing a temporary bypass channel and constructing a road that separates the bulk of the
construction area from the temporary bypass channel would reduce the amount of sediment
entering live water (design and mitigation measures 45, 46, and 52 [RDG et al. 2013a]). As a
part of the design, temporary ponds would be constructed to capture sediment across the work
area to prevent any sediment from reaching the bypass channel or the South Fork Clearwater
River. Turbid water may be pumped to the floodplain or settling ponds to keep areas dry during
construction to reduce sediment delivery to Crooked River and South Fork Clearwater River.
Design and mitigation measure 16 includes monitoring to be conducted as directed by the
USACE, EPA, NMFS, and USFWS, and adaptive management would be applied if turbidity
approached 50 NTUs over background 300 feet downstream. The Idaho standard for turbidity,
which is 50 NTU instantaneous measurement over background, is considered protective of cold
water aquatic life.
Petroleum-Based Products
The following design and mitigation measures related to petroleum-based products would be
implemented for Alternative 2: #2, 3, 4, and 5.
Fish have the potential to be affected by chemical contamination from the proposed project
activities. Heavy equipment would be used in most aspects of the project activities (floodplain
re-grading, new channel construction, LWD placement). Machinery would likely be working in
live water due to the high water table of the valley, even though the stream would be diverted
into a temporary bypass channel. Washing and maintaining all equipment would reduce the
amount of petroleum-based products entering the water from day-to-day operations. Staging
areas for machinery, fuels storage, and maintenance work would occur off site and far enough
away from live water that fish would not likely be exposed to petroleum products in the case of a
spill (#3, #5). Since much of the project area is composed of porous cobble, any spills would
percolate to the groundwater quickly. Storing petroleum products in containment structures with
impervious liners would prevent much of any spilled chemical from entering the water, and
having spill containment kits and a spill containment plan on site would allow for a quick
response to reduce the amount of chemicals leaching into the groundwater (#4).
Toxics
The following design and mitigation measures related to toxins would be implemented for
Alternative 2: #15 and 20.
Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the environment that has several forms. Metallic
mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid. Metallic mercury (inorganic mercury and its

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

compounds) enters the air from mining and manufacturing activities and from burning coal and
waste. It has also been added to the environment from historic gold mining activities. Although
mercury was not used in dredge mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a small
potential to find this element during restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies, including
the Crooked River Stream Survey and In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water Quality
Status Report 80: Crooked River (Mann and Von Lindern 1988), and Idaho Champion Group
Lode and Pacific Group Load Claims: Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection Report
(IDEQ 2011), have all shown that concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and water are
generally equivalent to background levels or below detection limits. Mercury levels in the project
area have been documented to be well below concentration standards set by the EPA that would
be harmful to fish and human health.
It is not likely that mercury would be found during implementation of the Alternative 2. If
detected during construction, follow measures identified in Appendix E. This would reduce the
potential for bioaccumulation of mercury in aquatic species in Crooked River and the South Fork
Clearwater River.
Temporary Bypass Channel
The following design and mitigation measures related to the temporary bypass channel would be
implemented for Alternative 2: # 45, 48, 52, and 53.
The temporary bypass channel would be constructed prior to any instream or floodplain
activities. The bypass channel would be constructed to accommodate a 10-year flow recurrence
and would remain in operation until the floodplain and new channel are complete. Cofferdams
and/or a head gate would be constructed on the main channel to control the flow to the bypass
channel. This would allow for increasing the flow in both the bypass channel and newly
constructed channel to reduce the amount of sediment mobilized during re-watering. The bypass
channel would allow for migration of all fish species during their migratory periods. The
temporary bypass channel would not likely provide suitable spawning habitats for steelhead,
spring/summer Chinook salmon, or bull trout due to limited spawning sized gravels. However,
primary spawning sites for spring/summer Chinook salmon are upstream of where the bypass
channel would be constructed. Bull trout have not been found to spawn in the lower Crooked
River, and the current channel conditions of low velocity and high cobble embeddedness limit
steelhead spawning in the project area.
The temporary channel would be watered during high flows if possible. This would allow
sediment produced to be flushed out during periods when natural sediment background is already
high and there is enough water so as not to dewater the existing channel. The bypass channel
would not be fully used until the low-flow work window of July 15 or as specified in
consultation with NMFS or USFWS.

Fish and Aquatic Organism Salvage
The following design and mitigation measures related to fish and aquatic organism salvage
would be implemented for Alternative 2: #11, 11a, 11b, 11c,45 and 52.
Fish salvage would occur in the mainstem Crooked River and connected ponds after July 1 or as
consulted on by NMFS and USFWS. Juvenile steelhead, spring/summer Chinook, westslope
cutthroat trout, and other aquatic species would likely be present. Mainstem fish salvage would
include a combination of dewatering, netting, and electrofishing. Methods for salvaging the
ponds would include blocknetting, electrofishing, staged dewatering, and seining.
Dewatering/Seining/Netting. Cofferdams and/or a head gate would be constructed on the
mainstem channel. Water would slowly be released into the temporary bypass channel to reduce
flows in the mainstem channel. This would allow fish to move downstream and out of the
project area. Seining and netting would be used in combination with dewatering to “encourage”
fish to move downstream and out of the project area in the main channel and ponds that are
connected to the channel.
Electrofishing. It is uncertain how many electrofishing passes would be needed to
remove fish from the mainstem channel and ponds. Since the channel and ponds would be
slowly dewatered, the amount of area needed to be electrofished would be reduced. It is not
likely that the in-channel pools or the ponds would completely dry up due to the high elevation
of the water table across the valley. It is possible that many of the fish could be chased into these
pools during dewatering and only the pools and ponds would require electrofishing.
Aquatic Invasive Species Control
The following design and mitigation measures related to fish and aquatic organism salvage
would be implemented for Alternative 2: # 11b, 31, 45 and 52.
Many streams have invasive aquatic species, such as the New Zealand mudsnail and the
myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease. Many of these species are practically
invisible to the naked eye and impossible to detect if attached to heavy machinery. Equipment
use to draft, dip, store, or deploy water can be exposed to a variety of invasive organisms. To
reduce the spread of invasive species from contaminated to uncontaminated sources, equipment
would be sanitized, cleaned and inspected. Equipment includes machinery used in construction,
waders, boots, nets, and any equipment used in the water. Equipment would be cleaned in an
area off the forest where invasive species could not spread to other water bodies.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with Forest Plan forestwide standards for fisheries resources in the
Nez Perce National Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-18 through II-20). Full
details of consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Cooperative efforts would occur among Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests, BLM, Nez
Perce Tribe, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to monitor
population levels of all MISs. Government-to-Government consultation has occurred to
recognize fishing and hunting rights guaranteed to the Nez Perce Tribe. The Forest Service and
IDFG would continue to coordinate to achieve mutual goals for fish and wildlife.
The purpose and need of the proposed Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project is to improve
fish habitat in Lower Crooked River. Alternative 1 would not restore degraded fish habitat. The
Lower Crooked River watershed would continue in a below fishery/water quality objective status
(50%) (USDA Forest Service 1987, as amended). Alternative 2 would directly improve
degraded fish habitat in the Lower Crooked River watershed. Proposed activities would provide
improvement to fish habitat conditions by improving pool quality, increasing large woody debris
recruitment, and increasing spawning habitat and higher-quality rearing habitat. These changes
would improve overall fish habitat complexity in Crooked River from the existing condition.
Reconstruction of the floodplain and channel would result in smaller particles being distributed
across more of the floodplain and larger particles suitable for spawning to move into Reaches 3
and 4 of Crooked River. Restoring channel and floodplain function, instream fish habitat
complexity, and improving its water quality, which would increase fish habitat potential in
Lower Crooked River towards the 90 percent Fish/Water Quality Objective identified in the
Forest Plan.
With respect to Management Area 10 (Riparian Areas), short-term decreases in streamside
canopy would occur under Alternative 2, but thousands of plants would be planted to increase
streamside canopy, in the long term. Alternative 2 would implement riparian improvements,
including connecting vegetation to groundwater and floodplain processes and planting native
grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees.
Nez Perce Forest Plan, Amendment 20 (PACFISH)

The PACFISH decision amended the Nez Perce Forest Plan in 1995 and was incorporated into
the Forest Plan as Amendment 20 (PACFISH; USDA Forest Service 1995b). PACFISH
establishes riparian goals and riparian management objectives (RMOs) and defines riparian
habitat conservation areas (Table 3-7). It includes specific direction for land management
activities within riparian areas adjacent to streams, lakes, wetlands, and landslide-prone terrain.
Riparian goals establish an expectation of the characteristics of healthy, functioning watersheds,
riparian areas, and fish habitat. The goals direct the Nez Perce National Forest to maintain or

improve habitat elements such as water quality, stream channel integrity, instream flows, and
riparian vegetation.
Standards and guidelines specific to watershed and habitat restoration include the following:
•

•

WR-1: Design and implement watershed restoration projects in a manner that promotes
the long term ecological integrity of ecosystems, conserves the genetic integrity of native
species, and contributes to attainment of Riparian Management Objectives.
WR-3: Do not use planned restoration as a substitute for preventing habitat degradation
(i.e., use planned restoration only to mitigate existing problems, not to mitigate the
effects of proposed activities).

Alternative 2 would be consistent with these standards and guidelines. The objective of this
alternative is to restore the ecological and watershed integrity of the Meanders sections of
Crooked River and would contribute to attainment of RMOs, which are currently not being met.
Planned restoration under Alternative 2 is not proposed to mitigate the effects of other activities
in the watershed.

Endangered Species Act and Biological Opinions
The Endangered Species Act requires the listing of species that are threatened or endangered
with extinction, federal agency consultation on activities affecting these species, and the
development of recovery plans. The ESA-listed aquatic species found in Crooked River are
steelhead trout and bull trout. For this project, the ESA missions are the responsibility of NMFS
for anadromous fish species (steelhead)and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for resident fish
species (bull trout) and terrestrial wildlife (lynx).
Under Alternative 2, the Forest Service and Nez Perce Tribe would submit a biological
assessment documenting the project effects on listed species to the regulatory agencies, and
formal consultation would be concluded prior to a record of decision being signed.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Aquatic Resources

3-61

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The USFWS and NMFS have developed draft recovery plans for ESA-listed fish in the project
area. The USFWS identified the South Fork Clearwater as a core area for bull trout recovery and
Crooked River as supporting a local population (draft USDI-FWS 2002). Historic dredge mining
was identified as a principal factor degrading bull trout habitat in Crooked River, with ongoing
legacy effects. Although previous restoration efforts were acknowledged, it was noted that they
did not fully restore the stream channel.
Actions identified to meet recovery goals for bull trout included identification of problem mine
sites and remediation of tailings, ponds, and other associated waste. Within the South Fork
Clearwater core area, Newsome Creek and Crooked River were identified as the top priorities.
Therefore, Alternative 2 is consistent with recovery goals identified in this draft plan.
In the draft Snake River Steelhead Recovery Plan for the Clearwater subbasin, the South Fork
Clearwater steelhead population was described as “intermediate” based on size and historic
habitat potential (draft NMFS 2011). Crooked River was identified as a major spawning area.
The draft plan emphasized the importance of riparian habitat restoration in American River, Red
River, Newsome Creek, and Crooked River, citing the loss of riparian vegetation, which has
reduced recruitment of large woody debris to stream channels and reduced habitat complexity.
It also cited channel modification and simplification, most commonly resulting from historic
dredging mining, which has affected both rearing and spawning habitat.
Priority areas identified for restoration in the South Fork Clearwater subbasin were primarily
associated with major spawning areas, which included lower Crooked River in the Meanders
section. Direction to meet recovery goals specifically included the following: “Restore stream
channels and floodplain function in reaches impacted by historic dredge mining and other land
uses in the Newsome, Crooked, American, and Red River watersheds. Many of these stream
reaches have straightened channels, infrequent pools, inadequate pool depth, inadequate riparian
vegetation, and reduced habitat complexity, including lack of cover. Projects may include
restoring natural floodplain meander patterns by reconnecting historic meanders or
reconstructing stream channels.”
Since Alternative 2 proposes these types of activities, it is consistent with the recovery goals
identified in this draft plan.
Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
Pursuant to Section 305(b) of the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
Act and its implementing regulations (50 CFR 600.920), federal agencies must consult with
NMFS regarding any of their actions that are authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to
be authorized, funded, or undertaken that may adversely affect essential fish habitat. The
Magnuson–Stevens Act, Section 3, defines essential fish habitat as “those waters and substrate
necessary for fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.”

Essential fish habitat for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha). Essential fish
habitat for Chinook salmon includes all historically accessible reaches of the Clearwater
River subbasin (except the North Fork above Dworshak Dam). Essential fish habitat for
Chinook salmon is present in Crooked River.

Clean Water Act and Idaho Water Quality Standards

Water Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project alternatives
on water resources that could potentially be affected by the proposed action including: water
quality, geomorphology, wetlands, and floodplains.
Analysis Area
The project area is located in the Lower Crooked River 6th Hydrologic Unit Code (6th Code
HUC) Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) prescription watershed as defined in the
Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a), which is within the Crooked River watershed and a
tributary to the South Fork Clearwater River. This watershed is currently below the
fishery/water quality objective established in the Forest Plan. The project boundary is the
Crooked River valley from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth to approximately 2 miles upstream
from the mouth to where the valley constricts and narrows. The analysis area for direct and
indirect effects on water quality, geomorphology, wetlands, and floodplains is the project
boundary.
Cumulative Effects Area
The analysis area for the water quality indicator of temperature , includes the Crooked River
watershed and the South Fork Clearwater River to its confluence with the Middle Fork
Clearwater River near Kooskia, Idaho.
The analysis area for the water quality indicator of turbidity is Crooked River within the project
area to its confluence with the South Fork Clearwater River.
The analysis area for the geomorphic indicators channel width-to-depth ratio, channel sinuosity,
and channel entrenchment ratio is the project area.
The analysis area for the geomorphic indicator sediment transport/bed mobility is the project
area and the South Fork Clearwater River to its confluence with the Middle Fork Clearwater
River near Kooskia, ID.
The analysis area for wetlands and floodplains is the project area.
The analysis area for watershed condition and sediment yield is the Forest Plan prescription
watershed: Lower Crooked River and Crooked River.

The resources of concern that could potentially be affected by the proposed action are water
quality, geomorphology, groundwater–surface water interactions, wetlands, and floodplains.
Groundwater–surface water interactions in the project area are highly variable with much
uncertainty, and the disturbed nature of the site makes it difficult to determine whether the reach
of Crooked River within the project area is gaining or losing groundwater, and how much flow is
traveling subsurface through coarse valley bottom substrates (RDG et al. 2012). For these
reasons, effects on groundwater–surface water interactions could not be evaluated.
The effects on water yield (the quantity of precipitation after plant use that is available as surface
and subusurface flow) would be minimal since the floodplain that would be re-graded has
extensive tailings piles that are sparsely vegetated; therefore, effects on water yield in response
to the clearing of vegetation is not a resource of concern.

Water Quality – Water Temperature and Turbidity
The beneficial uses designated by Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) have
been established for Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek, and for the South Fork
Clearwater River (IDAPA 58.01.02, IDEQ 2013). Beneficial uses for Crooked River are
secondary contact recreation, cold water aquatic life, and salmonid spawning, and for the South
Fork Clearwater River are primary contact recreation. These beneficial uses are addressed under
the indicator of temperature and turbidity (see also Aquatic Resources). The effect on primary
and secondary contact recreation water quality parameters (e.g. E.Coli bacteria) would be
negligible, and therefore is not a water quality concern.
Water temperature criteria adopted by IDEQ to protect these beneficial uses are: 22º C (71.6º F)
or less with a maximum daily average of no greater than 19º C (66.2º F) for cold water aquatic
life; and 13º C (55.4º F) or less with a maximum daily average no greater than 9º C (48.2º F) for
salmonid spawning (IDEQ 2013).
Water temperature criteria for bull trout spawning also apply to Crooked River pursuant to
Governor Batt’s State of Idaho Bull Trout Conservation Plan (Batt 1996). Water temperature
criteria for bull trout adopted by IDEQ are: 13º C (55.4º F) maximum weekly maximum
temperature (MWMT) during June, July and August for juvenile bull trout rearing, and 9º C
(48.2º F) daily average during September and October for bull trout spawning spawning (IDEQ
2013).
For this analysis, a surrogate indicator of effective shade is used for water temperature. Effective
shade is the percent reduction of solar radiation by streamside vegetation, and is used as a
surrogate indicator for water temperature for the purpose of consistency with South Fork
Clearwater River Subbasin Assessment and TMDLs (IDEQ et al. 2004) and South Fork
Clearwater River TMDL Implementation Plan (South Fork Clearwater River Watershed
Advisory Group 2006).
Mine tailings have potential issues with soil and water contamination from heavy metals, and
mercury is typically the heavy metal of concern. Although mercury was not used in dredge
mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a small potential to find this element during
restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies, including the Crooked River Stream Survey and
In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water Quality Status Report 80: Crooked River (Mann
and Lindern 1988), and Idaho Champion Group Lode and Pacific Group Load Claims:
Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection Report (IDEQ 2011), have all shown that
concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and water are generally equivalent to background
levels or below detection limits. Recent heavy metals monitoring data collected within the
project area in 2013 by the Nez Perce Tribe determined water quality did not exceed Idaho State
Water Quality Standards for cold water biota (Nez Perce Tribe 2013b unpublished data).
Mercury levels in the project area have been documented to be well below concentration

standards set by the EPA that would be harmful to fish and human health. Based on these
studies, mercury levels were not used as a water quality indicator.
Turbidity is a measure of the degree to which water loses its transparency due to the presence of
suspended solids: the more suspended solids, the higher the turbidity. The Idaho State Water
Quality Standard for turbidity states that turbidity shall not exceed background by more than 50
nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) instantaneously (beyond the mixing zone), or exceed 25
NTU for more than 10 consecutive days (beyond the mixing zone) (IDEQ 2013, IDAPA
58.01.02, sec 250), where the mixing zone boundary is located100 m (330 feet) downstream
from the activity.
Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek is not listed by the State, under Clean Water Act
Section 303(d), as water quality impaired for sediment (IDEQ 2010); however, per the TMDL,
human caused sediment in the South Fork Clearwater River at Stites should be reduced by
approximately 25% (South Fork Clearwater River Watershed Advisory Group-SFCRWAG
2006). The most commonly acceptable approach to controlling non-point sources of sediment is
to limit pollutants from reaching the water through a combination of best management practices
and filtering of runoff using riparian vegetation and floodplains (SFCRWAG 2006).
Geomorphology
Geomorphology is the examination of river forms and processes that operate through mutual
adjustments to achieve a condition of stability, where a river attains balance between erosion and
deposition. Geomorphic processes have been altered in the project area, resulting in a condition
of instability and degraded aquatic habitat. These processes include channel–floodplain
interaction and sediment transport/bed mobility. The following geomorphic indicators were used
to evaluate the potential effects from the proposed action on these geomorphic processes.

Channel entrenchment ratio is a measure of how incised a river is, or the extent of
vertical containment of a river relative to its adjacent floodplain. It is calculated as the
ratio of flood-prone area width to bankfull width, and used as an indicator of floodplain
connectivity (flood-prone area width/bankfull width).
Channel width-to-depth ratio is a measure of the shape of a channel cross section (e.g.,
wide and shallow or narrow and deep). It is calculated as the ratio of bankfull surface
width to mean bankfull depth, and is used as an indicator of the shape of the channel
(bankfull width/mean bankfull depth).
Channel sinuosity is a measure of the degree of meandering and channel migration
within a valley. It is calculated as the ratio of valley gradient to channel gradient, and is
used as an indicator of flow velocity (valley gradient/channel gradient).
Sediment Transport/Bed Mobility is the movement of sediment, and is used as an
indicator of the channel’s ability to maintain appropriately-sized spawning gravel and
clean interstitial spaces (the gaps between gravel particles).

Floodplains
The proposed action would alter the existing tailings piles to restore the Crooked River stream
channel and floodplain function. The indicator used to evaluate the potential effects on
floodplains is floodplain type and area (acres).
Wetlands
The proposed action would alter the existing wetlands in the project area. The indicator used to
evaluate the potential effects on wetlands is wetland class and area (acres).
Appendix B, Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Practicability Analysis was completed to
provide information to the USACE to assist the Corps with a permit decision under Section 404
of the Clean Water Act. Methods and indicators are described in Appendix B. The Least
Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) is identified and carried forward is
this EIS for analysis.
The proposed action would be subject to permitting by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) under the Clean Water Act, Section 404(b)(1) guidelines (40 CFR 230) for
discharge of dredge and fill material into waters of the United States.
Watershed Condition and Sediment Yield
Watershed condition . The proposed activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation,
Meanders portion, would have no direct and indirect effects on total and streamside road
densities, therefore it is not displayed in direct and indirect effects. This indicator is displayed in
cumulative effects analysis to compare alternative effects on watershed condition from other
proposed project in the Crooked River watershed.
Sediment yield. The proposed activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation, Meanders
portion, are not required to use Guide for Predicting Sediment Yields from Forested Watersheds
(Cline et al. 1981) as specified in the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987, as amended). The
proposed action of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would meet Idaho State
Water Quality Standards through design and mitigation measures. This indicator is displayed in
the cumulative effects analysis to compare alternative effects on sediment yields from other
proposed projects in the Crooked River watershed.

Hydrology of Crooked River
Although hydrology is not identified as an indicator of effects for this analysis, this section
presents hydrologic information about the project area including: baseflow and bankfull flow; the
design flows used for the design of the proposed action and groundwater–surface water
interactions. Information for this section was summarized from Design Criteria Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Baseflow and Bankfull Flow

Low flow, or baseflow, frequency statistics are useful to determine the minimum water
availability for fish passage under extreme conditions as well as to evaluate the risk of channel
dewatering. For Crooked River, baseflow statistics were estimated using the regional regression
equations presented in USGS SIR-2006-5035, which utilize drainage area, mean annual
precipitation, and percent of developed land. A summary of baseflow estimates for a
consecutive number of days and recurrence intervals is presented in Table 3-8. The baseflow
discharge used in the hydraulic model to design the reconstructed channel is the 30-day, 5-year
flow return interval (Q5) of 10 cfs.
Bankfull discharge was evaluated using multiple methods for hydraulic geometry and calibrating
roughness based on empirical data as well as measured field data for observed bankfull
indicators. Field discharge measurements were taken to calibrate bed roughness. Estimates of
bankfull discharge using field-surveyed bankfull indicators are summarized in Table 3-9.
Results indicate that the recurrence interval for bankfull discharge is Q1.1 or less, which is much
less than a Q1.5 recurrence interval that is typically associated with bankfull discharge.
Hydrologic analyses identified a significant disparity among methods for estimates of bankfull
discharge. Estimates of bankfull discharge using field data (bankfull indicators, channel cross
section geometry, water surface slope, and roughness derived from bed substrate) resulted in
values that were one-quarter to one-half of those derived from regional regression equations and
USGS gage data from nearby drainages (Table 3-10). One possible reason for the disparity is
flow attenuation caused by water storage in dredge ponds in the project area as well as the upper
watershed near the town of Orogrande. Another possible reason for the disparity is subsurface
flow through disturbed coarse deposits.
The design bankfull discharge was assumed to be between the estimates using field-surveyed
bankfull indicators and the estimates derived from regional regression equations and gage data
from nearby drainages, and the bankfull discharge of 300 cfs with a recurrence interval of
1.1 years was used in the model to design the reconstructed channel (Daniels, Matt. RDG, 2013).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Groundwater-Surface Water Interaction

Groundwater–surface water processes in the project area are heavily disturbed due to both past
mining impacts and rehabilitation efforts. Channel capacity estimates calibrated to fieldsurveyed bankfull indicators suggest that channel capacity in the middle of the project area
(Reaches 2 and 3; see Figure 3-14) is roughly 50 percent less than the upstream (Reach 1) and
downstream (Reach 4) project limits. Low flow discharge measurements were taken at four
instream locations in the project area in August 2012. Discharge measurements varied from
24.4 cfs to 25.8 cfs, and indicate that baseflow discharge is consistent throughout the
project area.
Temperature data collected suggest potential groundwater influence. Vegetation data suggest
that lateral groundwater and surface water inputs to the valley bottom from ephemeral tributaries
may be influencing the floodplain water table, whereby groundwater elevations are higher near
the edges of the valley relative to the center of the valley bottom. LiDAR data were used to
evaluate low flow surface water elevations throughout the valley bottom for ponds, wetlands,
side channels, and the main channel. Results indicate that surface water elevations are highly
variable, and the analysis yielded no distinct trends that would be useful for predicting
groundwater gradients or surface water relationships.
In summary, groundwater–surface water interactions in the project area are highly variable with
much uncertainty. The disturbed nature of the site from both mining and rehabilitation makes it
difficult to determine whether Crooked River within the project area is gaining or losing
groundwater, and how much flow is traveling subsurface through coarse valley bottom
substrates. Additional data collection and analysis prior to implementation would be useful only
for characterizing a highly disturbed existing condition that ultimately would be changed upon
implementation of the design, and would not provide useful information to inform project
design.
Effects to groundwater cannot be evaluated at this time given the limited information currently
available. However, groundwater levels would be monitored during implementation of
Alternative 2 and post-implementation for a minimum of three years in an effort to reduce the
uncertainty of groundwater-surface water interactions in the project area.
To reduce the potential of the new channel going subsurface in the cobbles upon completion of
the project, the floodplain and new channel would be regraded to have an appropriate mix of fill
that would improve water retention in the floodplain. The river channel and streambanks would
consist of about 30 percent sand and gravel mixed in with larger cobbles and boulders.
Floodplain fill consists primarily of sands, gravels, and cobbles six inches or less. Fines and
organic materials would be mixed in the floodplain substrate as well. Typical flow rates through
alluvial materials (hydraulic conductivity) are about 0.0012 ft/s for a sand and gravel mix and up
to 0.01 ft/s for gravel. Multiplying the groundwater flow rate by the area of floodplain fill layer
at the maximum thickness the expected flow rate through the sand and gravel mix is about 1.25

cfs (0.0012 ft/s * 400 ft wide by 2.7 ft deep) and 12.5 cfs for gravel (Daniels, Matt. RDG, 2013
and 2014). This means that only about 1.25 cfs would be able to pass through the sand and
gravel substrate material in the riverbed; and flows should be even less through the floodplain
fill. However, if the riverbed material consisted of only gravels and cobbles, the loss of flow
could be about 12.5 cfs from the river. Baseflow in Crooked River was measured as
approximately 25 cfs in 2012 (RDG et al. 2012). Base flow estimates for the 7 day Q2 is
approximately12.3 cfs. We can assume that if only about 1.25 cfs can pass through the substrate
materials, the remaining flows would be retained as surface flows, but again, if the substrate is
not mixed and consists of only gravel or larger sized substrate, there would be a high potential of
the river channel going subsurface.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
This section defines the existing condition and presents the analysis of direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects of the proposed action and alternative on water resources.
Water Temperature
Information for the water temperature analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design Report: Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a) and the South Fork Clearwater River
Subbasin Assessment and TMDL (IDEQ and EPA 2003).
Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek is assessed under §305(b) of the Clean Water Act
as water quality impaired for temperature, and a temperature TMDL (total maximum daily load)
has been developed and approved (IDEQ and EPA 2003). The TMDL states that increased
stream temperatures in the South Fork Clearwater River are primarily the result of increased heat
loading from increased solar radiation reaching the water surface and increased local
environmental temperatures as a result of the removal of riparian shading (IDEQ and EPA 2003).
Percent effective shade targets were established in the TMDL as surrogate measures necessary to
achieve temperature criteria, with a percent increase effective shade target of 24 percent for
forested tributaries of the South Fork Clearwater River (IDEQ and EPA 2003). The means of
achieving these effective shade targets is through restoring and protecting riparian vegetation,
and narrowing stream channel widths (IDEQ and EPA 2003).
Disturbed riparian conditions alongside Crooked River have resulted in altered plant
communities and reduced canopy cover, which has contributed to elevated water temperatures by
increasing solar radiation and decreasing effective shade. Disturbed riparian conditions
alongside Crooked River include a lack of floodplain connectivity due to channel entrenchment,
and extensive tailings piles with coarse, well-drained substrates. Lack of floodplain connectivity
limits the interaction between Crooked River and its floodplain, which inhibits the process of
sediment deposition along the river and within the floodplain that initiates woody plant
community succession. The coarse, well-drained tailings piles lack sufficient fine-grained
rooting material to support a healthy, diverse plant community, and their extent significantly
limits the area available for woody plant communities to establish.
Reduction in streamside shading can result in increases in water temperature. Changes in
shading can be due to a variety of factors, including vegetative succession (the replacement of
one plant community with another over time), mortality, or project activities. The TMDL and
percent effective shade are discussed in this section of this document.
Stream and valley structure factors that influence water temperature include channel slope,
width, streambed topography and substrate, channel pattern, and riparian vegetation and width.
In the project area, all of these factors have been adversely impacted by the historic dredge
mining. Water velocities in the project area have been greatly reduced through a reduction in

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

channel slope. Slower water is exposed to solar radiation longer than fast water, which increases
stream temperatures. This is also true for channels with high width to depth ratios. Channel
pattern, streambed topography, and substrate influence groundwater/surface water interactions,
where groundwater and hyporheic exchange (mixing of shallow groundwater and surface water
beneath and along the sides of the stream) can provide areas of cooling. Riparian vegetation
influences stream temperatures by reducing daily fluctuations through insulation in both summer
and winter. The elevated temperatures in Crooked River are also due to the severely altered
riparian condition throughout the watershed from past activities (Appendix C). Within the
project area, the stream is over-widened with little riparian shade or cover in the stream.
The existing plant communities within the project area are displayed in Figure 3-12, which
shows the extent of reed canary grass located streamside along Crooked River, and herbaceous
plants and conifers located streamside on the tailings piles along Crooked River. The existing
percent composition of streamside plant communities and streamside average percent summer
solar radiation and average percent summer effective shade are presented in Table 3-11. The
existing percent composition of streamside plant communities and streamside maximum percent
summer solar radiation and minimum percent summer effective shade are presented in
Table 3-12. As shown by Tables 3-11 and 3-12, reed canary grass currently occupies 40% of the
streamside with average and maximum percent summer solar radiation of 82 and 94%,
respectively. Corresponding streamside average and minimum summer percent effective shade
for the current reed canary grass are 18 and 6%, respectively. Conifer and herbaceous plants
currently located streamside on tailings piles each occupy 8% of the streamside, and have
average percent summer solar radiation of 41% and 80%, respectively, and average percent
summer effective shade of 59% and 20%, respectively. Conifer and herbaceous plants currently
located streamside on tailings piles have maximum percent summer solar radiation of 85% and
94%, respectively, and minimum percent summer effective shade of 15% and 5%, respectively.
The existing streamside weighted average percent summer effective shade is 30%, and the
existing streamside weighted minimum percent effective shade is 16%, indicating surface water
temperatures are elevated due to high solar radiation and low percent effective shade from
disturbed riparian conditions.

Direct and Indirect Effects

The proposed project would reconstruct Crooked River to reduce channel entrenchment and
increase floodplain connectivity; re-grade the floodplain to remove tailings piles; and import
suitable substrate. These actions would create the conditions necessary to support the
establishment and succession of desired riparian plant communities, including woody vegetation
that increases percent effective shade. Alder and spruce would grow rapidly, and alder can form
dense stands that would provide shade within 10 years or less; however, a minimum of 20 years
would be needed for conifer communities to grow to sufficient heights to provide shade (RDG et
al. 2013a).
The proposed project would reduce the potential for establishment of reed canary grass on the
new floodplain surface by constructing diverse topography and incorporating woody debris in
these new floodplain areas. This would create a mosaic of microsites to promote the
establishment of woody vegetation. Reed canary grass productivity is reduced by shade, and
dense woody vegetation establishment on the floodplain surface would create conditions less
suitable for reed canary grass.
The expected post-project plant communities within the project area are shown in Figure 3-13,
which displays the extent of streamside alders expected to replace the reed canary grass that is
currently occupying 40% of the streamside. A comparison of the extent in acres of existing and
expected vegetation communities is presented in Table 3-13. Reed canary grass is expected to
decrease by 13%, and alder is expected to have the greatest increase (32%). The expected postproject streamside average percent summer shade is 83%, based on the percent of channel length
expected to support woody vegetation (RDG et al. 2012b). This would be an increase of 177%
over existing streamside average percent summer shade of 30%. Data are not available to
calculate expected post-project streamside minimum percent summer shade, but if an increase of
177% is assumed, the value would be 44%. These percent effective shade increases exceed the
TMDL target of 24% for forested watersheds tributary to South Fork Clearwater River, and
exceeding this target could result in Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek cooling to
temperatures that do not exceed the water temperature criteria. If that occurs, the condition of
attaining water temperature criteria for removal from the §305(b) list would be met, and Crooked
River from the mouth to Relief Creek could be removed from the §305(b) list.

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the Meanders, which would not result in further increases in water temperature
pursuant to IDEQ Antidegradation Policy (IDEQ 2013; IDAPA 58.01.02, sec. 52), and does not
include restoration. Current elevated water temperatures would persist, water temperature
criteria would likely not be attained, and Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek would
likely remain on the CWA Section 305(b) list as water quality impaired for temperature.
Hydraulic analysis estimates it would require at least a 500-year return period flood flow event to
mobilize large cobble material (RDG et al. 2012), which is present in the tailing piles. An event
of that magnitude has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year. Thus, the time frame for
natural recovery to erode the tailings pile, restore floodplain connectivity, and create the
conditions for streamside vegetation that would provide enough effective shade to decrease water
temperatures would occur on an estimated time scale of thousands of years.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, there would likely be a short-term increase in water temperature with the
removal of streamside vegetation along the reconstructed channel and the temporary bypass
channel and associated decreases in effective shade. This short-term increase would continue
while flow is diverted to the temporary bypass channel (approximately 3 to 6 years), and until
desired riparian vegetation has grown to sufficient height to provide effective shade
(approximately 10 and 20 years for alders and conifers, respectively). However, under
Alternative 2, there would be a long-term beneficial effect (decrease) on water temperature.
Water temperatures would decrease with the expected increase in effective shade of 177% with
the establishment of desired riparian plant communities, including woody vegetation. This
increase in effective shade would exceed the TMDL target of 24% increase in effective shade for
forested tributaries of the South Fork Clearwater River. Exceeding the TMDL effective shade
target could result in Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek attaining water temperature
criteria. The time for this to occur would be a minimum of 20 years (the time needed for conifer

communities to provide shade). Attaining the water temperature criteria would meet the
condition for removal from the §305(b) list for temperature impairment. While 10 to 20 years
are anticipated for the growth of riparian plant communities that would provide shade for cooler
water temperatures, in the 75 years since the project area was disturbed, riparian growth has
resulted in 30% average summer effective shade and 16% minimum summer effective summer
shade, and without project implementation, natural recovery within 20 years would not occur.
Cumulative Effects: Water Temperature

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
ongoing, or reasonably foreseeable future actions.
The cumulative effects analysis area for water temperature includes the Crooked River watershed
and the South Fork Clearwater River to its confluence with the Middle Fork Clearwater River
near Kooskia, Idaho. A full description of past, ongoing, and future foreseeable actions
considered in this analysis is presented in Appendix C.
Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Past dredge mining has had the most notable management-related effects on water temperature in
Crooked River. Several different large bucket dredges operated in Crooked River between 1936
and 1958. The Mount Vernon dredge first operated in Crooked River in 1938, and except for a
few interruptions, continued to work in the area until the late 1950s. In several of the years that
it operated in Crooked River, the dredge ran 24 hours a day with shifts of up to 20 men. It
consistently topped annual production in the Orogrande Mining District, and several times
ranked number one in Idaho County. These intensive mining activities disturbed riparian
conditions alongside Crooked River and left extensive tailings piles with coarse, well-drained
substrates that are a poor growth medium, resulting in undesirable riparian vegetation with high
solar radiation that has caused elevated water temperatures. Ongoing actions include recreation,
road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and weed
treatments. The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project is a reasonably foreseeable
future action within the Crooked River watershed, and would include prescribed burning,
vegetation treatments, and temporary road construction.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
ongoing, or reasonably foreseeable future actions. Since no direct or indirect effects would occur
under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would occur.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, water temperatures in Crooked River would likely increase in the short term
with the removal of existing riparian vegetation for the construction of the new channel and the
temporary bypass channel, which could cause a cumulative effect of increased water
temperatures in South Fork Clearwater River. This short-term temperature increase in South

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Fork Clearwater River could dissipate in the downstream direction from its confluence with
Crooked River with instream mixing and tributary inflows. Water temperatures are not expected
to increase in the short- or long-term in Crooked River or South Fork Clearwater River from the
implementation of the proposed Orogrande Community Protection project. Some vegetation
treatments would occur in riparian habitat conservation areas along Crooked River, but not to the
extent that they would prevent the attainment of Riparian Management Objectives that include
adequate water temperatures for cold water biota, and no shading trees would be affected (USDA
Forest Service 2013 draft). In the long term, water temperatures are expected to decrease in
Crooked River as desired riparian vegetation grows and provides effective shade to the channel.
As with temperature increases, decreased temperature effects could occur in South Fork
Clearwater River beginning at its confluence with Crooked River. However, these effects could
also be expected to dissipate in the downstream direction with instream mixing and tributary
inflows.
Turbidity
Turbidity level in Crooke River vary with streamflow throughout the year. Levels increase
during peak streamflow in May or June annually and can also increase following precipitation
events. Turbidity measurements of five surface water samples were collected 2015 within the
project area in June 2015. Instream conditions ranged from 2.4 to 3.8 nephelometric turbidity
units (NTUs), with an average value of 2.9 NTUs. Turbidity level in the South Fork Clearwater
River during this same time period was 4.8 NTUs. Turbidity was measured using a Hach
turbidimeter, and all samples complied with the Idaho State Water Quality Standard for turbidity
(IDEQ 2013) .
The Idaho State Water Quality Standard state that turbidity shall not exceed background beyond
the mixing zone boundary by more than 50 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) instantaneously
or exceed 25 NTU for more than 10 consecutive days beyond the mixing zone (IDEQ 2013,
IDAPA 58.01.02, sec 250), where the mixing zone boundary is 100 m (330 ft) downstream from
the activity.
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the Meanders area, which does not include restoration activities that could
increase turbidity; therefore, Idaho State Water Quality Standard for turbidity would not be
exceeded.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

3-83

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Direct increases to instream turbidity levels could result from clearing of vegetation; preparing
staging areas; construction of temporary bypass channel and road; watering the temporary bypass
channel, re-watering the newly constructed channel and placement of large woody debris.
Floodplain grading activities and new channel construction would increase sediment production;
however, sediment basins would be constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle
out sediment.
These direct effects would be short term, based on the application of design and mitigation
measures that would be implemented to minimize turbidity increases during instream activities
(Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures #1, 6–10, 13, 16–19, 46–49, and 52). See also
Effectiveness of Mitigation at the end of this section.
A required Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that includes appropriate BMPs to
protect water quality, would be prepared and adhered to as part of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Construction General Permit. Activities
would be performed in compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in the NPDES permit
and CWA Section 401 water quality certification, which provide reasonable assurance that the
Idaho State Water Quality standard for turbidity would not be exceeded. These terms and
conditions would include the implementation and maintenance of BMPs to minimize turbidity,
and turbidity compliance monitoring. If an exceedance occurs and BMPs appear to be
functioning to their fullest capability, the activity would be modified and/or additional BMPs
would be implemented (including modifying existing BMPs). These conditions would include
turbidity compliance monitoring and reporting to ensure the water quality standard for turbidity
is not exceeded.
Best Management Practices (BMPs) would be implemented and maintained to minimize
turbidity increases during construction and include: completing ground-disturbing activities
during low-flow conditions and adjusting instream work dates on a site-specific basis through
coordination with the Central Idaho Level 1 Team and other agencies; diverting or pumping
stream water around the work site and placing screens on intake pipes; installing silt fences,
straw bales, and/or sand bag windrows as needed before excavation occurs to separate disturbed
areas from waterbodies; operating dewatering systems continuously until project construction
has been completed on each reach; and re-watering the new channel slowly. In addition to
compliance monitoring, BMPs will be inspected visually to determine if they are functioning. If
an exceedance occurs and BMPs appear to be functioning to their fullest capability, the activity
will be modified and /or additional BMPs will be implemented (including modifying the existing
BMPs).
Design and mitigation measures, such as installing sediment barriers (#8) and
mulching/stabilizing side slopes (#19), would reduce the overall amount of sediment that reaches
live water, but would not prevent all sediment from reaching the stream.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The project area is primarily composed of larger cobble since most of the fine sediment was
washed out during the dredging activities. This type of substrate would reduce the overall
amount of sediment produced during construction activities. The temporary bypass channel
may be watered during high flows (April–May) when turbidity background levels are naturally
higher to reduce the impacts on fish. Re-watering the newly constructed channel would likely
occur during low flow; however, since fine sediment is already lacking in the project area, the
amount that is mobilized during the re-watering process would be reduced.
Providing a temporary bypass channel and constructing a temporary work road would physically
separate the majority of the construction area from direct contact with Crooked River and would
reduce the amount of sediment yield delivered to waterbodies and resulting increases in turbidity,
during construction (#47, #48 [RDG et al. 2013a], and #52). As a part of the design, temporary
ponds would be constructed to capture sediment across the work area and prevent sediment yield
to the bypass channel or the South Fork Clearwater River. Turbid water may be pumped to the
floodplain or settling ponds to keep areas dry during construction and to reduce sediment
delivery to Crooked River and South Fork Clearwater River.
Cumulative Effects: Turbidity

Cumulative effects occur from the incremental effects of an action when added to other past,
ongoing, or reasonably foreseeable future actions.
The cumulative effects analysis area for turbidity is Crooked River in the project area to its
confluence with the South Fork Clearwater River. A full description of past, ongoing, and future
foreseeable actions is presented in Appendix C of the FEIS.
Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Past timber harvest, road construction and dredge mining activities in Crooked River are no
longer having an direct effect on turbidity. Indirectly, these activities contribute to the
background level of turbidity currently in Crooked River in the project area.
Ongoing actions, such as recreation and road maintenance, have indirect short term effects on
turbidity. Because Road 233 is directly adjacent to Crooked River, road maintenance can cause
sediment delivery to Crooked River, thus increasing turbidity for short durations. However, this
is not expected to exceed the Water Quality Standard for turbidity, in Crooked River or at its
confluence with the South Fork Clearwater.
The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project is a reasonably foreseeable future action
within Crooked River watershed. The project treatments include prescribed burning, vegetation
treatments and temporary roads construction and would apply design and mitigation measures
(including BMPS) and adhere to PACFISH riparian buffers, as to not result in turbidity levels in
Crooked River exceeding the Idaho State Water Quality Standards.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 1 – No Action

Since no direct or indirect effects would occur under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would
occur to the levels of turbidity in Crooked River.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, turbidity in Crooked River could increase in the short term during the
clearing of vegetation; preparing staging areas; construction of temporary bypass channel and
road; watering the temporary bypass channel, new channel construction, re-watering the newly
constructed channel, floodplain grading activities and placement of large woody debris.
However, compliance with the terms and condition set forth in the NPDES stormwater permit
and CWA 401 water quality certification would provide assurance that the Idaho State Water
Quality Standard for turbidity would not be exceeded in Crooked River within the project area or
downstream at its confluence with South Fork Clearwater River. Although Alternative 2 and the
proposed Orogrande Community project would be implemented in the same watershed and over
the same time period, with the application of the design and mitigation measures described
above, there is no cumulative effect expected.
Geomorphology – Direct and Indirect Effects
Channel Entrenchment Ratio

Information for the channel entrenchment ratio analysis was summarized from Design Criteria
Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Channel entrenchment ratio is a measure of how incised a river is, or the extent of vertical
containment of a river relative to its adjacent floodplain. It is calculated as the ratio of floodprone area width to bankfull width (flood-prone area width: bankfull width), and used as an
indicator of floodplain connectivity. Channel entrenchment ratios less than 1.4 indicate high
channel entrenchment; greater than 2.2 indicate slight channel entrenchment; and between 1.4
and 2.2 indicate moderate channel entrenchment (Rosgen and Silvey 1996). The desired
condition for Crooked River is low or slight channel entrenchment.
Geomorphology through the project area is altered, and existing channel entrenchment is
moderate per Rosgen Stream Classification (Rosgen and Silvey 1996), with mean channel
entrenchment ratios for the four river reaches within the project area ranging from 1.7 to 2.5, as
presented in Table 3-14. The locations of the four river reaches are presented in Figure 3-14.
Flow direction is from south to north (Reach 1 to Reach 4).
Channel entrenchment between tailings piles is containing Crooked River within its banks, and
in most cases the 100-year flood flow event (Q100) is contained in narrow overbank areas
between the channel and the tailing piles. This is preventing channel-floodplain interaction, and
floodplain connectivity is lacking. More than 50% of the valley bottom is elevated greater than

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

1.5 feet above the bankfull elevation (Table 3-15 and Figure 3-15), suggesting that a majority of
the valley contains tailings piles and is not part of the functioning floodplain.
Hydraulic analysis estimates that at least a 500-year return period flood flow event would be
required to mobilize large cobble material (RDG et al. 2012), which is present in the tailing piles.
An event of that magnitude has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year; thus, the time
frame for natural recovery to erode the tailings pile, reduce channel entrenchment, and restore
floodplain connectivity is on the scale of thousands of years.

entrenchment would persist with entrenchment ratios ranging from 1.7 to 2.5, and floodplain
connectivity would remain lacking. Natural recovery processes that could erode the tailings piles
and re-grade the floodplain to an elevation that reduces channel entrenchment and restores
floodplain connectivity would occur on an estimated time scale of thousands of years.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 proposes to excavate the majority of the tailings piles, re-grade the floodplain, and
size the new channel capacity for bankfull discharge to reduce channel entrenchment and restore
floodplain connectivity. Estimated channel entrenchment ratios for the re-constructed channel
were calculated using channel design criteria data (RDG et al. 2013a), and range from 10.0 to
12.5 (Table 3-16), indicating slight channel entrenchment and thus restored floodplain
connectivity. A summary comparison of channel entrenchment ratios by alternative is presented
in Table 3-17. The increase in channel entrenchment ratio from the existing 1.7–2.5 to 10.0–12.5
under Alternative 2 represents a change from moderate channel entrenchment to slight or low
channel entrenchment per Rosgen Stream Classification (Rosgen and Silvey 1996), indicating
that Crooked River would be reconnected with its floodplain and more natural and frequent
flooding of the floodplain would occur.

defined as the ratio of the bankfull surface width to the mean bankfull depth. Width-to-depth

greater than 40 are considered very high.

The existing channel width-to-depth ratios for the four river reaches of Crooked River within the

Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. The existing moderate to
high channel width-to-depth ratios (17 to 31) indicating a wide and shallow channel shape would
persist, as would elevated water temperatures that exceed the temperature criteria. Wide and
shallow channel shapes have slower water velocities and larger surface areas; therefore, they
have greater exposure time and area to solar radiation if there is little shading of the stream, and
water temperatures become elevated.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 proposes to re-construct two miles of Crooked River with expected channel widthto-depth ratios ranging from 23 to 36, as presented in Table 3-19, which are moderate to high
and indicate a wide, shallow channel shape. A comparison of channel width-to-depth ratios by
alternative is presented in Table 3-20, which shows that there would be little effect on channel
shape under Alternative 2 initially, and the channel shape would remain wide and shallow in the
short term. In the long term, however, width-to-depth ratios are expected to decrease in response
to increased complexity of the channel margins through the addition of woody debris structures,
and increased complexity within the channel through the addition of large woody debris. This
increased complexity would cause localized backwater and localized flow acceleration, which
would result in deeper flow from backwater effects, and scour and the formation of deeper holes
with deeper flow depth from flow acceleration effects. In addition to localized flow acceleration
resulting from increased channel complexity, stream velocity would increase in Reaches 2 and 3
where channel slope would be increased, as discussed in the Channel Sinuosity sections.
Increased stream velocity and expected post-project streamside average percent effective
summer shade of 83 percent, as discussed in the Water Temperature sections, could result in
decreased water temperatures.

Channel Sinuosity

Information for the channel sinuosity analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report:
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
Geomorphology in the project area has been altered by the past mining, which has left tailings
piles and resulted in a tortuous meander pattern (Figure 3-16, Appendix C). Channel sinuosity is
1.2 and 1.4 in the upper and lower reaches, respectively (Reaches 1 and 4, Figure 3-14), with
higher channel sinuosity of 2.2 and 2.7 in the tortuous Meanders middle reaches (Reaches 2 and
3, Figure 3-14). The higher channel sinuosity in the tortuous Meanders reaches indicates lower
channel gradients, which are approximately half the gradients of the upper and lower reaches
(Table 3-21). Lower channel gradients result in slower water velocities, which reduce the river’s
sediment transport competence and capacity. Sediment transport competence is the maximum
particle size that can be transported, and sediment transport capacity is the maximum amount of
sediment that can be transported. Low competence in the tortuous Meanders reaches (Reaches 2
and 3) coupled with an abrupt decrease in channel gradient that exists between Reaches 1 and 2
have caused gravel entering the project area from upstream (south) to deposit in Reach 2, thus
depriving downstream Reaches 3 and 4 of suitable spawning substrate, as presented in
Table 3-21.

Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 would remove the majority of the tailing piles and reconstruct the channel and its
floodplain to create more natural stream sinuosity and meet the design objective of restoring
geomorphology in the project area. Existing channel sinuosity ranging from 2.2 to 2.7
representing the tortuous meander pattern would be decreased, and more natural channel
sinuosity ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 would be created. This more natural channel sinuosity would
provide higher channel gradients and corresponding higher velocities, which would increase the
river’s competence to transport gravel and provide suitable spawning substrate to the
downstream reaches. A comparison of the existing and expected channel sinuosity and channel
gradients by alternative is presented in Table 3-22.

Sediment Transport/Bed Mobility

Information for the sediment transport/bed mobility analysis was summarized from Design
Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design
Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a), and Hydraulic
Modeling and Habitat Mapping for Existing Conditions (RDG 2013b).
Natural processes influencing sediment supply in the Crooked River watershed include geology,
soils, hillslope mass wasting, forest fires, and lateral migration/bank erosion. Granitic geology,
relatively stable hillslopes, infrequent fires, and low bank erosion rates appear to be factors
contributing to a low sediment supply. Sediment transport in the Crooked River is affected by
valley gradient, stream type, and supply. An evaluation of valley gradients and stream types
indicates that sediment transport capacity likely decreases downstream of the Narrows, creating
the potential for sediment deposition near the upper boundary of Reach 2 (Figure 3-14).
Similarly, past rehabilitation efforts to increase channel sinuosity by routing the river through
large dredge ponds have reduced channel gradient and increased the potential for sediment
storage, thus making the dredge ponds function as large sediment traps capable of depleting
downstream reaches of sediment supply. Downstream, the reduced stream power through
meandering channel segments combined with a lack of sediment supply have resulted in static
bed conditions and subsequent armoring of the riverbed with the over-sized remains of coarse
dredging deposits. These static conditions represent bed immobility.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

As discussed in the Channel Sinuosity section, lower channel gradients have resulted in slower
water velocities, which have reduced the river’s sediment transport competence and capacity and
caused gravel entering the project area from upstream to deposit in Reach 2, thus depriving
downstream Reaches 3 and 4 (Figure 3-14) of suitable spawning substrate (see Table 3-21).
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. Channel gradients and
water velocities would remain low, the river’s sediment transport competence would remain low,
static conditions representing an immobile and armored riverbed would persist, and downstream
reaches would continue to be deprived of gravel needed for suitable spawning substrate.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, the channel would be reconstructed to support a mobile gravel bed, which
would provide downstream reaches with appropriately sized spawning gravel and support the
maintenance of clean interstitial spaces. This would be accomplished by increasing channel
gradients in Reaches 2 and 3, as presented in Table 3-22, which would increase water velocities
in the meandering reaches and increase sediment transport competence and capacity to provide
suitable spawning gravels to downstream reaches. A comparison of channel gradients by
alternative is presented in Table 3-22.
A summary comparison of areas for particle size mobility is presented in Table 3-23, which
shows an increase in gravel mobility under Alternative 2 for both the bankfull discharge of
300 cfs with a recurrence interval of 1.1 years, and the Q2 discharge of 597 cfs with a recurrence
interval of 2 years. Figures 3-17 and 3-18 illustrate particle bed mobility for bankfull and Q2
discharges, respectively, where the reconstruction of the floodplain and channel would result in
smaller particles being distributed across more of the floodplain and larger particles suitable for
spawning to move into Reaches 3 and 4 of Crooked River (see also Aquatic Resources section).

Geomorphology – Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects analysis area for the geomorphic indicators channel width-to-depth ratio,
channel sinuosity, and channel entrenchment ratio is the project area.
The cumulative effects analysis area for the geomorphic indicator sediment transport/bed
mobility is the project area and the South Fork Clearwater River to its confluence with the
Middle Fork Clearwater River near Kooskia, ID.
A full description of past, ongoing, and future foreseeable actions is in Appendix C.
Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Past dredge mining has had the most notable management-related effects on geomorphology in
the project area. There are no ongoing or foreseeable future actions within the project area that
would affect channel sinuosity, channel entrenchment ratios, or channel width-to-depth ratios.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Since no direct or indirect effects would occur under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would
occur.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Alternative 2 would have direct effects on channel sinuosity, channel entrenchment ratios, and
channel width-to-depth ratios. While no other ongoing or foreseeable actions would affect these
indicators, there would be a beneficial cumulative effect, which is the intent of the project. The
beneficial cumulative effects include restored channel-floodplain connectivity, improved riparian
vegetation and stream shading, and cooler stream temperatures.
Wetlands
Information for the wetlands analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report: Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design Report: Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a), and Crooked River Rehabilitation Project
Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012). See Appendix B for the
Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) practicability analysis of alternatives.. The analysis was
used to identify the Least Damaging Practical Alternative (LDPA) for the project.
Within the 115-acre project area, 52.5 acres of wetlands have been delineated. Wetland classes
delineated include palustrine aquatic bed, palustrine emergent, palustrine scrub shrub, palustrine
forested, and riverine as presented in Table 3-24 and Figures 3-19, 3-20, and 3-21. Each of the
wetlands types provide various wetland functions, including: aquatic and terrestrial habitat,
debris recruitment, surface and groundwater storage, sediment and nutrient filtering, streambank
stabilization, thermal cover, and terrestrial habitat.
Palustrine aquatic bed wetlands account for 9.7 acres (18.5%) of the existing wetland area in the
project area, and include dredge ponds and low-gradient side channel features flowing along the

edges of the valley. Aquatic bed wetlands in the project area provide surface and groundwater
storage that maintain streamflows, and provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species. The
function of aquatic bed wetlands is limited through lack of connectivity with the mainstem

Palustrine emergent wetlands are the most abundant wetland class in the project area, and
account for 28.1 acres (53.5%) of the existing wetland area. Emergent wetlands, defined by the
dominance of erect rooted herbaceous (not woody) wetland plants, occur throughout the
floodplain including on streambanks of Crooked River, alongside channels, around dredge
ponds, at the toe of valley slopes, and on floodplain surfaces. Sedges and reed canary grass are
the dominant emergent wetland species on streambanks and connected floodplain features. As
discussed in the water temperature analysis, reed canary grass occupies 40% of the streamside
and provides average and minimum summer percent effective shade of 18 and 6%, respectively,
thereby providing little thermal cover.
Emergent wetlands are supported by a number of hydrologic regimes, including: temporarily
flooded, seasonally flooded, and semi-permanently flooded. Emergent wetlands provide surface
and groundwater storage that maintain streamflows, and provide habitat for aquatic and
terrestrial species. Where connected to Crooked River, these wetlands provide sediment and
nutrient filtering and streambank stabilization functions. The function of emergent wetlands is
limited due to lack of connectivity with Crooked River.
Palustrine scrub shrub wetlands account for 1.7 acres (3.2%) of the existing wetland area in the
project area, and are located in a few scattered locations on the floodplain that supports this
wetland class. Scrub shrub wetlands are located mostly along the main Crooked River channel
and support a range of floodplain and aquatic habitat functions, including thermal cover, debris
recruitment, and streambank stability. These wetlands provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial
species. Function of these wetlands is limited due to the lack of floodplain connectivity and the
small area occupied by this wetland type.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Two palustrine forested wetlands accounting for 0.5 acres (1.0%) of existing wetland area were
delineated in the project area. Both wetlands are associated with seep features on slopes on the
east side of valley that drain into the floodplain. In the project area, forested wetlands are rare
and associated with seeps along valley slopes. These wetlands provide habitat for terrestrial
species, including terrestrial insect input as a food source and leaf drop as a nutrient source for
other wetlands and aquatic habitat. Function of these wetlands is limited due to the small area
occupied by this wetland type.
Riverine wetlands accounting for 12.5 acres (23.8%) of existing wetland area were delineated in
the project area. These wetlands provide habitat for fish and other aquatic species, convey water
and sediment, and provide an influx of nutrients and organic matter to adjacent wetland features,
which supports nutrient cycling.

Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. Emergent wetlands that do
not provide thermal cover and currently account for the majority (53.5%) of the existing
52.5-acre delineated wetland area would likely persist at these high levels. Desired scrub shrub
wetlands that provide thermal cover and currently account for only 3.2% of the wetland area
would likely persist at these low levels. Existing wetlands by area, function, and class are
presented in Table 3-24.
No Clean Water Act Section 404 permit authorization would be needed by the USACE under
this alternative.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, a mosaic of vegetation communities would be created that would provide
more ecological functions than currently exist. This mosaic would be accomplished by restoring
channel-floodplain interaction through decreased channel entrenchment in the reconstructed
channel, whereby the floodplain would be inundated more frequently at flows greater than the
1.1-year recurrence interval, and through the construction of side channels that would connect to
the main channel at elevations above baseflow and below bankfull stage and would convey less
than 10 percent of the total flow.
Two types of wetland features would be constructed: slope wetlands and side channel wetlands.
Slope wetlands are lateral seeps entering the valley bottom from side drainages. Side channel
wetlands are wide, shallow depressions connected to side channel features. Side channel
wetlands would create areas of low velocity along the side channels to promote natural
recruitment of vegetation and organic matter and retain late-season moisture in the floodplain.
Existing aquatic bed and emergent wetlands would be converted to higher functioning scrubshrub and forest-dominated vegetation communities that would provide aquatic and terrestrial
habitat and increase streamside shading. A Montana Assessment was completed for the existing
condition of wetlands and the conceptual design of the post-project wetland areas. The
functionality score was increased in the post-project assessment of the expected conditions (from
458 to 723) (Nez Perce Tribe 2014). Alternative 2 is expected to impact 30.6 acres of the
existing 52.5 acres of wetland during construction (Figure 3-22), and create 42 acres of wetlands
(Figure 3-23). Following implementation, the expected wetland area would be 64.1 acres, which
would be a total net gain of 11.6 acres of wetlands in the long term.
A comparison of the areas of existing and expected wetland classes by alternative is presented in
Table 3-25. Existing wetlands outside construction limits would be preserved in their present
condition. Table 3-26 shows the existing wetland area, estimated project-related wetland impact

area, estimated area of wetland creation resulting from the project, and the total estimated area of
wetland post-project.
Alternative 2 would comply with Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) as: (1)
potential effects to wetlands in the project area have been evaluated; (2) design and mitigation
measures have been developed to avoid adversely impacting wetlands wherever possible or to
minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values of wetlands; and (3) Alternative 2 would
enhance the natural and beneficial value of wetlands by converting the existing wetlands to a
higher functioning wetlands.
Alternative 2 has been identified as the Least Damaging Practical Alternative (LEDPA), the
preferred alternative, for this project. See Appendix B for the Clean Water Act – Section
404(b)(1) practicability analysis of alternatives. The 404(b)(1) analysis was prepare to provide
information to the USACE and ensure that the LEDPA is carried forward for detailed study in
this EIS. Alternatives were compared for their consistency with the basic purpose; the impacts to
jurisdictional waters from discharge of dredged or fill material; other environmental impacts; and
cost, logistical, and technological considerations. Alternative 2, including design and mitigation
measures (see Chapter 2) would avoid and /or minimize impact to jurisdictional water and
special aquatic sites to the maximum extent practicable.
A Joint Application for Permit and Stream Alteration Permit would be needed for this
alternative. The effectiveness of revegetation efforts would be monitored for five years after
construction activities are completed, and submitted annually to USACE.

This estimate includes existing wetlands that would not be impacted by project actions combined with wetlands expected to be
created by the project.

Wetlands are expected to increase in both area and diversity in the project area as a result of the
project, and associated wetland and floodplain functions are also expected to increase. The
project design would create a diverse floodplain surface that is hydrologically connected with the
Crooked River channel. The floodplain would include a variety of geomorphic surfaces,
including a defined main channel, point bars, bankfull floodplain, side channels, and large and
small depression features. Frequent disturbance from floods, combined with groundwater and
hyporheic exchange, would result in a heterogeneous mosaic of habitats across the floodplain,
each capable of supporting a variety of plant species. These enhanced hydrogeomorphic
conditions would cause many of these diverse, newly created habitats to develop into ephemeral,
seasonal, or persistent wetland types.
The time needed for wetlands to develop in the floodplain depends on a number of factors.
Some wetland types, such as riverine wetlands, would be present immediately after project
implementation. Other wetlands, such as shrub and forested wetlands, would not be present until
woody vegetation has a chance to colonize and establish these areas. The diversity of features
incorporated into the design floodplain would provide both sources and storage of organic
matter, which would promote soil development over time. Deposited and accumulated sediment
within the hydrologically diverse floodplain would influence the development and maintenance
of wetland and riparian vegetation communities. Hydrologic conditions would dictate what
vegetation communities would ultimately develop and thrive in the floodplain and what type of
soils would develop over time.
Table 3-27 presents design vegetation communities with the expected wetland classes that are
likely to develop in the long term. Most of the rehabilitated floodplain is designed to support
riparian shrub and forest plant communities. The rehabilitated floodplain includes approximately
32.6 acres of alder vegetation community type, which is expected to develop into a palustrine
scrub shrub wetland over time (Figure 3-24). Other design features that are expected to develop
into wetland over time include bare colonizing surfaces, water features such as the main channel,
alcoves and side channels, and sedge vegetation communities. Palustrine forested wetlands may

develop in portions of the conifer/tall forb, mixed shrub, and spruce design vegetation
community types when they are located in areas with wetland hydrology (i.e., slope wetlands)
but these are not included in the estimated total expected wetland area because it is unclear how
the hydrology would develop in these areas.
Alternative 2 would create a connected, topographically heterogeneous floodplain with a mosaic
of vegetation communities, where the rehabilitated Crooked River floodplain would be able to
provide more ecological functions compared to the existing conditions. Conversion of existing
aquatic bed and emergent wetlands that are disconnected from the main channel by extensive
tailings piles to shrub and forest-dominated vegetation communities connected with the river
would support sediment and water retention, provide habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species,
increase allochthonous inputs of carbon and other nutrients, as well as increase shading of the
channel to help maintain water temperatures.

Floodplains
Information for the floodplains analysis was summarized from Design Criteria Report: Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report: Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a).
As discussed in the channel entrenchment analysis, tailings piles are extensive on the valley
floor, Crooked River is confined within its banks as a result, and more than 50 percent of the
valley bottom is not part of the floodplain (Table 3-15 and Figure 3-15). As discussed in the
water temperature analysis, this lack of floodplain connectivity limits the interaction between the
stream channel and the floodplain, which inhibits the processes that support desired riparian
vegetation communities. Within the 115-acre project area, there are approximately 22.7 acres of
floodplain, of which 15.6 acres are bankfull floodplain and 7.1 acres are upland floodplain.
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 – No Action

Under Alternative 1, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests would maintain the current
management of the project area, which does not include restoration. The majority of the project
area would remain outside of the floodplain, the lack of floodplain connectivity would persist,
and conditions to support desired vegetation communities and desired aquatic habitat would not
be created. The area of existing floodplain, by alternative, is presented in Table 3-28.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

Under Alternative 2, the floodplain and channel profile would be gradually raised 2.8 feet
beginning near the upstream boundary of Reach 2 (Figure 3-10) and then gradually lowered to
transition back to the existing channel and bankfull indicators near the downstream boundary of
Reach 4 (Figure 3-10). Interaction between the stream channel and floodplain would be restored
with floodplain inundation occurring more frequently at flows greater than the 1.1-year
recurrence interval, and sustainable floodplain morphology would be established that is capable
of supporting aquatic habitat and desired vegetation communities, which would provide more
ecological functions than currently exist. Under Alternative 2, approximately 22.7 acres of
floodplain would be impacted during construction, and 56.3 acres of new floodplain would be
created. Of the new floodplain created, 43.1 acres would be bankfull floodplain, and 13.2 acres
would be upland floodplain. Following implementation, the floodplain area would be 56.3 acres,
for a total net gain of 33.6 acres of floodplain. A comparison of the area of existing and
proposed floodplain types, by alternative, is presented in Table 3-28. Table 3-29 shows the
existing floodplain acres, project-related floodplain impact acres, and the post-project acres of
new floodplain created.

The new floodplain would be characterized by complexity and diversity, and consist of surface
elevations that correspond to a range of desired floodplain vegetation communities and desired
geomorphic features. These include wetlands, side channels, and oxbow or pond features of
varying depth that would create an abiotic template to support complex and highly functioning
plant communities. The result would be a wide range of ecological niches within a diverse
mosaic of plant communities for both short and long term. Further diversifying the floodplain
through placement of varying textures and thicknesses of substrate, and integrating woody debris
in patterns mimicking natural recruitment, would create the physical components necessary for
river processes to initiate development of a highly functioning floodplain environment. The
width of the bankfull floodplain would vary from 100 to 400 feet with the valley width, with an
average width of 300 feet. The bankfull floodplain would correspond to the elevation from the
top of the new channel banks to 1.5 feet higher, and would be inundated frequently at flows with
recurrence intervals greater than the 1.1-year flood flow event. The upland floodplain would be
constructed as a transition area between the bankfull floodplain and existing ground, and the
elevation would correspond to 1.5 to 2.0 feet above the top of the new channel banks. The
upland floodplain width would vary from 0 to 200 feet based on the balance of earthwork. The
height of the upland floodplain would be set at an elevation corresponding to slightly drier
vegetation community types. The upland floodplain would be inundated infrequently at flows
with recurrence intervals greater than the 25-year flood flow event (or, on average, inundated
every 25 years).
Alternative 2 would comply with Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) as:
(1) potential effects to floodplains in the project area have been evaluated; (2) design and
mitigation measures have been developed to reduce short-term impacts to floodplains; and
(3) Alternative 2 would restore the function of the floodplain.

Wetlands and Floodplains – Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects analysis area for wetlands and floodplains is the project area.
Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Past dredge mining has had the most direct notable management-related effects on wetlands and
floodplains in the project area. A full description of past, ongoing, and future foreseeable actions
considered in this analysis is presented in Appendix C.
There are no ongoing or foreseeable future actions within the project area that would affect
floodplains or wetlands.
Alternative 1 – No Action

Past dredge mining would continue to affect floodplain and wetlands currently in the project area
because these systems have been physically altered. However, since no direct or indirect effects
would occur under Alternative 1, no cumulative effects would occur.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action

The proposed action would reduce the effects from past dredge mining on the Crooked River
floodplain and wetlands in the project area through the proposed rehabilitation efforts.
Alternative 2 would have short-term adverse effect on wetlands with the reconstruction of the
channel and the re-grading of the floodplain; however, not all wetlands would be impacted. Of
the existing 52.5 acres of wetlands, 30.6 acres would be impacted, and 21.9 acres would be
preserved. These short-term adverse effects on wetlands are expected to be off-set by long-term
improvements that include the conversion of existing aquatic bed and emergent wetlands to
higher-quality shrub and forest-dominated vegetation communities that would provide aquatic
and terrestrial habitat and increase streamside shading, and by the net increase of 11.6 acres of
wetlands from the existing 52.5 acres to 64.1 acres post-project (Table 3-26).
Alternative 2 would have short-term adverse effects on the existing 22.7 acres of floodplain with
the re-grading of the floodplain; however, these short-term adverse effects would be offset by the
restoration of floodplain connectivity and improvement of floodplain function, and by the net
gain of 33.6 acres from the existing 22.7 acres to 56.3 acres post-project (Table 3-29).
Alternative 2 would have direct effects on the floodplain and wetlands. While no other ongoing
or future foreseeable actions would have direct or indirect effects on the floodplain and wetlands,
there would be beneficial cumulative effects, which is the intent of the project. The beneficial
cumulative effects include restored floodplain function, a net increase of 33.6 acres of floodplain,
the conversion from low value to high value wetlands, and a net gain of 11.6 acres of wetlands.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Other Cumulative Effects
Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Future Actions

Existing roads have had the most notable management-related effects on sediment yield in
Crooked River watershed, Campbell Creek, and Deadwood Creek. Ongoing actions include road
maintenance.
There are two reasonably foreseeable future actions within the Crooked River watershed that
were considered. The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project would include
prescribed burning, vegetation treatments, and temporary road construction activities. The
proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would reconstruct a portion of
Road 233. Both future activities are within the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area.
As modeled by NEZSED, the combined sediment yields from both reasonable foreseeable future
projects are predicted to be below Forest Plan sediment yield guidelines. Given sediment yields
from future foreseeable projects are predicted to meet Forest Plan guidelines, and
implementation of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project will meet Idaho State Water
Quality Standards through design and mitigation measures, there would be no cumulative effect
on sediment yield.
Watershed Condition

The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would have minimal direct
and indirect effects on total and streamside road densities and no direct or indirect effects on
watershed condition; therefore, no cumulative effects on watershed condition would occur.
Sediment Yield

The cumulative effects area for sediment yield is the Crooked River watershed, Campbell Creek,
and Deadwood Creek. A full description of past, ongoing, and future foreseeable actions is
presented in Appendix C.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The following project design and mitigation measures meet the intent of Clean Water Act,
Section 303, and are considered project-specific best management practices for the action
alternative (Alternative 2). The measures are specified in full in Chapter 2, Design and
Mitigation Measures. See, also, Federal Consistency Check List in the project record.
Sediment Yield/Turbidity
The following design and mitigation measures related to sediment and turbidity would be
implemented for Alternative 2: #1, 6–10, 13, 16–19, 46–49, and 52.
Aspects of the proposed project that have the potential to elevate turbidity and increase sediment
include: construction of temporary bypass channel and road; clearing of vegetation; preparing
staging areas; watering the temporary bypass channel; and re-watering the stream. Floodplain
grading activities and new channel construction would increase sediment production; however,
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

3-114

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

sediment basins would be constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle out
sediment. Design and mitigation measures, such as installing sediment barriers (#8) and
mulching/stabilizing side slopes (#19), would reduce the overall amount of sediment that reaches
live water, but would not prevent all sediment from reaching the stream.
The project area is primarily composed of larger cobble since most of the fine sediment was
washed out during the dredging activities. This type of substrate would reduce the overall
amount of sediment produced during construction activities. The temporary bypass channel
may be watered during high flows (April–May) when turbidity background levels are naturally
higher to reduce the impacts on fish. Re-watering the newly constructed channel would likely
occur during low flow; however, since fine sediment is already lacking in the project area, the
amount that is mobilized during the re-watering process would be reduced
Providing a temporary bypass channel and constructing a temporary work road would physically
separate the majority of the construction area from direct contact with Crooked River and would
reduce the amount of sediment yield delivered to waterbodies during construction (#47, #48
[RDG et al. 2013a], and #52). As a part of the design, temporary ponds would be constructed to
capture sediment across the work area and prevent sediment yield to the bypass channel or the
South Fork Clearwater River. Turbid water may be pumped to the floodplain or settling ponds to
keep areas dry during construction and to reduce sediment delivery to Crooked River and South
Fork Clearwater River.
Design and mitigation measure #16 may include actions or monitoring to be conducted as
directed by regulatory agencies, and adaptive management would be applied to ensure Idaho
State Water Quality Standards for turbidity are not exceeded.
The erosion control plan ensures coordination between the Forest Service and the contractor to
reduce offsite sediment and erosion. This is BMP Conservation Practice (CP) 15.03 in the
Region 1 and 4 Soil Conservation Handbook (USDA Forest Service 1988a), which was adopted
to comply with the Clean Water Act (also see BMP Fac-2 and AqEco-2 in the Forest Service
National Core BMPs [USDA Forest Service 2012]). Newly constructed or disturbed surfaces
have surface runoff as the dominant erosion mechanism for this scale of activity (Lane et al.
1997). Runoff is reduced by dispersing runoff with groundcover and shaping the surface, and by
preserving the soil’s capacity to take in precipitation.
Design and mitigation measures 9 and 13 rely on groundcover as a means to reduce erosion. The
measures tier to BMPs CP 11.03, 13.01, and 13.04 (USDA Forest Service 1988a) and National
Core BMPs Fac-2, Fac-10, Road-3, Road-6, and Veg-2 (USDA Forest Service 2012).
Groundcover is commonly used to reduce erosion for road bases and reclaimed soil areas. The
effectiveness depends on the slope and infiltration capacity of the soil. For roadsides where fill
provides poor infiltration, grasses disperse runoff but the infiltration capacity remains reduced.
However, rock and organic mulch both protect the surface and reduce the generation of overland

flow. The Water Erosion Prediction Project models illustrate the effectiveness with percent rock
and vegetation as primary inputs (Elliot et al. 1999). An annual rye is used since this grass
grows quickly and binds soil with roots. The vegetation reduces the incidence for rill forming by
minimizing the expanse of bare soil that can generate runoff. Measure 10 increases efficiency by
emphasizing use of onsite materials. Measure 26 indirectly bolsters erosion control since weeds
tend to be single-stemmed forbs that create less-effective groundcover than do grasses (Lacey et
al. 1989).
Measure 13 effectively reduces erosion by avoiding compaction and rutting that can occur when
machines operate in saturated conditions. Soil strength decreases substantially during wet
saturated conditions and operation (NCASI 2004). Saturated conditions increase runoff
incidence since soils lack capacity to take in precipitation.
Measure 10 shapes the constructed surfaces to reduce rill and gully formation from concentrated
water flow. The effectiveness is proven as a core design concept for constructing road surfaces
to shed water.
Petroleum-Based Products
The following design and mitigation measures related to petroleum-based products are to be
implemented for Alternative 2: #2, 3, 4, and 5.
Heavy equipment would be used for project activities that include floodplain regrading and
channel reconstruction. Washing and maintaining all equipment would reduce the amount of
petroleum-based products entering waterbodies from day-to-day operations. Staging areas for
machinery, fuels storage, and maintenance work would occur off site and far enough from live
water that waterbodies would likely not be exposed to petroleum products in the case of a spill
(#3, #5). Since much of the project area is composed of porous cobble, any spills would
percolate to the groundwater quickly. Storing petroleum products in containment structures with
impervious liners would prevent much of any spilled chemical from entering waterbodies or
groundwater, and having spill containment kits and a spill containment plan on site would allow
for a quick response to reduce the amount of chemicals leaching into groundwater (#4).
Toxics
The following design and mitigation measures related to toxics are to be implemented for
Alternative 2: #15 and 20.
Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the environment that has several forms. Metallic
mercury (inorganic mercury and its compounds) is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid.
Metallic mercury enters the air from mining and manufacturing activities and from burning coal
and waste. It has also been added to the environment from historic gold mining activities.
Although mercury was not used in dredge mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a
small potential to find this element during restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies,

including the Crooked River Stream Survey and In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water
Quality Status Report 80: Crooked River (Mann and Lindern 1988), and Idaho Champion Group
Lode and Pacific Group Load Claims: Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection Report
(IDEQ 2011), have all shown that concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and water are
generally equivalent to background levels or below detection limits. Mercury levels in the project
area have been documented to be well below concentration standards set by the EPA that would
be harmful to fish and human health.
It is not likely that mercury would be found during implementation of the Alternative 2. If
detected during construction, follow measures identified in Appendix E. This would reduce the
potential for bioaccumulation of mercury in aquatic species in Crooked River and the South Fork
Clearwater River.
New Channel
Design and mitigation measure #53 would be implemented to ensure sands and gravels are
properly mixed into the new channel to prevent water from going subsurface. The new channel
will be inspected during re-watering to ensure flows do not go subsurface. If flows are lost, fine
sediment will be washed into the substrate to seal interstitial spaces. If water loss continues, rewatering efforts will be halted, and substrate remixed with an excavator. Bentonite may be used
if water continues to go subsurface.
Temporary Bypass Channel
The following design and mitigation measures related to the temporary bypass channel are to be
implemented for Alternative 2: #48 and 52.
The temporary bypass channel would be constructed to pass water, fish and aquatic organisms
prior to any instream or floodplain work, and use until completion of the new floodplain and
stream channel (2–3 years). A spillway would be constructed on the cofferdam to spill any flows
greater than the Q10 (1,062 cfs) into the new channel to reduce the potential for bypass channel
failure at high flows. The bypass channel would be evaluated for stability through cross section
and longitudinal analysis prior to watering and the end of each construction season. Upon
completion of the new floodplain and channel, bypass channel would be reshaped into the new
floodplain
The temporary channel would be watered during high flows if possible. This would allow
sediment produced to be flushed out during periods when natural sediment background is already
high and there is enough water so as not to dewater the existing channel.
Site Rehabilitation
The following design and mitigation measures related to site rehabilitation are to be implemented
for Alternative 2: #17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 28, and 31.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Water Resources

The reclamation relies on local soil and plant material to ensure regrowth success (measure 18).
Local plants and soils have adapted to the local climate conditions. Measure 17 increases the site
capacity to support desired vegetation, as demonstrated by local road decommissioning
monitoring and research (Conner 2003, Lloyd et al. 2013). However, the disturbed conditions
favor establishment of noxious weeds that would compete with and exclude desired vegetation.
The exclusion of opportunistic weed species is critical to allow for desired vegetation to take
hold. Measures 25, 26, 28, and 31 would select for desired plant species using a combination of
preventive and control measures. The effectiveness would depend greatly on the ability for
follow-up treatment.

Alternative 1 would not improve water quality or restore degraded fish habitat. The Lower
Crooked River watershed would continue in a below fishery/water quality objective status (50
percent) (USDA Forest Service 1987, as amended). Alternative 2 would directly improve
degraded fish habitat in the Lower Crooked River watershed. Proposed activities would provide
improvement to fish habitat conditions by improving pool quality, increasing large woody debris
recruitment, and increasing spawning habitat and higher-quality rearing habitat. These changes
would improve overall fish habitat complexity in Crooked River from the existing condition.
Reconstruction of the floodplain and channel would result in smaller particles being distributed
across more of the floodplain and larger particles suitable for spawning to move into Reaches 3
and 4 of Crooked River. Restoring channel and floodplain function, instream fish habitat
complexity, and improving its water quality, which would increase fish habitat potential in
Lower Crooked River towards its 90 percent Fish/Water Quality Objective identified in the
Forest Plan.
Clean Water Act
Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state,
interstate, and local requirements; administrative authorities; and process and sanctions with
respect to control and abatement of water pollution. Executive Order (EO) 12088 requires the
Forest Service to meet the requirements of this Act. Therefore, all state and federal laws and
regulations applicable to water quality would be applied, including 36 CFR 219.27; the Clean
Water Act; the Nez Perce Forest Plan, including PACFISH Riparian Management Objectives
(RMOs) and Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas; Idaho State Best Management Practices
(BMPs); and Stream Alteration procedures. This analysis disclosed in the Final EIS for
Alternative 2 is expected to satisfy the Clean Water Act.
The Forest would apply for an Idaho Joint Application for Permits with the USACE and Stream
Alternation Permit with the Idaho Department of Water Resources, for Alternative 2. In
addition, a Section 404(1)(b) Practicability Analysis has been completed for the preferred
alternative (Appendix B). The results of Section 404(1)(b) Practicability Analysis identified the
Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA).
Idaho State Water Quality Standards
Short-term adverse effects on water temperature are not anticipated. However, pursuant to IDEQ
Antidegredation Policy, short-term adverse effects on water temperature may be allowed by
IDEQ without an antidegradation review where determined necessary to secure long-term water
quality improvement through restoration projects designed to trend toward natural characteristics
and associated uses to a water body where those characteristics and uses have been lost or
diminished (IDAPA 58.01.02, sec. 52).
Project-specific BMPs have been developed to reduce potential impacts to assigned beneficial
uses in the project area. Alternative 2 would be consistent with the State of Idaho
Antidegredation Policy. See Federal Consistency Check List in project record.

Executive Orders 11988 and 11990
These federal executive orders (EOs) provide for the protection and management of floodplains
and wetlands. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activities have been designed to
be consistent with the requirements of EO 11988 and EO 11990. As required, the Forest would
apply for an Idaho Joint Application for Permits with the USACE and a Stream Alteration Permit
with the Idaho Department of Water Resources.
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)
EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) requires each federal agency to evaluate the potential
effects of actions it may take in a floodplain to avoid adverse impacts wherever possible, to
ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management, including restoring and preserving such land areas as natural
undeveloped floodplains, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures
of this EO.
The action alternative has been evaluated for its potential effects to floodplains in the project
area (see previous analysis). Design and mitigation measures have been developed to reduce
short-term impacts to floodplains (Chapter 2).
Executive Order 11990 (Protection of Wetlands)
EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires federal agencies to take action to avoid adversely
impacting wetlands wherever possible, to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values
of wetlands, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO.
The action alternative has been evaluated for its potential effects to wetlands in the project area
(see previous analysis). Design and mitigation measures have been developed to avoid adversely
impacting wetlands wherever possible, or to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the
values of wetlands (Chapter 2).
Alternative 2 is expected to impact 30.6 acres of the existing 52.5 acres of wetlands during
construction, and create 42 acres of wetlands. Following implementation, the expected wetland
area would be 64.1 acres, which would be a total net gain of 11.6 acres of wetlands in the
long term.
The Forest would apply for a joint Clean Water Act Section 404 – Stream Alteration Permit and
apply actions or monitoring as required.
Idaho Forest Practices Act
The Idaho Forest Practices Act regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest
practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (IDAPA 20.02.01).
The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho State Water Quality Standards. The

Cultural Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section describes the potential effects to known cultural resources that are eligible, or
potentially eligible, for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a result of
implementing the proposed action. These two categories of sites, by law, require management
protection or mitigation and are hereinafter referred to as historic properties. Cultural properties
include things and places that demonstrate evidence of human occupation or activity related to
history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and culture. Historic properties, as defined by 36
CFR 800, the implementing regulations of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA; 16
USC 470 et seq.), are a subset of cultural properties that consists of any district, site, building,
structure, artifact, ruin, object, work of art, or natural feature important in human history that
meets defined eligibility criteria for the NRHP.
The types of historic properties on the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests are varied and
reflect the type of use, and pattern of use, humans have employed across what is now the Forests
for thousands of years. Locally, historic properties may include, but are not limited to,
archaeological sites, historic buildings and structures, trails, wagon roads, bridges, mining
features, rock art, cairns, traditional cultural properties, historic landscapes, communication lines,
historic trash middens, and backcountry airstrips. Historic properties are by nature nonrenewable, and are generally unable to recover from adverse effects.
The geographic and social scope of the analysis for cultural properties is the area of potential
effects (APE). The APE “means the geographic area or areas within which an undertaking may
directly or indirectly cause alterations in the character or use of historic properties, if any such
properties exist. The area of potential effects is influenced by the scale and nature of an
undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by the undertaking.”
(36 CFR 800.16(d)) In this section, APE is also referred to as project area.
Area of Potential Effects
The APE is the lower approximate 2 miles of the Crooked River Valley bottom.
Cumulative Effects Area
The cumulative effects area is the same as the APE.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
The project area (except for extremely steep slopes) was methodologically surveyed utilizing
15-meter-wide, pedestrian transects (or less) (Desert West Environmental 2013).
Per 36 CFR 60.4, in order for cultural properties to be eligible for (or remain eligible for)
inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places they must retain integrity and meet one of
four evaluation criteria:
a) Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
b) Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) Embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction;
or
d) Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
Given the NRHP evaluation criteria, the following indicator was used in analysis of effects of the
alternatives on cultural properties:
•

Would characteristics that qualify historic properties for the National Register of Historic
Places be adversely affected (irretrievably lost)? (Yes/No)

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Gold was discovered near present day Elk City, Idaho, in 1861. Miners immediately dispersed
into the surrounding mountains and developed claims. These workings resulted in tens of
thousands of mining features being located across the greater Red River Ranger District (and
beyond). Successive waves, “booms,” and mining strikes resulted in the construction of
additional features or the reworking of previously existing mining features. Today, the remains
of these activities can be seen in the form of stamp mills, ditches, prospects, adits, hand-placer
piles, dredge piles, habitation features, structures, can-dumps, trails, roads, and resulting artifact
scatters. The Crooked River Valley possesses all of these site types. Perhaps best known of
these features are the dredge piles along the Crooked River. They are considered one of the best
examples of dredge mining technology remaining in Central Idaho.
Recreation along the Crooked River has also been a popular past-time for decades. This activity
has resulted in the construction of formal campgrounds, dispersed campsite development, and
related archaeological components.
Affected Environment
Four cultural properties are found within the project area, with characteristics spanning a wide
range throughout the National Register integrity/evaluation criteria continuum (see Table 3-31).
One of these properties (site SHC-32) is considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. As a

No historic properties associated with American Indian use and settlement of the landscape exist within the project areas. This

with this use have likely been masked or otherwise removed by historic mining activity prevalent throughout the greater
project areas.

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would have no impact on one historic property (site SHC-32) of the
project area.
Alternative 2 would remove the dredge tailings (site SHC-32) along 2 miles of the lower
Crooked River. These tailings are perhaps the best example of bucket-line dredge mining
technology found in Central Idaho and therefore are an important historical resource. The
tailings resulted from extensive dredging operations conducted by the H&H Mining Company,
which operated a Yuba-manufactured dredge (locally referred to as the Mount Vernon dredge)
along the lower Crooked River from 1938–1942. The dredge piles of the lower 2 miles are
morphologically distinct. Their U-shaped pattern reflects the technology employed by bucketline dredges, which pivot around a central anchor-spud. The resulting architecture of the dredge
piles is directly reflective of this unique mining technology. These historical features are
important to not only understanding a given mining technology and its associated engineering,
but also reflect and convey business histories, commerce and trade, and regional/local
economics. The historic features are also related to larger world events. The H&H Mining
Company was forced to cease operations on the Crooked River by order of the War Production
Board in 1942. Gold mining was declared non-essential to the war effort and its labor force
dispersed to other industries deemed more important in defeating the Axis Powers of World
War II.

Alternative 2 would adversely (irretrievably) affect the National Register characteristics of site
SHC-32 (see Table 3-32). Mitigation would thus be required to ameliorate this adverse effect
(36 CFR 800.6(a)), as described below (see Chapter 2 for a full list of design and mitigation
measures). A Forest Plan amendment would also be needed to allow this adverse effect to occur
to the historic property (see Appendix D).

Meets definition of historic property, defined in 36 CFR 800.16(l)(1).

To mitigate for the irretrievable effect to site SHC-32, the following design and mitigation
measures would be employed:
•

•

•

•

•

Thoroughly photograph, document, and map historic dredge piles that are proposed for
removal (design and mitigation measure 42). This would create a formal record of the
historic property such that it can be studied and measured, thus ensuring the resource’s
ability to convey information related to dredge mining once the resource is removed.
Retain a representative sample of dredge piles for public interpretation (design and
mitigation measure 39). Retention of a small portion of the dredge piles ensures that the
visiting public can interact with the actual resource and tangibly understand their form
and function through a first-person experience.
Construct a three-panel educational kiosk in the Meanders to inform the public of the
history of the Crooked River Valley (design and mitigation measure 40). This would
educate the public as to the greater historical context associated with dredge mining along
the Crooked River.
Record the historic Gnome Village (design and mitigation measure 43). This is offsite
mitigation meant to enhance a resource that would not be affected by the project, but is
nonetheless languishing along the Crooked River. The Gnome village site is a
Depression-era hamlet built to support the Gnome Mine, which operated from about
1932–1937. The village is structurally in poor shape and its formal recording is crucial to
understanding the architecture and function of this “company-town.” Enhancement of
the Gnome village would help mitigate impacts of the project on the dredge piles because
the two resources share a similar historical theme, timeframe, and geographic scope.
Perform a social business history related to the economic contribution historic dredge
mining operations made to the local Central Idaho economy (design and mitigation
measure 44). This would promote understanding of the economic value of historic
mining activities to local rural economies such as Elk City, Idaho.

Cumulative Effects

Historic properties of the greater project areas date to perhaps 1861, but many of these older sites
have been destroyed by subsequent mining activity. The last temporally significant wave of

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Cultural Resources

3-125

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

mining within the Crooked River Valley occurred during the Great Depression. Thus, many of
the sites date from as recent as the 1930s.
The timeframe for determination of cumulative effects is circa 1938 to hundreds of years into
the future.
Past Actions

Historic mining activity has greatly altered the landscape. Evidence of American Indian use of
the landscape along with early mining features have nearly all been removed/altered by
subsequent mining actions. Recreation activity and all-terrain vehicle use has deflated
(flattened) dredge piles. Use of the dredge pile gravels for road maintenance activity has also
altered this historic landscape. Additionally, artifact collecting has removed vast amounts of
scientific data from historic mining sites. Natural events have also affected the historic
landscape. Wildland fire has burned historic properties within the greater project area, periodic
flooding and its associated erosion has affected streamside sites, and wind-throw events have
displaced historic features and artifacts as root wads were upended.
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would retain one historic property (site SHC-32) of the project area and it would
continue to exist in its current form. These dredge tailings could persist for hundreds of years.
Some deflation could occur as recreationists climb/drive over the dredge piles. Soil would
slowly build upon them, supporting a larger amount of vegetation and thus somewhat masking
their extent, form and outline. Wind-throw events could slowly displace dredge piles as root
wads are upended, deforming the once recognizable and morphologically distinct features.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 would have direct and indirect adverse effects to one historic property (site
SHC-32). This alternative would immediately and irretrievably remove virtually the entirety of
the historic property (SHC-32) from the landscape, which is the best example of bucket-line
dredge mining technology found in central Idaho. This action would adversely (irretrievably)
affect the National Register characteristics of site SHC-32; however, the application of design
and mitigation measures 39, 40, 42, 43, and 44 would ameliorate this adverse effect (36 CFR
800.16(a)) and therefore would have no cumulative effect.
Ongoing and Foreseeable Future Actions

Ongoing and foreseeable future actions include recreation, vandalism, artifact collecting,
wildland fire events, fire suppression actions, and natural decay. Within the project area, the
proposed Orogrande Community Protection project would have no adverse effect on historic
properties, and therefore would have no cumulative effect.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The Idaho State Historic Preservation Officer has concurred with the suitability and merit of the
mitigation measures proposed for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. For
additional details on the effectiveness of these measures, see Direct and Indirect Effects (above).

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with the Forest Plan’s forestwide and management area standards for
cultural resources (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-22 and II-23), except for protection of
historic property #SHC-32. A Forest Plan amendment is proposed under the 1982 Planning Rule
for Forestwide Standards #2 and 4 and Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource Standard #4
(see Appendix D). Full details on consistency with the Forest Plan are located in the project
record.
All landforms having a high probability for historic property locations have been surveyed for
the presence of cultural resources. No American Indian related sites are known to be located
within the project area. Government-to-Government and staff-to-staff consultation has occurred
with the Nez Perce Tribe. All cultural properties within the APE have been evaluated for their
National Register eligibility, with one site identified. Measures meant to recover significant
values of site SHC-32 are described above in Direct and Indirect Effects. All landforms having a
high probability for historic property locations have been surveyed for the presence of cultural
resources and their conditions documented.
Other Laws and Regulations
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (16 USC 470; as amended) requires
federal agencies to take into account their actions on historic properties. The required regulatory
review of effects resulting from federal undertakings is found in Section 106 of the Act, and has
been codified in 36 CFR 800 Part B. The mitigation proposed for site SHC-32 meets the intent
of the NHPA when the Idaho Historic Preservation Officer concurs on the proposed
mitigation package.

addresses these limitations.
Analysis and Cumulative Effects Areas
The analysis area includes the footprint of the restoration project to evaluate direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects, approximately 115 acres.
The timeframe used to consider effects from past activities is the past century, during which
mining and road construction created the need for the current project. Future projects that were
evaluated that could impact this project success were within the next 10 years.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
No changes were made to the Soil Resources Section between the Draft and Final EIS.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Data and analysis were taken from the Design Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), Final Design Report: Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2013a), technical drawings (RDG et al. 2013b), Mining Claim

Rehabilitation Project Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012),
engineering specifications sheets (Great West Engineering 2013), and South Fork Clearwater
River Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998).
A concurrent study on soil impacts from the Orogrande Community Protection project located
upstream from the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project provided information on
existing condition.
Current conditions and potential soil interpretations within the Crooked River Valley project area
were verified during a field visit in spring 2013. Digital information was used from Nez Perce
corporate GIS data layers, including: transportation, streams, terrestrial ecosystem unit (now
SSURGO ID609), watersheds, and project-generated digital information from River Design
Group. Terrain calculations were derived from LiDAR and 10-meter digital elevation models.
The Forest Plan directs to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion when conducting
management activities (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-5). The regional guidelines further
clarify that soil productivity is maintained where lands managed are part of the productive

The intent of the project is to restore the floodplain from a disturbed, non-natural state to a
functional valley bottom. The structure and function of the valley bottom would be improved to
support a natural soil and vegetation environment. The main concerns are the interim
disturbance created by restoration earth-moving activities and the net improvement in soil
productivity at the project conclusion.
The proposed action may change soil properties for hydrologic and biologic function. The
indicators below are used to show the effects from the project and interpret long-term recovery
trends:
A. Improved soil and plant habitat: Percentage of the project area that has improved plant
and soil habitat across project area using factors of plant community composition.
Improvements to soil physical, chemical, and biological function will be qualitatively
discussed.
B. Detrimental soil disturbance (acres or percentage).
C. Forest Plan Amendment (Yes/No).
Indicator A: Improved soil and plant habitat
This indicator shows the changes to soil and plant environment from the restoration project.
Terminology in the Forest Service guidance documents refer to no net loss in productivity
(USDA Forest Service 1987a, USDA Forest Service 1999a). Production itself measures annual
yield or the amount of carbon fixed per annum (Grier et al. 1989). However, the restoration
action’s objective is to re-establish a dynamic system in which the plant and soil associations
depend on the proximity to the river. Frequently flooded areas have shallow soils from annual
scouring by water. In contrast, elevated riverine terraces have only periodic flooding at 2- to
50-year frequencies, depending on height and proximity to river. The time between flooding
events on these terraces allows for vertical soil development and a wider suite of plant and
soil communities.
For the purposes of this project, productivity in the strictest sense as yield does not represent a
good measure of success; frequently flooded areas are natural but have poor production per
square unit area when compared to elevated river terraces. Thus, the merits of the project will be
evaluated based on the extent to which the project develops the site into a natural floodplain
environment. Factors of desired geomorphic surfaces and the improved soil physical, chemical,
and biological components will be evaluated. Since soil and vegetation communities are
coupled, the desired plant groups will be used as an indicator to compare to existing groups.

Indicator B: Detrimental soil disturbance
Soil standards in the Nez Perce Forest Plan specify management to maintain a minimum of
80 percent of an activity in a non-detrimental condition (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-22).
These standards address impairments by land management activities such as timber harvest using
measures of the extent and degree of disturbance. Detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) is a
standard measure used to evaluate the impact of these management actions whereby long-term
reductions in soil productivity could occur. Detrimental disturbance is defined by indications of
erosion, compaction, displacement, rutting, severe burning, loss of organic matter, and soil mass
movement. Management actions on the Nez Perce National Forest (NPNF) must comply with
the Forest Plan standards; thus, this analysis documents the amount of detrimental disturbance
resulting from the restoration activities. The NPNF standards apply to the Meanders project
since this is part of the productive landbase. These standards do not apply to the Narrows Road
project since the road prism has an administrative purpose and therefore is not part of the
productive landbase.
Indicator C: Forest Plan Amendment
Indicator C evaluates the need to amend the Nez Perce Forest Plan. An amendment is proposed
that would exempt the Crooked River Rehabilitation project from the Forest Plan’s Soil
Standard #2. The goal of the Forest Plan is to establish standards to comply with the National
Forest Management Act and the Multiple Use Act. Soil Standard #2 prevents permanent
impairment to productivity by limiting the amount of detrimental disturbance from management
actions. However, the standard does not provide for activities intended to restore productivity on
areas that were degraded by prior historical activities such as mining. The Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project intends to restore the floodplain and, thus, improve productivity.
Additional analysis is provided in Appendix D.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Physical Setting
The project is planned along the valley bottom of a deep set canyon. The sideslopes have steep
pitches of 50% to 70% slopes formed by metasediment bedrock. Colluvium forms thin mantles
over the bedrock on steep slopes and collects in draws and concavities, but overall slopes have
bedrock close to the surface. Warm aspects and areas of recent failure expose these bedrock
surfaces. Soil and vegetation development is highest where slope material accumulates on cool
aspects that have abundant water and may also contain remnant loess from volcanic ash
deposition.
The underlying geology structurally controls the slope topography and sets up the steep slope
pitches. The metasediments exposed on canyon are biotite schist and gneiss of the Elk City
metamorphic sequence that were most recently uplifted from the Idaho batholith pluton (75 to
100 Ma) (Lewis et al. 1990). These metasediments form a cap over the batholith which lies just

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

below the valley bottom surface of the Crooked River. A 285-foot-deep well drilled to sample
groundwater at the mouth of the Crooked River penetrated mostly granite bedrock from the
Idaho batholith (Mann and Lindern 1988). Thus, the Meanders section of Crooked River
overlies an impermeable bedrock surface that resists downcutting – at least in the near term of
thousands of years.
The geologic uplift is important since this started the sequence of canyon development which
frames the larger context of how and when material from the sideslopes erodes into the valley
bottom. The uplift and subsequent downcutting by the stream set up very steep slopes that
contribute sediment in only rare events of mass wasting.
Over millennia, faults formed by the geologic uplift get exploited by streams and thus advance
the development of canyons. The degree of strata movement is extensive, as evidenced by
upturned metasediments and the density of faults. The Meanders and Orogrande valley segments
of the Crooked River both follow north-to-northeast-trending faults. However, the Narrows
section of road has an eastern trend where the river “jogs” from a northeastern fault to a more
direct north-trend fault. This east orientation runs counter to the regional fault trend, which
might explain why the Narrows has exceptionally steep canyon slopes and narrow canyon width
when compared to the upstream and downstream segments.
The geomorphic sequence that contributes to valley fill is a result of rare climatic events. At
least in the recent 10,000 years, the evidence for natural erosion is rare outside of pulse climate
events that trigger debris flows (Kirchner et al. 2001). In the Crooked River setting, canyons and
particularly side draws, contribute sediment pulses from debris flows where upslopes experience
large-scale losses to vegetation from wildfire succeeded by major storm events (Meyer et al.
2001, Wondzell and King 2003). In the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests area, storms
and/or the sequence of storms that produce the level of saturation needed to start debris flows
appear to occur every 20 to 30 years, with substantial events occurring in 1945, 1975, and 1996
(McClelland et al. 1997). In the Lolo Creek area, there is evidence suggesting that a very large
storm event produced substantial floodplain deposits following the 1910-era wildfires based on
peak flow events in 1912 and examination of streamside terraces.
The debris flow deposits are redistributed along the valley bottom and integrated into the
floodplain by seasonal flooding. The factors of sediment size and texture, access to year-long
water, and annual exposure to floodwaters dictate the distribution of plants and soil communities.
Stable uplands outside the influence of Crooked River have conifer communities that grade
down in elevation to sedge and riparian shrub communities along the primary floodplain.
Mining activity
One of the primary needs for the project is to correct the arrangement of the valley bottom fill to
accommodate a natural flooding and deposition regime. The valley bottom was altered by
historic placer mining that took place from the 1930s through the 1950s (USDA Forest Service

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

1998 and 2005). Mining activities sifted the valley bottom material, releasing fines and leaving
rubble piles behind a dredge. Gold and silver mining affected 6 miles of the river across
200 acres (RDG 2012). The coarse cobble-sized dredge piles reach over 30 feet above the
primary floodplain, which no longer functions as a natural alluvial floodplain (RDG et al. 2012).
Despite the yearly high flow volumes, the dredge pilings have remained in situ except for a
1980s rehabilitation project that improved the channel connectivity to the dredge ponds.
Mine tailing have potential issues with soil and water contamination from heavy metals and
arsenic. In preparation for the 1980s channel rehabilitation work, the Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality commissioned several investigations to monitor dissolved and total metal
content and perform bioassays using 1-year-old steelhead and Chinook salmon (Baldigo 1986,
Mann and Von Lindern 1988). Testing took place in ponds and channel sections distributed
throughout the proposed Meanders project area to establish existing conditions. In addition, a
pilot project analyzed the metal content in response to moving the tailings.
For the existing conditions, the studies found that water samples had metal contents within
expected ranges using reference data from Red River, the American River, Deadwood Creek,
and Newsome Creek and comparing to EPA 95% thresholds. The metal contents in sediment
samples were also below the EPA’s established 95% threshold values.
Results from the pilot study found that moving the tailings produced short-term iron levels over
the 95% threshold for total iron but not for dissolved iron. The hazard was considered low since
total iron is bioavailable and the effect was short term.
Meanders soil and plant habitat
The Crooked River Enhancement Project in the 1980s increased the connectivity of the channel
to ponds and introduced riparian vegetation where possible. However, the floodplain remains
vastly departed both functionally and structurally for a typical alluvial valley form for this
setting. The Design Criteria Report (RDG et al. 2012) outlines how the current tailing piles do
not accommodate the various flows that refresh floodplains nutrients and sediment. The report
lists the limiting factors as (1) lack of floodplain connectivity, (2) the tailings create a
preponderance of coarse, well-drained substrates, (3) widespread distribution of reed canary
grass, (4) heavy browse and herbivory that selects for certain vegetation success, and
(5) recreation impacts that damage vegetation and introduce weeds (RDG 2012, p. 24).
The lack of a widespread floodplain has hindered the re-establishment of the desired species
since the valley bottom does not have the array of wetlands and terraces. The coarse cobble and
rock-sized tailings create a difficult growing medium for forb, grass, and shrub species with
insufficient water holding capacity. Likewise, the droughty conditions hinder soil development.
In a natural environment, the connection with seasonal flooding provides fine sediments that
bootstrap riparian growth with propagules, seeds, organic matter. The sediment amends soil
physical function by increasing water holding capacity and provides a substrate for seedlings to

take hold. Most of the current valley bottom remains outside the influence of seasonal flooding,
which explains why 70 years after mining disturbance the major vegetation form remains
upland conifer.
Indicator A: Improved soil and plant habitat

River Design Group et al. (2012) inventoried project vegetation and grouped the vegetation into
categories. Table 3-33 shows the distribution of vegetation forms. The columns display the
relative amount of desired vegetation groups across the area for the existing condition and the
action alternative (Alternative 2). The direct actions of the project would establish the functional
characteristics needed to return the site towards what is expected. The Meanders would need
several years of regrowth and an influx of sediment and seed source to fully reach the desired
conditions. Figure 3-25 displays a floodplain segment to illustrate the difference in the array of
vegetation between the existing and the desired conditions.

Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would not improve the current soil and plant habitat since the
Meanders does not have a functioning valley bottom.
Alternative 2 would meet the purpose and need by restoring the geomorphology of the valley
bottom to grow and redevelop into the desired diversity of plant and soil habitat.
Vegetation relies on physical, biological, and chemical soil properties for growth. Alternative 2
lays the foundation to rebuild these soil functional properties. The alternative would overcome
the current limitations for plants, including poor access to water and nutrients from floodflows,
poor water holding capacity, and insufficient growth substrate in the tailings.
Geomorphic forms

The action alternative (Alternative 2) would use three geomorphic forms that consist of primary
floodplain, upland floodplain, and upland to rebuild the valley bottom. The streamflow
disturbance interval for these forms corresponds to flooding at 1.5 years (Q1.5), 25 years (Q25),
and 500 years (Q500). Table 3-34 outlines the type and general extent of the geomorphic forms
compared to the current extent.

The primary floodplain would have similar soil physical properties to the current floodplain, but
the areal extent would expand substantially from 27.6 to 43.1 acres (see Figure 3-25). Soils are
coarse grained with layers of silt, sand, gravel, cobble, and rock from riverwash. Soil drainage is
well drained to excessively well drained, but with shallow access to the water table and localized
saturated conditions. The wider low-elevation floodplain would also increase lateral flow from
the channel.
Soil chemical and biological properties on the primary floodplain would advance as yearly
flooding deposits nutrients and sediments and alder establishes. Alder is a nitrogen-fixing
species well suited for this primary successional environment.
Uplands floodplain habitat represents a small portion of the project area at only 2.5 acres. Soils
on the upland floodplain would experience infrequent flooding and develop shallow and

Final Environmental Impact Statement

moderate depths to support a wide array of grass, forb, shrub, and trees. The soil physical
properties would be restored by limiting elevations to less than 4 feet above the river bankfull
elevation. This low elevation ensures access to the water table by mesic (water loving) shrubs
and trees. The soils would be amended with a wood chips and organic material to increase water
holding capacity since seasonal moisture deficits in the topsoil could occur. The biological and
chemical soil properties of the upland floodplain would develop incrementally over time as the
plants and soil colonize the site.
The uplands would be retained where possible since restoring soils in these environments takes
much longer than on the areas near water. The uplands rarely experience flooding and thus have
an inherently stable environment where soils develop vertically, in situ, over long periods of
time. As Table 3-34 shows, Alternative 2 would result in a net decrease in uplands from
15.6 acres to 13.8 acres. Construction would excavate tailings on the east side, but would leave
the west side river bank due to natural conditions. The biological and chemical properties of the
constructed uplands would develop incrementally as the plants and soil colonize the site.
One of the current limitations to vegetation is the lack of water and poor substrate for rooting.
The soil mix used in the upland floodplain and uplands bolsters water holding capacity with fine
sediment and organic matter. The soil medium relies on salvaged soil on site, mixed with finetextured fill, and organics from salvaged sod and vegetation residue. An estimated 17,346
cubic yards of soil would be salvaged and re-used on the project (RDG et al. 2013a, p. 75). The
soil medium would provide at least 12-inch topsoil depth and cover 50% of the area for the
upland floodplain and upland. Additional mulch using woody debris residue from the Orogrande
Community Protection project would be applied to the surface and mixed into the topsoil.
The project would advance the growth of soil and vegetation communities by bootstrapping the
site with sod that contains soil microbes for recolonization. The rooting zone is considered a
partnership among plants, soil microbes, and the soil substrate (Clapperton 2006). Plants rely on
soil microbes to access water and nutrients, while providing secretions and residues that
microbes use as a food source. An example is that all conifers have obligate relations with
ectomycorrhizae fungi to access nutrients (Horton et al. 1999). Within the upland and primary
floodplains, Alternative 2 would establish microsites that increase the diversity of soil and
vegetation habitat. Microsites include wetlands in addition to large aggregations of wood debris.
Functionally, the application increases the surface roughness to lend stability. The microsites
also provide unique habitat for wetland soils to develop and cool, moist areas for mesic soil and
plants. The swales trap seed and organic matter from passing flows and the coarse wood
provides shade that conserves moisture and stimulates overall soil development (RDG et al.
2013a, p. 68).
Large woody debris and wood chips would be distributed throughout the site and are considered
key elements for productivity (Harvey et al. 1987, Graham et al. 1994). These materials act as a
microsite and can provide biological recovery. Root crowns and roots are major foci for

microbial activity (Egerton-Warbuton 2005, Molina et al. 2011), and leaving green trees can
inoculate soils for regenerating seedlings.
Habitat diversity

Table 3-33 displays the current vegetation composition compared to the desired condition.
Figure 3-25 shows the contrast in diverse desired alder, shrub, and sedge communities to the
distribution of tailings that currently dominate the site. The greatest change from the action
alternative would be an alder increase from 1.8 to 51%. The amount of conifer would be halved
from current extent; also mesic forb meadows and reed canary grass/cattail communities would
be replaced with vegetation that is expected for this particular stream setting.
The reconstruction of the valley bottom would increase habitat diversity by providing for side
channels, alcoves, floodplain depressions, floodplain swales, side channel wetlands, and slope
wetlands (Figure 3-25). The provision for wetland communities would lead to a net gain in
palustrian shrub scrub from 1.7 to 34.3 acres (see Geum Environmental Consulting 2012).
Invasive species

The current conditions include abundant reed canary grass along the streams and within several
wetland areas. The action alternative avoids spreading reed canary grass by not using sod for
surface planting from infected areas. Following implementation, monitoring would be done to
detect invasive and noxious weeds, including reed canary grass. The weeds would be treated
using already approved measures (USDA Forest Service 1988a).
Weeds are a concern for the project since so much area is being returned to primary successional
conditions. Weeds are well suited for these disturbed conditions with opportunistic growth
strategies to quickly occupy sites where abundant sunlight, water, and nutrients are available
(James et al. 2010). Newly disturbed soils are characterized as having small periods of high
nutrient availability that favors forb or grass species that can grow quickly (Eviner and Firestone
2007). As the riparian and valley bottom establishes, the initial nutrient flush should decrease
and shade from overstory tree and shrub species would lessen the risk for weeds. Using the
estimate from River Design Group et al. (2013a) for alder regrowth on the floodplain, the risk
should be low after 10 years on the primary and upland floodplain. However, on the slowergrowth upland environments, the risk may extend longer.
Cumulative Effects

The action alternative would almost completely rework the valley bottom to rehabilitate past
conditions from mining dredge work. Trampling or compaction of soils may reduce
rehabilitation success adjacent to recreational sites. The project mitigates this potential impact
by designated staging sites in areas that are already compacted.

Indicator B: Detrimental soil disturbance
Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects

Alternative 1 would not result in any additional detrimental soil disturbance. The current River
Design Group estimate of the project area is 65 percent detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) based
on the need for restoration. The current conditions have persistent infertile growing conditions
of the tailings and lack the expected plant and soil habitat. The estimate is derived from the
comparison of the project area (115 acres) versus the amount of area that needs restoration
(74.8 acres).
Alternative 2. The Meanders is managed as part of the productive landbase and thus was
evaluated for long-term impact to productivity using Nez Perce Forest Plan standards.
Substantial earthwork is needed to excavate and transport the tailings into a valley form that
functions properly in order to restore the valley bottom. Approximately 65 percent of the project
area would be impacted by construction equipment. Figure 3-26 illustrates the elevation changes
needed to reconstruct the geomorphic forms for a river section. The red coloration indicates
excavation while the blue coloration shows the degree of fill needed. Much of the red
corresponds to tailings piles. The complete displacement, translocation, and re-dispersal qualify
as DSD using Nez Perce Forest Plan standards (USDA Forest Service 1987a) and Region 1 Soil
Quality Guidelines (USDA Forest Service 1999a).

(RDG et al. 2013b, p. 25).

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

3-138

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The application of the Nez Perce Forest Plan standards requires an assessment of the extent of
DSD across a project area compared to the 20 percent threshold value where long-term
productivity could occur. The existing condition is 65 percent and, thus, conducting
management activities would exceed the 20 percent threshold in the Forest Plan’s Standard #2.
However, management activities would meet Region 1 Soil Quality Guidelines.
The disparity between the NPNF and the Region 1 Soil Quality Guidelines is the ability to
restore productivity on severely impaired soils. The Regional guidelines state:
In areas where more than 15 percent detrimental soil conditions exist from prior
activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from project implementation and
restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and
should move toward a net improvement in soil quality. (USDA 1999, p. 2)
The restoration actions would lead to a net improvement for soil productivity by reducing the
level of DSD to levels below the existing conditions in the first year after implementation.
Table 3-35 shows the gradual soil recovery over time, depending on plant group and location. In
the first-year recovery, the site would move from the current condition of 65 percent to
48 percent DSD with channel restoration and the bare fluvial soils put in place. Soils would
recover physical function very quickly for all geomorphic forms. Chemical and biological soil
functions would recover most quickly in the floodplain habitat where adequate water promotes
the accrual of organic matter. In the uplands, lack of water and slower growth would create a
longer term for recovery.
River Design Group et al. (2013a, p. 28) estimated alder stands would establish within 10 years
on the primary floodplain, and the upland spruce and conifer groups would take 20 years. By
10 years the DSD would be down to 13 percent with alder securing the primary floodplain and
incremental soil development on the uplands. At 20 years, the DSD would be at 4 percent as the
upland recovery continues.

Indicator C: Forest Plan Amendment
Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects

Alternative 1 would retain the existing Nez Perce Forest Plan standards. No amendment to the
Forest Plan is proposed.
Alternative 2 proposes an amendment to the Nez Perce Forest Plan to address restoration actions
(see Appendix D for details). The main purpose for the amendment is to enable active
restoration actions. The amendment would exempt the Crooked River Rehabilitation project
from Forest Plan – Soil Standard #2. The goals of the Nez Perce Forest Plan soil standards are to
prevent substantial and permanent impairment to productivity. Soil Standard #2 controls against
management activities further degrading a site. However, the standard does not provide for
restoration of productivity for severely degraded soils. The exemption of Standard #2 would
allow for the restoration activities to improve soil productivity from 65 percent DSD currently to
48 percent in the first year after implementation and 4 percent in 20 years.
Other Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects – Flooding Risk

No adverse cumulative effects were identified for the action alternative or for the potential
Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. The road would continue to receive use as a
main thoroughfare or reduced traffic trail. The future Crooked River Narrows Road
Improvement project could reduce flooding risk over time.
Cumulative Effects – Mass Movement

No past or ongoing activities would increase mass movement along the Narrows for the action
alternative or for the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. Ongoing
activities of road repair and maintenance are administrative and occur within the current road
prism. The road was initially constructed in the late 1800s. Although frequent washouts have
occurred, no evidence of hillslope failure triggered from the road construction activities or
placement was found.
Planned prescribed burning as part of the Orogrande Community Protection project poses a risk
to the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project since the burning can result
in loss of groundcover. The burning could occur within the next 5 to 10 years depending on
suitable burn windows. The effect would be from slope cutting and thus after the Narrows work
is complete. The potential risk is low since the Orogrande project would prescribe burn at low
intensity. The burning takes place on the west-facing slopes along 2.5 miles of the Narrows
(milepost 3.5 to 6.0). The project specifically addresses mass wasting risk by avoiding
concentrated burning in large expanse concave draws, high-intensity burning that removes all
groundcover. A mosaic burn pattern is planned that would moderate potential runoff effects.
The five roadcuts for road widening after milepost 4.0 have planned prescribed burning on the
hillslopes above. The road cut with high risk for cutslope failure is outside the burn areas.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
The following design and mitigation measures are to be implemented for the action alternative
(Alternative 2) for the project. The measures are specified in full in Chapter 2, Design and
Mitigation Measures.
Erosion Control
The following design and mitigation measures related to erosion control are to be implemented
for Alternative 2: #1, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 19, 25, 26, 46, and 49.
The erosion control plan ensures coordination between the Forest Service and contractor to
reduce offsite sediment and erosion. This is BMP CP 15.03 in the Region 1 and 4 Soil
Conservation Handbook (USDA Forest Service 1988b), which was adopted to comply with the
Clean Water Act (also see BMP Fac-2 and AqEco-2 in the Forest Service National Core BMPs
[USDA Forest Service 2012]). Newly constructed or disturbed surfaces have surface runoff as
the dominant erosion mechanism for this scale of activity (Lane et al. 1997). Runoff is reduced
by dispersing runoff with groundcover and shaping the surface, and by preserving the soil’s
capacity to take in precipitation.
Design and mitigation measures 9 and 13 rely on groundcover as a means to reduce erosion. The
measures tier to BMPs CP 11.03, 13.01, and 13.04 (USDA Forest Service 1988b) and National
Core BMPs Fac-2, Fac-10, Road-3, Road-6, and Veg-2 (USDA Forest Service 2012).
Groundcover is commonly used to reduce erosion for road bases and reclaimed soil areas. The
effectiveness depends on the slope and infiltration capacity of the soil. For roadsides where fill
provides poor infiltration, grasses disperse runoff but the infiltration capacity remains reduced.
However, rock and organic mulch both protect the surface and reduce the generation of overland
flow. The Water Erosion Prediction Project models illustrate the effectiveness with percent rock
and vegetation as primary inputs (Elliot et al. 1999). An annual rye is used since this this grass
grows quickly and binds soil with roots. The vegetation reduces the incidence for rill forming by
minimizing the expanse of bare soil that can generate runoff. Measure 10 increases efficiency by
emphasizing use onsite materials. Measure 26 indirectly bolsters erosion control since weeds
tend to be single-stemmed forbs that do not create as effective groundcover as grasses (Lacey et
al. 1989).
Measures 13, 46, and 49 effectively reduce erosion by avoiding compaction and rutting that can
occur when machines operate in saturated conditions. Soil strength decreases substantially
during wet saturated conditions and operation (NCASI 2004). Saturated conditions increase
runoff incidence since soils lack capacity to take in precipitation.
Measure 10 shapes the constructed surfaces to reduce rill and gully formation from concentrated
water flow. The effectiveness is proven as a core design concept for constructing road surfaces
to shed water.

plants and soils have adapted to the local climate conditions. Measure 17-18 increases the site
capacity to support desired vegetation, as demonstrated by local road decommissioning
monitoring and research (Conners 2003, Lloyd et al. 2013). However, the disturbed conditions
favor establishment of noxious weeds that would compete with and exclude desired vegetation.
The exclusion of opportunistic weed species is critical to allow for desired vegetation to take
hold. Measures 25, 26, 28, and 33 select for desired plant species using a combination of
preventive and control measures. The effectiveness would depend greatly on the ability for
follow-up treatment. Mitigation measure #19 provides essential groundcover that adds organic
matter while retaining moisture for desired vegetation to take hold.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
This section describes the guidance for managing soils on the NPNF (USDA Forest Service
1987a). The action alternative would comply with the amended Nez Perce Forest Plan using the
determinations for detrimental soil disturbance. The project would lead to a net improvement in
detrimental soil condition and thus complies with Region 1 Soil Quality Guidelines (USDA
Forest Service 1999a). Full details on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located
in the project record.
The Washington, D.C., soil direction was used to clarify plant and soil function to address
productivity impacts (USDA Forest Service 2010a). The project intends to restore the floodplain
to a more natural state. Using vegetation and soil communities as an indicator, the greatest
improvement would be the expansion of a limited primary flood at 1.8 acres to 51 acres.
The project ultimately complies with the National Forest Management Act. The action
alternative would not produce substantial and permanent impairment of the productivity of the
land. Rather, the activities would lead to a net improvement of soil conditions in the short term
(1 year) and long term (20 years) after implementation.
The following lists how the action alternative meets the requirements of the Nez Perce Forest
Plan Standards, as proposed to be amended:
(1) Soil disturbance evaluation: The EIS displays the effects to soils for DSD.
(2) Soil disturbance thresholds: The project would comply with the Nez Perce Forest Plan
with the amendment that exempts this project from Soil Standard #2. The amendment
would enable the project to improve lands that currently have impaired soil conditions
beyond 20 percent DSD. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would comply
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

3-142

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

with the Region 1 Soil Guidelines by improving the site. The restoration would reduce
DSD from the existing 65 percent to 48 percent in year 1 and down to 4 percent by year
20.
(3) Effective groundcover: The project has design criteria that maintain sufficient ground
cover for the project to reduce erosion on the uplands and upland floodplain where stable
soils are desired. Roughly 60% areal cover is desired. The ground cover would be
obtained from planting and applying wood fiber mulch.
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The Nez Perce National Forest soil quality standards (Forest Plan II-22, USDA Forest Service
1987a) apply to lands in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area. The Forest Plan
directs the NPNF to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion through the application
of BMPs, careful riparian area management, use of fish/water quality drainage objectives, and
soil and water resource improvement projects (p. II-5).
The project would not meet Forest Plan soil quality standard #2, which says, “A minimum of
80 percent of an activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted, displaced, or puddled upon
completion of activities….” Therefore, an amendment to the Forest Plan is proposed (see
Appendix D). Full details on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the
project record.
Region 1 Soil Direction
Regional direction is available from the Region 1 Forest Service Manual for Soil Management
(FSM 2500-99-1, USDA Forest Service 1999a), referred to as R1 Soil Quality Standards. The
analysis standards address basic elements for the soils resource: (1) soil productivity (including
soil loss, porosity, and organic matter), and (2) soil hydrologic function. The soil productivity
direction identifies a value of 15 percent detrimental soil disturbance as a guideline that indicates
potential impairment from project activities. Regional guidance for soil management provides
direction that agency activities should result in a net benefit to soil conditions when past
activities have left detrimental soil disturbance in excess of 15 percent areal extent (USDA
Forest Service 1999a). As noted above (Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws),
the project would comply with Region 1 soil direction.
Washington Office Soil Direction
New direction provided by the Washington Office Forest Service Manual (Chapter 2550, USDA
Forest Service 2010a) addresses impacts to soil function from management activities. Permanent
impairment is defined as detrimental changes in soil properties (physical, chemical, and
biological) that result in the loss of the inherent ecological capacity or hydrologic function of the
soil resource that lasts beyond a land management planning period. The current R1 Manual
direction for soil management centers on minimizing disturbance and limiting the extent of
detrimental soil disturbance from management activities (USDA 1999). Direction for
maintaining site productivity is implicit in the National Forest Management Act (1976), which

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Soil Resources

3-143

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

requires that management “will not produce substantial and permanent impairment of the
productivity of the land.” However, the newly released Washington Office manual (USDA
Forest Service 2010a) takes this beyond a protective role to an active role in recognition that
ecological processes are dynamic. The new manual provides soil management objectives to:
(1) Maintain or restore soil quality on National Forest System lands, and (2) Manage resource
uses and soil resources on National Forest System lands to sustain ecological processes and
function so that desired ecosystem services are provided in perpetuity. Soil quality indicators are
further defined to include factors that provide insight to inherent soil function.
Soil function extends to trees, shrubs, grass, and herb growth, as well as underground
productivity – all attributes of soil productivity (Figure 3-27).
As noted above (Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws), the project would
comply with Washington Office soil direction.

Figure 3-27. Soil quality indicator relationship to soil productivity (from 2020 WO
FSM Chap. 2550).
National Forest Management Act
The National Forest Management Act states, “…timber harvested from National Forest System
lands...only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged.”
Forest plans will “insure…evaluation of the effects of each management system to the end that it
will not produce substantial and permanent impairment of the productivity of the land” [16 USC
1604(g)(3)(C) and 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i)]. As noted above (Consistency with Forest Plan and
Environmental Laws), the project would comply with the Act.

Wildlife Resources
Scope of the Analysis
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project has the potential to affect wildlife species and
their habitats. This section provides an analysis of wildlife species potentially present in the
project area and the effects that proposed activities may have on them or their habitat. For the
purpose of this analysis, wildlife species include endangered, threatened, sensitive species, and
management indicator species.
Analysis Area
The proposed project and direct and indirect effects analysis area consists of 2 miles of stream
restoration. The project boundary extends from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked
River and includes the entire valley bottom. The project area, approximately 115 acres, extends
from 0.1 mile upstream from the mouth of Crooked River (at the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game weir) to approximately 2.0 miles upstream.
Cumulative Effects Area
The area of consideration for cumulative effects for the western toad, gray wolf, harlequin duck,
fisher, moose and pine marten are the lands associated with the project area.
The cumulative effects analysis area for elk is the Forest Plan elk habitat analysis units.
The cumulative effect analysis area for lynx is the lynx analysis
The following changes were made between the Draft and Final EIS for this section and resource:
• Indicator section was updated to present information more clearly.
• The effects analysis was updated based on public comments on the Draft EIS and new
information.
• The status of the wolverine has been changed from a proposed species for listing under
the ESA to a Regional sensitive species for the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forest.
The FWS has found that the wolverine is not warranted for listing under the ESA
(USFWS 2014).
• A Biological Assessment and Biological Evaluation for Threatened, Endangered and
Sensitive wildlife species has been prepared. The report in the project record includes
these analyses.
• No consultation on Threatened and Endangered wildlife species was needed, because
determinations were No Effect to these species.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Analysis of effects for terrestrial wildlife species was completed using comparisons of Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project-related effects relative to the most limiting habitat factors for
each species.
Wildlife observation databases were reviewed to establish the presence of wildlife species in the
project area. The primary reference for information on observations is Idaho Department of Fish
and Game (2010a). Additional information was provided by River Design Group et al. (2012
and 2013a) and Toweill (2011).
Table 3-36 displays each of the federally listed Threatened and Endangered species and Forest
Service Region 1 Sensitive Species that have the potential to occur on the Nez Perce National
Forest, as well as Nez Perce National Forest MIS. Wildlife species and/or their habitat were
evaluated for potential to be affected by the proposed project. Some species were eliminated
from further consideration based on range, lack of habitat, and/or lack of known occurrence in
the analysis area.
Wetlands have been delineated in the project area by Geum Environmental Consulting (2012).
Acres of wetland classifications were used to determine the amount of habitat available for the
western toad and moose (Cowardin et al. 1992).
Elk habitat effectiveness calculations were completed to determine existing elk habitat
conditions (Leege 1984 [same as USDA Forest Service 1987a, Appendix B]).
In addition, peer-reviewed scientific literature and non-peer reviewed literature have been used
as the primary source of information regarding the life histories and habitat requirements of
wildlife species and the effect of natural and human-caused disturbance upon these species.
Resource Indicators
The analysis compares the effects of the alternatives using the following indicators:
• Effects to threatened, endangered, sensitive and management indicator wildlife species and
their habitat
• Western toad: disturbance; acres of breeding and non-breeding habitat
• Gray wolf: disturbance
• Harlequin duck: disturbance; acres of riverine and floodplain habitat
• Fisher: disturbance
• Elk: disturbance; changes in elk habitat effectiveness levels
• Moose: disturbance; aquatic forage habitat
• Marten: disturbance
• Neotropical migratory birds: disturbance; riparian habitat conditions

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Past land management activities, most importantly mining and road construction, have
substantially affected the landscape in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream and
riparian function in the main stem of Crooked River (Appendix C). Fire suppression, mining,
road construction, and timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural processes in the
watershed. The area surrounding Crooked River was mined for mineral resources from the
1900s through the 1950s. Mining waste (also referred to as mine tailings) is concentrated in the
valley bottom, altering the physical condition of the stream system, restricting the natural
migration pattern of the stream and other changes in channel morphology (channel size, form,
and function), and impairing the recolonization of riparian vegetation and its function as a
natural buffer. Road 233 is within the floodplain of Crooked River for approximately 3 miles
through the “Narrows” and 1 additional mile to Relief Creek. The road often floods during high
water events, constricts the river, and contributes sediment to Crooked River. These alterations
have resulted in a reduced area of productive aquatic and terrestrial habitat.
The area is used by many aquatic and terrestrial wildlife species (both rare and common).
Crooked River has been turned upside down due to past dredge mining. These past mining
activities have altered stream and riparian process and altered aquatic and terrestrial vegetation
compared to undisturbed streams. Natural recovery processes from past mining activities has
been slow and the re-colonization of native riparian vegetation has been inhibited on the large
mine tailings. The few trees and other vegetation currently growing on the mine tailings provide
less than desirable wildlife habitat.
Activities associated with Alternative 2 of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
would have short-term disturbance and displacement effects, as well as a temporary loss of
habitat. Overall, the project would result in a long-term improvement in stream and riparian
habitat by restoring and speeding up recovery of an altered stream channel and riparian
vegetation.
Federally Listed Species
The U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) requires the Forest Service
to analyze threatened species for which there may be suitable habitat in a project area. In Idaho
County, the USFWS has indicated that there may be suitable habitat for Canada lynx (Lynx
canadensis).
The Canada lynx was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 2000.
The Nez Perce National Forest is recognized as secondary, unoccupied Canada lynx habitat and
none of the Nez Perce National Forest has been identified as critical habitat by the USFWS
(USDA Forest Service 2007a, p. 3-5; USDA Forest Service 2007b, pp. 7 and 29; USDA Forest
Service and USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2006). The project area is not within lynx habitat
and there is no suitable lynx habitat specifically where project activities would occur. None of
the alternatives propose changes to any vegetation in the project area, and as such lynx habitat
would not be directly or indirectly affected. Mine tailings with little shrub or conifer vegetation

and wetlands consisting of open water and sedge communities are not considered habitat for lynx
or their prey. Even though there is one incidental sighting of lynx within 3 miles of the project
area, there is no evidence of a resident population or breeding females on the Forest. Lynx are
considered to be generally tolerant of human presence and activities and if there were dispersing
or transient lynx in the area at the time of implementation they could easily avoid project
activities by traversing upland forest environments. No anticipated risks of direct mortality or
long-term impacts to the population are expected. Implementation of this project would not
directly or indirectly modify any lynx habitat nor would it pose any direct or indirect threat to
individuals. Therefore, no cumulative effects would be possible with implementation of this
project. Activities associated with the Alternative 2 would have No Effect to lynx or their
habitat.
The project does not contain habitat (cottonwood galleries) for the yellow-billed cuckoo
(Coccyzus americanus), a candidate species; therefore, this species is not analyzed further in
this EIS.
Sensitive Species
The Northern Region Sensitive Species List, which contains those species identified as sensitive
by the Regional Forester, was last updated on February 2011 (USDA Forest Service 2011b).
This section considers those sensitive species (or their habitats) on the list that are known or
suspected to occur on the Nez Perce National Forest within the vicinity of the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area (Table 3-36).
Western Toad
Affected Environment

The analysis area for the western toad is the project area. Western toads use moist areas such as
streams, ponds, and lakes for breeding, foraging, and overwintering habitat. They prefer shallow
areas with mud bottoms and high-temperature areas, often in sites with vegetation present for
breeding. A wide variety of upland habitats are used during non-breeding times. Riparian areas
serve as migratory or dispersal corridors. Important upland habitat structure needed includes
down woody debris where individuals can access moist microhabitats during the hot daytime
summer hours to avoid desiccation.
There are three main types of habitat western toads use throughout the course of a year:
(1) breeding habitat, (2) summer or terrestrial non-breeding habitats, and (3) over-winter
hibernacula (Keinath and McGee 2005). Breeding habitat includes shallow water (<20 cm
[<8 inches]) at the edges of ponds, lakes, streams, river edges where water is pooled or very slow
moving; oxbow ponds; flooded meadows; beaver ponds; reservoirs and quarries; thermal pools
and ponds; and ephemeral pools. The water temperature at breeding sites typically ranges from
15–21°C (59–70°Fahrenheit -F) (Keinath and McGee 2005). In Montana, water temperatures for
breeding may be as low as 7.5°C (45.5 °F), but usually above 9°C (48 °F) (Montana Field Guide

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

2013). The active period for western toads begins in April or May and extends to September or
October (Montana Field Guide 2013). The breeding period is from April to mid-July.
Summer habitats include a diversity of forested and non-forested wet and dry areas. Juvenile and
adult western toads use these summer habitats for foraging, shelter, resting, and dispersal. Toads
prey on anything smaller than they are and that are easy to catch (invertebrates and vertebrates).
Adults and young of the year use terrestrial habitats and wet areas near water as hibernacula.
They use burrows made by small mammals, dig burrows, or over-winter under debris piles (logs
and rocks).
Western toads are known to occur along Crooked River in the part of the project area known as
the Meanders (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012). Juvenile toads have been observed in the
project area in June in wetlands or wet areas near the ponds and in Crooked River. There are
approximately 53 acres of wetland habitat and open water environments (ponds) available to the
western toad as potential breeding habitat (approximately 38 acres identified as breeding and 15
acres identified as non-breeding habitat) (Table 3-38 and Figure 3-28). There are more than 40
permanent and seasonal ponds that may provide breeding habitat for western toads; however, the
toads have been observed breeding in only one of the larger ponds (Geum Environmental
Consulting 2012, p. 31). It is unknown why western toads are not seen breeding in more of the
ponds in the project area, through many of the shallow ponds dry up during the summer. It is
also unknown if western toads use the main channel of Crooked River for breeding. Except for
only one or two of the ponds, it is assumed that the ponds are not connected to each other, nor
are they connected to the stream. The rubble (tailing piles) left from past mining and the stream
edge do not provide quality cover or overwinter habitat and provide only marginal non-breeding
habitat. Over-winter habitat to burrow in may be currently limited due to the disturbed state of
the stream and floodplain, which consists of larger, loose cobble that does not provide suitable
habitat for the western toad.
There is very little long-term monitoring data for western toad populations in Idaho. Species are
provided a status to show viability of populations. The status is ranged from 1 to 5 (1 being
critically impaired; 5 being secure) and G or S (G- global status and S- state status). The western
toad is apparently secure (G4/S4) across its range and in Idaho (Digital Atlas of Idaho 2012
[accessed August 7, 2013]; [G4/S3] NatureServe 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]). Declines in
abundance have been reported throughout the species’ range due to disease and parasites. Based
on a study in north-central Idaho, the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis pathogen is known to
occur on the forest (Goldberg no date). However, this fungal pathogen is not known to occur in
Crooked River.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects

The effects analysis below centers around the western toad. However the effects are the same
for all amphibians encountered during the implementation of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. There would be no direct or indirect effects to western toads or their habitat. The
western toad would continue to occupy the area in the vicinity of the Meanders. It is determined
that there would be No Impact to western toads or their habitat with Alternative 1.
Alternative 2

There would be a reduction of 22 acres of breeding habitat (wetlands) available to western toads
after completion of this project within the Meanders (Table 3-38). More than 40 permanent and
seasonal ponds that may currently provide breeding habitat would be lost during the construction
of the temporary bypass channel and side channel, and rehabilitation/restoration of the
floodplain.
As part of the project design, a minimum of three ponds would be retained, including the ponds
where western toad breeding has been observed. In addition to the three retained ponds, swales
would be constructed in the floodplain and alcoves would be constructed along the stream and
side channels (Table 3-37). The swales or floodplain depressions might have the potential to
hold water for potential breeding sites (RDG et al. 2013b [see Appendix A, Figures A-3, A-4,
and A-5; and Wildlife specialist report – Appendix A]). Slow backwater areas could also
provide potential breeding sites. However, the side channels and the alcoves associated with the
main channel are not expected to provide potential breeding habitat because the timing of
activation of water to flow into the side channels, the duration of water in the side the channel,
and the amount of snowpack each year is expected to change from year to year. If western toads
were able to find appropriate habitat to be able to breed in the side channels and other mainstem
alcoves, there would be a possibility of mortality to egg masses and tadpoles as the water recedes
before metamorphosis could occur.

Figure 3-28. Western toad habitat in project area.
Alternative 2 would restore the stream channel and floodplain and would provide improved
foraging, non-breeding, and over-winter habitat as sediments accumulate and settle across the
valley floor (stream channel and floodplain). A more natural functioning stream channel and
connected floodplain would also allow for easier and safer travel of toads across the floodplain.
Approximately 60 acres of floodplain habitat would be improved by adding woody debris and
implementing the revegetation strategy, which would provide much needed cover and diversity
to the floodplain. Adding woody debris to the floodplain would increase the amount of shelter,
nesting and overwinter habitat available to western toads and reduce the incidence of toads
drying out or mortality by predators while the toads are traversing the area to and from breeding
sites.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

There is potential for western toad mortality, as well as for other amphibians, for all life stages
(adults, egg masses, tadpoles, and juveniles) during construction of the temporary bypass
channel and dewatering/rechanneling of existing open water ponded environments; construction
of the side channel; construction of the temporary bypass road; dewatering of the main Crooked
River channel; dewatering of the temporary bypass channel; regrading/reshaping the valley
bottom, stream channel, and tailing piles; and equipment traffic.
Depending on the water temperature, amphibians may just be starting the breeding cycle when
construction activities begin. Activities would impede western toad breeding activities, crush egg
masses and tadpoles, and cause mortality of tadpoles, juveniles, and adults. Any part of the
breeding cycle that is not captured during aquatic organism salvage operations would result in
the desiccation of eggs, tadpoles, and metamorphosing toadlets, and would result in mortality of
current year’s egg masses and tadpoles and a loss of western toad production for that year. There
is also the potential to lose several years of western toad production due to the loss of potential
breeding sites associated with construction and restoration activities as part of restoring the
Crooked River Meanders. Aquatic organism salvage operations, as described in Chapter 2, are
intended to reduce the loss/mortality of aquatic organisms during construction and
watering/dewatering activities. However, there are also risks of mortality associated with aquatic
organism salvage operations. The risks include, but are not limited to, not being able to capture
all the amphibians through all lifestages, injury during salvage operations, not being able to get
them to a suitable site in a timely manner, or the ability of the various life stages amphibians to
survive the translocation process and adapt to the new location to finish metamorphosis.
Determination of effects for the western toad is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely
to cause trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under
Alternative 2.
Gray Wolf
Affected Environment

The analysis area for the gray wolf is the project area. Three aspects of wolf habitat were
reviewed: security of dens and rendezvous sites, prey base (elk), and security from human
disturbances and harm. The gray wolf occupies diverse habitats, from open meadows to heavily
forested stands. Wolves occupy broad territories and travel extensively in search of prey,
generally medium to large ungulates, especially elk. They are adaptable to human and land
management activity in general, but sensitive to disturbance at denning and rendezvous sites.
Wolves are known to inhabit the project area; however, there are no known den or rendezvous
sites in the project area.
The gray wolf has a global rank of G4/G5 (apparently secure) and an Idaho State ranking of S3
(vulnerable) (NatureServe 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]); S1 (critically imperiled) (Digital
Atlas of Idaho 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. Therefore, there would be no direct or indirect effects to gray wolves or their habitat.
It is determined that there would be No Impact to gray wolves or their habitat under
Alternative 1.
Alternative 2

Gray wolves could be subject to noise disturbance effects under the action alternative
(Alternative 2). Short-term impacts would be limited to displacement of wolves from the project
area if individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Over time, revegetation of the floodplain along the Meanders area would improve habitat (cover
and forage) for prey species.
Determination of effects for the gray wolf is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to
cause trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under
Alternative 2.
Harlequin Duck
Affected Environment

This species is a Nez Perce National Forest sensitive species and an Idaho species of greatest
conservation need (IDFG 2005). Harlequin ducks use swift-flowing mountain streams on the
Forest (IDFG 2005). They feed on benthic macroinvertebrates and use 2nd-order or larger
streams containing reaches with an average gradient of 1–7%, riffle habitat, clear water, gravel to
boulder–sized substrate, and forested bank vegetation.
There have been sightings of harlequin ducks along Crooked River in both the Meanders and
Narrows sections. There are approximately 13 acres of existing riverine habitat along Crooked
River that provide potential breeding and foraging habitat for harlequin ducks in the Meanders
area. The current habitat has been impacted by past mining, creating a non-functioning stream
channel and disconnected floodplain.
The harlequin duck has a global rank of G4 (apparently secure) and an Idaho State ranking of
S1B (critically imperiled) (NatureServe 2013 [accessed July 29, 2013]; Digital Atlas of Idaho
2013 [accessed July 29, 2013]).
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. There would be no direct or indirect effects to harlequin ducks or their habitat. It is
determined that there would be No Impact to harlequin ducks or their habitat under Alternative 1.
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

3-156

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2

Direct effects include the potential to disturb or displace migrating harlequin ducks traveling
through the area to breeding sites during construction activities.
Alternative 2 would improve a total of 14 acres of riverine habitat, thus improving potential
breeding and foraging habitat by restoring a more natural functioning stream channel and
connected floodplain.
Approximately 60 acres of floodplain habitat would be improved by adding woody debris and
vegetation, thus increasing cover and diversity to the floodplain. Macroinvertebrates, such as
stonefly and Odenata (dragonfly larvae), are an important food source for harlequin ducks.
Macroinvertebrate habitat would be improved under Alternative 2 by providing greater riffle
habitat, reducing cobble embeddedness, and reducing stream temperatures. Altering the
morphology of the stream would provide scouring of riffles, which reduces cobble
embeddedness. Creating more, higher-quality riffle habitat would increase the abundance and
productivity of macroinvertebrates in the project area. Stream temperatures would be reduced by
reconnecting the groundwater and surface water interaction and providing a wider riparian area
that would support larger trees and shrubs.
Determination of effects on harlequin duck is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to
cause trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under
Alternative 2. Over the long term, potential breeding and foraging habitat would be improved.
Fisher
Affected Environment

The fisher is a management indicator and sensitive species on the Nez Perce National Forest.
Fisher occurrence in western North America is closely associated with low- to mid-elevation
forests with a coniferous component, large snags or decadent live trees and logs for denning and
resting, and complex physical structure near the forest floor to support adequate prey populations
(Aubry and Lewis 2003).
The Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (IDFG 2005) summarizes fisher habitat in
Idaho as a mosaic of mesic (moist/wet) conifer, dry conifer, and subalpine forests. Mature and
older forests are used during summer; early seral and late successional forests are used in
the winter.
Fisher are known to occur in the vicinity of the project area.
Fisher has a global rank of G5 (widespread, abundant, and secure) and an Idaho State ranking of
S1 (critically imperiled) (NatureServe 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]; Digital Atlas of Idaho
2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]). In Idaho, the species occurs in the northern and central parts
of the state.

Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. As a result, there would be no direct or indirect effects to fishers or their habitat. It is
determined that there would be No Impact to fisher or their habitat under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2

Displacement effects would occur under the action alternative (Alternative 2) during
implementation. Indirect effects would be limited to noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Alternative 2 would improve cover and diversity in the floodplain along the Crooked River. This
would improve habitat (cover and forage) for fisher and their prey species.
Determination of effects on fisher is May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to cause
trend toward federal listing or reduce viability for the population or species under the
action alternative.
Management Indicator Species
Management indicator species were designated for the Nez Perce National Forest in the 1987
Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a).
Elk
Affected Environment

Elk tend to inhabit open grasslands, brush fields, and riparian areas for foraging and dense
forested areas for cover. Elk are known to occur in the project area.
The project area is located in Game Management Unit (GMU) 15. Elk populations in this GMU
are near or above objectives, with cow numbers being stable or slightly increasing and bull
numbers increasing (Rachael 2011).
Hunting pressure in Crooked River is estimated as moderate to high. Forage is mainly in open
old harvest units, open coniferous forests, and shrublands and comprises about 20% of the
project area. Vegetation management activities (primarily timber harvest with associated road
development) have changed summer habitat quality and distribution.
Elk summer habitat was analyzed using the Guidelines for Evaluating and Managing Summer
Elk Habitat in Northern Idaho (Leege 1984). The project area is within the Center Star elk
analysis unit which is assigned a 50% effectiveness habitat objective. The Center Star is
currently at 61%, which is above Forest Plan objective.
Elk are secure (G5/S5-rating of species status) in Idaho and across their range (NatureServe 2013
[accessed August 7, 2013]; Digital Atlas of Idaho 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]).

Alternative 2

Alternative 2 would improve cover and forage habitat for elk by improving vegetation and

Elk could be subject to short-term disturbance effects under Alternative 2. Short-term indirect
effects would be limited to displacement from noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Alternative 2 would not change existing elk habitat effectiveness levels for any elk units.
Moose
Affected Environment

Across the moose's range in North America, important moose habitats include mature, closedcanopy conifer or conifer-hardwood forests and high forage-producing, early-successional
forests, shrublands, and aquatic habitats. Herbaceous forage and deciduous browse includes
shrubby, open upland habitats—such as logged areas, burns in early succession, and subalpine
shrublands—and aquatic habitats in spring and early summer. Closed-canopy areas are used in
the fall and winter. In Idaho, moose occur mainly in mountainous conifer forest. Forest
vegetative types used by moose include grand fir and subalpine fir. Moose have been observed in
the project area.
Winter habitat is the most limiting habitat component for moose. Moose are very dependent
during the winter upon old-growth grand fir forest types with an understory of Pacific yew.
Winter range is characterized by double-canopy coniferous forests, which intercept significant
amounts of snow and also provide palatable evergreen forage. Grand fir–Pacific yew habitats fit
these criteria and are favored for winter foraging. The project area does not contain grand fir–
Pacific yew communities; however, moose have been observed in the project area foraging on
the shrubs and aquatic vegetation.
No population data for moose have been collected on a regular basis in the region. Data on
moose population size are difficult to obtain and moose are counted incidentally to elk surveys
(Toweill 2011). A sightability survey was conduted in 2000 in game management unit 15. The
results produced large confidence intervals due to the ability to detect animals under heavy
canopy cover. Some populations appear to be increasing and seem to respond favorably to
extensive habitat alteration by silvicultural practices. However, other populations may be
displaced or eliminated because they cannot adapt to habitat changes, particularly where yew
thickets are eliminated through logging and where increased road densities make moose more

vulnerable to harvest (Toweill 2011). Even though population levels and trends are unknown,
moose populations are large enough to support hunting.
Moose are secure (G5/S5) in Idaho and across their range (NatureServe 2013 [accessed August
7, 2013]; [G5/S4] Digital Atlas of Idaho 2013 [accessed August 7, 2013]).
The analysis area for moose is the project area.
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. As a result, there would be no direct or indirect effects to moose or their habitat.
Alternative 2

Alternative 2 would reduce the amount of aquatic foraging habitat for moose by removing the
majority of the ponds through construction of the bypass and side channels, and reconstruction of
the main Crooked River channel and floodplain. Alternative 2 would also improve cover and
forage habitat for moose by adding vegetation and diversity to the floodplain along Crooked
River, in the long term. Figure 3-29 depicts the current vegetation communities along the
Meanders and Figure 3-30 the proposed vegetation communities under Alternative 2. At least
three larger ponds would remain that would continue to provide aquatic forage for moose.
Swales and alcoves would be constructed that would also potentially provide forage areas.
Adverse impacts to moose habitat would occur during construction and for a short-term postimplementation period until vegetation can become re-established.
Moose could be subject to short-term disturbance effects under Alternative 2. Short-term
indirect effects would be limited to displacement from noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Pine Marten
Affected Environment

The pine marten (also known as the American marten) was selected as a Nez Perce Forest MIS
to represent trapped species and high-elevation old-growth forests. Marten inhabit dense, moist
to wet coniferous forests that support abundant vole populations (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994).
They prefer higher-elevation, mature subalpine fir/Engelmann spruce forests with large woody
debris, and well-developed canopy cover (Kujala 1993). Marten avoid openings greater than
150 feet from cover. Existing project area openings do not inhibit use of the area by marten.
Pine marten have not been observed in the project area, but they are suspected to occur in the
vicinity of Road 522.

Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. As a result, there would be no effects on marten or their habitat.
Alternative 2

Alternative 2 would improve cover and forage habitat for marten by adding vegetation and
diversity to the floodplain along Crooked River.
Marten could be subject to short-term disturbance effects under Alternative 2. Short-term
indirect effects would be limited to displacement from noise associated with project activities if
individuals are within the area at the time of work.
Neotropical and other Migratory Birds
Affected Environment

Forest landbirds include all the avian species, sometimes collectively termed “neotropical
migratory birds” and “resident songbirds.” This group of birds is not treated separately by
species, because they are an extremely diverse group of species, with widely disparate
habitat requirements.
In 1988, an amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act required the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS) to “identify species, subspecies, and populations of all migratory
nongame birds that, without additional conservation actions, are likely to become candidates for
listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.” To carry out this mandate, the USFWS
published “Birds of Conservation Concern 2002,” which recommends that its lists be consulted
in accordance with E.O. 13186 (Migratory Bird Conservation). In addition, numerous birds are
protected by IDFG nongame status and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Currently, there are no
Nez Perce Forest Plan standards specific to migratory birds.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act covers many ground-nesting and shrub-nesting birds. Some
migratory birds are covered by state hunting regulations; others are protected by non-game status
by the IDFG. Neotropical migrant birds use coniferous forest habitats in the U.S. during the
summer breeding season but migrate to southern latitudes to spend winters in habitats as far
south as Mexico and South America. Tropical deforestation and other environmental effects
related to bird wintering grounds are thought largely responsible for declines in some neotropical
migrant bird populations.
The Crooked River valley bottom was dredge mined with a bucket dredge from the 1930s
through the 1950s, which left large tailings piles and ponds. Mining waste (also referred to as
tailings piles) is concentrated around the stream corridor, altering the physical, hydrologic and
geomorphic conditions of the stream system, delivering sediment to the stream during both lowand high-flow conditions, restricting the natural pattern of stream migration and other changes in

channel morphology (channel size, form, and function), and inhibiting the recolonization of
native riparian vegetation.
The project area provides habitat primarily for riparian associated species. Species associated
with riparian vegetation include the rufous hummingbird, willow flycatcher, black-billed magpie,
American dipper, yellow warbler, and MacGillivray’s warbler.
Environmental Consequences – Direct and Indirect Effects

Neotropical and other migratory birds habitats found in the Crooked River Valley Restoration
project area that are most vulnerable and may be impacted by project activities are those
associated with riparian vegetation. There are currently no Forest Plan standards specific to
migratory birds.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. This alternative would have no direct or indirect effects on migratory birds.
However, the tailing piles would continue to provide less-than-desirable riparian
breeding and foraging habitat.
Alternative 2

The tailing piles are considered less-than-desirable riparian habitat for neotropical and other
migratory birds. Project activities associated with restoring the stream channel and floodplain
could cause short-term disturbance and displacement effects. There is the potential for
temporary loss of breeding sites with the removal of shrubs and trees during reshaping of the
floodplain. However, there are several preserve areas that will not be disturbed and will be
retained to provide nesting substrate for riparian-associated nesting birds.
Native plant species abundance, composition, and distribution would likely increase or improve
above current levels due to restoration of the stream channel and riparian vegetation. Improved
habitat or vegetative conditions include providing the vegetative structure, cover, and overall
habitat quality for many riparian-associated bird species.
The long-term benefits include improved stream and floodplain conditions, thus improving
nesting and foraging habitat for riparian-associated bird species. Re-vegetating the floodplain
with native and approved non-native plant species and maintaining for several years after project
completion through replanting and protection from browsing will improve foraging and nesting
habitat for neotropical migratory birds as well.
Cumulative Effects
Geographic Boundary

The area of consideration for cumulative effects for western toad, gray wolf, harlequin duck,
fisher, moose and pine marten includes lands within the entire project area.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Wildlife Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The geographic boundary for elk is the Center Star elk habitat analysis unit.
Time Frame

These effects are considered only for the species potentially affected by this project from the
initial habitat transformations in the early 1900s through the present, including this project and
reasonably foreseeable future actions. The timeframe for the cumulative effects assessment is
the duration of project activities and approximately 10–20 years after the completion of project
activities (which is the amount of time expected for the riparian vegetation to become mature).
This is the length of time for the alder and conifer communities to provide shade and to have a
stable, functioning wetland/floodplain that provides for wildlife and their habitat.
Past Actions

Historic mining activity has greatly altered the landscape. Timber harvest and road construction
have also have also influenced wildlife habitat in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation area.
These activities have been extensive in the past and have resulted in much more open, transitory
habitats than likely existed historically and altered riparian habitats. Overall trends of harvest
activity have been downward in recent years with a corresponding decline in initiation of early
seral conditions, although open conditions continue to be extensive. Refer to Appendix C for a
complete list and details of past, present, and foreseeable future actions that are considered in
this analysis.
Ongoing Actions

Ongoing actions within the proposed activity area consist of recreation, road maintenance, fire
suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and invasive weed treatments.
Future Foreseeable Actions

Motorized recreation and dispersed-camping activities would change in the future, but the effects
to wildlife and their habitats would be limited to designated existing routes and dispersedcamping areas following implementation of the Nez Perce National Designated Routes and
Areas for Motor Vehicle Use project decision. Ongoing maintenance of these travel routes is
considered routine and ongoing, with virtually no effects to the habitat through which they pass.
Currently there are numerous mineral claims in the project area (see Chapter 3, Mineral
Resources). These activities typically occur in disturbed areas and may have some disturbance
impacts to wildlife. There is one minerals plan of operation on file with the Forest at this time
for exploration activities from existing roads.
The Orogrande Community Protection project would modify wildlife habitats and cause
disturbance effects. Activities associated with Orogrande project in the vicinity of the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project are designed to reduce fuels, primarily in the understory
(prescribed burning and understory thinning). This would reduce understory cover (sapling and
pole-sized trees and shrubs), yet at the same time improve forage for big game species. . There

would be short-term disturbance and displacement effects to wildlife species in the area from
implementing this project. Elk habitat effectiveness levels would not change in the Center Star
elk habitat analysis unit as part of the Orogrande project.
Fire-suppression activities would be anticipated in the future in the project area, but the
occurrence, extent, and/or intensity of suppression efforts cannot be estimated or predicted. As
with all these activities, there would be disturbance/displacement effects to the species.
Noxious weed treatments would occur in the project area under the current weed management
plan in the future. Generally, spot applications should not affect any wildlife species of concern
due to avoidance by spray crews. The risk associated with herbicide treatment is the potential
that wildlife species, particularly amphibians, would accidentally be sprayed. The design criteria
specified in Chapter 2 would provide adequate protection for wildlife species by minimizing the
amount and type of herbicide to which amphibians could be exposed by restricting application
methods and applying buffer distances along streams, ponds, and wetlands.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

The No Action alternative (Alternative 1) would produce no additional effects to wildlife or their
habitat, as compared to past activity levels. Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effects
and therefore no cumulative effects on wildlife or their habitat. Existing vegetation would not be
altered nor would these wildlife species be disturbed or displaced.
Alternative 2

Alternative 2 and the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would add
short-term disturbance effects to this landscape through associated stream restoration, road
construction, and road decommissioning activities. The construction and removal of roads may
impact existing occurrences of wildlife species or habitats that are found in the immediate
vicinity of the project.
Habitat alterations and disturbance associated with the implementation of this project have the
short-term potential to combine with ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed
activity areas consisting of recreation, road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management,
mining, watershed restoration, and weed treatments. The action alternative along with ongoing
and future foreseeable actions would cumulatively add to the loss of some wildlife species
habitats. However, Alternative 2 would also provide a more natural functioning stream and
floodplain and may even be beneficial for some of the wildlife species using this area (i.e.,
improved habitat for harlequin duck, moose, fisher, neotrophical birds). There would also be
additional short-term disturbance and displacement cumulative effects to western toad, gray
wolf, harlequin duck, fisher, elk, moose, pine marten, neotropical birds from ongoing and future
foreseeable actions. There would also be the potential from short-term mortality impacts to
western toad from ongoing and future foreseeable actions. There would be no concerns for
viability of these species because of the extent of short-term impacts and the long-term

improvement of suitable wildlife habitats associated with improving the Crooked River valley
bottom.
Determination of Effects
Effects to threatened, endangered, and sensitive wildlife species by management activities of this
project and the proposed Crooked River Narrow Road Improvement project are summarized in
Table 3-39. This table includes all wildlife species on the Nez Perce National Forest sensitive
list. There is potential for impacts to western toads, gray wolves, harlequin ducks, and fisher.
Alternative 2 would likely harm existing western toads. The proposed action would create a
more connected and natural functioning river valley bottom but would likely disturb or displace
western toads, wolves, harlequin ducks, and fisher. Because only a low percentage of habitats
would be disturbed, there would be no concerns for the overall species viability.
Based on short-term impacts resulting from the project, it is determined that the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project may impact individuals, but would not lead to a trend toward
federal listing or a loss of viability for the western toad, gray wolf, harlequin duck, and fisher.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
By applying design and mitigation measures 11, 11a, 11b, 11c, 45, and 52 (as described in
Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures), the effects to western toads, neotropical migratory
birds, and their habitat would be reduced. Applying aquatic species salvage operations prior to
construction and dewatering activities would reduce the amount of western toad mortality in the
Meanders section of Crooked River.
In response to the introduction and spread of noxious weeds, actions would be taken to restore
vegetative conditions along Crooked River. These actions would also improve habitat for
wildlife species by applying design and mitigation measures 9, 10, 17, 18, 22, and 24–31 (see
Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures).
All water bodies, especially ponds, would be checked for amphibians prior to and during
construction of any work associated with the bypass channel, side channel, temporary road, and
floodplain, etc. All life stages of amphibians would be collected and immediately translocated to
the pond near channel station 110.00 (pond being retained and western toad breeding area).
Western toads tend to lay eggs in shallow water with emergent vegetation and facing a certain
exposure. Taking note of the conditions surrounding the egg masses and mimicing those
conditions when the egg masses are translocated to the new pond would enhance survival. It
may be possible to translocate the new egg masses immediately adjacent to the egg masses in the
identified pond.
In order to prevent additional spread of fungal pathogen, all gear, clothing, equipment, etc.
associated with the aquatic organism salvage operations would be disinfected/decontaminated
with a 10% bleach solution prior to entering any water bodies associated with the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation projects. Standard disinfection protocols would be followed (Maxell no
date, Phillot et al. 2010).
In some instances, disposable gloves have been shown to cause mortality when handling certain
life stages of amphibians, especially in tadpoles. If disposable gloves are necessary for aquatic
organism salvage operations and handling of aquatic organisms in the translocation process,
steps outline by Cashins et al. 2008 and Greer et al. 2009 would be followed to minimize
exposure and reduce incidental mortality of amphibians to pathogens/toxins from the gloves.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
The principal policy document relevant to wildlife management on the Nez Perce National
Forest is the 1987 Nez Perce National Forest Plan (Forest Plan), which contains goals,
objectives, standards, and guidelines for management of wildlife species and habitats on the
Forest. Forest Plan goals (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-1 and -2) addressing wildlife and
wildlife habitats are summarized below:

Provide and maintain a diversity and quality of habitat to support viable populations of
native and desirable non-native wildlife species.
Provide habitat to contribute to the recovery of Threatened and Endangered plant and
animal species in accordance with approved recovery plans. Provide habitat to ensure the
viability of those species identified as sensitive.
Recognize and promote the intrinsic ecological and economic value of wildlife and
wildlife habitats. Provide high-quality and quantity of wildlife habitat to ensure
diversified recreational use and public satisfaction.
Protect or enhance riparian-dependent resources.

Forest Service Manual 2670 (file code for threatened and endangered species) directs that all
federal departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and threatened species and
shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of the Endangered Species Act and to avoid actions
that may cause a species to become threatened or endangered. FSM 2670 also calls for the
Forest Service to maintain viable populations of all native and desirable non-native wildlife, fish,
and plant species in habitats distributed throughout their geographic range on system lands.
The three principal laws relevant to wildlife management on lands managed by the Forest
Service are the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the National Forest Management Act of 1976
and its implementing regulations at 36 CFR 219, and NEPA. Regulations promulgated
subsequent to passage of these laws require the Forest Service to maintain viable populations of
all native and desirable non-native wildlife species with emphasis on assuring that federally
listed (threatened and endangered) species populations are allowed to recover (36 CFR 219.9).
Regional Foresters provide a list of sensitive species for each Forest. Forests are required to
assure that sensitive species populations do not decline or trend towards listing under the
Endangered Species Act (FSM 2670.22).
This analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial sensitive species (i.e., Biological Evaluation),
per direction pertaining to streamlining (USDA Forest Service 1995a). The streamlined process
for doing biological evaluations for sensitive species focuses on two areas:

Executive Order (E.O.) 13186, “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory
Birds,” (January 10, 2001) pertains to conservation of migratory birds. A Memorandum of
Understanding to carry out the mandate of the E.O. was signed by the U.S. Forest Service and
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on January 7, 2001. In 1988, an amendment to the Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Act required the USFWS to “identify species, subspecies, and populations
of all migratory nongame birds that, without additional conservation actions, are likely to
become candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.” To carry out this
mandate, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published “Birds of Conservation Concern 2002,”

which recommends that its lists be consulted in accordance with E.O. 13186.
In addition, numerous birds are protected by IDFG nongame status and the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act. Currently, there are no Nez Perce Forest Plan standards specific to migratory birds.
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
Nez Perce Forest Plan – As stated under Other Laws and Regulations, the objective for
managing sensitive species is to ensure population viability throughout their range on National
Forest lands and to ensure that they do not become federally listed as threatened or endangered.
The Forest Plan supports this direction but does not set specific standards and guides for
sensitive species. Proposed activities are consistent with this direction to the extent that
proposed management actions do not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive wildlife
populations.
Applicable standards of the Nez Perce Forest Plan associated with the management of wildlife
and key habitats of threatened, endangered, sensitive, and management indicator species have
been reviewed and are being met, and in some instances, exceeded.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would be consistent with Forest Plan wildlife
standards (USDA Forest Service 1987a). The project would not lead to a loss of viability of
existing native and desirable non-native vertebrate wildlife species. A biological evaluation has
been prepared in compliance with sub-section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act.
Government-to-Government consultation has occurred for this project, and the Forest continues
to recognize the fishing and hunting rights guaranteed to the Nez Perce Tribe. The Forest has
coordinated with the IDFG to achieve mutual goals for fish and wildlife, including use of the
IDFG Idaho Fish and Wildlife Information System for habitat and species
observation/distribution information for this project. The Guidelines for Evaluating and
Managing Summer Elk Habitat in Northern Idaho (Leege 1984) was used to assess the
attainment of summer elk habitat objectives for this project.
Regarding Forest Plan management area standards, streamside vegetation canopy, structure,
composition and diversity are currently lacking along the Meanders section of the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project (Alternative 1). Alternative 2 would implement habitat
improvements to move the area toward stated objectives.
The project would also comply with PACFISH (USDA Forest Service 1995b) standards and
guidelines applicable to this project. Riparian Management Objectives would be maintained and
enhanced by the action alternative.
Full details on consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.

Other Laws and Regulations
Threatened and Endangered Species – Federal agencies are required to address effects to
threatened, endangered, and proposed species during project planning (Endangered Species Act
of 1973 as amended, P.L. 96-1591531(c)). This analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial
threatened and endangered species (i.e., Biological Evaluation), per direction pertaining to
streamlining (USDA Forest Service 1995a). This project is in compliance with the Endangered
Species Act.
Sensitive Species – Sensitive wildlife species are those that show evidence of a current or
predicted downward trend in population numbers or habitat suitability that would substantially
reduce species distribution. Federal laws and direction applicable to sensitive species include the
National Forest Management Act (NFMA 1976) and Forest Service Manual 2670.22. The Nez
Perce Forest has standards to conduct analyses to review programs and activities to determine
their potential effect on sensitive species and to prepare biological evaluations. The Forest
Service is bound by federal statutes (Endangered Species Act, National Forest Management Act),
regulation (USDA 9500-4), and agency policy (FSM 2670) to conserve biological diversity on
National Forest System lands and assure that sensitive species populations do not decline or
trend toward listing under the Endangered Species Act. A biological evaluation for sensitive
species has been prepared. The action alternative would not affect sensitive species viability on
Nez Perce National Forest lands, nor would it cause sensitive species to become federally listed
as threatened or endangered. This project is in compliance with sensitive species direction. This
analysis incorporates the effects on terrestrial threatened and endangered species (i.e., Biological
Evaluation), per direction pertaining to streamlining (USDA Forest Service 1995a). This project
is in compliance with the Endangered Species Act.
Species Viability – The action alternative—in combination with, and within the context of past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable future management actions in the analysis area—would not
affect population viability or distribution of native and desired non-native vertebrate species on
the Forest. This project is in compliance.
National Forest Management Act – The National Forest Management Act requires (among
other things) the Forest Service to “preserve and enhance the diversity of plant and
animal communities.”
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, National Forest Management Act of 1976, and Forest
Service regulations require federal land managers to maintain viable populations of all native and
desirable non-native wildlife species with special care taken to assure that federally listed
(threatened and endangered) species populations are allowed to recover. There are no federally
listed threatened or endangered species using the project area. The action alternative is in

Rare Plants
Scope of the Analysis
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project has the potential to affect rare plant species and
their habitats. This section provides an analysis of rare plant species potentially present in the
project area and the effects proposed activities may have on them. For the purpose of this
analysis, rare plant species include endangered, threatened, and sensitive plant species.
Analysis Area
Direct and indirect effects were analyzed for the project area for the restoration and improvement
of 2.0 miles of the Crooked River Meanders.
Cumulative Effects Area
The area of consideration for cumulative effects includes lands associated within this project
area.
The rationale for the selection of these analysis areas is that the effects are site specific to areas
treated within the project area (as delineated in Chapter 2) and would not extend beyond the
boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area would likewise not affect the
resource within.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
•

Updated the cumulative effects section.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Analysis included reviewing threatened, endangered, and sensitive species observation records
and topographic and forest habitat maps to identify potential habitat for plants of concern.
Individual species requirements were reviewed to determine which species or corresponding
habitat would be expected to occur in the project area.
Vegetation information was identified in the project area in 2012 (RDG et al. 2012).
Direct and indirect effects are discussed for each species. Direct effects could result from road
and stream alteration. Indirect effects for some species may include the expansion of weeds and
the mitigating treatments of these infestations. Road improvements that are limited to the road
prism would not have any direct or indirect effects on any species of concern. Cumulative
effects are the overall effects to species from past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
projects. Historically such effects on individual species were not measured or noted. However,
the past effects on general habitat condition can be qualified and matched to species dependent
on a particular habitat.

Affected Environment
Past land management activities, most importantly mining and road construction, have
substantially affected the landscape in many parts of the watershed, as well as instream and
riparian function in the main stem of Crooked River (Appendix C). Fire suppression, mining,
road construction, and timber harvest have caused a shift in many of the natural processes in the
watershed. The area surrounding Crooked River was mined for mineral resources from the
1900s through the 1950s. Mining waste (mine tailings) is concentrated in the valley bottom,
altering the physical condition of the stream system, restricting the natural migration pattern of
the stream and other changes in channel morphology (channel size, form, and function), and
impairing the recolonization of riparian vegetation and its function as a natural buffer. Road 233
is within the floodplain of Crooked River for approximately 3 miles through the Narrows and
one additional mile to Relief Creek. The road often floods during high water events, constricts
the river, and contributes sediment to Crooked River. These alterations have resulted in a
reduced area of productive aquatic and terrestrial habitat.
Federally Listed Species

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) requires the Forest Service to analyze threatened
species for which there may be suitable habitat in a project area. In Idaho County, the USFWS
has indicated that there may be suitable habitat for Macfarlane’s four-o’clock (Mirabilis
macfarlanei) and Spalding’s catchfly (Silene spaldingii). However, past assessments and
direction provided by the USFWS indicate that habitat for these species is limited to the Salmon
River basin on the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests. There are no occurrences or
suitable habitat for any federally listed plant species in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project area, which is in the Clearwater subbasin. These species will not be discussed further.
Water howellia is another listed threatened species. Even though water howellia is known to
occur in Idaho, it does not occur in Idaho County and was not detected during rare plant surveys
conducted on July 17, 2003. This species will not be discussed further.
Sensitive Species

The USFS Northern Region Sensitive Species List, which contains those species identified as
sensitive by the Regional Forester, was last updated on February 2011 (USDA Forest Service
2011b). Idaho barren strawberry is the only rare plant species known or suspected to occur in the
project area. Species not known or suspected to occur in the project area will not be discussed
further. A complete list of the sensitive plant species for the Nez Perce – Clearwater National
Forests can be found in Table 3-40.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Rare plant surveys were conducted in 2012 (RDG et al. 2012) and 2013 (Forest Service
personnel) in the project area.
Idaho barren strawberry (Waldsteinia idahoensis)

Idaho barren strawberry has a wide ecological range (Crawford 1980), and is found
predominantly in moister grand fir habitat types (cool and moist western red cedar) at midelevations (3,500–5,500 feet). Cool, moist micro sites within these general habitats are most
favorable for its development (Crawford 1980). Idaho barren strawberry is tolerant of shade but
responds favorably to increased light (Crawford 1980) and is also able to colonize disturbed soils
(Lichthardt 1999). It can be found growing in stands with open canopies, and transition zones
between riparian meadows and conifer forests.
Idaho barren strawberry is known to occur in the project area. Historical records show that Idaho
barren strawberry occurs in and around Campground 4. Rare plant surveys conducted on July 2
and 17, 2013, found Idaho barren strawberry north of Campground 3. The area along the
Meanders consists of larger, loose cobble, which does not provide suitable habitat for Idaho
barren strawberry. Idaho barren strawberry can be found along the Meanders where past
activities have maintained a soil component.

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

Under Alternative 1 (No Action), there would be no rehabilitation of the Crooked River
Meanders. This would have no effects on rare plant species or habitats. It is determined that
there would be No Impact to sensitive plant species or their habitat with Alternative 1.
Alternative 2
Idaho barren strawberry (Waldsteinia idahoensis)

Idaho barren strawberry appears to be tolerant of disturbances. Population density was greater in
open stands with past harvest and in old burns as compared to a more shaded closed conifer
community (Crawford 1980). It is capable of colonizing disturbed soils (Lichthardt 1999).
Idaho barren strawberry occurs in and around the area of Campgrounds 3 and 4 at the upper end
of the Meanders. The staging of equipment at these sites would further compact soils than what
they already are, creating less than ideal growing conditions for Idaho barren strawberry and
other plant species. Root systems would have a hard time breaking through the compacted soils.
Decompacting soils upon completion of the project would temporarily improve growing
conditions for Idaho barren strawberry. Restoring the floodplain would create conditions that are
too wet for Idaho barren strawberry. Determination of effects for the Idaho barren strawberry is
May impact individuals or habitat but not likely to cause trend toward federal listing or reduce
viability for the population or species under Alternative 2.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Cumulative Effects
Discussion of cumulative effects for rare plants is addressed through the general trend of the
suitable habitat required by these species as a result of past, present, and future management
actions. It is generally not possible to directly quantify effects of specific activities that are
several years or decades old on species of concern today. The status and occurrence of rare
plants was completely unknown for much of the management history of the watershed.
Historically, the changes in condition and abundance of specific habitats important to these
species are also largely unknown. Therefore, the effects of these past projects can be qualified
only through general discussions. However, the results of past projects contribute to the current
condition, which can be used to discuss and quantify effects of proposed activities on rare
plant species. Refer to Appendix C for a complete list and details of past, present, and
foreseeable future actions.
Geographic Boundary

The area of consideration for cumulative effects includes lands within the entire project area.The
rationale for the analysis area is that the effects are site specific to areas treated within the project
area and would not extend beyond the boundaries, and effects from outside the defined area
would likewise not affect the resource within.
Time Frame

These effects are considered only for the species potentially affected by this project from the
initial habitat transformations in the early 1900s through the present, including this project and
reasonably foreseeable future actions. The timeframe for the cumulative effects assessment is
the duration of project activities and approximately 10–20 years after the completion of project
activities (construction and planting). This is length of time for the alder and conifer
communities to provide shade and to have a stable, functioning wetland/floodplain that provides
for rare plants and their habitat.
Past Actions

The primary management activities that have influenced rare plant habitat in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area include past timber harvest and supporting road construction
and mining. These activities have been extensive in the past and have resulted in much more
open, transitory habitats than likely existed historically.
Ongoing Actions

Ongoing actions within the proposed activity areas consist of recreation, road maintenance, fire
suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed restoration, and weed treatments.
Currently, there are numerous mineral claims in the project area (see Chapter 3, Mineral
Resources). These activities typically occur in disturbed areas that are not considered habitat for
any of the sensitive plant species.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Rare Plants

3-178

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Fire-suppression activities would be anticipated in the project area in the future, but the
occurrence, extent, and/ or intensity of suppression efforts cannot be estimated or predicted.
As with all these activities, the effects to the species would likely be mixed.
Noxious weed treatments would occur periodically in the project area under the current weed
management plan in the future. Generally, spot applications should not affect any species of
concern due to avoidance by spray crews. However, in the case of the Idaho Barren strawberry,
potentially affected by this project, some spraying may occur along occupied road corridors and
impacts
are possible.
Future Foreseeable Actions

The Orogrande Fuels project and the Designated Routes and Areas for Motor Vehicle Use
(DRAMVU) project are future actions that may have impacts to sensitive plants species.
Motorized recreation and dispersed-camping activities would change in the future, but the effects
on soils would be limited to designated existing routes and dispersed-camping areas following
implementation of DRAMVU project decision. Ongoing maintenance of these travel routes is
considered routine with virtually no effects to the habitat through which they pass.
The Orogrande Community Protection project would maintain relatively open conditions,
allowing sun to reach the soil and provide light disturbance to which these species potentially
respond favorably. This activity would be expected to have the small but positive effect of
promoting the maintenance of the suitable habitat for the Idaho barren strawberry in areas
adjacent to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project.
Alternative 1 (No Action)

The no action alternative (Alternative 1) would produce no direct or indirect effects on potential
rare plant habitat, as compared to past activity levels. The progression of forest succession
would improve habitat for most sensitive plant species; however, species favored by more open
conditions would decline as general forest succession progressed absent of large-scale
disturbance such as wildfire. Thus, there would be no cumulative impacts on potential rare
plant habitat
Alternative 2

Habitat alterations associated with the implementation of this project have the short-term
potential to combine with ongoing and foreseeable actions within the proposed activity areas,
including recreation, road maintenance, fire suppression, fuels management, mining, watershed
restoration, and weed treatments. Alternative 2 would cumulatively add to the loss of sensitive
species habitats along Crooked River by providing a more natural functioning stream and
floodplain. There would be no concerns for viability of the Idaho Barren strawberry because of
the extent of sensitive plant locations and suitable habitats within the Crooked River drainages.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Actions taken to prevent the introduction and spread of noxious weeds in disturbed areas would
be beneficial in maintaining and improving rare plant vegetative communities by reducing the
incidence of introduced non-native and noxious weedy plant species. The following design and
mitigation measures (as described in full in Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures) are
proposed for the action alternative: 9, 10, 17, 18, and 24–31.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The Nez Perce Forest Plan states that no action will be taken that will jeopardize a threatened
and/or endangered species (USDA Forest Service 1987a, page VI-12). The objective for
managing sensitive species is to ensure population viability throughout their range on National
Forest lands and to ensure that they do not become federally listed as threatened or endangered.
The proposed action is consistent with this direction to the extent that proposed management
actions would not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive plant populations or habitat.
The Forest Plan does not set specific standards and guides for sensitive plants. Full details on
consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Other Laws and Regulations
Threatened and endangered species are designated under the Endangered Species Act. It is the
policy of Congress that all federal departments shall seek to conserve endangered and threatened
species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of this purpose (ESA 1531.2b). The
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area does not contain habitat or populations of
threatened or endangered plant species.
Sensitive species are defined in the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2670.5) as “those plant and
animal species identified by the Regional Forester for which population viability is a concern, as
evidenced by significant current or predicted downward trends in population numbers, density,
or habitat capability that reduce a species/existing distribution.” In FSM 2670.22, management
direction for sensitive species is in part, to ensure that species do not become threatened or
endangered because of Forest Service actions and to maintain viable populations of all native
species. The most recent update to the sensitive species list became effective in May 2011. The
Forest Service must evaluate impacts to sensitive species through a biological evaluation (BE).
Effects Determinations
Determination of effects on rare plant species by management activities of this project are
summarized in Table 3-40. This table includes all plant species on the Nez Perce National Forest
sensitive list. There is potential for impacts on Idaho barren strawberry. The proposed action
would likely harm existing plants, but would create or maintain open conditions along the road

of habitat would disturbed, there would be no concerns for the overall viability of the species.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Invasive Plants
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project proposed
action on invasive plants. The proposed activities that could affect vegetation conditions include
removal of vegetative cover, construction activities, importing materials, and revegetation
activities.
Invasive plant species are an important ecosystem attribute to consider when assessing potential
impacts from the proposed action. Invasive plants, which include listed Idaho noxious weeds,
have the potential to affect native species’ richness and frequency, erosion rates, and ecological
processes. Invasive plants can expand following human-caused or natural disturbances and
colonize degraded as well as intact habitats. Many invasive plants found in the Intermountain
West were accidentally or intentionally introduced into North America between the 1880s and
1920s. Without their natural predators and pathogens, invasive plant populations can expand.
The Red River Ranger District implements integrated invasive plant management strategies that
deal with invasive plant infestations within the project area based on priorities outlined in the
Annual Operating Plan for the Upper Clearwater River Weed Management Area, a communitybased cooperative. The area generally has potential for invasive plant control work through the
life of the proposed project.
Analysis Area
The analysis area is the same as the project area, approximately 115 acres.
Cumulative Effects Areas
The cumulative effects analysis area is the Crooked River watershed.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
No changes were made to the Invasive Plant section between the Draft and Final EIS.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Invasive plant expansion and prevention in the project area is greatly influenced by habitat
susceptibility, seed source, seed dispersal, and disturbance. Invasive plants could expand in the
analysis area depending on the interaction of these four factors.
The indicators used for this analysis are:
•

Susceptible habitat

Data for this analysis comes from several sources, including past Forest Service weed inventories
(USDA Forest Service 1998 to 2012), the Design Criteria Report (RDG et al. 2012), and
personal knowledge.
Susceptible Habitats
Susceptibility refers to the vulnerability of plant communities to colonization and establishment
of invasive plants. Invasive plants can be expected to colonize those sites or habitats that
provide the necessary requirements to complete their life cycle. Those habitats that lack the
necessary resources for specific invasive plants are not considered susceptible to colonization.
Under these conditions a site or habitat may be considered as having low susceptibility or may
even be unavailable to weed colonization.
Susceptible habitats were identified in the action area using geographic information systems
(GIS). A buffer was used around the Meanders in order to assess the maximum amount of area
impacted by the action alternative. Habitats were classified as having low, moderate, or high
susceptibility based on habitat type group (HTG) characteristics and known ability of invasive
plants to colonize in these habitat types. Highly susceptible habitats can be colonized and
dominated with invasive plants even in the absence of intense and frequent disturbance. HTGs
with a low rating are only slightly susceptible to weed colonization.
Weed susceptibility is determined by HTGs (e.g., warm and dry with overstory species of
Douglas-fir/grassland). Historically, the Crooked River Valley bottom was warm and moist with
a late seral vegetation community of alder and fir spruce overstory. With the disturbance levels
from past mining, the current site conditions are warm and dry (tailings piles are not inundated
during seasonal flow events) with seral lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir as overstory species.
Habitats moderately susceptible to weed invasion provide site characteristics where species can
invade the herbaceous layer and become a common element across the plant community in the
absence of intense and frequent disturbance. Ground- and habitat-altering disturbances are
important factors contributing to weed colonization within and adjacent to highly and moderately
susceptible habitats.
Of the 10 vegetation community sites identified by River Design Group (2012), four were
considered to represent disturbed plant communities; however, these four communities represent
over 50% of the composition in the valley bottom. Disturbed community types were dredge
conifer, dredge herbaceous, reed canary grass, and mesic forb meadow. These are also the
community types that support the greatest amount of invasive species, such as oxeye daisy,
hounds tongue, and spotted knapweed, and are currently the most susceptible to invasive plants,
with the exception of the reed canary grass community.

Weed Expansion Risk
The risk of weed expansion in the analysis area was determined by assessing the following
factors: (1) susceptibility of HTGs, (2) presence of weed infestations (seed source), (3) amount
of fire and timber harvest over the past 10 years (site disturbance), and (4) density of roads
(spread corridors). Risk was assigned a low, moderate, high, or extreme category. GIS was used
to display and calculate acres for activities occurring in each risk zone. The analysis does not
include reed canary grass. Table 3-41 displays the rationale for weed spread risk ratings.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
The analysis area has had high levels of past disturbance: the majority of the area has
experienced mining (dredging) since the 1930s, and currently there are approximately 2.0 miles
per square mile of roads within the Crooked River watershed. Within the greater context of the
South Fork Clearwater River subbasin, noxious weeds and invasive plants occupy more than
30,000 acres, on approximately 6% of the subbasin (USDA Forest Service 1998). This includes
species known to occur in the analysis area and species that currently do not occur in the analysis
area. Spotted knapweed populations have heavily infested areas along the main road and
trailhead/dispersed camp sites (spread vectors) within the project area. Reed canary grass has
been found to be increasing in the central part of the project area along the main stream channel.
Reed canary grass is not listed as a state noxious weed; however, it can easily dominate the
wetter habitats and prevent desired native species from colonizing. Reed canary grass has an
excellent stability rating. Common tansy and peavine have been found in several small sites.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Invasive Plants

3-186

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

These common tansy and perennial peavine sites were inventoried in 2012 and no plants were
found on these sites, in the project area (Doyle 2012). Other weed species found in the
Meanders area include hounds tongue and oxeye daisy. These species are primarily found on
dredge tailings, roadsides, and other high-use disturbance areas.
Noxious weeds such as spotted knapweed are spread readily via seeds. Spotted knapweed seeds
have an efficient dispersal mechanism. The seeds are capable of being carried several miles due
to fine plumes acting like a parachute for the seed. Reed canary grass and common tansy spread
rapidly with disturbance to root systems. Roads, as well as trails, are vectors spreading invasive
plants within the analysis area. The complete length of the project area has a main corridor road.
Biological control methods have been used in/or near the analysis area. “Classical biological
control is the introduction and establishment of carefully selected natural enemies to exert stress
on a noxious weed which ultimately causes plant death or reduces the competitive ability of the
invasive plants to a point where desirable plant species can out-compete them” (Jette et al. 1999).
Bio-agent release sites of Larinus minutus, a seed head feeder, on spotted knapweed have been
established within the South Fork Clearwater River drainage. These sites were established in the
year 2000 and have not shown enough activity to make any determination of effectiveness
(Winston 2012).
Weed Inventory Data
Our knowledge of weed populations in the project area is good: however, unknown weed
populations may exist. Field surveys for invasive plants have been conducted in the Crooked
River drainage for more than 14 years (USDA Forest Service 1998 to 2012). Known weed sites
may change in weed density and site boundaries on an annual basis due to factors such as
weather and effectiveness of ongoing treatments. Table 3-42 lists invasive plant species, and
their acreages, that have been identified in the project area. Figure 3-31 displays known invasive
plants, except reed canary grass, in the project area.

In summary:

The project area is currently infested with invasive species, mostly spotted knapweed and
reed canary grass.
Knowledge of the extent of existing weed populations is good, due in part to good access
from existing roads.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Most existing populations are associated with known disturbances such as dredge mining,
roads, and camp sites.
Past dredge mining and associated road construction have increased the risk of weed
expansion in most of the project area.
Reed canary grass often dominates the lower-gradient stream banks along Crooked River
within the southern half of the Meanders area.

Habitat Susceptibility
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current management of invasive plant species.
The Meanders area would continue to have habitat susceptibility as high (1 acre), moderate
(54 acres), low (105 acres), and none (3 acres). Figure 3-32 displays habitat susceptibility to
weed invasion under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would, in the short term, increase the levels of low to moderate
habitat susceptibility with the implementation of ground-disturbing activities. Long term, habitat
is expected to move toward a historic low susceptibility level as water levels rise and wetter,
cooler habitats become established adjacent to Crooked River. Short term, levels of reed canary
grass would most likely expand. Reestablishing native shrub and conifer cover would decrease
levels of reed canary grass due to eventual increased shading from taller shrub and conifer
species.

Weed Expansion Risk
Direct and Indirect Effects

The expansion risk of weed populations and introductions is low to moderate due to the
generally wetter habitats. Most of the proposed activities are outside the high to extreme
expansion risk sites.
While it is well known that the risk of weed invasion increases with disturbance and is variable
depending on specific habitats and management activities, making exact determinations of weed
response is difficult; consequently, the implementation of design and mitigation measures would
minimize an increase in, if not decrease, weed expansion risk over time.
Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current management of the invasive plant species.
The Meanders area would continue to have weed risk as high (0 acres), moderate (21 acres), low
(140 acres), and none (3 acres). Figure 3-33 displays weed expansion risk under Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would, in the short term, increase the levels of low to moderate
weed expansion with implementation of ground-disturbing activities. Long term, weed risk is
expected to move toward a historic low level as weed treatments occur, water levels rise, and
wetter and cooler habitats become established adjacent to Crooked River; however, in the short
term, levels of reed canary grass would most likely expand. Reestablishing native shrub and
conifer cover would decrease levels of reed canary grass due to the eventual increased shading
from taller shrub and conifer species.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Cumulative Effects
Time Frame

Past and present disturbances associated with vegetative treatments, added to reasonably
foreseeable actions, would create over the next 10–15 years a cumulative threat of weed
expansion through distribution of weed seed, ground disturbance, and creation of spread
pathways. Management activities that disturb the ground aid establishment of invasive plants
through increased niches or open areas that can be utilized. The risk of weed expansion would
be reduced with the implementation of design criteria and mitigation under each action
alternative as disturbed surfaces recover to native vegetation. Restoration of wetland habitats
would reduce susceptibility and risk to new and or expansion weed populations.
Ongoing and Foreseeable Future Actions

Ongoing weed management would continue under either alternative. New invaders would be
given the highest priority.
The Orogrande Community Protection project would increase weed spread risk through grounddisturbing activities such as burning.
The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would in the short term
increase the levels of low to moderate habitat susceptibility and the levels of low to moderate
weed expansion with the implementation of ground-disturbing activities. Over the long term,
implementation of design criteria and mitigation measures would lower the habitat susceptibility
and the risk of weed expansion to at least current levels.
In summary:
•

Weed spread is likely under both alternatives, including No Action.

•

Weed expansion risk is not expected to increase significantly from the proposed activities
because of the currently highly disturbed nature of the river system, and long-term risk is
already mostly moderate or lower in the project area.

•

The extent of weed spread would be dependent on implementation and effectiveness of
existing weed treatments, design criteria, and mitigation items.

•

Reed canary grass would decrease over time with greater shade/competition from shrubs
and conifers, and less disturbance from a restored stream channel.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Design and mitigation measures 25–28 and 31 (as described in full in Chapter 2, Design and
Mitigation Measures) are proposed for the action alternative to help prevent the spread of
invasive and noxious weeds.

Monitoring
Implementation Monitoring
Implementation monitoring would be conducted to ensure that design criteria are being
implemented properly.
Monitoring would include the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Complete and document inspections for weed sources on equipment required to be
cleaned according to forest standards (design and mitigation measures 26, 27, and 31).
Plant seed, straw and/or mulch would be certified as required and the results would be
documented (design and mitigation measures 25 and 26).
District and Forest weed coordinators would ensure weed management follows Forest
Standards and protocols (design and mitigation measure 28).
Sources for gravel, dirt, rock, and other material hauled for the project would be from
weed-free sources (design and mitigation measures 26 and 27).
Inventory for new weed species (design and mitigation measure 28).

Effectiveness Monitoring
Effectiveness monitoring would be conducted to determine if design criteria achieve their
desired objectives.
Monitoring would include the following:
1.
2.

Post management monitoring would determine changes in noxious weed populations and
inventory for new weeds as a result of the project and guide future weed management
actions (design and mitigation measure 28).
A documented increase in invasive weeds would trigger Integrated Weed Management
(USDA Forest Service 2001; Forest Service Handbook 2080), development and
implementation of a management plan, and adjustments of weed treatments as necessary
following coordination with the District/Forest weed coordinators and the Central Idaho
Level I Team (design and mitigation measure 28).

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The Forest Plan calls for the coordination of a weed control program with county, state, and
other federal agencies. This directive is met through the participation of the Forest in the Annual
Operating Plan for the Upper Clearwater Weed Management Area, a community-based
cooperative. Both alternatives would be consistent with the Forest Plan standard for
implementing a weed control program (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-20). Full details on
consistency of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.

Other Laws and Regulations
Executive Order 13112 for Invasive Species, Section 2a(3), directs each affected federal agency
to “not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the
introduction or spread of invasive species in the United States or elsewhere unless, pursuant to
guidelines that it has prescribed, the agency has determined and made public its determinations
that the benefits of such actions clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by invasive species;
and that all feasible and prudent measures to minimize risk of harm would be taken in
conjunction with the actions.”
Analysis and evaluation of invasive plants in this project is based on direction contained in the
Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 (as amended), Executive Order 13112 for Invasive Species,
Forest Service policy (USDA Forest Service 1995c, 2001), and the Nez Perce National Forest
Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-7, II-20, II-26, III-6).
In general, the Forest is directed to implement an effective weed management program with the
objectives of preventing the introduction and establishment of noxious weeds; containing and
suppressing existing weed infestations; and cooperating with local, state, and other federal
agencies in the management of noxious weeds.
The proposed action might cause the spread of invasive species in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project area to some degree. However, this potential harm would be outweighed
by the overall benefits to the watershed by the proposed treatments. Design criteria and
mitigation measures would be implemented to minimize any harmful effects associated with the
spread of invasive species. These measures are designed to meet the guidance of Executive
Order 13112. Alternative 1 would continue to have the presence of invasive species.
Alternative 2 would create a more fully functioning hydraulic condition, and is expected to cause
a decline in non-native invasive plant species populations over time.

Recreation Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project on recreation within and adjacent to the project area. Recreation along the
Crooked River Road (Road 233) consists mostly of camping and fishing; the availability of
campsites is the primary concern of forest visitors to this area.
Analysis and Cumulative Effects Areas
Developed Recreation Sites
A developed recreation site is a discrete area on a Forest that provides recreation opportunities,
receives recreational use, and requires a management investment to operate and/or maintain to
standard under the direction of an administrative unit in the National Forest System.
Recreation sites range in development from relatively undeveloped areas, with little to no
improvements (Development Scale 0 and 1), to concentrations of facilities and services
evidencing a range of amenities and investment (Development Scale 2 through 5).
Dispersed Recreation Sites
Dispersed recreation sites are sites with little investment and are at Development Scale of
0 through 1. Sites were identified in accordance with Region 1 primitive sites resource condition
survey methodology.
Groomed Snowmobile Trail System
Part of Road 233 and part of Deadwood Road (Road 1803) are on the Groomed Snowmobile
Trail System and constitute an important segment of Idaho State Snowmobile Area 25B.
Groomed snowmobile trails are shown in Figure 3-34.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
No changes were made to the Recreation Resources section between the Draft and Final EIS.
There were some comments on the Draft EIS about safety and recreation. See Response to
Comments 14 and 45,in the ROD, Appendix F.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
This analysis included review of Nez Perce National Forest Plan direction, GIS roads, trails,
dispersed recreation and developed recreation map layers, and existing field conditions.
An inventory of dispersed recreational sites was completed by the Forest Service in 2009 and
2010 (Hammer 2009, 2010). This inventory identified the location of 18 dispersed recreational
sites in the project area. Full details are in the project record.

There are no wilderness areas or Idaho Roadless Areas in or adjacent to the project area,
therefore there will be no effects analysis presented in this document. See project record for

The indicators used for each issue by alternative were:
•
•
•

Indicator A – Impact on developed recreation (number of sites)
Indicator B – Impact on dispersed recreation (number of sites)
Indicator C – Fishing access to Crooked River.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Existing Condition
Recreation use along Crooked River is moderate with most use occurring during the summer and
early fall. The Crooked River Road (Road 233) is a popular travel way for motorists on the
“Gold Rush Loop Tour” traveling from Crooked River to Elk City via Penman Hill and Dixie.
Winter use also occurs in the area, including snowmobiling on groomed snowmobile trail SNO1083 located on Road 1803. Campers along Road 233 use these dispersed recreation sites to
access Crooked River to fish and use the camp sites as a base camp to drive all-terrain vehicles
or sport utility vehicles on the Gold Rush Loop Tour to Orogrande Summit, Wildhorse Lake, and
into the hump corridor of the Gospel Hump Wilderness.
Developed Recreation

There are two developed recreation sites and one developed recreation loop tour in the project
area (see Figure 3-34). Campground 4 is at the upper end of the project area and is a designated
campground. Campground 3 is across Road 233 from Campground 4, and has a few dispersed
campsites and a toilet. The Gold Rush loop tour follows Road 233 along the entire project area
and identifies the interpretive sign for the Crooked River mill site at the mouth of the watershed.
Dispersed Recreation

There are currently 18 dispersed camping sites in the lower 2 valley miles of Crooked River (see
Table 3-43, Figure 3-34). Many of these sites are grouped and are located off three main access
routes from Road 233. Not all of the sites are likely to be used at the same time. Typically,
recreationists who use dispersed sites will distance themselves from other campers. Therefore,
only three or four of the dispersed sites would likely be used at any one time.

Fishing Access to Crooked River

Recreational fishing is a popular activity in Crooked River. Current access to fishing is by
parking on Road 233 shoulders or driving to the 18 dispersed recreational sites and walking to
the river.
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action)

No direct or indirect effects would occur to existing developed or dispersed recreation sites. The
existing access points would remain and the number of sites would not change. Fishing access to
Crooked River would not change.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action)

Short-term effects to developed and dispersed recreation sites would occur during the
implementation of the project. Campgrounds 3 and 4 and 18 dispersed sites would be closed
seasonally during construction of the proposed action (April through November), for up to
6 years.
Long term, the access points to the dispersed campsites in the lower 2 miles would remain the
same under this alternative. New dispersed sites would not physically be created; however, the
opportunity to camp within the same vicinity of the current dispersed camp sites would remain.
There would be no changes to the developed camp sites under this alternative. There would be
no long-term impacts to developed or dispersed recreation, as the proposed action would
maintain campsites in the project area.
Short-term effects to fishing access to Crooked River would be similar to effects to dispersed
recreational sites. Fish would be in the bypass channel, but the area closure would limit access
in the short term. Long-term fishing access would be similar to the existing condition.
Floodplain roughness may make access along Crooked River more difficult because of log
placement in the floodplain, but access points to the river would remain the same.

Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects area includes the Crooked River watershed (Figure 3-34). The
Orogrande Community Protection project overlaps and is adjacent to the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project area, and it is possible that the proposed action and the Orogrande project
could be implemented concurrently, possibly affecting all developed and dispersed recreation in
the Crooked River drainage. The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project
is upstream of the proposed action and would not occur at the same time. This would allow for
camping in either the Narrows or Meanders during the estimated 10-year construction period.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Time Frame

The implementation period for the proposed action would overlap that of the Orogrande
Community Protection project. The proposed action and the proposed Crooked River Narrows
Road Improvement project, however, would not occur at the same time.
Past Actions

In the past, fire-suppression activities have included storage of hazardous fuels in dispersed sites
for several years before being burned or disposed of as fire wood.
No Action (Alternative 1)

No direct or indirect effects would occur to existing recreation resources, developed recreation,
dispersed recreation, or the groomed snowmobile trail system. Thus, there would be no
cumulative impacts on recreation resources.
Proposed Action (Alternative 2)

Table 3-45 and Figure 3-34 display recreation resources in the Crooked River and Deadwood
subwatersheds. The proposed action would impact three developed recreation sites and
18 dispersed recreation sites over a 6-year period. Design and mitigation measure 33 for
Crooked River proposes a 1-year public notice before the Meanders area is closed to the public
(18 dispersed sites, three developed sites).
The proposed action and the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project could
impact as many as three developed recreation sites and 30 dispersed recreation sites total; these
projects, however, would not be implemented at the same time.
Implementation overlap of the proposed action and Orogrande Community Protection project
could impact as many as nine developed recreation sites and 30 dispersed recreation sites.
There would be short-term effects but no long-term effects to fishing access to Crooked River
under the proposed action. If the proposed action and the Orogrande Community Protection
project are implemented concurrently, there would be additional short-term effects to fishing
access to Crooked River if fuel-reduction activities restrict access to Crooked River.
If the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation and the Orogrande Community Protection projects
are implemented concurrently, the effects on dispersed and developed recreation sites would be
the same as described above for the proposed action.
There would be no direct, indirect, or cumulative effects to the 2 miles of the groomed
snowmobile trail on Forest Road 1803 during construction (seasonally for up to 2 years).

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Design and mitigation measures 33, 35, and 36 (see Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures)
would reduce the short-term effects to recreationists during project implementation. Notifying
the public 1 year in advance that the Meanders area, including Campgrounds 3 and 4, would be
closed to camping would allow for the public to find new camp sites. Keeping Road 233 open
would allow for campers to find campsites in the upper watershed, outside of the project area.
The proposed action would also maintain dispersed campsites in the Meanders upon completion
of the project and would not impact the designated campgrounds upon completion of the project.
This would allow recreationists who frequent the Meanders area to use the same or similar
campsites upon completion of the project.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would be consistent with Forest Plan recreation standards (USDA Forest Service
1987a, pp. II-15 and II-16 [forestwide] and pp. III-15 and III-16 [Management Area 7]). The
project would follow the visual quality objectives (VQOs) established in the American and
Crooked River Project Record of Decision and FEIS (USDA Forest Service 2005a). VQO’s for
the project area are retention in the foreground at Campground 3 and 4, and partial retention for
the remainder of the project area (see Table 3-46). Figure 3-35 displays the Forest Plan’s visual
quality objectives for the project area and surrounding area. The current scenic integrity level
(SIL) is very low.
The VQOs would be met under Alternatives 1 or 2. Short term impact to visual quality.
Following construction, Alternative 2 would plant a variety of riparian and upland species
adjacent to both developed and dispersed recreational sites to facilitate recruitment of native
material over time, thus improving visual quality. To speed recovery efforts and provide
screening, 1-8 gallon sized plants, willow cutting and sedge plugs would be used. Species would
be planted on the floodplain based on community type to ensure higher survival rates and
success of the re-vegetation efforts. Soil salvage in the project area would provide microsites
and water holding capacity for the plants to survivability and success. Full details on consistency
of the project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Alternatives 1 or 2 would not change recreation opportunities in the project area in the long term.
Alternative 1 would not change the condition of existing developed or dispersed recreation sites.
Alternative 2 would maintain the same number of access points to dispersed recreation sites in
the Meanders, some physical conditions at these sites would be treated, and the new floodplain
would be planted with riparian and uplands species. In the short term, the project area including,
campgrounds would be restricted from public use for up to 6 years.
Alternative 1 would not construct or maintain any new facilities. Alternative 2 would not change
existing road and trail facilities, but would install one interpretive kiosk with access to comply
with relevant laws and Forest Service policy.

Air Quality
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation proposed action on
air quality. The proposed action could change air quality within the project area.
Analysis and Cumulative Effect Areas
The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects analysis focuses on air quality within the project area
and the airsheds—that is, the part of the atmosphere that behaves in a similar manner in the
dispersion of emissions—that immediately surround the project area. The Crooked River and
Deadwood watersheds lie totally within North Idaho Airshed 13. This airshed encompasses the
area from the Idaho state boundary with Montana to the east, Oregon to the west, the North Fork
Clearwater – Lochsa hydrologic divide to the north, and the Salmon River to the south.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
No changes were made to the Air Quality section between the Draft and Final EIS.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
The indicator used for this resource was particulate matter.
A “Decision Analysis for Smoke Modeling” was used to select the level of analysis from any
burning of slash piles that may occur (Story and Dzomba 2005). A threshold in this decision
analysis for particulate matter emission is established at 100 tons/year. This threshold is based
on the minimum increase required to establish the existence of a major source for noncompliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Since neither of the
alternatives in the analysis area approaches or exceeds 100 tons/year, no further analysis
is required.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Airshed 13 has no nonattainment areas (areas exceeding U.S. EPA NAAQS). Air quality within
the Crooked River area is considered good to excellent most of the year (NPCC 2005). Local
adverse effects result from occasional wildfires during the summer and fall, and prescribed
burning in the surrounding areas during spring and fall. Smoke from wildland and prescribed
fires usually drifts eastward and eventually into Montana. Restrictions on prescribed burning in
the Nez Perce National Forest have been imposed in the past because of adverse effects on air
quality in parts of western Montana. Smoke produced by wildland and prescribed fires in
upwind airsheds, including southern Idaho and eastern Oregon, has affected the air quality in the
Crooked River area in the past.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Air Quality

3-205

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Locally, all major canyons are subject to temperature inversions, which trap smoke and
pollutants. Temperature inversions can occur anytime during the year, but are most common in
the fall.
Based on fire history information, the range of natural variability in the analysis area probably
ranged from very clear and clean during non-fire months (November to May) to hazy and smoky
for extended periods during the fire months (June to October). Current air quality in the analysis
area during non-fire months is probably close to the range of natural variability, while during the
fire months, air quality is probably outside the natural range (i.e., clearer and cleaner), except
when large wildland fires are burning in the vicinity. This is because under current policy, most
wildland fires are suppressed, and therefore the amount of smoke has been greatly reduced from
previous historical levels.
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 (No Action) — No direct or indirect effects would occur on existing air quality
conditions under this alternative. No particulate matter would be produced and visibility would
not be impaired in any way.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) — Dust and vehicle emissions generated from road activities
and increased vehicle traffic during project construction would temporarily affect air quality
under the proposed action alternative. This alternative requires a greater amount of earthwork
and could result in a longer duration of temporary air quality effects. These temporary impacts
are not expected to violate any of the state standards. There would be no expected long-term
effects on air quality due to this alternative.
Cumulative Effects
Consideration of cumulative effects for air quality differs from the considerations for other
resource areas. Past activities in the analysis area are not considered, except when use of
existing roads and facilities may contribute to dust levels. The focus of the cumulative effects
analysis for air quality is the Crooked River and Deadwood watersheds.
The action alternative would have a minimal and short-term effect on air quality by increased
dust and vehicle emissions generated from road activities and increased vehicle traffic during
project construction. Current and future activities that could affect air quality in the Crooked
River watershed and would have a cumulative impact include potential prescribed burning
projects, including those outlined in the Orogrande Community Protection project and the
American and Crooked River Project (see Appendix C). However, mitigation measures and
procedures outlined in the North Idaho Smoke Management Memorandum of Agreement are
intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of communications about, and coordination
of, prescribed burning to avoid adverse cumulative effects. Present and future use of the analysis

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Air Quality

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

area and activities in the analysis area would not change the current assessment of good to
excellent air quality, and therefore have no cumulative effect.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
To reduce potential impacts to air quality, mitigation measures #3, 22, and 51 would be
implemented. These measures would reduce the amount of dust produced from driving on roads
as well as potential smoke from burning wood chips.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would comply with Nez Perce Forest Plan direction to cooperate with the Idaho
Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the
protection of air quality (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-23). Forest Plan direction also
dictates following the Clearwater and Nez Perce Fire Management Plan, which incorporates
existing interagency plans and assessments. The Montana/Idaho Airshed group is composed of
state, federal, tribal, and private member organizations who are dedicated to preserving the air
quality of Idaho and Montana. The Montana/Idaho Airshed Group Operating Guide
(Montana/Idaho Airshed Group 2010) is meant to provide accurate and reliable guidance to
members of the Group and contains pertinent agreements, guidelines, deadlines, plans, and
procedures inherent to successfully operating the Group smoke management program. The
intent of the smoke management program is to minimize or prevent smoke impacts while using
fire to accomplish land management objectives. The smoke management program is designed to
help burners meet Idaho and Montana regulatory requirements. Full details on consistency of the
project with the Forest Plan are located in the project record. The Nez Perce National Forest is a
party to the North Idaho Smoke Management Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which
establishes procedures to regulate the amount of smoke produced by prescribed fire. This MOA
is intended to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of communications about, and
coordination of, prescribed fire to avoid adverse effects on air quality.
Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 by the U.S. Congress and amended several times, is the
primary legal instrument for air resource management. The Clean Air Act amendments of 1977
established a process that includes designation of Class I and II areas for air quality management.
The primary differences between Class I and II areas are in the protection and processes
provided in the 1977 amendments. Class I areas receive the highest levels of protection under
the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program. This program regulates air quality in these
areas through application of numerical criteria for specific pollutants and use of the Best
Available Control Technology.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Air Quality

3-207

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The Clean Air Act requires that the U.S. EPA identify pollutants that have adverse effects on
public health and welfare and establish air quality standards for each pollutant. Each state is also
required to develop an implementation plan to maintain air quality. The U.S. EPA has issued
NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, lead, and particulate
matter with a diameter of 10 microns or less (PM10) and 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5).
Idaho has similar standards for these pollutants. In general, concentrations of PM10 greater than
150 micrograms per cubic meter for longer than 24 hours, or greater than 50 micrograms per
cubic meter as an annual arithmetic mean, are considered a hazard to public health and welfare.
Similarly, concentrations of PM2.5 greater than 65 micrograms per cubic meter for longer than
24 hours, or greater than 15 micrograms per cubic meter as an annual arithmetic mean, are
considered a hazard to public health and welfare.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would meet the requirements of the Clean Air
Act by following procedures outlined in the North Idaho Smoke Management MOA and
Montana/Idaho Airshed Group Operating Guide.

Mineral Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation proposed action on
mineral resources. The proposed action could change access to mineral claims, lode and placer
claim corners, or mineral resources within the project area.
Analysis Area
The minerals analysis area is the same as the project area.
Cumulative Effects Area
The cumulative effects area is the Lower Crooked River, Relief Creek, Deadwood Creek, and
Campbell Creek subwatersheds.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
The following changes were made between the Draft and Final EIS for the minerals resource
section:
•

Effectiveness of new design and mitigation measures 32a and 32b was added, based on
public comments.

•

See also Response to Comments 46, 46, 47, 48 49 and 50 in the Final EIS, Appendix F.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Information presented in this analysis is summarized from the South Fork Clearwater River
Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998), the Design Criteria Report: Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG et al. 2012), and American River Crooked River FEIS and
ROD (USDA Forest Service 2005a). In addition, a Bureau of Land Management mining claim
report was generated for use in this analysis.
The following assumption was used to estimate the number of lode claims: within each quarter
section, there can be up to eight individual 20-acre lode claims.
For this analysis, the project (Meanders) area includes Road 233 and adjacent sections.
The indicators that were used for each issue by alternative are:
•

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
Historical Mining Use
From the 1930s through the 1950s the lower 2 miles of the Crooked River Valley was heavily
dredge mined, leaving behind large tailing piles and deep ponds throughout the valley bottom.
Gold and silver mining affected more than 6 miles of the river and approximately 200 acres of
the valley bottom. Major mining occurred in the Meanders area using the famous Mount Vernon
dredge (Figure 3-36). For more information, see Chapter 3, Cultural Resources.

Figure 3-36. Mount Vernon dredge in Crooked River. Dredge processing low-grade
placer gravels on Crooked River, about 1938 (Elsensohn 1971:48-7).
Past mining disturbance areas and current mining claims are documented in the project file and
also in Mining Claim Inventory: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Design (RDG 2012),
USDA Forest Service (2005), and USDA Forest Service (1998). Historical mining use in the
project area is also summarized in Appendix C.
Smaller mining operations, such as hand placer mining, sluice box, and gold panning, has
occurred in the Meanders and adjacent areas (Figure 3-37).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Figure 3-37. Miner at work using sluice box in north-central Idaho.
Current Mining Use
There are no patented mining claims in the Meanders area (RDG 2012).
There are two types of unpatented mining claims on Forest Service lands: lode and placer. Lode
claims are for veins or lodes or other rock in place, bearing metallic or certain other valuable
deposits, and may not exceed 1,500 feet in length along the vein or lode and may not be more
than 300 feet on each side of the middle of the vein at the surface. Adits, shafts, or open pits are
features typically found on lode claims. Placer claims are for valuable minerals that occur in
other than vein or lode form, such as in sand and gravel deposits containing particles of gold.
Techniques for removal include panning or sluice box and can range from small to large scale.
Within each quarter of a section, there can be up to eight individual 20-acre placer claims.
There are approximately 3 placer and 24 lode unpatented mining claims in the Meanders area
(Figure 1 of RDG [2012]), within 6 quarter sections (Hughes 2013).
There are two proposed Plans of Operation on file with the Forest Service in the project area:
one along Road 233 and throughout the Crooked River watershed, and one in the Deadwood
subwatershed (see Appendix C).
Other mining activities that have occurred in the past include “recreation suction dredging”
permitted by the State of Idaho. Tributaries to the South Fork Clearwater River have been closed
to suction dredging since at least 2009 (IDWR 2013a, 2013b). The South Fork Clearwater River
and tributaries are also closed to suction dredging by the EPA (USDI-EPA 2013). It is unknown
how long these closures may continue. Gold panning, which has not been regulated by the Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests, occurs on a small scale. Permits for large-scale mining
could be authorized following an environmental analysis.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Access to current placer or lode mining claims is provided through a variety of methods
including existing roads, trails, or non-motorized methods.
Access to Mineral Claims, Claim Corners, and Mineral Resources
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current access to 3 placer and 24 lode mining
claims in the Meanders area (see Table 3-47). Under this alternative there would be no change to
the existing tailings piles and no effect to mining claim access or mineral resources in the
project area.
There would be no effect to existing mineral claim corners.
No change to future reclamation bonds would occur.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would have a short-term direct effect on access to mining
claims and mineral resources in the Meanders area (see Table 3-47).
During implementation there would be an area closure established in in the Meanders area (see
Chapter 2, design and mitigation measure 33). Claim holders would have to find an alternative
access during implementation of this alternative. Construction of the temporary haul/access road
would reduce impacts to the mining claimants and the public by maintaining access on Road 233
during construction activities (see Chapter 2, design and mitigation measure 49); however,
access to existing claims in the Meanders area would be limited for up to 6 years (2015 to 2021).
Access to mining claims with or without an approved Plan of Operation would also be restricted
during implementation over a 6-year period. This would be a short-term impact.
Existing dredge piles (placer claims) would be moved during implementation to reconstruct the
stream and floodplain. Dredge materials are not expected to be moved outside a quarter section
area. This would be a short-term and long-term effect to the existing mining claims.
Future reclamation bonding would increase, reflecting the surface conditions (stream channel
and floodplain) following implementation of Alternative 2. All existing lode mining claim
corners would be protected or re-established to their original locations if they are moved during
the implementation (see Chapter 2, design and mitigation measure 32).

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Crooked River and tributaries to the South Fork Clearwater River are closed to suction dredging
by the State of Idaho since 2009. The South Fork Clearwater River is open by the State of Idaho
for suction dredging for about one month annually (July 15 to August 15). However, the South
Fork Clearwater River and all tributaries are closed by EPA to suction dredging (IDWR 2013a;
IDWR 2013b; USDI-EPA 2013).
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effect to access to mineral claims, claim corners,
or mineral resources in the project area, and would therefore have no cumulative effect.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 and the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would have a
short-term effect on access to mining claims on or adjacent to Road 233 but no effect to longterm access, and would therefore have no cumulative effect. Claim corners would be protected or
re-established.
Foreseeable Actions

Two proposed Plans of Operation are on file with the USDA Forest Service – Premium and Gold
Zone (Appendix C). The proposals are for exploratory drilling within the Meanders area,
adjacent to the Meanders area, and in the Deadwood subwatershed. These projects are planned
to be implemented (2014–2015) during at the same time frame as the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project (2015–2024); however, there is no decision to implement at this time.
Coordination under the approval of a Plan of Operation would be needed regarding access and
activities in the project areas.
The Orogrande Community Protection project proposed action would have short-term effect to
claim corners during implementation and access to mining claims; and no direct or indirect effect
to mineral resources (USDA Forest Service 2013a draft). Considering the Orogrande Community
Protection project and the proposed Alternative 2 (CRVR), there would be a cumulative shortterm effect on claim corners and access to mining claims in the Crooked River watershed. These
projects would potentially inhibit the ability for mining claimants to conduct mining related
activities until the projects are completed.
The other two proposals (Panama Placer and Idaho Champion Placer) are directly adjacent to
Road 234 (Crooked River Road), upstream of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
area. These proposals have not been analyzed in detail but maybe proposed to occur within the
next 6 years.
Suction dredging mining activities in the project area and downstream are dependent on project
consultation with NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the protection of
threatened and endangered fish and their habitat.
The action alternative would not restrict or control mining location or methods in the project
area. Although the proposed action could result in disturbance to individual claims, there are no

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Mineral Resources

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

other current or foreseeable activities that would result in cumulative effects on mineral
resources in the project area.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Impacts to access to existing mineral claims would be reduced by design and mitigation
measures 32, 32a, 32b, 32c, 33, 49, and 50 (see Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures). In
response to public comments on the Draft EIS, measures 32a, 32b and 32c were added to
mitigate the effects to mining claimants from implementation for up to 6 years. These measures
would provide protection to established mining claim corners and reduce effects to mining
claims during implementation. The public and mining claimants would be notified of project
activities as they are implemented. The temporary haul/access road and closure periods would
reduce impacts to claimants who are traveling on Roads 233, 522, or 1803.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The national forest land administered by the Nez Perce National Forest has been divided into
26 management areas, each with different management goals, resource potentials, and
limitations. Management Area 4 (MA 4) deals with mineral resources. The Forest Plan could
not predict where, when, and what kinds of minerals development might be proposed, nor
specific needs for surface resources. Therefore, MA 4 is not site specific, but applies to any area
that consists of active or recently active mining extraction and processing operations. The goal
of MA 4 is to “[e]ncourage valid exploration and development of mineral resources, while at the
same time minimizing surface impacts from those activities” (USDA Forest Service 1987a).
Specific standards for water resources in MA 4 are to meet established fishery/water quality
objectives for all “prescription watersheds” (USDA Forest Service 1987a). Forest Plan
Amendment No. 3 (USDA Forest Service1989) makes changes and adds the following
statements, which apply to this project:
•

Page II-23 of Forest Plan: Approximately 56 percent of the Nez Perce National Forest is
open to mineral entry under the general mining laws with no restrictions other than valid
existing rights and such surface resource protection measures as may be required under
36 CFR 228.

•

Page III-11 of the Forest Plan, Management Area 4: The stated goal is to encourage
exploration and development of mineral resources, while at the same time minimizing
surface impacts from those activities.

•

Appendix O-16 of the Forest Plan, Item 2m: The monitoring plan will be a tracking
mechanism to make sure that operating plans and bonds accurately reflect the current
level of activity, that reclamation work is properly completed and the bond returned upon
cessation of mining, and that a reasonable degree of uniformity is maintained.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Within the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area there are no lands considered to be
managed as Management Area 4 at this time.
The Forest Plan’s forestwide standards for minerals resources would be met for this project
(USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-23). Reasonable access would be provided to prospect,
explore, develop, and produce mineral resources for general access to a claim but does not apply
to the project for mining that would create a significant disturbance since there are no current
approved Plans of Operation in the project area. Details on consistency of the project with the
Forest Plan are located in the project record.
Alternative 1 (No Action) would not change existing access to minerals claims. Alternative 2
would change existing access during implementation in the Meanders area for up to 6 years.
Long-term access would remain the same as exists currently.
Claimants (lode and placer claims) were notified about this project and received a copy of the
scoping letter for comment. Permission is not required to enter any of the claims associated with
this project since none of the claims have recognized surface rights.
Other Laws and Regulations
Several laws regulate exploration or mining on National Forest System lands. The Organic
Administration Act requires the Forest Service, as the land manager, to minimize environmental
impacts without materially interfering with a mining claimant’s rights under the General Mining
Laws. Since mining is a legitimate use of the national forest, the Forest Service is mandated to
integrate the development and use of minerals with the use of other resources to the extent
possible under the laws governing minerals disposal.
Forest Service regulations (36 CFR 228, Subpart A) give the authorized national forest officer
the authority to approve Plans of Operation and to require claimants to take measures to prevent
adverse impacts from occurring as a result of their mining activities. Mining claimants are
required to conduct operations in an environmentally sound manner in conformance with these
regulations and with their approved Plan of Operations. While the Forest Service may influence
aspects of an operation that affect surface resources, it may not prevent mining claimants from
exercising their statutory right to enter upon their claims to search for and extract minerals.
Provided that the land in question is open to mineral entry, the Forest Service has no regulatory
basis to prohibit legitimate mining activities. There are two proposed Plans of Operation in the
project area, but they have not been approved at this time.
The Forest Service is required by law to provide reasonable access to valid existing mineral
rights, regardless of their form, whether it be an unpatented claim, lease, or private property
(such as a patented claim), or subsurface mineral right. An unpatented claim is an implied
property right that can be held, sold, or inherited, and access is regulated under the Mining Law
of 1872. Rights are restricted to the extraction and development of a mineral deposit. No land
ownership is conveyed under these claims. Patented claims are private property, in which the

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Mineral Resources

3-216

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

federal government has passed its title to the claimant, giving the claimant title to the locatable
minerals and, in most cases, the surface and all resources. There are no patented claims in the
project area. Only unpatented federal mining claims exist in the project area. Reasonable access
to mining claims would be provided under the proposed action (Alternative 2). Three design and
mitigation measures were added regarding access to mining claims during and following
implementation, including movement of mineral resources.
A mining claim creates a possessory interest in the land, which may be bartered, sold,
mortgaged, or transferred by law, in whole or in part, as any other real property. A locator
acquires rights against other possible locators when the locator has complied with the applicable
federal and state laws. The claimant has the right to dispose of all locatable minerals on a
mining claim. The proposed action (Alternative 2) would not change the right of the mining
claimant to dispose of locatable minerals from an existing mining claim.
The Forest Service must respect claims and claimants’ property by taking precautions to avoid
damage to claim corner markers, excavations, and other mining improvements and equipment.
The claimant has a number of other rights, including: reasonable access to the claim; the right to
use the surface for prospecting, mining, and processing (but not exclusive possession); the use of
timber as necessary for the mining operation; and the right to clear timber as necessary for
mining (claimant cannot sell the timber). Design and mitigation measures have been developed
for the action alternative to protect claim corner markers. There are no currently approved
excavations, mining equipment, or improvements that have been identified in the project area.

Transportation
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project alternatives
on transportation. The proposed project may impact public access on Road 233 during and
following implementation.
Public comments about the transportation system were focused on the Narrows Road proposed
action. Some public comments identified concerns about the proposed improvements
(aggregate), safety of traveling on roadways, and the cost of activities. There were specific
concerns about impacts to access from State Highway 14 to the community of Orogrande. The
community of Orogrande is accessed via road by Road 233 (Crooked River) or, alternatively, by
Roads 1803 (Wheeler Mountain Road), 522 (Deadwood Road), and 233 (Crooked River Road)
(see Figure 1-1). See Chapter 2, Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study,
for more information.
Analysis Area
The analysis area includes roads in the project area, specifically Road 233.
Cumulative Effects Area
The cumulative effects area is the same as the analysis area.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
No changes were made to the Transportation section between the Draft and Final EIS. See also
Response to Comments 51, 52, and 53 in the Final EIS, Appendix F.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Information from preliminary design products was used for basic inventory and analysis. In
addition, for matters related to jurisdiction, discussions were held with the Idaho County
road manager.
The indicators used for each issue were:
•

Existing Condition

There are no current traffic delays along Road 233 adjacent to the Meanders.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current access on Roads 233. Alternative 2
(Proposed Action) would cause some short-term delays as equipment and supplies are mobilized
into the Meanders area. This would occur over a short duration (e.g., week-long) period during
spring or summer and again in late fall when equipment is moved out of the area. The
construction of the temporary access road and bypass channel would reduce delays and maintain
access on Road 233 during implementation. Implementation could take multiple years.
Cumulative Effects

Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effect on traffic delays and, therefore, no
cumulative effect.
Short-term adverse effects of traffic delays would be present under Alternative 2 or the proposed
Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project. Other ongoing road treatment activities,
such as surfacing placement or culvert maintenance, may also cause traffic delays. Because no
other construction is proposed at the same time (2015–2021), there would be no cumulative
effects.
Indicator B – Safety of Traveling on Roadways (Road 233)
Existing Condition

All roads accessing Orogrande are single-lane roadways.
The existing Road 233 has limited vehicle turnouts available to allow for opposing traffic to
pass. This is especially the case in the section through the Narrows. In addition, due to the close
proximity of Crooked River to Road 233 through the Narrows, seasonal flood flows can erode
the roadway shoulder, causing roadway widths to be reduced. Existing grades on Road 233 are
generally mild with most of the length being less than 5% gradient.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 would have no direct or indirect effects to safely traveling on Road 233 because
no construction would occur. The existing conditions on roadways would continue.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Transportation

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Alternative 2 would have construction traffic present on the lower 2 miles of Road 233 for up to
6 years. This construction traffic would pose an incremental risk to traveling the roadway.
Several design and mitigation measures have been developed to mitigate these risks (23, 33, 49,
and 50). Design and mitigation measure 23 would complete maintenance of Road 233 to offset
construction-induced impacts during implementation (see Chapter 2). Design and mitigation
measure 33 would notify the public when the Meanders construction activities are going to
occur, including construction signing (see Chapter 2). Design and mitigation measure 49 would
minimize construction traffic by constructing a temporary access road that would reduce the
direct effects to the public. Design and mitigation measure 50 would clear debris and equipment
off Road 233 as the project is implemented.
Cumulative Effects

Past actions, including construction of Roads 233, 522, and 180, have resulted in the current
location of roads to be maintained by the Forest Service or Idaho County. Traveling on these
roads has some inherent risks because of their current location, grade, and alignment.
Ongoing activities that affect safety of traveling on these roads are regular road maintenance
activities conducted by Idaho County on Road 233 and by the Forest Service on Roads 1803
and 522.
The proposed Orogrande Community Protection project occurs in the project area and would be
implemented from 2014 to 2019. Hauling of material and equipment on Road 233 could affect
the safety of traveling on Road 233 (USDA Forest Service 2013 draft); however, design and
mitigation measures developed for both projects would reduce this potential cumulative effect.
The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project is upstream of the project area
(Appendix C). The Narrows project is proposed to be implemented after the Meanders project.
This action would provide incremental improvements for safety of traveling on roadways to
access Orogrande on Road 233 through the Narrows to provide additional turnouts and reduced
shoulder erosion. Condition of Road 233 in the Narrows area along 3.5 miles would be
incrementally improved in the road condition through the Narrows. Less seasonal flooding of
the surface would occur.
Indicator C – Cost of Improvements (Dollars, Funding Source)
Existing Condition

No improvements are ongoing at this time. Road maintenance costs depend on jurisdiction and
maintenance responsibilities.

Alternative 1 (No Action) would not result in direct investment for improvements.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) is estimated to cost $2,500,000 to complete stream channel and
floodplain re-construction, and revegetation in the Meanders area.
The primary funding source would be the BPA Fish and Wildlife Program.

Cumulative Effects

Implementation of the proposed action or the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road
Improvement project (estimated cost, $1,498,000) has the potential to benefit the local economy
through the development of construction-based jobs and purchasing of construction materials,
fuel, and other local products. In conjunction with other construction-based projects in the local
area, these projects have the potential to contribute to the economy.
Road Surfacing
Cumulative Effects

There are no past, ongoing, or future foreseeable actions that would change the mileage of
aggregate surfacing on roads in the project area.
The proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project would directly and
incrementally increase the amount of roadway with aggregate surfacing on Road 233.
Cumulatively, this would result in approximately 8 miles of aggregate surface on Road 233.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
Design and mitigation measures 23, 33, 49, and 50 (see Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation
Measures) would reduce impacts to the public or the transportation system from the proposed
action (Alternative 2). The effectiveness of these measures is dependent upon successful
implementation.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would meet Nez Perce National Forest Plan standards (forestwide and management
areas) for roads, trails, and transportation (USDA Forest Service 1987a).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The economics of proposed access developments have been analyzed using proven tools, and
these have been incorporated into the project design. Maintenance of roads in the project area
would continue at current levels (commensurate with use, user type, user safety, and facilityresource protection), dependent upon jurisdiction. The action alternative would meet the
standard to plan, design, and manage all access to meet land and resource management
objectives, State Water Quality Standards, and best management practices.
Impacts from construction would be minimized in identified key riparian and wildlife areas, as
described in Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures. Alternative 2 has been developed to
minimize effects to key riparian and wildlife areas from proposed activities (see Chapter 3,
Aquatic Resources, Water Resources, and Wildlife Resources). Alternative 2 would reduce
impacts or improve conditions in riparian areas. Standards for mitigation of sedimentation
would also be met. Construction and maintenance would provide public access to interpretive
facilities (see Chapter 3, Cultural Resources).
Other Laws and Regulations
The National Forest Roads and Trails Act of October 13, 1964, as amended, authorizes road and
trail systems for the National Forests. The Act also authorizes granting of easements across
National Forest System (NFS) lands, construction and financing of maximum economy roads
(FSM 7705), and imposition of requirements on road users for maintaining and reconstructing
roads, including cooperative deposits for that work.
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 7700 enumerates the authority, objectives, policy, responsibility,
and definitions for planning, construction, reconstruction, operation, and maintenance of forest
transportation facilities and for management of motor vehicle use on NFS lands (USDA Forest
Service 2010b). The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project proposed action is consistent
with this policy.
The Travel Management rule (70 FR 216) requires each National Forest to formally designate
those roads, trails, and areas where summer motorized travel is permitted and to show them on a
Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Once the rule is implemented, motorized travel will be
permitted only on the roads, trails, and areas shown on the MVUM. The Designated Routes and
Areas for Motor Vehicle Use (DRAMVU) FEIS and ROD are expected to be released in 2015
for the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests. Depending on the alternative selected in the
FEIS/ROD, the DRAMVU project decision would: eliminate cross-country travel on the Nez
Perce – Clearwater National Forests by permitting motorized use on designated roads and trails,
except snowmobiles; implement seasonal closures on some roads and trails in Management Area
16 (Elk and Deer Winter Range) and 21 (Moose Winter Range), and other areas; add up to five
new trail connectors to create loop opportunities; identify motorized access for dispersed
camping from roads and trails; and eliminate motorized use on some roads and trails to minimize
resource damage, reduce conflicts, and provide a full array of recreation opportunities. Within

the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, the DRAMVU decision could potentially
change access prescriptions on Roads 233, 522, 1803, and spur roads; and eliminate motorized
cross-country travel.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project proposed action would meet Forest Plan
standards, moving forest resources toward the goals and objectives described in the Forest Plan,
and the project’s compliance with all state and federal regulations would minimize effects on
Forest resources.

Social and Economic Resources
Scope of Analysis
This section considers the effects of the proposed action on social and economic resources.
Analysis and Cumulative Effect Areas
The project area is the Crooked River and Deadwood watersheds. The geographical and social
scope of the analysis, as well as the cumulative effects area, is the Clearwater River subbasin
(Idaho, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Lewis, and Latah counties).

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
The following changes were made between the Draft and Final EIS for this section and resource:
• More information was added on the economic impact of fishing in Idaho.
• See also Response to Comments 51, 52, and 53 in the Final EIS, Appendix F.
• Additional economic analysis was added in response to comments.

Analysis Methods and Indicators
Existing social and economic data were summarized from the Clearwater River Subbasin
Climate Change Adaptation Plan (Clark and Harris 2011). The five-county region has a
population of about 104,496, with Nez Perce County having the highest population (39,211) in
2009. Idaho County is the 19th most populous county in Idaho and the largest county in total
area. Population levels have increased by about 12% from 1990 to 2009 in Idaho County.
Median age ranged from 27.9 in Latah County to 42.5 in Lewis County. Median age increased
in all of the counties from 1990 to 2009.
Employment was chosen as an indicator relative to Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 32), potential
effect on minority and low-income populations. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project area is in Idaho County, Idaho, and within the Nez Perce Tribe ceded lands. Based on
comments, additional analysis was completed using the Treatments for Restoration Economic
Analysis Tool (TREAT; USDA Forest Service 2011d). This tool was used to estimate
employment from a rehabilitation project within Clearwater, Idaho Lewis, Nez Perce counties in
Idaho; Asotin County in Washington and Ravalli County in Montana.
Recreation-based economics was chosen as an indicator based on a comment received during
scoping of the proposed action. The forest also received comments about potential impacts to
tourism in Idaho County related to the reclamation of the area’s mining history.

Indicator A – Employment
Affected Environment

The most recent income data for the Clearwater River subbasin is from 2000 (Census data).
Average income in 2000 ranged from $14,411 in Idaho County to $18,544 in Nez Perce County
(Clark and Harris 2011). Figure 3-39 provides the household income distribution of the
Clearwater subbasin in 2000.

Figure 3-39. Household income distribution for Clearwater River Subbasin, 2000
(Clark and Harris 2011).
Employment within the Clearwater River subbasin is categorized as non-service (farming,
mining, construction, agriculture), service (transportation, retail, financial services, and
wholesale), and government. Non-service and government employment make up about 17.6%
and 22.5% of the working population, respectively, while service employment accounts for
58.5% of the population in 2009 (Clark and Harris 2011). 1 Since 2000, non-service employment
has decreased from 23%, service employment has increased from 53%, and government
employment has decreased from 23.6%.

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current management in the Clearwater River
subbasin and would not impact the economic or social status of the area. No short-term increase
in jobs or secondary economic activities would be created.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) could create a short-term increase in job opportunities, and
secondary economic activity would be indirectly supported during construction. Job
opportunities are directly related to construction jobs created by the proposed action, including
jobs for minorities and low-income populations. Secondary economic activity includes
purchasing supplies locally, lodging, purchasing fuel, and other such activities. However, the
proposed action is unlikely to result in a measurable effect on poverty, unemployment, or income
rates in the subbasin.
Based on comments, a Forest Service Economist, took a closer look at the potential economic
contribution of this type of project under contract. The analysis used the Treatments for
Restoration Economic Analysis Tool (TREAT) based on Clearwater, Idaho Lewis, Nez Perce
counties in Idaho; Asotin County in Washington and Ravalli County in Montana. For a project of
this scale the analysis considered a $2,500,000 project, over 6 years, 100% contracted, and 100%
watershed and abandon mines restoration. It was estimated that Alternative 2 could contribute
approximately 24 jobs and provide just under million in labor income, or 4 jobs and $161,000 in
labor income each year, over 6 years (USDA Forest Service 2011d).
Indicator B – Recreation-Based Economics
Affected Environment

In the Clearwater River subbasin, recreation is an important social component of the lifestyles of
the local residents, and access to recreational facilities is highly important. More than two-thirds
of the subbasin is forested, with most of the forested lands being federally managed. In 2009,
20% of jobs in the subbasin were in the travel and recreation-related businesses (Clark and
Harris 2011). In Idaho, recreation and tourism is the third largest industry.
In the 2012, IDFG Director’s Report to the Commission, it was estimated that fishing in Idaho
generates about $500 million in statewide retail sales (IDFG 2012a). Of that, about $50 million
is spent per year in retail sales for salmon and steelhead fishing in the Clearwater River basin and
lower Salmon River. A 2005 study by Don Reading, he found that restored salmon and
steelhead fisheries could provide an additional $23 million annual to the communities of
Grangeville and Elk City (Reading 2005).
The project area is a popular recreation area for camping, fishing, wildlife viewing, and firewood cutting. The Meanders area offers both developed and dispersed recreational camping
opportunities. Fishing access in Crooked River is by foot or from a few spur roads that go to
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Social and Economic Resources

campsites. The Narrows Road area provides direct access to Crooked River, although the road is
narrow and has few pullouts for parking or camping.
The project area is currently listed on the “Gold Rush Loop Tour” on an interpretative map
created by the Forest. No signs are located at the site, however dredge piles are visible
throughout within the project area.
Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects

Alternative 1 (No Action) would maintain the current recreation opportunities and not provide
an overall improvement of fish habitat in the Crooked River watershed.
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) would have short-term impacts to recreational activities in the
project area during construction and for a few years upon completion (up to six years). The
project area would be closed seasonally during construction, which would limit camping and
recreation activities in the project area. The same number of dispersed and developed campsites
would remain in the project area and would be accessible upon completion of the project (see
Chapter 3, Recreation Resources). Other areas in the Clearwater River subbasin would remain
open for camping and fishing.
Long term this alternative would improve overall fish habitat in the Crooked River watershed,
which would indirectly improve angling opportunities in Crooked River and the South Fork
Clearwater River. Access to Crooked River for angling opportunities would be improved by the
removal of the dredge tailing piles. Currently, the river is closed to salmon and steelhead
fishing. Anglers can fish for cutthroat trout, whitefish, and other non-listed species. By
providing better overhead cover, instream complexity, and food sources for the fish, localized
populations are likely to increase.
The South Fork Clearwater River is open seasonally for spring Chinook salmon and steelhead
fishing. The duration of the fishing season is dependent on the number of fish returning to the
South Fork Clearwater River. Adult Chinook salmon numbers returning to Crooked River range
from around 350 fish to about 800 fish annually (IDFG 2010b, 2011, 2012). Of these, only
about 30 fish are allowed to pass above the weir because of the Idaho Supplementation Studies;
half of those fish were females or an undetermined sex. Annual redd counts in the watershed
ranged from 4 to 17 from 2007 to 2011 (Table 3-49), which corresponds to the number of
females and unknown sexes that were passed above the weir. With the completion of the Idaho
Supplementation Study in 2013, more fish may be allowed to pass above the weir. Coupled with
an increase in spawning habitat from the proposed action, the potential for more adult Chinook
salmon in returning to the upper South Fork Clearwater would potentially provide greater
angling opportunities for these fish.

Stocking efforts in the Crooked River watershed are changing from spring Chinook salmon to
summer Chinook salmon. In 2012, 220,000 summer Chinook were released in Crooked River
(Johnson, NPT. Pers. comm., 2014). It has not been determined by the IDFG and Tribe
Production Division how many summer Chinook fish will be passed above the weir after the
brood stock fish are collected. It is possible that the project area could be reseeded with fish
passed above the weir, and upon completion of the restoration, there would be about four times
as much spawning habitat to support an increased number of returning adults. This could
provide a summer Chinook fishing season in the South Fork Clearwater River in the long term,
which would boost recreation-based economics in the area.
The project area would continue to be currently listed on the “Gold Rush Loop Tour” on an
interpretative map created by the Forest.
With respect to comments about the project’s effect on tourism related to the area’s mining
history, Alternative 2 includes design and mitigation measures that would address potential
impacts to cultural resources. Specifically, this alternative adopted eight mitigation measures
(Chapter 2, Alternative 2, Design and Mitigation Measures # 37 to 44). These design and
mitigation measures were specifically developed to ameliorate adverse effects to the National
Register characteristics of site SHC-32, and include activities like the construction of educational
kiosks to inform the public about the history of Crooked River Valley, and the development of a
social business history related to the economic contribution historic dredge mining operations
made to the local economy. Specific to the economics aspect of this issue, design and mitigation
measure #44 states that a social business history related to the economic contribution historic
dredge mining operations made to the local Central Idaho economy (Functional Analysis
Business History - Lower Crooked River) has been prepared. This actions would promote
understanding of the economic value of historic mining activities to local rural economies such
as Elk City, Idaho that would be available to the public.

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences – Social and Economic Resources

3-228

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Following the implementation of Alternative 2, local mining history would continue to be visible
first-hand by the public at other locations on the Red River Ranger, to see other examples of
dredge mining similar to those in the project area.
With respect to potential impacts to tourism business in Idaho County, Alternative 2 would result
in improved fish habitat and would have the potential to increase the long-term economic
contribution to small travel and tourism businesses in Idaho County. In addition, this alterative
includes design and mitigation measures, like the establishment of an educational kiosk at the
site (mitigation measure #40), might enhance the attractiveness of the site as a stop on a mining
history tour. The activities associated with Alternative 2 may benefit the area economy via a
small increase in tourism associated with fishing excursions and visits to local historic mining
sites. However, these conclusions are difficult to analyze with quantitative accuracy as they rely
on speculation grounded in expert opinion (Stockmann and Ng, 2015. USFS, pers. comm.).
Cumulative Effects
Neither the proposed action nor the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project
is anticipated to generate a cumulative effect on social trends such as population or age, minority
status, or income. The anticipated impacts are not in themselves substantial enough to contribute
to changes in the social resources of the project area.
Neither the proposed action nor the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project
is anticipated to generate a cumulative effect on poverty levels, per capita income, or
employment rates. Implementation of the projects may contribute to short-term cumulative
increases in local incomes if several local firms are select at the same time to implement ongoing activities in the National Forest, such as stream restoration, timber harvest, weed
treatments, road work, and ongoing fisheries studies. Implementation of the projects may
contribute to short-term cumulative increases in secondary benefits if several contracts are
awarded at the same time, generating demand for local goods and services. The projects would
take up to 10 years to complete.
Recreation and angling opportunities would continue in the project area and in the Clearwater
River subbasin. Other campsites may be closed within the Crooked River watershed during the
area closure for the proposed Crooked River Narrows Road Improvement project; however,
since many other campsites exist within the vicinity of Crooked River and in the Clearwater
River subbasin, no cumulative effects to recreation-based economics are expected.

Effectiveness of Mitigation
There are no mitigation or design measures for social and economic effects.

Consistency with Forest Plan and Environmental Laws
Nez Perce National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Direction
The project would meet the Nez Perce National Forest Plan forestwide goals and standards for
social and economic resources (USDA Forest Service 1987a, pp. II-1and II-24). The project
would provide a sustained yield of resource outputs at a level that would help support the
economic structure of local communities and provide for regional and national needs. Outputs
relevant to this project—recreation opportunities, jobs, purchasing supplies locally, lodging,
purchasing fuel, and other such activities—have been analyzed. Alternatives have been
evaluated that emphasize intrinsic ecological and economic wildlife values. Analysis of the
economics of proposed changes to access developments was completed.
Other Laws and Regulations
Environmental Justice

Executive Order 12898 requires analysis of the impacts of the proposed action and alternatives to
the proposed action on minority and low-income populations. The order is designed in part
“…to identify, prevent, and/or mitigate, to the extent practicable, disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of the United States Department of Agriculture
programs and activities on minority and low income populations…”
Neither of the project alternatives is expected to negatively affect the civil rights of minorities,
American Indians, or women. No civil liberties of American Citizens would be affected.
Consultation with the Nez Perce Tribe has been ongoing since 2012. No environmental health
hazards are expected to result from implementation of either alternative. The implementation of
this project is expected to provide some limited employment opportunities in local communities
in Idaho County.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Short-Term Uses and Long-Term Productivity
The National Environmental Policy Act requires consideration of “the relationship between
short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the Congress, this includes using all practicable
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to
foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and
nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements
of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101).
An evaluation of the relationship between the local short-term uses of the human environment
and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity discloses the trade-offs between
short-term adverse impacts and long-term benefits of the proposed project. Short-term impacts,
disruptions, and uses of the local environment may be worthwhile if there are long-term benefits
to the environment resulting from the actions.
Short-term uses of and impacts on the local environment are associated with the construction of
the project and are listed below. Discussions of these impacts are documented in the
Environmental Consequences section for each resource in Chapter 3. Many of these impacts
could be minimized with the application of design and mitigation measures, as recommended in
Chapter 2.
The short-term adverse effects that could be caused by the proposed project include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increased turbidity in Crooked River due to instream restoration work and culvert
replacement/removal, however, levels would remain below state standards.
Increased water temperature due to riparian vegetation removal for channel
reconstruction and temporary bypass construction
Disturbance of individual fish and macroinvertebrates
Disturbance of existing wetlands
Modification of wildlife species habitat and distributions of sensitive and management
indicator wildlife species
Adverse effects due to direct mortality or displacement of individuals, or even loss of
habitat (western toad)
Changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive plant species
Increased dust and vehicle emissions
Burying of existing rock, soil, and vegetation by regrading of mining dredge tailings
Exposure of locatable minerals.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The long-term benefits to be gained through the implementation of the proposed project include
the following:
•
•
•

Recovery of natural processes in the Crooked River floodplain, which would improve
habitat conditions (cover and forage) for many of the wildlife species using this area
Decreased soil compaction and surface erosion problems in the watershed
Improved fish habitat due to reduction in sediment yield, increased pool habitat quality,
and improved health of the riparian plant community

•

Reduced water temperatures in Crooked River with potential attainment of water
temperature criteria and removal from the §303(d) list for temperature impairment.

•

Improved habitat quality for wildlife.

Unavoidable Adverse Effects
Under Alternative 2, there would be a small impact on fish within the project area and
downstream to the South Fork Clearwater River. Efforts would be made to work within the fish
“window” as designated by the USFWS and NMFS, and to reduce sediment and turbidity during
construction. Fish would be provided migratory passage for the duration of the project.
Under Alternative 2, there would be unavoidable and adverse short-term increases in water
temperature due to removal of existing riparian vegetation for channel reconstruction and
temporary bypass channel construction.
Under Alternative 2, there would be direct mortality to adult western toads, egg masses, tadpoles,
and juveniles during construction of the temporary bypass channel and dewatering/rechanneling
of existing open water ponded environments; construction of the temporary bypass road;
dewatering of the main Crooked River channel; dewatering of the temporary bypass channel;
regrading/reshaping of the valley bottom, stream channel, and tailing piles; and equipment
traffic. The alternative is consistent with Forest Plan direction to the extent that proposed
management actions would not adversely affect viability of existing sensitive wildlife
populations.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources
Irreversible commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction
of a species or the removal of mined ore. Irretrievable commitments are those that are lost for a
period of time such as the temporary loss of timber productivity in forested areas that are kept
clear for use as a power line right-of-way or road.
Alternative 2 would result in the irreversible and irretrievable use of historic properties. Mining
waste and associated artifacts are not only physical representations of history, they—even when
newly created—give a visual sense of history. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act makes reference to this visual sense of history when allowing that historic properties may
still be eligible for listing even when they have been newly modified, as long as they maintain

Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences

3-232

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

their visual sense of place. Nowhere is this more applicable than to historic mining areas, known
as historic vernacular landscapes. The mining waste and associated artifacts are irretrievable.
Once removed from their contextual resting places, artifacts lose their archaeological value as
information resources, and if restoration were to take place, the inability to recreate the tailings
piles exactly as they were would be irreversible.
Human resources would be used for the construction and maintenance of the project. Economic
commitments are also an irretrievable investment. The estimated approximate cost of the
Alternative 2 is $2.5 million. Funds have already been committed and spent for planning,
design, environmental studies, and completing the environmental impact statement.
Implementation of Alternative 2 would commit an undetermined amount of fossil fuels in order
to transport material and implement other activities.
The project implementation would result in some loss of fish and wildlife habitat and
displacement of fish and wildlife during construction. Stream habitat lost would be replaced by
construction of a new channel. Wetland habitats and their associated functions and values lost as
a result of the project would be replaced.
Proposed project activities would modify wildlife species habitat and would result in short-term
changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive and management indicator wildlife
species. The project would result in some loss of wildlife habitat and displacement of wildlife
species during implementation of project activities. There would be an irretrievable commitment
of resources with the loss of potential breeding sites (ponds) for western toads.
Proposed project activities would modify sensitive plant species habitat and would result in
short-term changes in habitat conditions and distributions of sensitive plant species. However,
long-term habitat conditions would not be irretrievably or irreversibly lost.
The loss of native vegetation to new or expanding weed infestations would be a possible
irretrievable effect if active restoration to native species is not pursued. Intensive invasive
treatments and native plant restoration work would improve habitats and plant communities,
which would minimize and avoid irreversible effects.
The commitment of resources is based on the belief that the condition of the natural environment
in the watershed would be improved by the proposed project. The primary benefits would be
improved fish habitat and water quality.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Public Involvement
This section includes a summary of public participation opportunities; and consultation and
coordination with tribal, federal and state agencies that occurred with the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project by the Forests (Table 4-2).
Beginning in 2011 the Forest and Nez Perce Tribe staff collected data, inventories and analyses
that refined the proposed action activities for this project. Based on comments on the proposed
action presented to the public in December 2012 the proposal was refined (including the removal
of Narrows Road portion of the project; see Chapter 2 and Appendix C) in the Draft EIS. After
receiving comments on the Draft EIS in March 2014 and through the consultation efforts the
proposal was refined in the Final EIS. Based on direction from the deciding official and these
inputs, alternatives, design and mitigation measures, monitoring and effects analysis input have
been updated in this document.
A list of those who commented on the Draft EIS, a summary of all comments received on the Draft
EIS and our responses to those comments are included in Appendix F because of the page limit to
print the Final EIS. Appendix F also displays letters received from federal and state agencies.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Consultation and Coordination
The IDT consulted agencies and individuals for input, through either formal scoping or informal
contacts with specific resource specialists. A summary of public involvement is listed in Table
4-2. Scoping letters were sent to interested agencies, publics, and organizations in December
2012. The full mailing list is located in the project record.

Tribal Consultation
In December 2012, a scoping letter was sent to inform the Nez Perce Tribe of the upcoming
analysis, and to solicit comments related to proposed activities. Informal consultation was
initiated with the Nez Perce Tribe at the Quarterly Meeting in January 2013. Updated
information was discussed at subsequent meetings on April 11, 2013; November 18, 2013;
March 20, 2014; and November 3, 2014. The Draft EIS was sent to the Nez Perce Tribal
Executive Committee Chairman and staff for comment in March 2014. Nez Perce Tribe staffs
did not identify issues warranting formal consultation. Consultation was completed on November
3, 2014.

Federal and State Consultation
Consultation with the USFWS and NMFS was initiated in February 2013. Biological
assessments for federally listed fish, wildlife, and plants have been prepared and are located in
the project record (see also Table 4-2). Consultation will be completed prior to making a
decision.
The Forest will consult with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Idaho Department of Water
Resources, and US Environmental Protection Agency to obtain any necessary permits related to
streams, wetlands, and floodplains prior to implementation.
Investigations used for this analysis meet requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act
and provisions of the Programmatic Agreement between the Idaho SHPO and Region 1 of the
USDA Forest Service. The Cultural Resource Inventory Report has be sent to the Idaho State
Historic Preservation Office. Final concurrence has been received from Idaho State Historic
Preservation Officer for the Crooked River Rehabilitation project.
Based on comments from the Idaho Water Resource Board, the Forests requested approval to
undertake a stream channel reconstruction project on the Crooked River, a State Designated
Recreation River, in January 2014. Approval was received in March 2014.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

LAWS AND REGULATIONS

As part of the analysis for this project, the IDT evaluated various alternatives under the laws,
regulations, and requirements relating to federal natural resource management. Several of the
design and mitigation measures presented in Chapter 2 were developed and incorporated to
ensure that these requirements would be met. Additional details on laws and regulations can be
found in Chapter 1 (Regulatory Framework), Chapter 2 (Design and Mitigation Measures),
Chapter 3 (by resource), and/or the project record. Chapter 1 contains information on the Nez
Perce Forest Plan Direction, and Tribal Treaty Rights. The project record has a full description of
Forest Plan consistency, by resource.

Clean Air Act
The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963 and amended numerous times since then, is the primary legal
authority governing air quality management. This Act provides the framework for national,
state, and local efforts to protect air quality. This project is not expected to have impacts to air
quality. The Montana/Idaho State Airshed Group was formed to coordinate all prescribed
burning activities in order to minimize or prevent impacts from smoke emissions and ensure
compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the federal agency charged with enforcing the Clean
Air Act. The project area lies totally within North Idaho Airshed 13. No smoke emissions
would occur with this project. See Chapter 3, Air Quality, for more information.

Clean Water Act and Idaho State Water Quality Laws
Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires federal agencies to comply with all federal, state,
interstate, and local requirements; administrative authorities; and process and sanctions with
respect to control and abatement of water pollution. Executive Order (EO) 12088 requires the
Forest Service to meet the requirements of this Act. Therefore, all state and federal laws and
regulations applicable to water quality would be applied, including 36 CFR 219.27; the Clean
Water Act; the Nez Perce Forest Plan, including PACFISH Riparian Management Objectives
(RMOs) and Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas; Idaho State Best Management Practices
(BMPs); and Stream Alteration procedures. Clean Water Act Section 404 permits and National
Pollution Elimination Discharge System permits would be applied for and followed, including
monitoring. See Chapter 3, Water Resources, and project record for more information.
The Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality were consulted on this project.

Endangered Species Act
Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2670 (USDA Forest Service 2005a) directs the Forest Service to
conserve endangered and threatened species and to utilize its authorities in furtherance of the

Chapter 5.Laws and Regulations

5-1

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Endangered Species Act (ESA), and to avoid actions that may cause a species to become
threatened or endangered. FSM 2670 also requires the Forest Service to maintain viable
populations of all native and desirable non-native wildlife, fish, and plant species in habitats
distributed throughout their geographic range on NFS lands. As directed by the ESA, biological
assessments and consultation under Section 7 of the ESA have been completed for this decision.
The action alternative is not expected to result in a jeopardy biological opinion for any listed
species. See Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, Wildlife Resources, and Rare Plants, for more
information.

Executive Orders 11988 and 11990
These federal executive orders (EOs) provide for the protection and management of floodplains
and wetlands. Numerous floodplains and wetlands exist within the project area.
EO 11988 (Floodplain Management) requires each federal agency to evaluate the potential
effects of actions it may take in a floodplain to avoid adverse impacts wherever possible, to
ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management, including restoring and preserving such land areas as natural
undeveloped floodplains, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures
of this EO.
EO 11990 (Protection of Wetlands) requires federal agencies to take action to avoid adversely
impacting wetlands wherever possible, to minimize wetlands destruction and preserve the values
of wetlands, and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and procedures of this EO.
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activities have been designed to be consistent
with the requirements of EO 11988 and EO 11990. As required, the Forest would apply for a
Joint Application for Permits with the Army Corps of Engineers and Stream Alteration permit
with the Idaho Department of Water Resources. See Chapter 3, Water Resources, for more
information.

Executive Order 12898
EO 12898 (Environmental Justice) directs each federal agency to make environmental justice
part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority and low-income populations. An associated memorandum emphasizes the need to
consider these types of effects during NEPA analysis. The proposed activities would not
disproportionately adversely affect minority or low-income populations, including American
Indian tribal members. See also Chapter 1 for Tribal Treaty information and
Chapter 3, Social and Economic Resources.

Chapter 5.Laws and Regulations

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Executive Orders 13007 and 13175
Executive Order 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites) requires consultation with tribes and religious
representatives on the access, use, and protection of sacred sites by land management agencies.
No Indian Sacred Sites were identified in the project area. No changes to access would occur.
See Chapter 3, Cultural Resources and project record, for more information.
Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) directs
federal agencies to consult and collaborate with tribal officials on policies or actions that have
tribal implications. The Forests has discussed the proposed activities and the analysis of effects
from the proposed activities with the Nez Perce Tribe. The Forests has completed consultation
with the Nez Perce Tribe. See Chapter 1 and Chapter 4 for more information.

Executive Order 13112
Executive Order 13112 (Invasive Species) was issued on February 3, 1999, to enhance federal
coordination and response to the complex and accelerating problem of invasive species. EO
13112 directs federal agencies to work together [as stated in the Preamble] to “…prevent the
introduction of invasive species and provide for their control and to minimize the economic,
ecological, and human health impacts that invasive species cause.” Project activities have been
designed to be consistent with the requirements of EO 13112. See Chapter 3, Invasive Plants,
for more information.

Idaho Forest Practices Act
The Idaho Forest Practices Act regulates forest practices on all land ownership in Idaho. Forest
practices on NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to water quality (Idaho Administrative
Procedures Act IDAPA 20.02.01). The rules are also incorporated as BMPs in the Idaho Water
Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be consistent with the Idaho Forest
Practices Act. See Chapter 3, Water Resources, for more information.

Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act
The Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act regulates stream channel alterations between mean
and high water marks on perennial streams in Idaho (IDAPA 37.03.07). Instream activities on
NFS lands must adhere to the rules pertaining to the Act. The rules are also incorporated as
BMPs in the Idaho Water Quality Standards. Project activities have been designed to be
consistent with the Idaho Stream Channel Protection Act. The Forest would apply for a Stream
Alteration permit with the State of Idaho. See Chapter 3, Water Resources, for more
information.

Intentional Destructive Acts
According to the United States Department of Energy (USDOE) Office of NEPA Policy and
Compliance, environmental impact statements must explicitly address the potential
environmental consequences of intentionally destructive acts (such as sabotage or

Chapter 5.Laws and Regulations

5-3

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

terrorism)(USDOE 2006). This applies to all USDOE proposed actions, including both nuclear
and non-nuclear proposals.
Intentional destructive acts at project sites involving fish and habitat rehabiliation are generally
focused on attempts to vandalize construction equipment and materials. There is an extremely
low risk that the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project area would become the target of
vandalism because of its remote location. However, if such acts did occur, it is expected that any
damaged equipment or problem areas, such as areas of hazardous material spills, would be
isolated and repaired or cleaned up quickly by construction or project crews.

Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
Pursuant to Section 305(b) of the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
Act and its implementing regulations (50 CFR 600.920), federal agencies must consult with
NMFS regarding any of their actions that are authorized, funded, or undertaken, or proposed to
be authorized, funded, or undertaken that may adversely affect essential fish habitat. The
Magnuson–Stevens Act, Section 3, defines essential fish habitat as “those waters and substrate
necessary for fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” The forest would

Endangered Species Act. Essential fish habitat for Chinook salmon is designated in the project
area:. Essential fish habitat for Chinook salmon includes all historically accessible reaches of the
Clearwater River subbasin (except the North Fork above Dworshak Dam). Essential fish habitat
for Chinook salmon is present in Crooked River.

Neotropical Migratory Bird Laws
Neotropical Migratory Bird Laws include the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) and Migratory
Bird Conservation Executive Order 13186. The alternatives would be developed to be in
compliance with the MBTA and Executive Order 13186, which authorizes activities including
habitat protection, restoration, enhancement, necessary modification, and implementation of
actions that benefit priority migratory bird species.

Mining Law of 1872
The Forest Service is required by the Mining Law of 1872 to provide reasonable access to valid
existing mineral rights, regardless of their form, whether it be an unpatented claim, lease, or
private property (such as a patented claim), or subsurface mineral right. There are several
existing valid mining claims in the project area.

National Environmental Policy Act
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 United States Code [U.S.C.] 4321 et seq.)
was enacted on January 1, 1970. NEPA establishes national environmental policy and goals for
the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for

Chapter 5.Laws and Regulations

5-4

Final Environmental Impact Statement

implementing these goals within federal agencies. NEPA also established the Council on
Environmental Quality.
Title I, Section 101, of NEPA contains a Declaration of National Environmental Policy that
requires the federal government to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions
under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony. Title I, Section 102, requires
federal agencies to incorporate environmental considerations in their planning and decisionmaking through a systematic interdisciplinary approach. Specifically, all federal agencies are to
prepare detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of and alternatives to major
federal actions significantly affecting the environment. These statements are commonly referred
to as environmental impact statements (EISs).
The public has an important role in the NEPA process, particularly during scoping, to provide
input on what issues should be addressed in an EIS and to comment on the findings in an
agency's NEPA documents. The public can participate in the NEPA process by attending
NEPA-related hearings or public meetings and by submitting comments directly to the lead
agency. The lead agency must consider all comments received from the public and other parties
on NEPA documents during the comment period.
The requirements of NEPA, as specified in 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 1500, have been
fully applied through this project planning effort. The Draft EIS and Final EIS, and the
comprehensive analyses and public involvement steps which they incorporate, comply with the
letter and intent of NEPA. The Final EIS analyzed a reasonable range of alternatives, including
no action, and discloses the expected environmental effects of each alternative within the context
of identified issues. This project is in full compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act.

National Forest Management Act
The National Forest Management Act (NFMA [16 U.S.C. 1600–1614, as amended]) reorganized,
expanded, and otherwise amended the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act
of 1974, which called for the management of renewable resources on NFS lands. NFMA
requires the Secretary of Agriculture to assess forest lands; develop a management program
based on multiple-use, sustained-yield principles; and implement a resource management plan
for each unit of the NFS. It is the primary statute governing the administration of national
forests. The Forest has implemented a resource management plan: the Nez Perce Forest Plan.
Activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project have been designed to be
consistent with the NFMA and Nez Perce Forest Plan. See Chapter 3, Soil Resources, for more
information.

National Historic Preservation Act
Section 101 of NEPA requires federal agencies to preserve important historic, cultural, and
natural aspects of our national heritage. The legal processes associated with the protection and

Chapter 5.Laws and Regulations

5-5

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

preservation of these resources is outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(NHPA [36 CFR 800]) and subsequent amendments. Passed by Congress 2 years before NEPA,
the NHPA sets forth a framework for determining if a project is an “undertaking” that has the
potential to affect cultural resources. The implementing regulations also outline the processes
for identifying, evaluating, assessing effects, and protecting such properties. The coordination or
linkage between the Section 106 process of the NHPA and the mandate to preserve our national
heritage under NEPA is well understood and is formally established in 36 CFR 800.3b and
800.8. The terminology of “…important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national
heritage” found in NEPA includes those resources defined as “historic properties” under the
NHPA [36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)]. It is thus the Section 106 process that agencies utilize to consider,
manage, and protect historic properties during the planning and implementing stages of federal
projects. The Forest meets its responsibilities under NHPA through compliance with the terms
of a Programmatic Agreement (PA) signed among Region 1 of the Forest Service, the Idaho
State Historic Preservation Office, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. See
Chapter 3, Cultural Resources, for more information.

Region 1 Soil Quality Standards
Region 1 soil quality standards (USDA Forest Service 1999) specify that at least 85% of an
activity area (defined as a land area affected by a management activity) must have soil that is in
satisfactory condition. In other words, detrimental impacts (including compaction, displacement,
rutting, severe burning, surface erosion, and mass wasting) shall be less than 15% of an activity
area. In areas where more than 15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities, the
cumulative detrimental effects from proposed activities, including restoration, shall not exceed
the conditions prior to the proposed activity and should move toward a net improvement in soil
quality. Project design criteria would ensure that soil quality standards are met. See Chapter 3,
Soil Resources, and Appendix D for more information.

Appendix B- Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis
Introduction
As the lead agency, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests is proposing the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project to improve fisheries habitat in Crooked River by restoring stream
and floodplain functions, restoring instream fish habitat complexity, and improving water
quality, on the Red River Ranger District. In cooperation with the Nez Perce Tribe, Bonneville
Power Administration, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Forest Service is
preparing the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Environmental Impact Statement (EIS),
which will evaluate different alternatives for meeting the purpose of the project. At the end of
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, the Final EIS has been prepared, and
the Deciding Official of the Forest Service will select an alternative for implementation in the
Record of Decision.
As part of this EIS process, the Forest Service has prepared this Section 404(b)(1) Practicability
Analysis to provide information to assist the USACE with a permit decision under Section 404
of the Clean Water Act. The purpose of the analysis is to ensure that the Least Environmentally
Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) is carried forward for detailed study in this Final
EIS.
Important Note: Alternatives in this appendix are described and compared to each other in
this section only. The alternative numbers and descriptions are not the same as the
alternative numbers described in Chapter 2 of this Final EIS.
Section 1 – Introduction and Summary
1.1 Introduction and Regulatory Requirements
This analysis is provided to demonstrate that the proposed Meanders portion of the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project design has avoided and/or minimized impacts to
jurisdictional waters and special aquatic sites to the maximum extent practicable, pursuant to the
EPA’s Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines for Specification of Disposal Sites for Dredge or Fill
Material (40 CFR § 230).
This document specifically analyzes and compares alternatives to consider their consistency with
the basic project purpose; the impacts to jurisdictional waters from the discharge of dredged or
fill material; other environmental impacts; and cost, logistical, and technological considerations.
The analysis concludes that the full floodplain grading and stream channel relocation and the inplace shifts of the narrows road are the practicable alternatives that would have the lease impact
to aquatic resources without having other significant environmental impacts.

Appendix B. Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis

B-1

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The Section 404 (b)(1) Guidelines prohibit the discharge of dredged or fill materials to waters of
the United States if there is a “practicable alternative to the proposed discharge that would have
less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other
significant adverse consequences” (40 CFR § 230.10a). Practicable alternatives include activities
that do not involve a discharge of fill into the waters of the United States or involve a discharge
at other locations in waters of the United States. An alternative is “practicable” if it is “available
and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology and logistics
in light of overall project purposes” (40 CFR § 230.10(a) (2)). Because the proposed Meanders
portion of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project is water-dependent (i.e. the project
requires in-water activities to fulfill its basic purpose), there is no legal presumption that a
practicable alternative to the project which does not involve waters or special aquatic sites exists
– either in alternative project location or design (40 CFR § 230.10(a) (3)). In other words, the
project proponent does not need to demonstrate that there is no alternative that would meet the
project purpose and result in no discharge of fill in waters or special aquatic sites.
Federal law requires that “no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if there is a
practicable alternative to the proposed discharge which would have less adverse impact on the
aquatic ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse
environmental consequences.” 40 CFR 230.10(a). The purpose of this 404 (b)(1) alternatives
analysis is to:
• evaluate the range of alternatives
• determine their relative environmental effect
• screen the alternatives for practicability
• identify the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative; and,
• describe any additional mitigation to address residual effects on wetlands or waters of
the United States.
This analysis is not designed to be a stand-alone document. The 404(b)(1) analysis tiers to the
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation DEIS and FEIS, the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
Design Report (River Design Group [RDG] et al 2013), Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
Criteria Report (RDG et al 2012), and the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project Wetland
Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012). More information and details about
the proposed action and no action alternative can be found in these documents.
1.2 Summary of Proposed Project
The proposed project consists of two very distinct parts: the Meanders and the Narrows. This
alternatives analysis and LEDPA determination is for the Meanders portion of the project. See
the 404(b)(1) Analysis for the Narrows alternatives and LEDPA determination. The meanders
portion would rehabilitate the lower 2 miles of Crooked River from mining legacy degradation.
The narrows portion would improve up to 4 miles of road to reduce sources of fine sediments

from the valley bottom road in Crooked River. Up to 4 miles of road would be realigned and
reconstructed out of the 50- year floodplain.
1.2.1

Project Location

Crooked River is a tributary to the South Fork Clearwater River; its mouth is approximately 57
miles upstream from Kooskia, Idaho and 5 miles downstream from Elk City, Idaho (Figure 1-1).
It is located within the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests and the 1855 Treaty Lands of
the Nez Perce Tribe. There are parcels of private land in the project area, most resulting from
patented mining claims. Most of the watershed is federally owned.
1.3 Alternatives Analysis Approach
The Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines require that the practicability of any alternative site be
evaluated on the basis of whether the site is available and the project is capable of being
implemented on the site in light of the overall project purpose. The range of alternative sites to
be reviewed cannot be so broad as to make the analysis unmanageable, or so narrow as to
effectively preclude potentially practicable alternatives.
Several alternatives were considered for analysis, including alternative project designs that
include modified project components, such as modified facilities, layout, size, and scale. These
alternatives were analyzed in order to answer the following fundamental questions:
 Whether there are practicable alternatives consistent with the basic project purpose
that would not involve discharge of fill or other water quality effects to waters of
the United States, including wetlands, in the Project Area,
 Whether there are practicable alternatives consistent with the basic project purpose
that would result in fewer impacts to waters of the United States, including
wetlands, in the Project Area, and
 Whether there are practicable alternatives consistent with the basic project purpose
that would result in an avoidance or reduction of other environmentally adverse
effects
The alternatives for the Meanders will be analyzed separately as the Meanders portion of the
project is water dependent. The purpose of the project is to creat better conditions for fish
habitat, however, the preferred alternative relies on other factors beyond fish habitat.
1.3 Factual Determination and Identification of the Least Environmentally Damaging
Practicable Alternative (LEDPA)
This analysis provides a series of Factual Determinations with respect to the Least
Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA) based on the criteria contained in
40 CFR § 230. The criteria include both direct and indirect impacts to aquatic habitats, impacts
to endangered species, impacts to other significant wildlife and human use characteristics.

1.4 Project Purpose
The basic project purpose, as defined in 40 CFR § 230.10(a)(3), is:
To restore and rehabilitate the pool-riffle complexes and wetland functions of Crooked
River, while strengthening the recovery efforts of federally-listed threatened and
endangered fish species within the geographic boundaries of the Nez Perce – Clearwater
National Forests, as well as the Pacific Northwest Geographic Region.
The overall project purpose is:
To restore and rehabilitate the pool-riffle complexes and wetland functions of Crooked
River to improve habitat for federally-listed threatened and endangered fish species
within the South Fork Clearwater River watershed. Restoration and improvement of
approximately 2.0 miles of river and 115 acres of floodplain, degraded from historic
mining activities, to improve habitat for ESA-listed and sensitive aquatic species in
Crooked River Meanders.
1.5 Project Objectives
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project objectives for the Meanders include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Reconnecting the river and its floodplain to restore hydrologic function
Creating conditions for higher quality, connected wetlands
Restoring river sinuosity and morphology to improve hydraulic flow
Returning sediment transport processes and functions to a more natural, system in
equilibrium
Constructing in-river habitat to provide spawning and rearing for steelhead and bull trout,
as well as spring/summer Chinook salmon and westslope cutthroat trout
Reducing temperature through connection of surface water and groundwater and
increasing shade along all water in the valley
Re-vegetating the valley bottom with native riparian grasses, forbs, shrubs and trees
Improving recreational opportunities within the Crooked River Watershed

The proposed project was developed in coordination with Nez Perce Tribe, Watershed Division,
and the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests. Over the past 25-30 years, many iterations of
restoration in the valley bottom have been planned and some realized. This project, with
available funding, work force, and project support, would be the largest restoration project in the
valley. Many of the short comings in the past were due to high factor of safety and lack of
sufficient funding to complete a large-scale project. Monitoring and observations of past
restoration helped shape the proposed project.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Section 2 – Alternatives Analysis
In 2012, the US Forest Service and Nez Perce Tribe contracted River Design Group to collect
data on the current condition of the project area and to develop design alternatives to restore
Crooked River. After collecting the current condition data, it was apparent that the hydrology of
the project area was altered such that habitat for ESA-listed fish could not be sustained without
restoring the floodplain throughout the valley bottom. The data also suggest that the dredge
ponds are acting as sediment and heat sinks and reservoirs that attenuate spring flows.
During the 1930s through 1950s the entire main stem of Crooked River was heavily impacted by
dredge mining, which left large tailings piles and deep ponds throughout the valley bottom.
Physical changes to the valley bottom have altered stream and riparian processes, and have
affected aquatic and terrestrial habitat conditions that resulted in degraded ecosystem conditions
relative to historic conditions. The lower 2 miles have been altered so drastically that hydrologic
conditions resemble that of a spring-fed creek, in-river complexity is low, the majority of the
streambed is armored, and the re-colonization of riparian vegetation has been impaired.
River Design Group was asked to design a valley bottom that would provide a rehabilitated
stream corridor capable of supporting natural aquatic processes and sustain the habitat
requirements of the focal aquatic species for a range of life stages and seasonal behavior patterns.
This would include an accessible and functioning floodplain, natural stream meanders, complex
fish habitat, and desired vegetation. The project boundary extends from the IDFG weir intake,
approximately 0.1 miles upstream of the confluence with South Fork Clearwater River, to
approximately 2 miles upstream. The valley width includes Road 233 on the east side of the
valley to the base of the hillslope on the west side of the valley.
Alternatives to the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) were conceptually developed as the
design went through iterations over the span of a year, through Forest Service and Nez Perce
Tribe review of the firm’s design and implementation plans. As required by the Clean Water Act
Section 404(b)(1), the alternatives that were considered must examine the potential impact to
waters of the United States and include the Preferred Alternative, the No Action Alternative
(Alternative 2), and any other alternatives that may be practicable and have different potential
impacts to waters of the United States. Alternative 3 includes re-grading the entire 115 acre
project area, realigning the full 11,000 feet of channel, and yearly bypass channel construction,
water transfer, and deconstruction. Alternative 4 includes removing some tailings to reconnect
the channel and valley ponds, but not re-grading the tailings piles or reworking the channel
pattern. Alternative 5 includes removing all tailings and hauling offsite, leaving ponds and
channel in existing condition. Alternative 6 includes the same final product as Alternative 1, but
phasing of the work would be different: work would start at the upstream end and move
downstream each season, with a single year temporary bypass channel, and all floodplain and
channel work for each phase completed in a season. Alternative 7 includes small fixes such as
pond connection, LWD structure construction, or cutting off some of the tortured meanders.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The following addresses the viability of each alternative to meet the practicability test under the
Clean Water Act. It is prudent to examine first if an alternative would result in no identifiable or
discernible difference in impact on the aquatic ecosystem. The criteria of avoidance,
minimization, and mitigation are used to evaluate a projects’ impacts to wetlands and aquatic
ecosystems proposed under a Joint Application for Permit. The relative amount of wetland
restoration/creation and waters of the United States creation in the channel are considered for
each of the proposed alternatives.
Tables B-1 and B-2 display the relative differences among the alternatives for their capacity to
improve fish habitat, improve water quality, improve/expand habitat for riparian and wetland
species, improve floodplain/river interactions, and improve sediment transport processes. Both
adverse and beneficial effects of each alternative on the aquatic ecosystem are shown in Table B2. Table B-2, Row 4 illustrates viability and cost of Alternatives. Alternatives 1, 2, 4 and 7 are
considered to have a viable cost.

Section 3 – Alternatives Discounted for Not Meeting Project Objectives
3.1 Alternative 4 – Reconnect Ponds to the River, no Floodplain Grading
Overview
Actions in this alternative would include removing small areas of the tailings piles to connect
some of the ponds to the main river channel. Connections of this type have been facilitated in the
past. The yellow circle in Figure B-2 indicates a past rehabilitation connection attempt.
Observations of these sites indicate that fish habitat improvement and stream and floodplain
connection has not occurred since the action (~15-20 years) and without greater rehabilitation
measures, will not occur in the future. The gradient of the river channel is currently too low to
adequately sort substrate for spawning and rearing habitat, or to create and maintain a diverse
and complex habitat structure. This alternative would not move the system towards functioning
more naturally. It would also not increase riparian shading, decrease floodplain heat sinks or
increase floodplain connectivity. Figure B-1 is a photograph of past implementation of a similar
alternative. Though the pond is connected to the river, they only have a small inlet from the river
and no surface outlet, with minimal functionality as an off channel habitat type. Figure B-2 is an
image from above, showing the “reconnected” pond system.

Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
This alternative does not meet the purpose or objectives to rehabilitate the valley bottom for fish
habitat needs. The slope of the river would remain too low for proper sediment transport,
hydrologic and hydraulic functions to be restored to the system.
Impacts to Jurisdictional Waters
This alternative would have little direct impact to jurisdictional waters. Some fill would be
removed from the dredge pile areas to connect ponds to the river. Because this alternative did not
meet the purpose and need, it was not taken to full design and the exact areas of wetland impacts
and creation are unknown.
Turbidity would be localized and would most likely not be difficult to minimize and mitigate
with BMPs. Cobble embeddedness would not change substantially due to retained nonfunctioning hydraulic and hydrologic processes. Water temperature would remain the same as in
Alternative 2 or increase due to the river connected to more surface water.
Other Environmental Impacts
This alternative does not address the major disturbance in the valley and so has little effect in the
system. The impacts from this alternative are long-term negative impacts from the continued
degradation of fish habitat. Chapter 3 of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Final EIS has
the complete analysis of the No Action alternative which has similar effects as this alternative.
Cost, Logistical and Technical Considerations
This alternative would not be cost, logistically, or technically prohibitive.
3.2 Alternative 5 – Remove mine tailings in valley, maintain river channel and ponds
Overview
This alternative entailed using large equipment to remove tailings piles from the valley bottom
and hauling to use to build up a road base for Road 233 through the Narrows. The current pond
features would remain, as well as the unnatural meander pattern through the valley.
Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
This alternative does not meet the purpose or objectives to rehabilitate the valley bottom for fish
habitat needs. The slope of the river would remain too low for proper sediment transport,
hydrologic and hydraulic functions to be restored to the system. A similar project was completed
in the late 1980s in part of the project area and very little change in fish habitat condition has
been observed. Figure B-3 is an overview of this project from the 1980s that shows the tailing
removed, but the river pattern has not changed in 30 years. Also, the side channel on the east side
is a connected series of ponds.

Impacts to Jurisdictional Waters
This alternative would have little direct impact to jurisdictional waters. Fill would not be
removed from the river or ponds, or added to either. Because this alternative is not the Preferred
Alternative, the exact areas of wetland impacts and creation are unknown.
Turbidity from the activity would be little to none. Some stream crossings would be necessary
but turbidity from that activity would be negligible. Cobble embeddedness would remain the
same or potentially increase from increased potential mobile sediment on the raw floodplain.
Temperatures could decrease over time with increased shading potential, but with the remaining
highly altered floodplain characteristics (ponds, tortuous meandering stream form), it would take
longer to see decreased temperatures than in Alternative 1.
Other Environmental Impacts
The direct effects of this would be much less than the proposed alternative, but more than the no
action or Alternative 4. Vegetation would be reduced to nearly none, sediment processes would
not be restored as the channel alignment would not be changed, and ponds would remain in
place, which most likely contributes to increased temperatures throughout the project area.
Cost, Logistical and Technical Considerations
This alternative is cost prohibitive from hauling the material up to the areas in the Narrows. The
material from the tailings piles is unsuitable for road base; therefore, it would need to be hauled
off-site, which is cost prohibitive. In conclusion, this alternative may not be practicable due to
cost and logistical considerations.

3.3 Alternative 7 – Small fixes of stream channel to improve fish habitat
Overview
This alternative would utilize methods such as large woody debris placement, cutting off some of
the tortuous meander bends to increase river gradient, or re-connecting some of the ponds to the
main channel. These types of projects have been implemented over the last 35 years in Crooked
River as well as other South Fork Clearwater River tributaries. Observations of these types of
improvements suggest little positive benefit towards restoring the fisheries.
Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
This alternative does not meet the project purpose and objectives of rehabilitating the valley
bottom. The floodplain would remain disconnected and major, long-term fish habitat restoration
would not occur.
Impacts to Jurisdictional Waters
Because this alternative does not meet the purpose and need of the project, it was not taken to
final design and the exact areas of wetland impacts and creation are unknown. The most it could
disturb is 115 acres. It would most likely be much less. Turbidity effects are also unknown as
this is not designed. Due to the nature of past projects and the observed effects, cobble
embeddedness would not decrease over the project area. Potentially, cobble embeddedness could
decrease in localized areas with addition of wood to the river, but overall, would remain high.
Temperature would not decrease as observed from past projects of similar nature.
Other Environmental Impacts
The direct effects of this would be much less than the proposed alternative, but more than the no
action or Alternative 4. Small fixes like additions of LWD, pond connection or meander cutoffs
constructed may improve local fish habitat. However, long term, this level of restoration would
not meet the need of restoring the hydrologic functions of lower Crooked River.
Cost, Logistical and Technical Considerations
Though this alternative has not been planned or designed, there are no foreseeable cost,
logistical, or technical circumstances that would be prohibitive to implementation.
In conclusion, this alternative does not meet the project purpose and objectives of long-term fish
habitat restoration and rehabilitating the valley bottom.
3.4 Conclusion
Alternatives 4, 5, and 7 were dropped from further analysis during the pre-design phase of
project development, since they do not meet the project’s objectives (Section 1.5) and as
illustrated in Tables B-2 and B-3, above.

Section 4 – Viable Alternatives Discounted from Further Analysis Due to Cost,
Logistical and Technical Considerations
4.1 Alternative 3 – 115 Acres Floodplain Grading and 11,000 feet Channel Alignment with
Single-year Temporary Bypass Channel
Overview
This action alternative is larger in scope than the Preferred Alternative. One hundred and fifteen
acres of valley bottom would be graded and the entire length of the channel through the project
area would be reworked (11,000 feet in total). Dredge tailings would be graded over the valley
bottom, but a large, 500+ year terrace would be created against the east side of the valley to
dispose of the excess tailings. There would be 54 acres of bankfull floodplain (inundation
frequency at flows >Q1.1), 18 acres of low terrace (flows >Q10), and 12 acres of high terrace
(flows >Q500). This includes 250,000 cubic yards of earthwork, 70 in-river large woody debris
structures, and 75 acres of floodplain roughness treatment.
A temporary bypass channel would be constructed to divert flow around the work area; however,
flow will be routed into the new channel after completion of each floodplain grading and channel
construction phase. The flow would be diverted in mid-July and re-enter the newly constructed
channel in the fall before an identified date through consultation with USFWS and NMFS. Water
would not remain in the temporary bypass channel over winter or the spring.
Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
This alternative meets the project purpose of rehabilitating the valley bottom for enhancement of
fish habitat needs. However, this alternative risks jeopardizing ESA-listed fish populations by
dewatering and rewatering the main channel in the summer and fall and coinciding fish salvage
operations. Also, a project constraint is to not affect the IDFG collection weir near the mouth of
Crooked River. This alternative, with its increased floodplain grading and channel construction,
risks adversely affecting the weir. Overall, there are too many risks and effects with this
alternative that it would be considered to not meet all objectives.
Impacts to Jurisdictional Waters
This alternative has a larger impact to wetlands and the river than Alternative 1 due to the larger
extent of grading and channel reconstruction. Also, transferring water from the main channel to a
by-pass and back again each summer of construction would create turbidity events, suspended
sediment, and deposition in Crooked River and the South Fork Clearwater River each season.
This would be a much larger impact to jurisdictional waters than Alternative 1. Because this
alternative had too great of impacts to ESA-listed fish, the design was not taken to the full extent
and the exact areas of wetland impacts and creation are unknown. Cobble embeddedness and
temperature effects would be similar in scope to Alternative 1.
Other Environmental Impacts

Appendix B. Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis

B-14

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Due to the dewatering and rewatering of the main channel at the beginning and end of the instream construction time constraints each year, fish salvage would be a very large, costly, and
harmful process. ESA-listed and sensitive fish species’ populations could be at risk of jeopardy
under this alternative. Additionally, in-stream sediment impacts would occur twice a year, and
the following spring of each phase. This could culminate into a very large impact to Crooked
River and potentially the South Fork Clearwater River.
Cost, Logistical and Technical Considerations
This alternative may not be practicable due to costs associated with annual dewatering and
rewatering of the main channel, fish salvage, and regulatory timing restrictions, in addition to
logistics of transferring that much water, sediment mitigations and fish salvage.
4.2 Alternative 6 – Phasing with 4 reaches and complete all aspects of a reach in one season
Overview
This alternative entailed completing all aspects of an entire reach during one construction season.
This includes constructing a temporary by-pass channel, re-grading the floodplain, reconstructing
the new channel and bank stabilization structures, installing large woody debris, rewatering the
new channel, and decommissioning the by-pass channel. Temporary stabilization measures
would be required for the first three phases in the newly constructed stream channel and
floodplain to prevent downcutting of the new channel during high spring flows. Temporary
stabilization measures would include grade control structures to step down the new channel three
feet into the existing channel and address the risk of head-cutting back upstream into the new
channel. Similarly, temporary stabilization measures would be required to transition the new
floodplain to existing ground and prevent floodplain erosion. These structures would prevent
fish passage through the project area in-between construction phases. Constructing a 1-year bypass channel would mean conducting fish-salvage operations twice each year for each phase of
construction, which would vastly increase the amount of take of ESA-listed fish.
Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
This alternative would eventually meet the project purpose and objectives of rehabilitating the
valley bottom for fish habitat needs. However, through the sediment and fish handling effects,
this alternative would have high risks of jeopardizing ESA-listed fish populations. This
alternative also has a high risk of failing in between project phases. A large flow event (> Q10)
would create too much instability in the grade structures and could create downcutting in the
newly created channel and floodplain.
Impacts to Jurisdictional Waters
This alternative would have the same impacts as Alternative 3 in regards to sediment inputs at
the beginning and end of each in-stream work period each summer, as well as the following
spring. This alternative also would impact the same area of wetland as Alternative 3. Because

Appendix B. Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis

B-15

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

this alternative is not the Preferred Alternative, the exact areas of wetland impacts and creation
are unknown.
Increased turbidity would occur through watering and dewatering channels each year. Cobble
embeddedness would decrease overtime as in Alternative 1, due to a more naturally functioning
hydraulic and hydrologic system. Temperatures would have the same response as in Alternative
1.
Other Environmental Impacts
Fish passage is very important through the project area, during and after construction. This
alternative, with the stabilization measures that would be necessary between phases, to be left
over winter and spring, would most likely have fish passage issues that would be unacceptable.
The channel stability and restoration success would be hinged on the stabilization measures
between phases. There is a high risk that spring flows, ice flows, or rain on snow events could
occur and cause the stabilization structures to fail.
Cost, Logistical and Technical Considerations
This alternative may not be practicable due to costs associated with annual dewatering and
rewatering of the main channel, fish salvage, and regulatory timing restrictions, in addition to
logistics of transferring that much water, sediment mitigations and fish salvage. Logistical and
technological methods for the over-winter stabilization of the floodplain and river channel may
be lacking to limit the constructability of this alternative.
In conclusion, this alternative may not be practicable due to cost and logistical considerations.
4.3 Conclusion
Alternatives 3 and 6 were dropped from further analysis during the pre-design phase of project
development, since they would likely exceed $500,000 per year to construct, which is the
funding limit.
Section 5 – Evaluation of the “No Action” (Alternative 2) and Preferred
(Alternative 1) Alternatives
5.1 Alternative 2 – No Action
Overview
Under Alternative 2, No Action, no stream rehabilitation would occur. This alternative provides
a baseline for comparison of environmental consequences of the proposed action to the existing
condition. The results of taking no action would be the current condition as it changes over time
due to natural forces.
The natural recovery process would result in a gradual adjustment to an equilibrium state, with a
more natural ratio of pools and riffles throughout the project area; however, these recovery
processes would be extremely long term. Major flood events would slowly undercut the dredged
materials, scouring and redistributing the piles of mining waste. The redistribution of these
Appendix B. Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis

B-16

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

materials would result in the formation of a more naturally sinuous channel with pool habitat
occurring on the corners, at large woody debris jams, or against bedrock outcrops. Through
these natural processes, under this Alternative, the area would eventually return to a more natural
condition; however, in Crooked River, the expected rebound would be very slow. From
hydraulic analysis, it is estimated that a 500-year flow event would be necessary to move the
material in the tailings piles (RDG et al. 2012). A feasibility study conducted on Newsome
Creek, a system very similar to Crooked River, estimated that natural recovery within the project
area would require between 1,000 and 5,000 years or more (Clear Creek Hydrology and North
Wind 2004). Aquatic habitat would remain degraded and hamper fish recovery efforts in
Crooked River during this recovery process.
The natural recovery of stream morphology and riparian conditions would be very slow due to
the extreme level of alteration across the entire valley bottom. The slow pace of recovery would
do little in the short term to improve habitat complexity and aid in the recovery of sensitive,
threatened, or endangered species within the project area.
Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
This project Alternative does not meet the purpose to rehabilitate the valley bottom for
enhancement of fish habitat needs.
Impacts to Jurisdictional Waters
There would be no activity discharges either on-site or off-site. Dredge piles would continue to
be slowly sloughed into Crooked River through scour action. Sediment transport processes
would continue in a highly altered condition, creating a fine sediment deposition zone in the
channel throughout the project area, thus decreasing spawning and rearing habitat continuously.
Floodplain could take thousands of years to be created and functioning. The Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Project Wetland Delineation Report (Geum Environmental Consulting
2012) describes the current condition of the wetland components in the valley. Table B-1
outlines the current condition of the wetlands in the valley. Emergent and aquatic bed wetlands
are the most abundant, as dredge mining activity left many ponds throughout the valley. In
Appendix A, the current condition and rating of the function of the wetlands in the valley is
assessed using the Montana Wetland Assessment method.
Cobble embeddedness would remain very high, or increase due to lack of functioning hydrologic
and hydraulic processes throughout the valley bottom.
Temperatures would remain elevated through the project area, with very limited natural
recruitment of future shade and cover.
Other Environmental Impacts
Other than long term increased degradation of the system, there would be no environmental
impacts associated with activities from this Alternative. Chapter 3 of the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Final EIS has the complete analysis of the No Action Alternative.

Cost, Logistical, and Technological Considerations
This Alternative has no associated costs, logistical or technological considerations because no
activity would occur.
5.2 Preferred Alternative – 115 Acres Floodplain Rehabilitation and 7,400 feet Channel
Alignment with Multi-year Temporary Bypass Channel
Overview
This alternative would rehabilitate approximately 115 acres of floodplain by moving dredge
tailings, reconstructing approximately 7,400 feet of new stream channel, installing woody bank
treatments, constructing more than 2,700 feet of side channels, creating conditions for 64 acres
of wetlands, and replanting the valley bottom with native plant communities. This includes
190,000 cubic yards of earthwork, 58 in-river large woody debris structures and 60 acres of
floodplain roughness treatments.
Of the 115 acres within the valley bottom, approximately 42.4 acres are at or below ordinary
high water. In this Alternative, approximately 70 acres of the finished project area would be at or
below ordinary high water.
Primary elements of this proposed action would include:
•

Salvage existing material onsite (trees, brush, rocks, etc.) to use in the new channel and
floodplain.

•

Construct a temporary bypass channel to provide fish passage during construction.

•

Construct a temporary access route in the project area to reduce the impact to Road 233.

•

Create stream morphology features, including stream slope, meanders, and pool/riffle
ratios, that would provide quality habitat for fish and allow for a more natural hydrologic
function to maintain these features in the future.

•

Balance earthwork quantities to maximize bankfull floodplain area by filling in tailings
ponds and developing a sloped valley bottom along the east edge of the project area
without removing material from the project area.

•

Stabilize newly constructed streambanks using woody material and brush.

•

Create areas that would support wetland development over time.

•

Re-vegetate the floodplain with native and approved non-native vegetation, and maintain
for several years after project completion through replanting and protection from browse.

Consistency with Project Purpose and Objectives
The project would be consistent with all of the project objectives and project purpose. This
alternative would create floodplain, wetland, and in-channel habitat to support and strengthen
ESA-listed and sensitive fish. It limits and minimizes impacts to jurisdictional waters.

During the pre-design phase of this alternative, the Nez Perce – Clearwater National Forests and
the Nez Perce Tribe contracted Geum Environmental Consulting to complete a wetland
delineation of the entire 115 acre project area (Geum Environmental Consulting 2012). The 166
page report describes the existing vegetation, soils, and hydrologic conditions within the valley
as well as a final wetland delineation. Methods for wetland delineation followed the Corps of
Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (Enviornmental Laboratory 1987) and the Regional
Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Western Mountains,
Valleys, and Coast Region (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 2010).
Table B-4 (same as Chapter 3, Table 3-26) defines the different types of wetlands, associated fill
for the preferred alternative, expected wetland area created and final total of wetlands postproject. Column 3 illustrates the existing wetlands proposed to be impacted under this alternative
and Column 4 illustrates wetland classes expected to be developed after implementation of this
alternative (see also Chapter 3, Figures 3-22 and 3-23). Wetlands outside of the construction
limits should not be impacted. Currently, there are 52.5 acres of wetlands in the project area, of
which 37.8 are aquatic bed or emergent classes. Of these 52.5 acres, approximately 30.6 acres
would be permanently filled and 42.0 acres of the floodplain area would be constructed at an
elevation, in conjunction with revegetation, to create conditions for wetlands. Elevations, in
relation to the water surface, of the different existing wetland types and vegetation communities
were used to design the creation of wetlands during floodplain construction. Approximately 22
acres of existing wetland area will not be filled or disturbed during implementation. The
unimpacted wetlands are dispersed mostly in the aquatic bed, emergent or riverine classes, as
scrub-shrub and forested wetlands are very minimal currently in the project area, due to the
extremely altered state of the valley.

Although mercury was not used in dredge mining in the upper South Fork Clearwater, there is a
small potential to find this element during restoration activities. Past geochemistry studies,
including the Crooked River Stream Survey and In-Situ Toxicity Results (Baldigo 1986), Water
Quality Status Report 80: Crooked River (Mann and Von Lindern 1988), and Idaho Champion

Group Lode and Pacific Group Load Claims: Preliminary Assessment and Site Inspection
Report (IDEQ 2011), have all shown that concentrations of heavy metals in both soil and water
are generally equivalent to background levels or below detection limits. Mercury levels in the
project area have been documented to be well below concentration standards set by the EPA that
would be harmful to fish and human health.
In preparation for channel rehabilitation work in the 1980s, the Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality commissioned several investigations to monitor dissolved and total metal
content and perform bioassays using 1-year-old steelhead and Chinook salmon (Baldigo 1986,
Mann and Von Lindern 1988). Testing took place in ponds and channel sections distributed
throughout the proposed Meanders project area to establish existing conditions. In addition, a
pilot project analyzed the metal content in response to moving the tailings.
For the existing conditions, the studies found that water samples had metal contents within
expected ranges using reference data from Red River, the American River, Deadwood Creek,
and Newsome Creek and comparing to EPA 95% thresholds. The metal contents in sediment
samples were also below the EPA’s established 95% threshold values.
Results from the pilot study found that moving the tailings produced short-term iron levels over
the 95% threshold for total iron but not for dissolved iron. The hazard was considered low since
total iron is bioavailable and the effect was short term.
Aspects of the proposed project that have the potential to elevate turbidity and increase sediment
inputs in Crooked River and the South Fork Clearwater River include: construction of temporary
bypass channel and access road; clearing of vegetation; preparing staging areas; watering the
temporary bypass channel; and re-watering the stream. Floodplain grading activities and new
channel construction would increase sediment production; however, sediment basins would be
constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle out sediment. Design and mitigation
measures, such as installing sediment barriers, not working in saturated conditions, and
mulching/stabilizing side slopes, would reduce the overall amount of sediment that could reach
live water, but would not prevent all sediment from reaching the stream. Turbidity levels would
be expected to remain below Idaho State standards of an instantaneous reading of 50 NTUs over
background or 25 NTUs over background for more than 10 consecutive days. The two highest
potential turbidity events would be watering the bypass channel and then after the project is
complete, watering the newly constructed channel. It is planned to water the bypass channel
during the spring runoff; this method would decrease the impact of the turbidity from the activity
due to higher background levels during that time of year.
The temporary bypass channel was modelled by River Design Group (2013) to design a stable
channel capable of carrying a Q10 flow (1,061 cfs) plus one foot of freeboard. Additional
analysis of flow modeling has shown the bypass channel will be able to maintain a Q25 flow.
The primary risks are lateral and vertical stability. The model results suggest that the presence of
large cobble and larger material (150-300 mm) will result in fairly stable conditions. Recent
observations of existing site conditions indicate that the 150-300 mm material is common on site
Appendix B. Clean Water Act – Section 404(b)(1) Analysis

B-20

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

and reinforcement will not be needed for the entire channel. In addition, the bypass channel will
flow through several existing ponds, which will serve as pools and areas of lower risk of
instability.
Because of lateral constraints posed by the Crooked River Road and the project area, the bypass
channel requires building up a berm along the west bank to prevent flow from entering the
project area. The berm height would vary up to 4 feet above the design surface. The proposed
berm cross section would have a top width of 16 feet with side slopes of 2:1. The berm would
serve multiple purposes including use as a haul road during construction and use as a staging
area for material that will eventually be used to fill the bypass channel after floodplain and
channel construction is complete.
The Crooked River Road (233) is elevated above the floodplain, and set back a ways in most
places from the floodplain footprint. There are two areas where the bypass channel and the road
are fairly close horizontally (25-30 feet) but are separated vertically (>30’). Modelling shows the
road will never be inundated and, as designed, the large material should stabilize the toe of the
slope to ensure the road is not compromised by flow in the bypass channel.
The temporary bypass channel should provide fish passage for a range of flows. The existing
ponds will provide areas of lower velocity and deeper water to facilitate movement up and down
the bypass channel. It will be necessary to inspect the bypass channel following large flows in
order to assess channel changes that could affect fish passage and stability. As modelled, the
average flow velocity of a Q10 flow would be about 7 feet/second (ft/sec) (RDG 2013), but
ranges from near 0 to 11.5 ft/sec. Additionally, the margins should maintain much lower
velocities (< 4ft/sec) to allow passage of all lifestages of fish at nearly all flows.
The temporary bypass channel would initially impact the ponds along the east side of the valley.
According to Figure 3-22 (Chapter 3), those are currently palustrine aquatic bed and palustrine
emergent wetland types. For 3 to 4 years, the bypass channel would be in place as the floodplain
and channel are constructed. After the channel construction work is complete, the water would
be moved out of the bypass channel and the bypass channel would be filled in.
Cobble embeddedness is currently high (80%; USDA Forest Service 2005) throughout the
Meanders. This alternative, by creating a channel and floodplain that are more hydraulically and
hydrologically functioning, should reduce cobble embeddedness through the reach.
Water temperature through the project area currently reaches 20°C and above, numerous days
from June to September. There are some cold water inputs from groundwater most likely, but
due to the lack of shading through the project area, the water remains warm to the mouth of
Crooked River. This alternative would increase potential shading by over 50%. Shade increases
will decrease temperature over the long term in Crooked River. There is potential for a short
term increase in temperature from removing the minimal shade from the floodplain. However,
with this alternative, the most upstream and downstream reaches would not be reworked,
preserving the mature woody species to maintain shade. Also, with the reconnected groundwater

B-21

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

system, temperatures should stabilize and even potentially decrease in the short term. The shade
will take 5-10 years to become functioning along the newly constructed channel, and after 50
years, should reach its potential.
Other Environmental Impacts
The Preferred Project Alternative would result in impacts to all resources in the valley. Most
negative impacts are short term with long term beneficial impacts resulting from the project.
Through mitigation and design measures, short term negative impacts will be minimized to the
extent possible. See Section 7, Mitigation and Table B-6 for environmental impacts. Chapter 3
of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Final EIS has the complete environmental analysis of
the Preferred Project Alternative (Final EIS - Alternative 2).
Cost, Logistical, and Technological Considerations
The Preferred Project Alternative would be phased over several years and would cost about
$500,000 per phase, which is the upper limit of project funding. This includes temporary bypass
channel construction, floodplain grading, channel reconstruction, and revegetation. Logistically,
this alternative has the highest likelihood of success. The area is owned by the Forest Service and
access is uninhibited.
Section 6 – Practicability and Environmental Impacts
6.1 Least Environmentally Damaging
Alternative 1 (Preferred Alternative) will most adequately address a permanent solution to
floodplain function and in-river processes to help restore fish habitat and populations in Crooked
River. In addition, the cost is viable, the technology and access available, and the other
environmental impacts temporary and short duration. Construction impacts will be mitigated as
described in the following section while post-construction activities are adaptive and
manageable. All material created in construction will be utilized in the same construction period
on the project so no disposal or long term stockpiling will be necessary.
Section 7 – Mitigation
Mitigation is a three-tiered sequence: avoidance and minimization, reduction of impacts, and
compensation of impacts through creation, restoration or enhancement of the wetlands or waters
of the United States. The design is intended to reconnect Crooked River and its floodplain and to
restore floodplain and river processes and function to restore fish habitat and populations.
Therefore, the project is a mitigating measure for long-term continued degradation of the system.
Temporary impacts that would occur as the project is constructed require mitigation; this section
describes those planned mitigations specific for water quality protection and for minimizing
sediment inputs to the channel.

7.1 Proposed Minimum Erosion Control Measures During Construction
Aspects of the proposed project that have the potential to elevate turbidity and increase sediment
include: construction of temporary bypass channel; clearing of vegetation; preparing staging
areas; watering the temporary bypass channel; and re-watering the stream. Floodplain grading
activities and new channel construction would increase sediment production; however, sediment
basins would be constructed throughout the project area to capture and settle out sediment.
Design and mitigation measures, such as installing sediment barriers, not working in saturated
conditions, and mulching/stabilizing side slopes, would reduce the overall amount of sediment
that reaches live water, but would not prevent all sediment from reaching the stream.
Sediment effects of fish are dictated by timing, duration, intensity, and frequency of exposure
(Bash et al. 2001). The extent of the effect is higher when turbidity is increased and particle size
is decreased (Bisson and Bilby 1982). Bash et al. (2001) reported that protective mucus levels of
individual fish are lower during periods when instream sediment backgrounds are lower (i.e., low
flow work window), which may increase turbidity effects on fish during this period. Watering
the temporary bypass channel and re-watering the newly constructed channel are the activities
that would increase turbidity the most. The project area is primarily composed of larger cobble
since most of the fine sediment was washed out during the dredging activities, which would
reduce the overall amount of sediment produced during construction activities. Timing of
watering the temporary bypass channel would be coordinated with NMFS and USFWS to reduce
the impacts on ESA-listed fish. Re-watering the newly constructed channel would likely occur
during low flow. However, since fine sediment is already lacking in the project area, the amount
that is mobilized during the re-watering process would be reduced.
Providing a temporary bypass channel and constructing a road that separates the bulk of the
construction area from the temporary channel would reduce the amount of sediment from
entering live water (RDG et al. 2013). As a part of the design, temporary ponds would be
constructed to capture sediment across the work area to prevent any from reaching the bypass
channel or the South Fork Clearwater River. Turbid water may be pumped to the floodplain or
settling ponds to keep areas dry during construction to reduce sediment inputs to Crooked River
and South Fork Clearwater River.
Design and mitigation measures include monitoring to be conducted as directed by the USACE,
IDEQ, EPA, NMFS, and USFWS. As directed by IDEQ or EPA adaptive management would be
applied if turbidity reaches 50 NTUs over background during low flow. The Idaho standard for
turbidity is 50 NTU instantaneous measurement over background, which is considered protective
of cold water aquatic life.
Construction documents, a NPDES and SWPPP will detail the location and type of erosion and
sediment control BMPs. Temporary sediment basins throughout the project area will be in place
during construction and rewatering to minimize sediment entering Crooked River and the South

Fork Clearwater River. Erosion control BMPs including seeding, mulching with native materials,
and planting will be implemented upon completion of floodplain grading activities. The Design
and Mitigation Measures, including BMPs, outlined in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS will be
followed.
7.2 Post Construction
An adaptive management plan may be developed to assist in the following post project inventory
and monitoring designs: vegetation survival, floodplain/wetland, weeds, and in-river habitat. All
monitoring would be conducted on a 1, 3, and 5 year time frame. Vegetation survival would be
monitored throughout the project area using a random plot design. If a large number of plants are
dying, replanting will occur as funding is available. A re-vegetation plan will be created to
follow the above time frames. The floodplain will be monitored for function and deposition.
Wetlands will be inventoried throughout the project area. Invasive weeds will be monitored and
treated as specified in the Final EIS. In-river monitoring may include cross-sections, large woody
debris structures, cobble embeddedness, and water temperature. All monitoring is based on
future funding as are fixes, if needed.
Section 8 – Summary and conclusions
After considering rehabilitation alternatives, Alternative 1 was determined to be the least
environmentally damaging that would still meet the purpose and objectives. Implementation of
this alternative would provide the greatest benefit to the stream.

Appendix C - Cumulative Effects
Summary – Past, Ongoing, and Foreseeable Activities
During the analysis process and subsequent preparation of this Final EIS, the Forest Service
determined what information regarding past actions was useful and relevant to the analysis of
cumulative effects (CEQ 2005). Past, ongoing, and reasonably foreseeable future actions were
considered for each resource to determine the cumulative effects associated with implementing
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. The spatial extent of the cumulative effects
analysis area and the activities considered vary for each resource analyzed. They are discussed
by resource in
Chapter 3. Existing conditions are a result of past and current activities in the analysis area. Past
management activities and their potential effects as well as current practices are briefly described
below. Detailed information and larger-scale maps are in the project record.
A full summary of past and ongoing activities is in the project record. One source of information
that was used to identify activities to be considered in cumulative effects analysis is the
American and Crooked River Final EIS and ROD (USDA Forest Service 2005a). This document
provided a detailed summary of past and ongoing activities in the Crooked River and American
River watersheds. Another source is the South Fork Clearwater River Landscape Assessment
(USDA Forest Service 1998). Forest records were queried to determine the amount and location
of historic timber harvest, past wildfires, prescribed burns, pre-commercial thinning, road
construction, road decommissioning and habitat improvements in Crooked River.
Figure 1-1 (in Chapter 1) is a vicinity map of the project area. Figures C-1 and C-2 display the
project area, analysis area boundaries, and some ongoing and future, foreseeable actions
considered in cumulative effects analysis.
Table C-1 provides a summary of subwatershed and project area information. Past, ongoing, and
reasonably foreseeable activities that have occurred and may occur in the project area or
cumulative effects areas have been considered by various resources, as presented in Table C-2.
Table C-2 includes a summary of activities, including: road management, trail management,
recreation, access management, timber harvest, pre-commercial thinning, wildfires, prescribed
fires, watershed and fish habitat improvement projects, weed management, mining, and grazing
activities. These projects may contribute to existing and future conditions. Table C-2 is
organized by resource activity, time (past, ongoing, and future foreseeable activities), and area.
Resource activities are summarized by two areas: the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
(CRVR) project area and the Crooked River watershed (which is also the Orogrande Community
Protection project area). Depending on the activities and resource area, effects may be addressed
in Chapter 3.
Table C-3 provides a more detailed description of several future foreseeable actions.

Proposed Crooked River Narrows Road
Improvement project, 2022–2025.
Proposed Action – Alternative B would
re-align and reconstruct about 3.5 miles
of Road 233 to reduce sources of
sediment through the Narrows.
Reconstruct the existing road to provide
turnouts, provide a wider road base where
possible (up to 16 feet), provide a buffer
between the road and the river, gravel the
road surface, and provide a stable road
base. Remove bedrock from the hillside
through blasting and excavation,
riprapping sections of the roadway, install
new cross drains, providing a road ditch,
re-surfacing, and planting vegetation
along disturbed streambanks. Excess
material from reconstruction would be
placed to improve Road 233 subgrade

As part of the South Fork Clearwater
River Habitat Enhancement project,
installation of fish habitat structures was
completed in Crooked River channel in
1980s (see Figure C-3). Dredge piles
were removed from the floodplain, and
grass, sedges, and trees planted. The
tight meanders remain unchanged. The
Native Material Inventory completed in
2012 identified the following type of
structures that were installed and are
still in place: weirs, rock and boulder
weirs, deflectors, random boulders, and
anchored large woody debris structures.
(River Design Group and Geum 2012).
The Forest Service led efforts to
improve aquatic habitat for threatened
and endangered fish species by
reconnecting several dredge ponds with
the river and removing approximately
30,000 cubic yards of cobble tailings
(RDG 2012 – Mining Claim Inventory).
To implement the American River–
Crooked River decision, through the
Crooked River Stewardship contract,
the following activities have been
implemented: 13.28 miles of road
decommissioning; 5.06 miles of
watershed road improvement; 11 miles
of soil restoration; 9.26 acres of soil
restoration; 3.9 miles of instream
improvement. Includes East Fork
(2010) and Mainstem Relief (2007)
culvert replacements.
Through the 5-mile to Orogrande

Project Name

Project Description
The Red River Ranger District proposes to approve Premium Exploration’s proposal to conduct
exploratory drilling in the Crooked River and Deadwood area of the Red River Ranger District at
a total of 171 drill sites. Each drill site would encompass a surface area of approximately 30 feet
by 50 feet. A maximum of two holes would be drilled at each site. These holes are anticipated to
be 3 inches in diameter but may be up to 6 inches in diameter, depending on equipment
availability, and would be drilled using a self-contained, self-leveling, and track-mounted drill
rig. A sump approximately 3 feet wide, 3 to 4 feet deep, and approximately 20 feet long would
be dug at each site to contain drill fluid and to allow drill cuttings to settle out. Drill fluid is
composed of water and a clay derivative. Water for the drill rig would be brought in from off site
in a truck or trailer-mounted tank. Each site would be reclaimed and each drill hole would be
filled and plugged when work at that site is completed before moving on to the next drill site.

Proposed
Premium
Exploration Drill
Plan

In the Deadwood area, most of the drill sites are adjacent to or on existing roads. Three sites are
adjacent to Forest Road 522 (Deadwood Road), and are located on turnouts, which could be used
as drill pads to minimize surface disturbance and allow the passage of traffic at the same time.
Two sites would require overland travel to access, and up to two sites could require some minor
road reconstruction, with a maximum of approximately ¼ mile of low standard temporary road
construction to access drill sites. These roads would be recontoured, seeded, and mulched after
completion of drilling.
In the Crooked River area, most of the drill sites are adjacent to or on existing roads or old road
templates that would require no work other than clearing of deadfall to access the site. Some
minor widening of the road surface may be required at some of the sites for drill pads, depending
on the orientation of the drill rig. Three sites would require overland travel to access, and one
site would require some minor road reconstruction (approximately ¼ mile).

Project Description
The Red River Ranger District is proposing a fuel reduction project to help protect the
community of Orogrande, Idaho, from wildfire.
This project would create fuel breaks on National Forest System lands adjacent to private
property and emergency evacuation routes using a combination of prescribed burning and
mechanical treatments. Prescribed fire only would be used on about 2,491 acres; and hand and
mechanical treatment on approximately 1,009 acres. Hand and mechanical treatments would
remove dead and live trees in the understory and overstory, and prune residual trees.
Merchantable trees would be removed as products. Mechanical treatments would be followed by
prescribed burns to further reduce fuel loading. Approximately 7 miles of temporary road
construction would be needed to access treatment areas, including construction of approximately
2 miles of temporary road in the West Fork Roadless Area. Also, approximately 1 mile of
existing (drivable) non-system road use would also occur in this roadless area.

We would maintain desired conditions with periodic under burns every 10–20 years (depending
on monitoring results) to remove ladder fuels. For public safety and to facilitate operations, roads
within the project area, including Crooked River Road 233, might be intermittently closed to the
public while we implement the proposed action.

Appendix D - Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments
Amendment Description and Finding of Non-Significant Amendments
Two Forest Plan amendments are proposed under the 1982 Planning Rule following the
transition provisions of the 2012 Planning rule (219.17; 1982 planning regulations in effect
prior to November 9, 2000 (See 36 CFR parts 200 to 299, Revised as of July 1, 2000)). This
direction allows for amendments to existing plans to proceed under the prior planning rule.
Plan amendments may be initiated, completed, and approved under the provisions of the prior
planning rule for 3 years after May 9, 2012. The two proposed Forest Plan amendments were
presented for comment in the Draft EIS (March 2014). See responses to comments received
in Appendix F. Since these two amendments are proposed as project-specific amendments
only for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, they are subject to the public
notification requirements of 36 CFR 218.
Project-level impacts of the proposed project-specific amendments are considered in Chapter
3, and the direct, indirect and cumulative effects in this Appendix provide the analysis at the
forest level.
The Responsible Official has evaluated the following analysis and has concluded that the
proposed amendments described in detail below do not constitute a significant amendment to
the Nez Perce National Forest Plan, also known as the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service
1987a, as amended).
The following is provided to disclose the proposed amendment text and effects analysis of
the proposed Forest Plan amendments. The proposed amendments are project-specific for
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project.
This appendix is organized based on the following proposed amendments:
•

Soil Resources:
o Forestwide Standard #2.

•

Cultural Resources:
o Forestwide Standards #2 and #4.
o Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource Standard #4.

Changes between the Draft and Final EIS
The cumulative effects section was updated for soil resources, to account for the Clear Creek

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Soil Resources
NEZ PERCE NATIONAL FOREST
LAND AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN
AMENDMENT NO. X (PROPOSED)
PROJECT-SPECIFIC AMENDMENT TO SOIL QUALITY STANDARD #2
FOR THE CROOKED RIVER VALLEY REHABILITATION PROJECT AREA
The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Forest Service to implement restoration
activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area that currently
exceed Forest Plan – soil quality standard #2.
The goal of the Nez Perce Forest Plan Standards is to meet the National Forest Management
Act where management actions will not produce substantial or permanent impairment of the
productivity of the land (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i)).
To prevent permanent impairment to productivity, the Nez Perce National Forest soil quality
standards (Forest Plan, page II-22, USDA Forest Service 1987a) control the areal extent of
detrimental soil disturbance impact by management activities. Soil quality standard #2
currently reads as follows:
“A minimum of 80 percent of any activity area shall not be detrimentally compacted,
displaced, or puddled upon completion of activities. This direction does not apply to
permanent recreation facilities and other permanent facilities such as system roads.”
Standard #2 prevents management from further degrading areas with already poor conditions
but does not provide for the restoration and rehabilitation actions of the magnitude needed
for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. The current conditions have mining
tailings that remain in a departed condition across the project area after 70 years of regrowth.
This project-specific amendment would exempt the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project from Forest Plan Soil quality standard #2 in order to facilitate the restoration of
productivity in the project area.
*** End of Amendment ***

Appendix D. Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments

D-2

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Analysis of Factors
Soil Standard #2 (Forest Plan, page II-22) would be exempted with a project-specific Forest
Plan Amendment for Alternative 2 of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project, in the
project activity area, on the Red River Ranger District. The amendment would allow valley
rehabilitation activities to proceed in areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil
conditions.
Proposed activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include soil
remediation to achieve a net improvement in the project area from past soil disturbance. Soil
improvement actions would increase the array of diverse plant communities associated with a
restored riparian floodplain with concomitant increase in soil communities. The restoration
actions result in higher soil productivity with biomass from grass and forb, shrub and tree
forms instead of sparse trees that currently occupy the site. Soil properties to hold water,
store, and produce nutrients would increase as the site vegetation develops. Site stabilization
actions would decrease soil losses during and after construction. Actions include
decompacting soils, re-contouring to slope, and adding organic matter, including large woody
material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend for soil conditions;
advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment.
Timing: The amendment applies only to the activities proposed in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project, and therefore applies only for the duration of those restoration actions.
The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited.
Location and Size: The proposed Forest Plan amendment would affect implementation of
activities within the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. The project
area and activity area are about 115 acres (Figure 1-1). The project activity area represents
less than 0.01 percent of the total 2,274,146 acres of National Forest System land in the Nez
Perce National Forest. The size of area affected is therefore limited.
Goals, Objectives, and Outputs: The Forest Plan goal for soils is to maintain soil
productivity and minimize any irreversible impacts to soil resources. The Forest Plan
objective for soils is to maintain soil productivity and minimize soil erosion through the
application of best management practices, careful riparian area management, use of
fish/water quality drainage objectives, and soil and water resource improvement projects.
This amendment is fully consistent with the goals and objectives of the Nez Perce Forest
Plan because the amendment would allow activities to restore areas currently unproductive to
a productive state. These activities would respond directly and indirectly to the Forest Plan
goal and objective for soils. These activities would not inhibit achievement of the Forest
Plan goal/objective.
This is a project-specific amendment to the Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2 for lands in
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. This project-specific
amendment would allow the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project to proceed despite

Appendix D. Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments

D-3

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

the fact that the project activity area currently exceeds the 20% compacted, displaced, or
puddled soils standard.
Management Perspective: Amendment of Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2 is specific
and applicable only to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area (115
acres). This amendment does not apply to activities occurring outside the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area. The proposed change would occur on less than 0.01
percent of the Forest; as a result, there would be no measurable change to goods and service
produced in the total forest planning unit (2,274,146 acres, Forest).
For the riverine environment of the Crooked River project, the natural recovery rate was
limited to water’s edge environments after the historic dredge mining. Under natural
circumstances, the deposition of fine soil materials from episodic (100- to 1000-year return
interval) events is needed to approach the reference conditions for this environment prior to
mining. The active restoration advances the recovery timeframe to less than 50 years.
Purpose and Need of Amendment
Purpose
The purpose of this amendment is to allow activities to occur in the project activity area with
greater than 20 percent detrimental soil disturbance.
Need
Past placer mining and harvest activities have altered soils conditions in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project activity area. The current Forest Plan standards and the Forest
Service Region 1 soil quality guidelines provide direction to maintain soil productivity. The
proposed amendment would exempt the project from Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2,
allowing for activities to occur on areas with greater than 20% soil detrimental disturbance,
as long as soil improvement activities are implemented.
Based on the current condition, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for
Alternative 2 to allow for restoration activities to occur in the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project activity area.
Direct, indirect, and cumulative impact of amendment
Direct and indirect effects
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would not exempt the project from Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2. Soil
conditions in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project activity area would remain
detrimentally disturbed. No soil improvement activities would occur.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Action Alternative

Alternative 2 is evaluated in this analysis, and would exempt the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project from Forest Plan – Soil quality standard #2. This alternative would not
adjust the goals, objectives, or outputs as described in the Forest Plan. This amendment
would allow the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project to proceed despite the fact that
the project activity area currently exceeds the 20% compacted, displaced, or puddled soils
standard. The amended standard would be applied to the project activity area.
The amendment would allow restoration, including soil improvement activities, to proceed in
areas with extensive pre-existing detrimental soil conditions. The amendment takes into
account the amount of existing detrimental soil disturbance, and allows the flexibility to
achieve multiple resource objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions.
Proposed activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include soil
remediation to achieve a net improvement in the project activity area, which has past soil
disturbance. Soil improvement objectives are to increase water infiltration, increase soil
productivity, reduce potential for weed invasion, and stabilize bare slopes. Actions include a
combination of decompacting soils, recontouring to slope, and/or adding organic matter,
including large woody material. These activities would establish a quicker improving trend
for soil conditions, advancing tree growth and vegetation establishment.
On the project-specific scale, the proposed activities in Alternative 2, for the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project would move the site from 65% detrimental condition toward
less than 5% in 20 years (see Chapter 3, Soil Resources).
This project-specific amendment applies to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
activity area over approximately 6 years. The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore
limited.

Project area is 43,4731 acres. This amendment adopts the Region 1 soil standard of
15% for detrimentally disturbed soils. This amendment will allow vegetation treatments
and soil improvement activities to proceed in areas with pre-existing detrimental soil

objectives while showing an upward trend in net soil conditions.
One future foreseeable project proposes an amendment to the Forest Plan – Soil standard #2.
Each proposal is for a project-specific amendment to adopt the Regional Soil quality
standards (15%).

forest on two allotments exceeding 20% (3 allotments exceed 15%).

Past amendments have led to a net improvement of productivity on the forest. The results of
this project, and future foreseeable projects, would also lead to a net improvement in
productivity across the Nez Perce Forest, within each activity area. The prior successes
combined with the restorative actions of this project indicate that no adverse cumulative
effects would prevent the Nez Perce National Forest from meeting NFMA.

AMENDMENT NO. X (PROPOSED)
PROJECT-SPECIFIC AMENDMENT TO:
CULTURAL RESOURCE STANDARDS #2 AND #4 AND
MANAGEMENT AREA 3 – CULTURAL RESOURCE STANDARD #4
FOR THE CROOKED RIVER VALLEY REHABILITATION PROJECT AREA
The purpose of this amendment is to allow the Forest Service to implement restoration
activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area, which contains one
eligible cultural resource site that meets the National Register Criteria for Historic Places.
The goal of the Forest Plan is to identify and protect cultural properties that are considered
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. These properties are considered historic
properties (36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)) and must be protected, avoided, or mitigated, during
federal undertakings.
The Nez Perce National Forest Plan – Cultural resource standards #2 and #4 (Forest Plan,
page II-17) and Management Area 3 standard #4 (Forest Plan, page III-9) apply to lands in
the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area (USDA Forest Service 1987a).
Cultural Resource standard #2 currently reads as follows:
“Sites will be evaluated and protected on a site-by-site basis unless larger areas
such as historic or prehistoric districts are involved.”
Cultural Resource standard #4 currently reads as follows:
“Protect and preserve National Register and National Register-eligible cultural
resources.”
Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource standard #4 currently reads as follows:
“Protect National Register or eligible sites from deterioration or destruction.”
Cultural Resource standards #2 and #4 and Management Area 3 – Cultural resource standard
#4 direct the Forest to identify and prevent management from damaging historic or National
Register–eligible cultural resources, but does not provide for the rehabilitation actions of the
magnitude needed for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. The project area
includes one eligible site (SHC-32).
This project-specific amendment would exempt the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project (site SHC-32 in the project area), from Forest Plan – Cultural resource standards #2
and #4, and Management Area 3 – Cultural resource standard #4 in order to facilitate the
rehabilitation of the Crooked River Valley.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Analysis of Factors
The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project would be exempt from Cultural Resource
standards #2 and #4 (Forest Plan, page II-17) and Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource
standard #4 through this project-specific Forest Plan Amendment. The proposed amendment
would allow rehabilitation activities to proceed on one cultural resource site identified as a
National Register–eligible site. The amendment takes into account the amount and type of
cultural resource sites, and the Forest has consulted with the Idaho State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO). This amendment allows other resources objectives to be met
while still meeting the protection requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) through mitigation.
Timing: The amendment applies only to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project,
and therefore applies only for the duration of those restoration actions (approximately 6
years). The temporal scope of the amendment is therefore limited. Future projects would
follow the current Forest Plan standard, until the Forest Plan is revised.
Location and Size: The proposed Forest Plan amendment would affect implementation of
activities at one cultural property that meets National Register Criteria in the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area (SHC-32; see Chapter 3, Cultural Resources section). The
project area is approximately 115 acres, and is located in: T29N, R7E, Sections 25 and 36;
and T28N, R7E, Section 1 (Boise Meridian), 5 miles west of Elk City, Idaho. The project
area represents less than 0.01 percent of the total 2,274,146 acres of National Forest System
land in the Nez Perce National Forest. The area affected is therefore limited.
Goals, Objectives, and Outputs: Forest Plan Goal 11 is to locate, protect, and interpret
significant prehistoric, historic, and cultural resources. The Forest Plan objective for cultural
resources is to inventory, evaluate, and, where appropriate, protect prior to land-disturbing
activities. And, as appropriate, cultural resources would be interpreted for the public.
The objectives set forth in the Forest Plan for cultural resources would not be altered. The
goal to locate, protect, and interpret significant prehistoric, historic, and cultural resources
would still be met. All cultural resources in the project area have been located.
The Forest Plan objective is for cultural resources to be inventoried, evaluated, and, where
appropriate, protected prior to land-disturbing activities. As appropriate, cultural resources
will be interpreted for the public. All cultural resources in the project area have been
inventoried, several sites would be protected, and interpretation signs would be installed as a
part of this project. The intent of the objective would be met.
The cultural resource inventory found many dredge mining tailings. The tailings resulted
from extensive dredging operations conducted by the H&H Mining Company, which
operated a Yuba manufactured dredge along the lower Crooked River from 1938–1942.
The dredge piles of the lower 2 miles are morphologically distinct. Their U-shaped pattern
reflects the technology employed by bucket-line dredges which pivot around a central

anchor-spud. The resulting architecture of the dredge piles is directly reflective of this
unique mining technology.
Proposed activities for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include removal of
these dredge piles and reconstruction of the stream, channel, and floodplain using this
material. In order to move the historic dredge piles with the Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation project, an amendment to Cultural Resource standards #2 and #4; and
Management Area 3 – Standard #4 is needed.
Management Perspective: Amendment of Forest Plan – Cultural Resource standards #2 and
#4 and Management Area 3 – Standard #4 is specific or applicable only to the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area. This amendment does not apply to activities occurring
outside the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area. The proposed change would
occur on less than 0.01 percent of the Forest; as a result, there would be no measurable
change to goods and services produced in the total forest planning unit (2,274,146 acres,
Forest) prior to completion of the Forest Plan revision. This amendment allows other
resources objectives to be met while still meeting the protection requirements of the NHPA,
through the applied design and mitigation measures.
The proposed amendment does not alter the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term
land and resource management. With this amendment, additional projects or activities that
will contribute to achievement of the management prescription would be completed.
The amendment would allow the management area boundaries within the project area to be
altered. The project area currently includes Management Areas 3 and 10. The amount of
Management Area 3 would be reduced by the rehabilitation activities to reconstruct Crooked
River and the floodplain. The amount of Management Area 10 would increase through the
construction of the new floodplain and upland areas. It is a project-specific amendment that
would allow actions that would contribute to the achievement of Management Area10
objectives and meet objectives of Management Area 3 that were expected from these
management areas.
Purpose and Need of Amendment
Purpose
The purpose of this amendment is to allow activities to occur on one site identified as a
National Register–eligible site.
Need
Past placer mining and harvest activities have altered the ground conditions in the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project area. The current Forest Plan standards and Management
Area 3 standards provide direction to identify and protect National Register–eligible sites.
The proposed amendment would not apply Forest Plan Cultural Resource standards #2 and

Appendix D. Proposed Project-Specific Forest Plan Amendments

D-9

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

#4 or Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource standard #4, allowing for activities to occur
on cultural resource sites.
Based on the current condition, a project-specific Forest Plan amendment is needed for
Alternative 2 to allow for restoration and for cultural resource interpretation of cultural sites
to occur in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area.
Direct, indirect, and cumulative impact of amendment
Direct and indirect effects
No Action Alternative

Alternative 1 would not exempt the project from Forest Plan – Cultural resource standards #2
and #4 or Management Area 3 – Cultural resource standard #4. Known cultural resource
sites in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area would remain unchanged.
Alternative 1 would not amend the Forest Plan.
Action Alternative

Alternative 2 is evaluated in this analysis, and would require a Forest Plan amendment for
Cultural Resources standards #2 and #4 and Management Area 3 – Cultural Resource
standard #4. This alternative would not adjust the goals, objectives, or outputs described in
the Forest Plan. This amendment would allow the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project to proceed despite the fact that the project area contains one cultural resource site that
is eligible for the National Register and would be disturbed. The project would be exempt
from applying these standards to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation, in the project area.
This alternative would move toward the goals, objectives, and standards for fish.
The amendment would allow restoration, including retention of representative historic dredge
piles and interpretation of the site, to proceed in areas that possess one National Register–
eligible site (SHC-32). The amendment takes into account the full inventory of cultural
resources that has been completed and allows for other resource objectives to be met, and
implementation of mitigation measures.
Proposed activities in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project include removal and
re-distribution of historic dredge mine tailings. A complete inventory for existing cultural
resources was completed and is documented in the Crooked River Archaeological Survey
(Desert West Environmental 2013a). Mitigation for the proposed adverse effect to cultural
resources includes:
•
•
•

Thoroughly photograph, document, and map historic dredge piles that are proposed for
removal.
Retain a representative sample of dredge piles for public interpretation.
Construct a three-panel interpretive sign related to the history of dredge mining on the
Crooked River.

Record the historic Gnome village.
Perform a social business history related to the economic contribution made by historic

The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (16 USC 470; as amended) requires
federal agencies to take into account their actions on historic properties. The required
regulatory review of effects resulting from federal undertakings is found in Section 106 of
the Act, and has been codified in 36 CFR 800 Part B. The mitigation proposed for site
SHC-32 meets the intent of the NHPA when the Idaho Historic Preservation Officer concurs
on the proposed mitigation package.
This project-specific amendment applies to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project
area. The Forest would be exempt from applying Cultural Resource standards #2 and #4 and
Management Area 3 – Standard #4 at cultural resource site SHC-32. The temporal scope of
the amendment is therefore limited.
Cumulative effects
There have been no past Forest Plan amendments for Forest Plan – Cultural Resource
standards #2 and #4 or Management Area 3 – Standard #4.
There are no cumulative effects with the proposed amendment to the Forest Plan. The
amendment is project specific and limited in time.

Appendix E - Best Management Practices for Mercury Collection from
Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project
Background
Mercury is a naturally occurring element in the environment that has several forms. Metallic
mercury is a shiny, silver-white, odorless liquid. Metallic mercury (inorganic mercury and its
compounds) enters the air from mining and manufacturing activities and from burning coal and
waste. It has also been added to the environment from historic gold mining activities. Soil and
water samples have been collected to test for heavy metals, including mercury, in the Crooked
River Valley Rehabilitation project area by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS; Baldigo
1986), Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ; Mann and Von Lindern 1988 and
IDEQ 2011), and the Nez Perce Tribe (NPT; NPT 2013b) over the past 10 years. Thus far,
mercury either has not been detected or is below levels considered significant based on Idaho’s
and EPA’s Water Quality standards.
Conclusion
Mercury levels in the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project area have been documented to
be well below concentration standards set by the EPA that would be harmful to fish and human
health. It is not likely that mercury would be found during implementation of the Alternative 2,
as described in the Final EIS, based on data collected in the project area. However, if mercury is
detected through monitoring during construction activities, appropriate measures may be taken
that could include development of a detailed sampling and analysis plan and a health and safety
plan.

Comments Received and Responses
All comments on the Draft EIS were reviewed and the substantive comments within each letter
were summarized by topic. In some cases, similar comments from different commenters were
grouped together. Public comments and Forest Service, Nez Perce Tribe, BPA and USACE
responses are provided below. Original comment letters/emails and content analysis of these is
located in the project record. Table A-1 includes the letter number (#) referred to in each
comment.
PURPOSE AND NEED
1. Comment (Letters #04, 05, 09, 11, 12, 15, 22, 23, 24, 25):
The purpose of the project is to straighten out an existing river?
The river is natural as it exists…
Response:
As stated in the Draft EIS and Final EIS, Chapter 1, the purpose and need are to restore channel
and floodplain functions, restore instream fish habitat complexity, and improve water quality in
Crooked River. Descriptions of historic, existing, and the desired conditions have been updated
in the Final EIS, Chapter 1, to clarify the purpose and need.
The purpose and need of the project are to “improve fisheries habitat in Crooked River by
restoring channel and floodplain functions, restoring instream fish habitat complexity, and
improving water quality.” The river, as it currently exists, has an unnatural sinuosity and is
over-lengthened for the overall slope and width of the valley due to historic dredge mining. The
sinuosity, or degree of meandering for a river, is determined by the ratio of valley to channel
gradient. Lower Crooked River, based on the valley slope and width, should exhibit a sinuosity
pattern that is about one-half of that currently found in much of the project area. As stated in
Chapter 3, the river would not be “straightened” but would have a sinuosity of about 1.5, which
is similar to the sinuosity of undisturbed reaches of Red River with similar valley widths and
slopes.
The Crooked River Valley was dredged mined in the 1930s through the 1950s, which severely
altered the shape and slope of the river channel. Crooked River no longer looks like, or
functions, as a natural river.
See also responses to Comment 2.
HISTORIC CONDITIONS IN PROJECT AREA
2. Comment (Letter #15):
Chapter 1, Purpose and Need for Action, 1st sentence states, “Historic mining activities have
altered the Crooked River valley and have led to degraded fish habitat, causing inadequate
densities of fish in Crooked River (a lower density that the stream historically supported).”

Appendix F. Comments Received on Draft EIS and Forest Service Responses

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The forest has not established what conditions existed in the proposed action area prior to the
“historic mining operations” “during the 1930s through 1950s” that is asserted to “have
altered the Crooked River valley and have led to degraded fish habitat”. In fact, it is blatantly
lacking! Further, limited data exists for conditions in the intervening period between the 1950s
and present day. “Data” asserted in the DEIS also appears to be conflicting. Example: Pg. 322, “Due to the high hydraulic conductivity through the dredge tailings in the valley,
temperatures are slightly lower at the downstream end;” while pg. 3-62 states, “these extensive
mining activities….left extensive tailing piles….that has caused elevated water temperatures”.
Rationale #1 - “Restoration” (referred to repeatedly in the proposal) infers a return to a known
existing previous condition. As proposed, this project makes no attempt to “restore” the Crooked
River valley to a previous condition. Rather, the project’s intent (“rationale”) is to establish a
new condition that may have never existed and that would result in “theoretical” improvement.
It is quite possible that the proposed action would actually have detrimental impact, short and
long term. Without a verifiable, established “conditions” baseline prior to project
implementation, there is no way to establish a post implementation result.
I do not argue that past mining activities have resulted in changes to the proposed action area.
However, what those changes were and what the direct impacts have been has not been
established. Physical changes to the habitat cannot be clearly established as causal to
“presumed” species past, present or future conditions.
Response:
The Final EIS, Chapter 1, was updated to present information about the historic conditions of
the Crooked River valley pre-1930s. The Forest Service attempted to locate historic photos of
the valley, but has been unable to locate photos or information on pre-mining conditions.
Restoration, as defined by EPA (2000), refers to the return of a degraded ecosystem to a close
approximation of its remaining natural potential. Therefore, using the term restoration, we are
returning Crooked River to conditions similar to the predicted historical conditions within
project constraints, which are determined by geomorphic and hydrologic parameters described
in Chapter 3, Water Resources. The definitions for restoration and rehabilitation have been
updated in the Glossary in Chapter 5 of the Final EIS.
The design of the new river channel and floodplain was developed to provide a landscape
capable of sustaining geomorphic processes to support desired aquatic habitat and vegetative
conditions. The desired future geomorphic condition includes restoring river and floodplain
functions by reducing channel entrenchment, establishing pool development processes,
addressing stream flows and ponding conditions, and modifying the channel hydraulics to
produce flows that would support a mobile gravel bed (produce spawning areas). The proposed
design provides these conditions. As stated in the Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from
Detailed Analysis section, an infinite number of river configurations could have been developed,

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

all of which would produce similar results and effects because the overall channel and
floodplain functions would be rehabilitated.
The river channel through the valley was historically dynamic and likely occupied all areas of
the valley bottom at one point in time or another through lateral migration. Historic photos
would provide a single snapshot of where the river existed at that time. Although the proposed
design may not restore the channel to the exact condition that existed just prior to the mining
activities, the processes that formed and sustained the river channel historically would be
rehabilitated.
The Final EIS, Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, has been updated to clarify surface water
temperature data.
Surface water temperature data indicate slightly lower (approximately 1°C) temperatures at the
downstream end; however, these slightly lower water temperatures at the downstream end are
also elevated above standards.
The existing geomorphology and water quality are presented in the Final EIS, Chapter 3, Water
Resources.

Do not undertake the project...
...as a long-time resident, property and business owner proximal to the proposed project area, I
request the adoption of Alternative 1 – No Action. There are other opportunities and potential
actions that can improve conditions in the lower Crooked River valley that have less risk, less
impact and much cheaper associated costs.
...Over time, nature has automatically adjusted to the local environment and provided, AT NO
COST, the perfect solution to the encroachments of humanity. Leave it alone.
...Leave Crooked River Alone!!! This is a historical place!!
… The whole of the 2 mile stretch of Crooked River in the proposal should be left intact.
…Idaho County Commission is against the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project…
Response:
Alternative 1 (No Action) provides for no rehabilitation of the Crooked River Valley. The
Forest Service would not complete the project and no cost for rehabilitation would be expended.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

In particular, we [Idaho Conservation League] strongly support efforts to restore the natural
flood plain, natural meanders, topography, vegetation and habitat elements that are important
for both aquatic and terrestrial species. We feel strongly that the project will contribute to the
ecological integrity of the ecosystem and is an appropriate use of mitigation dollars to restore
anadromous and resident fish habitat.
We [Friends of the Clearwater] generally support projects like this designed to improve areas
that have been harmed by actions such as dredging.
Overall, we [EPA Region 10, Office of Ecosystems, Tribal and Public Affairs] support the
purposes of this project and commend the USFS for addressing the historic alteration to the
river valley from past mining.
Response:
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) provides for restoration of the Crooked River Valley to restore
anadromous and resident fish habitat damaged by past mining activities.
The Forest Service acknowledges the support of the purpose of the project.
5. Comment (Letter #10):
The Idaho Conservation League remains strongly supportive of this project, and encourages the
Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests to pursue more opportunities to restore proper
hydrological function in areas that have been negatively impacted by past management
activities.
Again, we appreciate and support your efforts to restore and improve aquatic habitat and
properly functioning streams. We support the project, and encourage you to explore further
restoration activities throughout the forests.
Response:
Alternative 2 (Proposed Action) provides for restoration of the Crooked River Valley.
The Forest Service acknowledges the group’s interest in more and other restoration activities on
the forest. With other efforts in the future the forest will pursue other work in the watershed and
across the forest. See Final EIS, Appendix C – Narrow Road Improvement Project.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The design of the new river channel and floodplain was developed to provide a rehabilitated
landscape capable of sustaining geomorphic processes to support desired aquatic habitat and
vegetative conditions. The desired future geomorphic condition includes restoring river and
floodplain functions by reducing channel entrenchment, establishing pool development
processes, addressing stream flows and ponding conditons, and modifying the channel
hydraulics to produce flows that would support a mobile gravel bed (produce spawning areas).
The proposed design provides these conditions. The shape of the new river channel and overall
valley bottom was determined through successive iterations of hydrologic analysis, terrain
model development, earthwork analysis, and hydraulic modeling. The Design Criteria Report
(RDG et al. 2012) and Final Design Report (RDG et al. 2013) provide the parameters used to
develop the design and the model results. As stated in the Alternatives Considered but
Eliminated from Detailed Study section, an infinite number of river configurations could have
been developed, all of which would produce similar results and effects because the overall
channel and floodplain functions of the valley bottom would be rehabilitated.
7. Comment (Letter #16):
To rehabilitate something (especially an environmental feature) is to restore it to its former
condition. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to restore the Meanders section of Crooked
River to its former condition, or close to that. However, at the public meeting in Elk City on May
8, 2014, we were told that there are no old maps, photographs, or other documentation of what
that condition was. We were told that the design for Alternative 2, the Proposed Action, was
based on the condition (shape and numbers of meanders, vegetation, slope, and other aspects)
of similar valleys elsewhere. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) does not
explain this process. Rather, it appears to take for granted that Alternative 2, which is described
in great detail, must be the best possible approximation for the former or natural condition of
the Meanders. The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) should explain how the
Alternative 2 design was arrived at, and what if any other designs were considered. Both the
public and the decision makers need this information.
Response:
Chapter 2, Alternatives in the Final EIS, description of Alternative 2 was updated to include an
explanation of the design and background information.
See responses to Comments 2 and 6, above.
8. Comment (Letter #26):
My concern is the practicality of dewatering oversized mine waist and the potential release of
mercury into a dynamic system.
Response:
Please refer to the Soils section in Chapter 3 of the Final EIS.

Appendix F. Comments Received on Draft EIS and Forest Service Responses

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Mercury was not used during the mining process in Crooked River. Mercury was sampled in
and upstream of the project area by USGS and IDEQ in the 1980s and 2000s since elemental
mercury and other heavy metals could be naturally present in the area and brought to the surface
during mining activities. As stated in Chapter 3, mercury levels in the project area have been
documented to be well below concentration standards set by the EPA that would be harmful to
fish and human health. Appendix E of the Final EIS provides the best management practices
for mercury collection if it is found in the project area during construction to reduce any
potential adverse effects.
Chapter 3 of the Final EIS has been updated to show the potential of dewatering the river.
Historic dredging of the valley bottom left larger cobble material that has a high porosity, as
described in Chapter 3. Groundwater and subsurface flow paths would likely exist in the project
area during construction and completely dewatering the project area during construction is not
likely. However, a bypass channel would be provided that would separate fish and aquatic
species from the construction area. This would reduce sediment effects and the direct killing of
aquatic species.
To reduce the potential of the river going subsurface in the cobbles upon completion of the
project, the floodplain and new river channel would be regraded to have an appropriate mix of
fill that would improve water retention in the floodplain. The river channel and streambanks
would consist of about 30 percent sand and gravel mixed in with larger cobbles and boulders.
Floodplain fill consists primarily of sands, gravels, and cobbles 6 inches or less. Fines and
organic materials would be mixed in the floodplain substrate as well. Typical flow rates through
alluvial materials (hydraulic conductivity) are about 0.0012 ft/s for a sand and gravel mix and up
to 0.01 ft/s for gravel. Multiplying the groundwater flow rate by the area of floodplain fill layer
at the maximum thickness, the expected flow rate through the sand and gravel mix is about
1.25 cfs (0.0012 ft/s * 400 ft wide by 2.7 ft deep) and 12.5 cfs for gravel (M. Daniels, RDG,
pers. comm, 2014). This means that only about 1.25 cfs would be able to pass through the sand
and gravel substrate material in the riverbed; and flows should be even less through the
floodplain fill. However, if the riverbed material consisted of only gravels and cobbles, the loss
of flow could be about 12.5 cfs from the river. Baseflow in Crooked River was measured at
about 25 cfs in 2012 (RDG et al. 2012). Base flow estimates for the 7-day Q2 (2-year return
interval streamflow) is about 12.3 cfs. We can assume that if only about 1.25 cfs can pass
through the substrate materials, the remaining flows would be retained as surface flows; but
again, if the substrate is not mixed and consists of only gravel or larger sized substrate, there
would be a high potential of the river channel going subsurface.
EFFECTIVENESS OF SIMILAR PROJECTS – RIVER BYPASS/GROUNDWATER

9. Comment (Letter #21):
We [Friends of the Clearwater] had several questions we posed in our scoping comments. Not
all of them have been addressed in the DEIS. For example, we asked questions whether

restoration of this type actually and works and if so, how effective is it. The past mitigation work
seems to have been detrimental rather than beneficial, at least for some species.
Have river bypasses like the one proposed worked in past projects? The DEIS notes the concern
over groundwater and the role it play in this lower part of Crooked River. In essence, there
should be enough information for the agency to know whether any negative impacts will result.
Groundwater is particularly important for a species like the bull trout. The input of cooler
groundwater can make a major difference in habitat for this species.
Response:
Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, Effectiveness of Mitigation, has been updated in the Final EIS.
Groundwater information is presented in and has been updated in Chapter 3, Water Resources.
Similar projects around the area have met the goals and objectives set out for the project. New
information, techniques, and lessons learned are expected, but all projects in the recent past have
benefitted target fish species.
The bypass channel is designed to pass a 25-year flow event (1,316 cfs), which has been
determined as an acceptable risk for 3 years. There are mitigations and risk management
techniques built in to mitigate for a larger flow.
Long-term (>1 year) bypass channels have not been implemented in the local area, but they are
utilized in the region. The Mill Town Dam Removal project on the Clark Fork River in western
Montana utilized a large bypass channel while the dam was removed, contaminated sediments
were dredged out of the historic floodplain, and the new channel was created, including large
woody debris placement and riparian planting. The water was in the bypass channel for
2.5 years and there were no associated problems. The bypass channel was designed for a Q100
flow. The largest flow seen during bypass use was about a Q10 (Martin 2014, personal
communication).
The Milltown project was subject to a Q35 flow the first year following full watering of the
channel, before bank stabilization was complete. One meander bend avulsed into a side channel,
but was able to be reconstructed and, using bank stabilization treatments, has not reverted to that
channel.
Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, in the Final EIS has been updated to discuss potential
groundwater impacts from Alternative 2. Groundwater elevation data suggest that there would
most likely be water in the bypass channel. Groundwater interactions should be more natural
following construction, with infiltration and exfiltration happening continuously along the new
channel and floodplain. Currently, bull trout use the project area as a migratory corridor from
the South Fork Clearwater River to the upper Crooked River watershed for spawning.

CONSTRUCTION PHASING

10. Comment (Letter #19):
The construction for the rehabilitation of the Crooked River would occur in four phases
beginning in 2015. Table 2-1 also includes two options for floodplain grading of different
stream reaches. We found portions of this section in the document to be unclear. It was our
understanding that floodplain grading would occur as part of the construction phases rather
than be optional. Listing flood plain grading actions as options seems to suggest that this
activity may not occur. We believe that restoring the floodplain is critical in promoting a
naturally functioning river system. We recommend that the final EIS include an expanded
discussion on the options and how the decision would be made to implement either or both
options. In addition, the construction phases discuss activities that would occur at various
channel stat ions (e.g., channel station 31+00). It is difficult to identify the referenced stations
on any of the figures in the document. We suggest modifying the figures to more clearly identify
channel stations for bypass channel and new channel locations.
Response:
The Final EIS text and graphics have been updated in Chapter 2 (Figures 2-1 and Table 2-1) to
show the location of Phases and Options. These are also displayed in the Final EIS, Appendix
A, Figure A-1a and Figure A-1b.
Under Alternative 2, the proposed construction phases were developed through project design.
There are six construction phases, as outlined in the Final EIS, Chapter 2, Table 2-1. The
project was divided into four Phases, which require a bypass channel, stream channel
reconstruction, and large woody debris placement; and two Options, which require only
floodplain grading and large woody debris placement. The construction phases were developed
to allow for construction within a set budget each year.
Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 must occur in sequence in order to reduce environmental impacts and risks
during construction. The construction phasing approach is to complete new floodplain grading
and new channel grading of Phases 1 and 2 in the middle reaches of the project area where the
river channel currently exhibits 90-degree meander bends. The new channel bank and
floodplain treatments (large woody debris placement) are scheduled to occur in Phase 3 and the
bypass channel reclamation would occur in Phase 4.
Options 1 and 2 are separate from the Phases since they can be completed at any time during the
project implementation without impacting the rest of the design. Options 1 and 2 include
floodplain grading and large woody debris placement. The floodplain grading was designed to
allow these Options to be completed independently without compromising the integrity of the

design of the floodplain and stream channel. In addition, the Options were separated in the
design to provide flexibility in funding the project.
Implementation of all six phases is dependent upon funding overtime. Funding from BPA is
would be used for Alternative 2. Other grants or funding could also be used. The amount of the
construction bids for each phase would determine how and when they are implemented. It is the
Forests’ intent is complete all six phases of construction to meet the purpose and need of the
project. See Rationale for the Decision in the Record of Decision.
See also response to Comment 51.
11. Comment (Letters #13, 14):
Why not let the dredger miners move/work the material first to help with the project to cut costs
and make the holes for the project? Would't that help with both parties? Wouldn't that be more
cost effective?
Response:
Forest Plan, Management Area 10 – Riparian Areas, Fish and Wildlife Habitat Management,
Standard 2, directs the Forest Service to rehabilitate riparian areas before any further
nondependent resource use of the immediate area is permitted (USDA Forest Service, 1987a, as
amended; page III-31). Under Alternative 2, Final EIS, would complete rehabilitation of the
Crooked River riparian area and meet this Forest Plan standard.
Alternative 2 would be implemented under a Forest Service construction contract. It would be
very difficult to coordinate contractor and claimant actions to meet the design specifications
outlined in the contract. Also this would be a liability for the contractor.
The commenter’s suggestion could be beneficial to both parties, but it would not be feasible to
implement under a Forest Service contract.
See also Chapter 2, Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detail Study in the Final EIS.
REVEGETATION

12. Comment (Letter #20):
Ecologically, your EIS implies that you want to return the Crooked River flora to its natural
state. Anyone viewing the area can see that it is currently covered in natural flora and
inhabited by natural fauna… To assume that a replanting effort of "natural" plants from a
nursery is preposterous.
Response:
Design and Mitigation Measures 2, 9, 10, 18, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31, in Chapter 2 of the

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The Nez Perce National Forest Plan direction is to manage riparian areas to maintain cover and
security for riparian-dependent species with emphasis on habitats for threatened and endangered
species, as well as for water quality. The Forest Plan places emphasis on re-establishment of
riparian vegetation in those areas degraded by past activities including dredge mining.
As shown in Chapter 3, Figure 3-12, in the Final EIS, much of the existing streamside
vegetation is reed canarygrass and the tailings piles are primarily bare on the slopes. Reed
canarygrass is not a species that would naturally occur in the Crooked River valley and is
considered an invasive species. Lodgepole pine and Douglas fir, which are found on the tops of
the tailings piles, are not interacting with the stream or providing the benefit of shade to reduce
water temperatures, as described in Chapter 3, Water Resources, of the Final EIS. Spruce,
alders, and willows are the species that are typically found in floodplains and should dominate
the valley bottom. Seed stock and cuttings used in the rehabilitation effort would be collected
from the local area to provide species that are tolerant of the climate zone and that would be
native to the area.
LARGE WOODY DEBRIS

13. Comment (Letter #21):
Where will the large woody debris come from? Will it come only from trees that are to be
removed from the current riverside area or will there be a small logging project to provide the
wood?
Response:
The Final EIS, Chapter 2, Alternative 2 and Appendix C, were updated to clarify the source of
the large woody debris.
Much of the large woody debris needed for the project would be from onsite sources within the
project area. Additional large woody debris is needed for the project and would come from
local projects under other NEPA decisions. The Forest Service has been working on
identification of sources of large woody debris for this project.
See Rationale for the Decision in the Record of Decision.
14. Comment (Letter #25):
Crooked River has redds with beautiful cover in corners. Don’t need to throw logs in creek.
Logs in creek are hazardous to the public and children. They would get trapped if they fell in.
Response:
A description of the current condition of fish habitat is in Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, Pool
Quality and Quantity, and Habitat Features, in the Final EIS.
Salmonids spawn in gravel/cobble-sized material with little fine sediment and good throughsubstrate flow to keep eggs aerated. Large woody debris is important for fish habitat, especially
steelhead, cutthroat, and bull trout (Roni and Quinn 2001).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Large woody debris is an important piece of stream ecosystems, providing habitat and cover for
salmonids, a high-quality habitat for macroinvertebrates preferred by salmonids and poolforming processes; discussion and detail on woody debris is found in Chapter 3, Aquatic
Resources, in the Final EIS.
The addition of large woody debris would not increase the risk to the public relative to other
streams in the area that currently have large woody debris that has entered the stream naturally.
MONITORING

15. Comment (Letters #13, 14):
Who is monitoring water Quality from CRVR project and in the South Fork of the Clearwater
River?
Response:
Under Alternative 2, the USFS and Nez Perce Tribe would monitor water quality during
construction activities and upon completion of the project, as described in: Chapter 2 of the
Final EIS, Biological Opinions in the Record of Decision – Appendix B, or as required by other
permits (National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, or Stormwater Management
Plan).
The Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests, Nez Perce Tribe, and Idaho Department of
Environmental Quality monitor water quality in the South Fork Clearwater River.

FOREST PLAN AND AMENDMENTS

16. Comment (Letter #10):
With regards to protection of cultural and historic resources, we support the Forest Plan
Amendments to allow for the project to move forward. Finally we note that the State Historic
Preservation Office has concurred with the suitability and merit of the mitigation measures.
We also support the amendment to the Forest Plan with regards to soils to allow the project to
move forward.
Response:
The forest acknowledges your comments.
17. Comment (Letters #15, 21):
Fact #3 – The forest plan is asserted to be a dictating directive for the implementation of this
project, both within the document and as voiced by agency reps at public meetings.
Rationale #3 – The DEIS states in a number of places the need and ability to change/modify the
forest plan in order to implement the proposed project. If the forest plan can be changed or
modified in order to implement the project, the forest plan can also be changed or modified to
inhibit the project.

The Final EIS, Appendix D, includes the analysis for the proposed forest plan amendments. The
conclusion is that an amendment would be needed for soil resources and cultural resources with
Alternative 2.

ALTERNATIVES – NARROWS
18. Comment (Letters #06, 19):
We attended the group information meeting last fall on the CRVR Project… The highlight of the
meeting for us was the proposed work that would be done in the narrows on the Crooked River
Road, we see that has been thrown out.
The Forest Service's Notice of Intent also discussed a secondary purpose and connected
proposal - realigning the Crooked River road to reduce sediment delivery to surface water and
reduce the risk of continual flooding of the Crooked River Road. The DEIS removed this action
from further analysis due to the need for additional information.
Response:
Chapter 2 of the Final EIS describes why the Narrows Road alternatives presented to the public
in January 2013 were eliminated from detailed study from the Final EIS.
The Final EIS, Appendix C, identifies the Narrows Road Improvement Project as an activity the
forest will pursue in the future.

…let's look at some known facts any time any stream is straightened it washes much worst, if
that stream is straightened it will destroy all salmon and steelhead fish eggs due to leaving some
out of the water and burying the rest in sand due to to much sand washing down the river, plus
the fact to do this amount of work is going to require cats, track hoes and who knows what else

Response:
The Nez Perce Forest Plan directs presently degraded fish habitat to meet the fish/water quality
objectives established in the Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service 1987a, p. II-19; and Appendix
A, Table A-1).
Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures 1 and 45, specifically address when instream work
can be done so as not to affect salmon and steelhead redds and eggs.
Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources, in the Final EIS describes timing of establishment of vegetation
and floodplain processes. Chapter 3, Water Resources, describes the sinuosity and sediment
transport processes currently and as designed.
Roni and Quinn (2001) observed much higher steelhead and cutthroat trout densities in the
winter after large-scale stream rehabilitation and large woody debris placement. Due to the
design feature of constructing a bypass channel, work would not occur in occupied habitat.
Other projects of similar nature have occurred or are in progress on the Forest. The large
equipment is necessary to realign the material as designed. Equipment use in stream or live
water would be minimized due to the bypass construction.
The project is in compliance with:
Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (as amended),
50 CFR § 402.12 (Interagency Cooperation, Biological Assessments),
Endangered Species Consultation Handbook (USFWS and NMFS, March 1998),

Response:
The Nez Perce Forest Land Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) provides direction for
wildlife and fish with Forestwide standards that apply to this project (USDA Forest Service
1987a, p. II-19). The Draft EIS, page 1-12, reiterates that the Nez Perce Forest must meet
established fishery/water quality objectives for all prescription watersheds, as shown in
Appendix A of the Forest Plan (Table A-1). Table A-1 illustrates that Lower Crooked River
(Prescription watershed number 17060305-05-01) has a current fishery habitat potential of 50%.
Appendix F. Comments Received on Draft EIS and Forest Service Responses

F - 14

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

The fishery water quality objective for habitat potential is 90%. Lower Crooked River is
classified as a stream below carrying capacity due primarily to a lack of diversity (pool
structure). The habitat components are stated to be replaced through direct habitat improvement
projects (USDA Forest Service, 1987a, Appendix A-1, Table A-1).
The USFWS (2002) recovery plan states that the large migratory component (fluvial lifehistory) of bull trout in the South Fork Clearwater core area is considered at intermediate risk.
Core areas such as the Crooked River population are considered to have very high habitat
potential for bull trout (USDA Forest Service 1998; CBBTTAT 1998d; and IDFG 2005aAppendix D). The 5-year summary and evaluation for the Snake River Basin Steelhead, states
that the Clearwater Major Population Group (including the South Fork Clearwater steelhead
population) has an overall viability rating of high risk (NOAA 2011). Habitat improvement
efforts on federal lands should remain a priority for the recovery of Snake River Basin Steelhead
(NOAA 2011, p. 52). Westslope cutthroat trout are widespread in the Upper South Fork
Clearwater River, including Crooked River. IDFG screwtrap data (2002–2014) show that there
is a fluvial life-history component in the Crooked River westslope cutthroat trout populations.
Preservation of this fluvial life history is an important component to consider, given isolated
populations in the Upper Crooked River. Improved habitat complexity such as the addition of
large wood complexes in the lower reaches will benefit fluvial cutthroat. Large wood
contributes to pool formation and creates dynamic instream structure providing cover, rearing,
and potential overwintering habitat for cutthroat.
Roni and Quinn (2001) observed much higher steelhead and cutthroat trout densities in the
winters following large-scale stream rehabilitation and large woody debris placement. Another
observation of rehabilitation projects was that the cutthroat and steelhead numbers and densities
increased as riffle area increased. The designed channel will increase fast water habitat by 33%,
increasing potential cutthroat and steelhead preferential habitat by the same amount.
21. Comment (Letter #18):
The Department of the Interior has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project, Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest,
Idaho. In Chapter 3: Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences, the document
contains a discussion of the role of water temperature on fish populations. Prior to the
development of the Final EIS, the Department recommends that the authors consider and
reference the following U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 2007 study conducted on the Crooked
River by Torgersen et al. The report includes possible impacts on fish, and indirectly birds, and
other fauna that was not addressed in the current document.

Response:
The Forest has reviewed this document. It is a study of a Crooked River in Oregon, with vastly
different physical, geomorphological, and biological characteristics. The structure, fish
assemblages, and the spring-fed flow type system do not relate to Crooked River, Idaho;
therefore, this river was not considered as part of analysis for this document. See, also,
CONSIDERATION OF SCIENCE AND LITERATURE SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC
section below.
22. Comment (Letter #20):
Piscatorially, a cutthroat trout fishery exists in Crooked River. To eliminate this fishing
opportunity in the name of providing more breeding grounds for salmon and steelhead is a
waste of time, money and effort. Many miles of rivers and streams have been allocated for the
salmon and steelhead; surely this small section of Idaho will not make or break the recovery
efforts for those fish.
Response:
See response to Comment 20.
Roni and Quinn (2001) observed much higher steelhead and cutthroat trout densities in the
winters following large-scale stream rehabilitation and large woody debris placement. Another
observation of rehabilitation projects was that the cutthroat and steelhead numbers and densities
increased as riffle area increased. The designed channel would increase fast water habitat by
33%, increasing potential cutthroat and steelhead preferential habitat by the same amount.
Following implementation of Alternative 2, fishing opportunities are expected to increase, as
shown by the immediate response of fish in other restoration projects and as a result of increased
productivity and densities expected to occur in the rehabilitated reaches (Bransford, NPT. Pers.
comm., 2014).
This area has been listed as a high-priority reach for salmon and steelhead for the Forest Service
since the early 1980s (USDA Forest Service, 1987a, as amended; USDA Forest Service 1998).
23. Comment (Letter #21):
The information in the DEIS about the Pacific lamprey is not clear. The mitigation measures
don’t mention this rare species in terms of allowing its passage but it suggests later in the DEIS
that the same mitigation measures also work for Pacific lamprey.
Response:
Additional Pacific lamprey passage information has been added into Chapter 3, Aquatic
Resources, of the Final EIS.
If Pacific lamprey are found on site during implementation, Design and Mitigation Measures 11
and 45 (Chapter 2 of the Final EIS), including Best Management Practices outlined in USDIFWS (2010), would be followed.

…let's look at some known facts any time any stream is straightened it washes much worst, if
that stream is straightened it will destroy all salmon and steelhead fish eggs due to leaving some
out of the water and burying the rest in sand due to to much sand washing down the river, plus
the fact to do this amount of work is going to require cats, track hoes and who knows what else

Response:
Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures 1 and 45, of the Final EIS specifically address when
instream work can be done so as not to affect salmon and steelhead redds and eggs.
Chapter 3, Water Resources, of the Final EIS describes the existing, overly-sinuous and
unnatural channel planform and the proposed, more natural sinuosity of the new channel, and
provides the geomorphic rationale for the proposed, more natural sinuosity. This rationale
relates channel sinuosity to channel gradient and water velocity, and explains how restoring
natural sinuosity would increase water velocity and improve the transport of suitable spawning
substrate to downstream reaches that are currently in a static, armored condition.
Other projects of similar nature have occurred or are in progress on the Forest. The large
equipment is necessary to realign the material as designed. Equipment use in stream or live
water would be minimized due to the bypass construction.
25. Comment (Letter #15):
“Data” asserted in the DEIS also appears to be conflicting. Example: Pg. 3-22, “Due to the
high hydraulic conductivity through the dredge tailings in the valley, temperatures are slightly
lower at the downstream end;” while pg. 3-62 states, “these extensive mining activities….left
extensive tailing piles….that has caused elevated water temperatures”.
Response:
The statement in the Draft EIS (page 3-22) in Chapter 3, Aquatic Resources is referring to the
temperature change from the top to the bottom of the project area, along 2 miles of the Crooked
River valley. In the Final EIS, this section was updated, see pages 3-23 to 3-29, and Figure 3-9.
The statement in the Draft EIS (page 3-62) in Chapter 3, Water Resources is referring to the
overall elevated water temperature in Crooked River at the bottom of the project area, that
currently exceeds the State of Idaho temperature standards (see FEIS, Table 3-3). In the Final
EIS, Chapter 3, Water Resources, Crooked River Hydrology (page 3-64 to 3-65) was updated to
clarify the relationship of groundwater-surface water processes. This section includes an
explanation of hydraulic conductivity and the existing dredge mining piles.

26. Comment (Letter #19):
,
Sediment and temperature
Total Maximum Daily Loads have been developed for the South Fork
of the Clearwater River subbasin (IDEQ et al. 2004. South Fork Clearwater River Subbasin
Assessment and TMDLs) which includes the Crooked River. Actions to meet reduction targets
are necessary to support beneficial uses. We believe this project will significantly improve water
quality and habitat. In the following comments, we offer some recommendations regarding
inclusion of additional information about the predicted temperature decreases and sediment
reductions in the final EIS.
Although the DEIS refers to the River Design Group final design report for specific details (i.e.,
RDG 2012b), it is unclear what method was used to predict the average effective shade. The
TMDL established a 24 percent increase in effective shade to achieve beneficial uses for cold
water and salmon spawning. We are very pleased to note that average effective shade is
expected to increase from 32 percent to 83 percent after implementation of the project. This is
well above the TMDL target. We recommend that a summary of the methods/models used to
form the basis of conclusions related to temperature be included in the final EIS.
The DEIS does not specifically address the sediment portion of the TMDL. We acknowledge that
restored hydrology/sinuosity will improve the river's sediment transport and capacity; however,
the DEIS does not identify TMDL targets or the timeframe for attaining standards. In addition,
one potential issue related to sediment that affects water quality is the proximity of roads to
surface water. The Notice of Intent (December 2012) discussed the Narrows Road as a source of
sediment affecting the Crooked River and provided options for addressing this issue. Although
the road component was eliminated from further consideration in the DEIS, it remains as part of
the cumulative effects analysis and potential future foreseeable actions. We recommend that the
final EIS disclose how the project will comply with sediment targets established for the
watershed. We also encourage the USPS to obtain the necessary information to further assess
the Narrows Road and consider evaluating alternatives through a subsequent NEPA analysis as
stated in the DEIS.
Response:
Chapter 3, Water Resources, of the Final EIS has been updated to present the method used by
River Design Group to predict post-project percent effective shade. Post-project percent
effective shade was predicted by River Design Group to be the percent of channel length
expected to support woody vegetation (RDG et al. 2013a).
Chapter 3, Water Resources, of the Final EIS has been updated to discuss the sediment TMDL
for the South Fork Clearwater River. Crooked River from the mouth to Relief Creek is not
listed under §303(d) of the Clean Water Act as water quality impaired for sediment (IDEQ
2010); however, per the TMDL, human-caused sediment in the South Fork Clearwater River at
Stites should be reduced by approximately 25% (South Fork Clearwater River, Watershed

Advisory Group (SFCRWAG 2006)). The most commonly accepted approach to controlling
non-point sources of sediment is to limit pollutants from reaching the water through a
combination of best management practices and filtering of runoff using riparian vegetation and
floodplains (SFCRWAG 2006). Chapter 2 of the Final EIS presents several Design and
Mitigation Measures that would be implemented to minimize turbidity and ensure that the Idaho
State water quality standards for turbidity are not exceeded. A required Stormwater Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that includes appropriate BMPs to protect water quality would be
prepared and adhered to as part of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) Stormwater Construction General Permit. See also responses to Comments 27 and 28.
Mature riparian communities and a stable hydrologic regime and stream channel are needed to
substantially improve stream temperatures and provide pollutant buffers. The Idaho Department
of Environmental Quality believes 10 years should be a reasonable amount time for achievement
of water quality standards; however, it is likely to take decades for improvement throughout the
watershed considering the time needed to for riparian vegetation to grow to maturity
(SFCRWAG 2006).
A Federal Consistency Checklist has also been completed for Alternative 2 and is located in the
project record.
27. Comment (Letter #19):
We are also unclear if an NPDES Stormwater Construction General Permit is applicable for
this project. We provided information on the EPA Region 10's Stormwater Construction General
Permit in our scooping comments (January 2013). The EPA RIO's COP is required for projects
affecting over one acre in disturbance. The project boundary should include areas for stockpile,
equipment, any facilities, and temporary storage. To assist in understanding the permit
requirements, the operator should identify potential pollutant sources in relation to possible
points of discharge. To avoid impacts to surface ·water, best management practices must be
properly selected, installed and maintained to contain or reduce each pollutant (e.g., sediment,
oil, grease, and other toxic pollutants). BMPs include structural and non­ structural actions. We
recommend that the final EIS discuss the applicability of NPDES to the project and include a
discussion of BMPs that would be employed at the site to ensure water quality protection. More
information on NPDES can be obtained by visiting the EPA R10 website at:
http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/WATER.NSF/NPDES+Permits/Region+10+CGP+resources/
Response:
For Alternative 2, an NPDES Stormwater Construction General Permit would be obtained prior
to construction as determined by law. A required Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan
(SWPPP) that includes appropriate BMPs to protect water quality would be prepared and
adhered to as part of the NPDES permit. Chapter 2, Design and Mitigation Measures #6 and 16
of the Final EIS was updated to include the applicability of the NPDES permit, and the
appropriate BMPs to protect water quality are described in Chapter 2.

28. Comment (Letter #20):
Water turbidity is currently at a minimum in Crooked River. Eighty years of settling has
provided clear, cool water. Straightening of the channel will increase particulates in the stream
water, eventually clouding the Clearwater River. Current discussion regarding particulate
matter and habitat destruction as a result of dredging in the large rivers of our area should be a
wake up call as to the habitat disaster that will occur as the result of excavators, dozers, and
backhoes wading up and down Crooked River.
Response:
Under Alternative 2, turbidity is a short-term effect of any instream activity. However, the
design and mitigation measures presented in Chapter 2 would minimize turbidity and prevent
the Idaho State water quality standards for turbidity from being exceeded in Crooked River and,
therefore, the South Fork Clearwater River. Idaho State water quality standards for turbidity are
stringent, and implementation of Alternative 2 would have to adhere to them.
Following construction, turbidity could increase for a year or two. However, with the
constructed channel and floodplain designed to function more like a natural system, the water
energy should dissipate across the floodplain, and the gravels, sands, and silts the river has
carried should drop out.
WETLANDS
29. Comment (Letter #19):
Without a Clean Water Act (CWA) 404(b)(l) analysis, the EPA cannot make any preliminary
determination that the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative [LEDPA] is
Alternative 2, analyzed in the EIS. We understand that the analysis is still being developed, and
that the intent is to have it included as an appendix (Appendix B) to the final EIS. This analysis
will include impacts to all waters of the U.S. and not limited to wetlands. While other
alternatives were considered but eliminated from detailed study, the 404(b)(l) analysis must
consider all alternatives and demonstrate how the selected alternative meets the LEDPA.
The EPA will review the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's Public Notice (PN) for Application for
Permit (CWA 404) for this project when it is published. The EPA likely will have specific
comments based on the PN, understanding that the project as described in the DEIS clearly
provides a net benefit to the Crooked River valley aquatic ecosystem.
Response:
The Final EIS, Appendix B, includes the Clean Water Act 404(b)(1) analysis for waters and
wetlands of the United States and presents the Least Environmentally Damaging Practical
Alternative (LEDPA).
On August 22, 2013, the USACE entered into an interagency agreement with the Nez PerceClearwater National Forests to combine the Section 404 and NEPA process. The merger process

Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
According to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Draft Environmental Impact Statement:
These “features are the dredge piles along the Crooked River. They are considered one of
the best examples of dredge mining technology remaining in central Idaho.”
“These tailings are perhaps the best example of bucket-line dredge mining technology
found in central Idaho and therefore are an important historical resource. The tailings
resulted from extensive dredging operations conducted by the H&H Mining Company,
which operated a Yuba-manufactured dredge (locally referred to as the Mount Vernon
dredge) along the lower Crooked River from 1938–1942. The dredge piles of the lower 2
miles are morphologically distinct. Their U-shaped pattern reflects the technology
employed by bucketline dredges, which pivot around a central anchor-spud. The
resulting architecture of the dredge piles is directly reflective of this unique mining
technology. These historical features are important to not only understanding a given
mining technology and its associated engineering, but also reflect and convey business
histories, commerce and trade, and regional/local economics. The historic features are
also related to larger world events. The H&H Mining Company was forced to cease
operations on the Crooked River by order of the War Production Board in 1942. Gold
mining was declared non-essential to the war effort and its labor force dispersed to other
industries deemed more important in defeating the Axis Powers of World War II.”
Since these are one of the “best examples of dredge mining technology remaining in central
Idaho”, destroying them in any manner would destroy our history and any historic reference
that is left. There are occasional piles of rocks that are from the dredging era but they do not
show the significance of mining activity nor is their integrity intact.

Would characteristics that qualify historic properties for the National Register of Historic Places
be adversely affected (irretrievably lost)? (Yes/No)
According to the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Draft Environmental Impact Statement:
“Four cultural properties are found within the project area, with characteristics spanning
a wide range throughout the National Register integrity/evaluation criteria continuum
(see Table 3-31). One of these properties (site SHC-32 Dredge tailings; Mining;
Meanders) is considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.
There are no National Register sites in Idaho County, nor in Idaho, that even come close to this
property in its historic perspective of settlement, work, contributions to the national economy,
etc. The only other “mining” sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Idaho are the
Chinese Sites in the Warren Mining District, ROCKY BAR South Boise Historic Mining District,
and Moore Gulch Chinese Mining Site. To lose this site, which qualifies for the National
Register, is to lose too much of our history.
Response:
The Forest Service acknowledges your opinion.
37. Comment (Letter #20):
Historically, the destruction of one of the last, best examples of dredge mining (per your EIS) is
a crime. In all arenas historical conservation is the focal point of retaining the developmental
record of the United States. Destruction of eighty years of mining history would be a travesty.
Response:
The Forest Service acknowledges your opinion.
MITIGATION OF EFFECTS – CULTURAL RESOURCES
38. Comment (Letter #10):
While we [Idaho Conservation League] recognize that impacts to the historical dredge tailings
would result from the project, we feel that the mitigation measures proposed are adequate to
ameliorate the effects of the project. We also feel that other representative examples of dredge
tailings are common in the region, and that the specific value of the Crooked River dredge
tailings are limited.

With regards to protection of cultural and historic resources, we support the Forest Plan
Amendments to allow for the project to move forward. Finally we note that the State Historic
Preservation Office has concurred with the suitability and merit of the mitigation measures.
Response:
The Forest Service acknowledges this opinion and agrees that the State Historic Preservation
Office has concurred with the project mitigation stipulations.
39. Comment (Letter #16):
Whatever the condition of the Meanders section of Crooked River was (say, 100 years ago), it
has clearly been drastically changed by dredge mining and other activities. I am not convinced
by the argument that the dredge piles should be left as they are just because they are historic.
They are indeed historic, but not every historic thing can or should be preserved. Especially
when they have degraded something else of great value, such as the fishery of the Clearwater
watershed, the historic “structures” should be sacrificed. The DEIS proposes mitigation
(preservation of a small subset of the tailings piles, educational displays), which is both
necessary and sufficient to preserve a record of the mining history of the area.
Response:
The Forest Service acknowledges this opinion.
40. Comment (Letter #17):
[Note: The author has quoted material from the DEIS, directly or indirectly, in the
following—as signified by indented blocks in regular font—and has provided comments—

Thoroughly photograph, document, and map historic dredge piles that are proposed for
removal (design and mitigation measure 42). This would create a formal record of the
historic property such that it can be studied and measured, thus ensuring the resource’s
ability to convey information related to dredge mining once the resource is removed.
All this is well and good and should be done anyway but it in no way substitutes for the real
thing when viewing the cultural context of the settlement of the west and the impact and
importance of gold mining to the nation.
• Retain a representative sample of dredge piles for public interpretation (design and
mitigation measure 39). Retention of a small portion of the dredge piles ensures that the
visiting public can interact with the actual resource and tangibly understand their form
and function through a first-person experience.

The “representative samples” in no way tell the whole story. There are many “representative
samples”, i.e., rock piles that remain, but are totally out of and devoid of context to what they
were originally. The remaining piles get used for road bed projects, etc. The whole of the 2 mile
stretch of Crooked River in the proposal should be left intact.
• Construct a three-panel educational kiosk in the Meanders to inform the public of the
history of the Crooked River Valley (design and mitigation measure 40). This would
Appendix F. Comments Received on Draft EIS and Forest Service Responses

F - 25

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

educate the public as to the greater historical context associated with dredge mining
along the Crooked River.
• Record the historic Gnome village (design and mitigation measure 43). This is offsite
mitigation meant to enhance a resource that would not be affected by the project, but is
nonetheless languishing along the Crooked River. The Gnome village site is a
Depression-era hamlet built to support the Gnome Mine, which operated from about
1932–1937. The village is structurally in poor shape and its formal recording is crucial to
understanding the architecture and function of this “company-town.” Enhancement of
the Gnome village would help mitigate impacts of the project on the dredge piles
because the two resources share a similar historical theme, timeframe, and geographic
scope.
Plans for enhancement of the Gnome village is a great idea, depending on what that
enhancement entails. It may “share a similar historical theme, timeframe” but it does not share
the same “geographic scope” with the historic dredge area. A village and the actual dredge
area are not related enough to interpret the history of the area.
• Perform a social business history related to the economic contribution historic dredge
mining operations made to the local central Idaho economy (design and mitigation
measure 44). This would promote understanding of the economic value of historic
mining activities to local rural economies such as Elk City, Idaho.

This does need to be done but in no way substitutes for the actual on the ground site. It would
serve to enhance the site, not take the place of.
Response:
The expressed advocacy for the preservation of cultural resources is admirable. However, the
National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800.6) allows adverse effects to occur to cultural
resources on federal land so long as these effects are mitigated. Indeed, the Forest Service has
worked with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) to assemble an acceptable level of
mitigation for the project. These mitigation measures have been formalized and agreed upon in
a signed Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Forest Service and SHPO.
CUMULATIVE EFFECTS – CULTURAL RESOURCES **
41. Comment (Letter #17):
[Note: The author has quoted material from the DEIS, directly or indirectly, in the
following—as signified by indented blocks in regular font—and has provided comments—

Historic properties of the greater project areas date to perhaps 1861, but many of these
older sites have been destroyed by subsequent mining activity.
41a. What is the evidence of the older sites?
41a. Response:
The word “perhaps” was used intentionally. Historical references note that placer mining was
occurring along the greater South Fork Clearwater River drainage as early as 1861. Whether
Appendix F. Comments Received on Draft EIS and Forest Service Responses

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

mining activity dating specifically to 1861 ever occurred along the Crooked River proper is
currently unknown; however, it is not unreasonable to assume that mining did occur, given that
the Crooked River is a major tributary to the South Fork Clearwater River. Regardless,
subsequent mining activity in the 20th century along the lower Crooked River has
altered/removed overt evidence of this potential earlier mining component.
The last temporally significant wave of mining within the Crooked River Valley
occurred during the Great Depression. Thus, many of the sites date from as recent as the
1930s.
41b. I have related documentation of this and because it took place “as recent as the 1930”s” in
no way makes it insignificant.
41b. Response:
The Forest Service agrees. Indeed the term “significant wave” was used to characterize this
1930s mining activity.
Historic mining activity has greatly altered the landscape. Evidence of American Indian
use of the landscape along with early mining features have nearly all been
removed/altered by subsequent mining actions.
41c. Was there really any significant American Indian use of this area? Maybe they fished there.
It is not disputed that they came into the Elk City area to pick camas and to follow the southern
Nez Perce trail to Montana, but there is no evidence that there was any “significant” use of
either the area nor the drainage in question. Why would American Indian use be any more
important or significant than that of subsequent White/Chinese use???
41c. Response:
Historical references show that the greater South Fork Clearwater River drainage was used by
American Indians. But evidence of American Indian use along the lower Crooked River is
immaterial to the effects analysis for the project. The project is not attempting to mitigate for
adverse effects to American Indian sites.
The law does not determine the significance of cultural properties based upon the cultural
affiliation of said properties.
Recreation activity and all-terrain vehicle use has deflated (flattened) dredge piles. Use
of the dredge pile gravels for road maintenance activity has also altered this historic
landscape.
41d. If this site were protected, these types of activities could be curtailed/stopped.
41d.Response:
The Forest Service agrees.
Additionally, artifact collecting has removed vast amounts of scientific data from historic
mining sites.

41e. This is probably true but is in no way a reason to destroy what is left with proper
interpretation along with the actual physical evidence.
41e. Response:
The Forest Service is not proposing to remove historic dredge mining features because artifact
collecting has occurred at mining sites. Other overtly stated factors related to “aquatic
restoration” are driving the proposed action.
Natural events have also affected the historic landscape. Wildland fire has burned
historic properties within the greater project area, periodic flooding and its associated
erosion has affected streamside sites, and wind-throw events have displaced historic
features and artifacts as root wads were upended.
41f. These types affect all historic properties, some more than others.
41f. Response:
The Forest Service does not disagree.
SOIL RESOURCES
42. Comment (Letter #21):
… Also, what is not clear is whether any additional impacts to soils would result from the
project. Frankly, it appears the agency has been inconsistent in various documents in how it
analyzes new impacts to soils on areas where soils are already negatively affected.
Response:
Rationale of the type of soil amendment and location within the floodplain is provided in the
soils analysis of Indicator A: Improved soil and plant habitat within the Draft EIS, pp. 3-107 to
3-112. The soils analysis addresses soil disturbance and the need for a forest plan amendment to
provide for active restoration of soils and plant communities (Draft EIS, pp. 3-113 to 3-115).
The current Nez Perce Forest Plan direction ensures soil protection by minimizing disturbance
but does not provide for active restoration at the scale of this project. Typically, management
actions that harvest timber or lower fuels buildup minimize the disturbance footprint to a level
whereby permanent impacts to soils are avoided. The soils analysis for these other projects
considers the disturbance from past, present, and future perturbations to this disturbance level.
However, the CRVR project, Alternative 2, would entirely rebuild the floodplain plant and soil
communities and, thus, a disturbance threshold is not applicable. The existing conditions remain
departed from the expected natural conditions both structurally and functionally. Minimizing
disturbance would not restore or improve the productivity of the land for these degraded areas
within the CRVR project. The project area’s existing conditions, project scale, proposed active
restoration create a need to amend the forest plan, in comparison to other types of forest projects
that may require a forest plan amendment (see Draft EIS, Appendix D). Consideration of
cumulative impacts to soils from past, ongoing, and future management actions can be found in
the Draft EIS (pp. 3-112, 3-114, 3-115).

43. Comment (Letter #20):
Ecologically, your EIS implies that you want to return the Crooked River flora to its natural
state. Anyone viewing the area can see that it is currently covered in natural flora and
inhabited by natural fauna. To assume that hauling in soil from another area can be "natural"
is ludicrous.
Response:
Alternative 2 would return riverside soil and vegetation communities to what is expected for this
type river reach (see Draft EIS, p. 3-107 to 3-112). The current expression of these communities
departs from nearby analogues, as outlined in the existing condition assessments in the Design
Criteria Report: Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation and Design (RDG et al. 2012) and the
South Fork Clearwater River Landscape Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1998).
Outside soil materials may be considered where needed to propagate the desired plant and soil
communities. Soil materials including fill, topsoil, and mulch are considered as options.
However, onsite soil and plant resources would be used to the extent possible (see Draft EIS,
p. 3-117).
Chapter 2, of the Final EIS was also updated to describe the desired condition of the Crooked
River valley, floodplain and river.
WILDLIFE RESOURCES
44. Comment (Letter #02):
This area is teaming with wildlife from ducks, fish, deer, elk, cougar, mink this list goes on and
on. To go in and turn their world upside down again would be nothing short of a total travesty.
Response:
Crooked River has been turned “upside down” due to past dredge mining activities between
1930 and 1950. These past mining activities have altered stream and riparian processes and
altered aquatic and terrestrial vegetation compared to undisturbed streams. The few trees and
other vegetation currently growing on the mine tailings provide little in terms of quality wildlife
habitat (cover and forage) compared to a more properly functioning stream/riparian system. It
has been determined that there would be short-term effects to wildlife species that may use the
area associated with the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project. These effects include the
temporary displacement of wildlife species from the area due to loss of habitat and
noise/disturbance from project activities. Overall, however, the project would result in a longterm improvement in stream and riparian habitat by restoring/rehabilitating and speeding up
recovery of an altered stream channel and riparian vegetation (see Chapter 3, Wildlife, of the
Final EIS).

RECREATION RESOURCES
45. Comment (Letter #03):
If the work on the three miles of Red River below the Ranger Station is any indication of what
will be done here, it is clear this project is not in the best interests or recreational users,
fishermen or hunters. The Red River Project destroyed almost three miles of “no fee”
recreation, camping and fishing sites that had been enjoyed by the public for over sixty years.
This project destroys the excellent and accessible fishing offered in the area, thus economically
impacting Idaho County in a negative way;
Response:
Under Alternative 2, the dispersed campsites in Campgrounds 3 and 4 and others in the project
area, would continue to be available after implementation of Alternative 2. There would be the
same amount of “no fee” camping that is currently in the project area (see Chapter 3, Recreation
Resources, of the Final EIS). This project area would remain a “no fee” dispersed recreational
area, because there are no improvements that require a fee for use.
Roni and Quinn (2001) observed much higher steelhead and cutthroat trout densities in the
winters following large-scale stream rehabilitation and large woody debris placement. Another
observation of rehabilitation projects was that the cutthroat and steelhead numbers and densities
increased as riffle area increased. The designed channel would increase fast water habitat by
33%, increasing potential cutthroat and steelhead preferential habitat by the same amount.
Following implementation of Alternative 2, fishing opportunities are expected to increase, as
shown by the immediate response of fish in other restoration projects and as a result of increased
productivity and densities expected to occur in the rehabilitated reaches (Bransford, NPT, Pers.
comm. 2014). In addition, this alternative would re-shape existing dredge tailing piles and
increase access across the valley bottom for recreational use, including fishing.

The Nez Perce–Clearwater National Forests did have to consult with the State Historic
Preservation Office. As part of the mitigation described in Chapter 2 of the Final EIS, some
areas of past dredge tailings would be retained with interpretation.
Metal detectors may be used on National Forest System lands in areas that do not contain or
would not be reasonably expected to contain archaeological or historical resources (FS Manual
2364.23). Metal detectors must be used for lawful purposes and must not violate ARPA or 36
CFR 261.9. Relevant prohibited acts found in 36 CFR 261.9 state:
(g) Digging in, excavating, disturbing, injuring, destroying, or in any way damaging any
prehistoric, historic, or archaeological resource, structure, site, artifact, or property.
(h) Removing any prehistoric, historic, or archaeological resource, structure, site,
artifact, property.
No forest plan amendment would be needed if the cultural resource site can be protected.
47. Comment (Letter #13):
When Crooked River project is complete, when will it open up for dredging?
Response:
Under Alternative 2, after implementation the Forest Supervisor would rescind the temporary
area closure (Design and Mitigation Measure 33, Chapter 2 of the Final EIS) to allow general
forest use in the project area, including dredging under an approved plan of Operation and other
required permits.
Dredging in Crooked River is regulated by the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If Crooked River is opened for dredging, and required
NEPA analysis and decision are completed, dredging could occur in the project area.

48. Comment (Letter #13):
48a. How will you compensate claimants on Crooked River when area closure is in effect?
Response 48a. Design and Mitigation Measure 33, under Alternative 2, Chapter 2 in the Final
EIS would close the entire area yearlong to all public activities. The simplest thing is for the
claimants to pay their fees during the closure period under Alternative 2.
The Forests would work with the claimants to get a waiver and notice of intent to hold:

Measure 32b, was added under Alternative 2, Chapter 2 in the Final EIS.
49. Comment (Letter #21):
Regarding the mineral withdrawal concept which was rejected in the DEIS, we have two
comments. First, we raise this to ensure that any mineral development does not get in the way of
the rehabilitation work while it is ongoing. The DEIS suggests mineral work would be forbidden
during project implementation. Is that true and does it apply to all types of mineral activity? If
not, how can restoration work be conducted while mineral development is ongoing? This needs
to be clarified.
Second, it makes no sense not to have a withdrawal after the restoration work is done. Why do
this work if it could be undone by subsequent mineral development? Mineral development
caused the problem in the first place.
Response:
Chapter 2, Alternatives, of the Final EIS considered a mineral withdrawal of the project area
through a forest plan amendment. Direction in the Nez Perce Forest Plan (USDA Forest Service
1987a), Appendix M, provides criteria to consider when proposing an area for mineral
withdrawal:
“3. There is no other way to protect the resource or improvement. Possible alternate
methods include mitigation measures in operating plans, reclamation bonding, and no
surface occupancy stipulations in lease applications.”
For the Crooked River project, it was determined that the rehabilitation work could be protected
in the future. After implementation, if mineral exploration is desired and approved the site
would be reclaimed to the improved condition through a reclamation bond. The bond would be
collected to ensure that rehabilitation planned for the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project would be completed. In addition, the current Forest Plan revision effort is addressing the
issue of restoration and mineral entry.

I am a geologist and currently reside in Canada, employed under a NAFTA work permit. In the

years experience in the mining industry and currently hold interest in mining properties in Idaho
County. I am familiar with current and historical placer mining methods.
In reviewing the EIS on the project I am concerned that not enough analysis has been done on
mine waist accumulated during historical dredging. The dredging process creates waist of over
and under sized material generally split at 3/4 of an inch screen size. The oversize material
accumulates in large windrowed piles of gravel and cobble visual above the water table. Unseen
below is the layer of undersized material. Historic beneficiation of ore consumed large amounts
of mercury with daily losses into the undersized material.
My concern is the practicality of dewatering oversized mine waist and the potential release of
mercury into a dynamic system.

Fiscally, it is a waste of taxpayer money during one of the worst economic crises to envelop the
United States. No defensible reasoning exists for the wanton misuse of 2.5 million dollars on a
project such as the Crooked River plan. Instead of wasting money on this boondoggle, you
personally should be in the lead of USFS attempts to save money and return it to the public
coffers.
Please leave this area alone I am sure you can spend millions elsewhere where it would be
much more beneficial....
There are other opportunities and potential actions that can improve conditions in the lower

This project destroys the excellent and accessible fishing offered in the area…., thus
economically impacting Idaho County in a negative way;
This project is a waste of taxpayer money.
Response:
Chapter 2, Alternative 2 describe that primary funding would come from Bonneville Power
Administration (BPA), and if necessary other grants or funding sources. Following the Forest
Service decision, BPA would decide whether to provide funding toward the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation Project.
Chapter 2, Tables 2-3 and 3-48, display the difference between alternatives including cost of
improvements, funding source and project schedule. Chapter 3, Social and Economics, in the
Final EIS displays the analysis of effects on employment and recreation-based economics by
alternatives, including effects to Idaho County. Based on these comments, additional
information was added on the economic impacts of fishing and restored fish habitat to Idaho.
The BPA is a nonprofit federal power marketing agency within the Department of Energy. BPA
is financed through revenues it generates selling wholesale electrical power from 31 federal
hydro projects in the Columbia River Basin, one nonfederal nuclear plant, and several other
small nonfederal power plants, and transmitting this power throughout the Northwest. BPA uses
its revenues to finance its operations, which include fish and wildlife mitigation obligations
required by law.
As described in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIS (pp.1-7 and 1-8), under the Pacific Northwest
Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980 (Northwest Power Act), BPA must
mitigate for the impacts to fish and wildlife in the Columbia River Basin associated with the
development and operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). BPA
completes this work based on a comprehensive review process that concludes with project
recommendations. The Northwest Power and Conservation Council (Council), under its
Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program, periodically solicits fish and wildlife mitigation
project proposals from a variety of entities in the Columbia Basin. These projects are then
reviewed by the Independent Scientific Review Panel (ISRP) to evaluate their scientific merit
and feasibility. The ISRP then provides its recommendation for each proposal to the Council.
The Council reviews the ISRP recommendations and provides BPA with its funding
recommendations for each proposal. BPA reviews the ISRP and Council recommendations and
must make its own funding decision for each proposal. BPA funds a program that is consistent
with the Council’s Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Program to fulfill its mitigation
responsibilities under the law.
During BPA’s review process, priority consideration is given to proposals that address important
mitigation obligations defined in the Council’s Fish and Wildlife Program as well as

Endangered Species Act (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) obligations contained in biological
opinions issued within the Columbia River Basin.
The Council recommended that BPA consider funding the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation
project. Additionally, this project would help BPA meet its obligations under the ESA by
fulfilling commitments to implement Reasonable and Prudent Alternative 35, which calls for
identifying tributary habitat restoration projects in the 2008 FCRPS Biological Opinion, as
amended by a Supplemental Biological Opinion in 2010 and 2014 (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Fisheries 2008, 2010, 2014).
BPA agreed to be a cooperating agency on this EIS to analyze the potential impacts of the
proposed project. The project would benefit ESA-listed fish (Chinook salmon, steelhead, and
bull trout) and help BPA meet its mitigation responsibilities under the Northwest Power Act.
BPA will document its decision whether to fund the project with ratepayer funds in its own
Record of Decision, after completion of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Final EIS and
the signing of the Record of Decision.
52. Comment (Letter #10):
We feel strongly that the project will contribute to the ecological integrity of the ecosystem and
is an appropriate use of mitigation dollars to restore anadromous and resident fish habitat.

from the proposed project.
The Forest Service acknowledges your comments.
IMPLEMENTATION
53. Comment (Letter #25):
Contractors would be from out of state. Not local contractors.
Response:
Due to the cost of mobilizing to remote Forest locations and the importance of price in the

“the proposed action responds to the objectives of the Nez Perce Tribe by protecting, restoring,
and enhancing watersheds within proximity of their ceded territories”.
Fact #2 – The DEIS is asserting that the treaty of 1855 is the relevant “treaty” that establishes
Nez Perce Tribe rights and authority.
Rationale #2 – The treaty of June 11, 1855 was the initial treaty with the Nez Perce Tribe.
However, subsequent treaties of June 9, 1863 and August 13, 1868, as well as subsequent
agreements, have diminished the rights, scope and legal authority that the Nez Perce tribe has
over the proposed action area. The Nez Perce Forest appears to have given arbitrary superior
recognition and authority to the 1855 treaty, which has dramatic implications and results as
pertains to this proposed project and beyond it.
Response:
The Treaty of 1863 reduced the size of the Nez Perce Reservation from about 7.5 million acres
to roughly 750,000 acres; however, it did not affect the rights the Nez Perce had reserved in the

Response:
Chapter 1, Public Involvement, and Chapter 4, Summary of Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Planning Process and Timeline, of the Final EIS show the efforts by the Forest
Service to inform and gather comments from the public about this project.
In addition to the required legal notices in the paper of record and in the Federal Register, the
forest issued news releases in local papers and on the Forest webpage during the planning
process.
In addition to the required public involvement (36 CFR 220.4), the forest held two sets of public
meetings (Scoping, January 2013; DEIS meetings, May 2014), and a field trip to the project area
(June 2013).
The project webpage has been updated throughout the planning process to provide information
to the public at: http://www.fs.fed.us/nepa/fs-usda-pop.php/?project=40648

Last fall I saw the Forest Service teams planting trees out near the airstrip. I did notice that
other areas all along that section have been planted as well as the tree's are all surrounded by
fence wire to protect them from the browsing animals. Now you are suggesting to come in with
heavy equipment and remove all the tailing piles around these newly planted tree's. Who dreams
this stuff up?
Response:
In 2013, the Nez Perce Tribe planted trees near the airstrip, which is outside the Crooked River
Valley Rehabilitation project area. These trees would not be disturbed by the proposed project.

there to replace the pine beetle devastation and fix the fences, this Historic site is in a very sad

…I don't care if the NOAA says this is critical habit, for certain fish, I am sick of Government,

…I seen your project on American River, you destroyed camping spots, destroyed a perfectly
good road made out of clean dredge tailing, (that did not put silt into the river), destroyed
bridges, built a new ATV trail up on the hill side out of fresh soil, that will wash dirt into the
stream, blocked off roads that ATV's used, and made the road a dead end so that Elk City
residents do not have a loop to ride on anymore...
...It is my opinion that those promoting this effort are more interested in taking money from the
Government for their personal benefit than in any altruistic improvement of the River.
….This is getting absolutely ridiculous. I question Rick Brazell anyway on some other issues he
has made decisions on... You need to get real here folks.
…The environmentalists the Forest Service the Fisheries people you have working for you are

and may have again....
…Red River is a mess. A waste of money. You should go out and clean up Red River.

Re:
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency comments on the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement for the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest Crooked River Valley
Rehabilitation Project
(EPA Project Number: 13-0007-AFS).
Dear Mr. Brazell:
The EPA has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed Crooked
River Rehabilitation Project located on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forest. Our
review of the DEIS was conducted in accordance with our responsibilities under the National
Environmental Policy Act and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act.
The DEIS analyzes the Forest Service proposal to restore two miles of the Crooked River,
which has been significantly degraded from past land management practices such as
dredge mining and road activities. The DEIS includes a no action alternative and the
proposed action to rehabilitate the lower two miles of the Crooked River valley bottom by
restoring the natural floodplain, river meander, and riparian that has been damaged from
historic dredge mining. The Forest Service's Notice of Intent also discussed a secondary
purpose and connected proposal - realigning the Crooked River road to reduce sediment
delivery to surface water and reduce the risk of continual flooding of the Crooked River
Road. The DEIS removed this action from further analysis due to the need for additional
information.
Overall, we support the purposes of this project and commend the USFS for addressing the
historic alteration to the river valley from past mining. Based on our review, we are rating
the DEIS as LO (Lack of Objections). In addition, we are including recommendations that
we believe may improve the disclosure and clarity of information regarding water quality,
wetlands, and construction activities in the EIS.

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

Water Quality

Sediment and temperature
,
Total Maximum Daily Loads have been developed for the
South Fork of the Clearwater River subbasin1which includes the Crooked River. Actions to
meet reduction targets are necessary to support beneficial uses. We believe this project will
significantly improve water quality and habitat. In the following comments, we offer some
recommendations regarding inclusion of additional information about the predicted
temperature decreases and sediment reductions in the final EIS.
Although the DEIS refers to the River Design Group final design report for specific details
(i.e., RDG 2012b), it is unclear what method was used to predict the average effective
shade. The TMDL established a 24 percent increase in effective shade to achieve beneficial
uses for cold water and salmon spawning. We are very pleased to note that average effective
shade is expected to increase from 32 percent to 83 percent after implementation of the
project. This is well above the TMDL target. We recommend that a summary of the
methods/models used to form the basis of conclusions related to temperature be included in
the final EIS.
The DEIS does not specifically address the sediment portion of the TMDL. We
acknowledge that restored hydrology/sinuosity will improve the river's sediment transport
and capacity; however, the DEIS does not identify TMDL targets or the timeframe for
attaining standards. In addition, one potential issue related to sediment that affects water
quality is the proximity of roads to surface water. The Notice of Intent (December 2012)
discussed the Narrows Road as a source of sediment affecting the Crooked River and
provided options for addressing this issue. Although the road component was eliminated
from further consideration in the DEIS, it remains as part of the cumulative effects analysis
and potential future foreseeable actions. We recommend that the final EIS disclose how the
project will comply with sediment targets established for the watershed. We also encourage
the USPS to obtain the necessary information to further assess the Narrows Road and
consider evaluating alternatives through a subsequent NEPA analysis as stated in the DEIS.
We are also unclear if an NPDES Stormwater Construction General Permit is applicable for
this project. We provided information on the EPA Region 10's Stormwater Construction
General Permit in our scooping comments (January 2013). The EPA RIO's COP is required
for projects affecting over one acre in disturbance. The project boundary should include
areas for stockpile, equipment, any facilities, and temporary storage. To assist in
understanding the permit requirements, the operator should identify potential pollutant
sources in relation to possible points of discharge. To avoid impacts to surface ·water, best
management practices must be properly selected, installed and maintained to contain or
reduce each pollutant (e.g., sediment, oil, grease, and other toxic pollutants). BMPs include
structural and non­ structural actions. We recommend that the final EIS discuss the
applicability of NPDES to the project and include a discussion of BMPs that would be
employed at the site to ensure water quality protection. More information on NPDES can be

Wetlands
Without a Clean Water Act (CWA) 404(b)(l) analysis, the EPA cannot make any
preliminary determination that the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative is
Alternative 2, analyzed in the EIS. We understand that the analysis is still being developed,
and that the intent is to have it included as an appendix (Appendix B) to the final EIS. This
analysis will include impacts to all waters of the U.S. and not limited to wetlands. While
other alternatives were considered but eliminated from detailed study, the 404(b)(l) analysis
must consider all alternatives and demonstrate how the selected alternative meets the
LEDPA.
The EPA will review the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's Public Notice (PN) for
Application for Permit (CWA 404) for this project when it is published. The EPA likely will
have specific comments based on the PN, understanding that the project as described in the
DEIS clearly provides a net benefit to the Crooked River valley aquatic ecosystem.
Construction Phasing
The construction for the rehabilitation of the Crooked River would occur in four phases
beginning in 2015. Table 2-1 also includes two options for floodplain grading of different
stream reaches. We found portions of this section in the document to be unclear. It was our
understanding that floodplain grading would occur as part of the construction phases rather
than be optional. Listing flood plain grading actions as options seems to suggest that this
activity may not occur. We believe that restoring the floodplain is critical in promoting a
naturally functioning river system. We recommend that the final EIS include an expanded
discussion on the options and how the decision would be made to implement either or both
options. In addition, the construction phases discuss activities that would occur at various
channel stat ions (e.g., channel station 31+00). It is difficult to identify the referenced stations
on any of the figures in the document. We suggest modifying the figures to more clearly
identify channel station s for bypass channel and new channel locations.
We appreciate the opportunity to review and comment on the DEIS. If you have any questions

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Rating System for Draft Environmental Impact
Statements Definitions and Follow-Up Action*
Environmental Impact of the Action
LO – Lack of Objections
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review has not identified any potential
environmental impacts requiring substantive changes to the proposal. The review may have disclosed
opportunities for application of mitigation measures that could be accomplished with no more than
minor changes to the proposal.
EC –Environmental Concerns
EPA review has identified environmental impacts that should be avoided in order to fully protect the
environment. Corrective measures may require changes to the preferred alternative or application of
mitigation measures that can reduce these impacts.
EO – Environmental Objections
EPA review has identified significant environmental impacts that should be avoided in order to
provide adequate protection for the environment. Corrective measures may require substantial changes
to the preferred alternative or consideration of some other project alternative (including the no-action
alternative or a new alternative). EPA intends to work with the lead agency to reduce these impacts.
EU – Environmentally Unsatisfactory
EPA review has identified adverse environmental impacts that are of sufficient magnitude that they
are unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health or welfare or environmental quality. EPA intends
to work with the lead agency to reduce these impacts. If the potential unsatisfactory impacts are not
corrected at the final EIS stage, this proposal will be recommended for referral to the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ).
Adequacy of the Impact Statement
Category 1 – Adequate
EPA believes the draft EIS adequately sets forth the environmental impact(s) of the preferred
alternative and those of the alternatives reasonably available to the project or action. No further analysis
of data collection is necessary, but the reviewer may suggest the addition of clarifying language or
information.
Category 2 – Insufficient Information
The draft EIS does not contain sufficient information for EPA to fully assess environmental impacts
that should be avoided in order to fully protect the environment, or the EPA reviewer has identified new
reasonably available alternatives that are within the spectrum of alternatives analyzed in the draft EIS,
which could reduce the environmental impacts of the action. The identified additional information, data,
analyses or discussion should be included in the final EIS.
Category 3 – Inadequate
EPA does not believe that the draft EIS adequately assesses potentially significant environmental
impacts of the action, or the EPA reviewer has identified new, reasonably available alternatives that are
outside of the spectrum of alternatives analyzed in the draft EIS, which should be analyzed in order to
reduce the potentially significant environmental impacts. EPA believes that the identified additional
information, data, analyses, or discussions are of such a magnitude that they should have full public
review at a draft stage. EPA does not believe that the draft EIS is adequate for the purposes of the
National Environmental Policy Act and or Section 309 review, and thus should be formally revised and
made available for public comment in a supplemental or revised draft EIS. On the basis of the potential
significant impacts involved, this proposal could be a candidate for referral to the CEQ.
