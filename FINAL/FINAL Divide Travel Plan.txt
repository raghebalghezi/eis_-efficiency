Abstract The Helena National Forest is proposing changes to the existing motorized public

access routes and prohibitions for wheeled and over-snow motorized vehicles on National
Forest system lands within the Divide Travel Planning Area on the Helena Ranger District. The
overall objective of this proposal is to provide a manageable system of designated public
motorized access routes, consistent with and to achieve the purposes of, Forest Service travel
management regulations at 36 CFR part 212 subpart B.
This final environmental impact statement (FEIS) considers five alternatives in detail – the No
Action and four action alternatives. Alternative 1 is the No Action alternative, which provides a
baseline for comparing the magnitude of environmental effects of the action alternatives.
Alternative 2 was the proposed action presented to the public during the 2008 scoping period.
This alternative was developed using the current Forest Transportation System maps,
information from the 2004 Helena Roads Analysis, field verification and public input. Alternative
3 was developed in response to public input regarding wildlife security issues, non-motorized
uses and general resource concerns relative to erosion and sedimentation from road conditions.
Alternative 4 was developed as a result of public comments. This alternative addresses both
social and resource concerns identified by the public. Alternative 5, the final preferred
alternative, was developed in response to public comment on the draft environmental impact
statement (DEIS) as well as additional field reviews and is designed to increase motorized loop
trail opportunities and reduce the short spur and redundant parallel routes. It also improves big
game security as well as addresses resource concerns relative to erosion and sedimentation
from roads and stream crossings. Consideration was given to further align the Continental
Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with National Standards.
The No Action alternative would defer implementation of the Travel Management Rule and
would not result in a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). No changes would be made to the
existing system of available public motorized routes and areas within the Divide Travel planning
area.
The four action alternatives would be consistent with the travel planning regulations at 36 CFR
212 Subpart B, with the resulting available wheeled motorized access routes and areas
designated on a MVUM and public use of a motor vehicle other than in accordance with those
designations would be prohibited as per 36 CFR 261.13. If an action alternative is selected, it
would meet the intent of subsequent site-specific planning as required by the ‘Off-Highway

Vehicle Record of Decision and Forest Plan Amendment’ (January 2001). This FEIS includes a
programmatic plan amendment to the Helena National Forest Plan for Standard 4a, big game
security. This amendment would establish a new standard for elk security for those herd units
within the planning area.
This FEIS and associated draft decision documents (Records of Decision) are subject to the predecisional administrative review process (objection process) pursuant to 36 CFR 218, subparts A
and B. Objections will only be accepted from those who have previously submitted specific
written comments regarding this proposed planning effort during scoping or other designated
opportunity for public comment in accordance with §218.5(a). Issues raised in objections must
be based on previously submitted, timely, specifically written comments regarding this
proposed planning effort unless based on new information arising after the designated
comment opportunities. Objections, including attachments, must be filed via mail, fax, email,
hand delivery, express delivery, or messenger service. An automated response will confirm the
electronic objection has been received. Electronic objections must be submitted in MS Word,
Word Perfect, or Rich Text Format (RTF).
Objections must be submitted within 45 calendar days following the publication in the Helena
Independent Record, the newspaper of record. The publication date in the newspaper of record
is the exclusive means for calculating the time to file an objection. It is the objector’s
responsibility to ensure timely filing of a written objection with the reviewing officer pursuant to
§218.9. The regulations prohibit extending the time to file an objection.
Because this travel plan decision also includes a programmatic Forest Plan Amendment, this
aspect of the decision is subject to objection pursuant to 36 CFR Part 219, subpart B. Objections
specific to the programmatic amendment will be accepted for an additional 15 days, so
therefore must be submitted within 60 calendar days following publication in the Helena
Independent Record-newspaper of record. It is the responsibility of the objector to ensure their
objection is received in a timely manner. The publication date of the legal notice of the
objection period in the newspaper of record is the exclusive means for calculating the time to
file an objection. Objectors should not rely on date or timeframe information provided by any
other source.
The objection must contain the minimum content requirements specified in §218.8(d) and
219.54(c) and incorporation of documents by reference is permitted only as provided in
§218.8(b) and 219.54(b). All objections are available for public inspection during and after the
objection process.
At a minimum an objection must include the following (36 CFR 218.8(d)) and 36 CFR 219.54(c)):
(1) The objector’s name and address, with a telephone number, if available; ( 2) a signature or
other verification of authorship upon request (a scanned signature for Email may be filed with
the objection);
(3) when multiple names are listed on an objection, identification of the lead objector
(verification of the identity of the lead objector shall be provided upon request); (4) the name of
the proposed plan or plan amendment, the name and title of the Responsible Official and the
name(s) of the National Forest(s) and/or Ranger District(s) on which the proposed plan or plan
amendment, will be implemented; and (5) a description of those aspects of the proposed plan
or plan amendment addressed by the objection, including specific issues related to the
proposed plan or plan amendment, if applicable, how the objector believes the environmental
analysis or draft decision specifically violates law, regulation, or policy; suggested remedies that
would resolve the objection; supporting reasons for the reviewing officer to consider; and (6) a

SUMMARY
The Helena National Forest (HNF) is proposing changes to the existing system of designated
motorized public access routes and prohibitions within the Divide Travel Planning area for
wheeled and over-snow motorized vehicles.
The area this travel plan includes is approximately 155,500 acres of National Forest System (NFS)
lands and lies within Lewis and Clark and Powell Counties, located in the state of Montana. The
area encompasses Black Mountain and extends to the Tenmile Drainage and Little Blackfoot and
Bison Mountain Areas. The following four Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA) are included in the
Divide Travel Plan area: Electric Peak, Jericho Mountain, Lazyman and Nevada Mountain. The
Helena National Forest Plan recommended portions of the Electric Peak IRA for Congressional
designation as wilderness.
The existing system of available public motor vehicle routes and areas in the Divide area is the
culmination of multiple agency decisions over recent decades. Public motor vehicle use of much
of this available system continues to be manageable and consistent with the current travel
management regulation. Exceptions have been identified, based on public input and the criteria
listed at 36 CFR 212.55 and in these cases changes are proposed. The overall objective is to
provide a manageable system of designated public motorized access routes and areas within the
Divide Travel Plan area, consistent with and to achieve the purposes of Forest Service travel
management regulations at 36 CFR part 212 subpart B.
Executive Order (EO) 11644 (1972) as amended directed the agency to, among other things,
designate “the specific areas and trails on public lands on which the use of off-road vehicles may
be permitted and areas in which the use of off-road vehicles may not be permitted.” The
executive order, Section 8, then requires the agency to “monitor the effects of the use of offroad vehicles [and] from time to time amend or rescind designations.” The Helena National
Forest has updated its travel plan numerous times over the last three decades, amending or
rescinding designations as monitoring indicated the need. This proposal continues that
longstanding approach. Public motor vehicle use of much of the existing system continues to be
manageable and consistent with EO 11644 and current travel management regulations;
however, the Forest has identified a need for change in some locations.
In 2005 the Forest Service published new implementing regulations (Federal Register 2005: 70
FR 68264). This rule, known as the Travel Management Rule (36 CFR 212 Subpart B), replaced
the previous regulations. While carrying forward the requirements of the executive order, it
makes two other national requirements. First, all units will now use a consistent approach to
wheeled motor vehicle use designations by identifying on a map those routes and areas that are
open to wheeled motorized use. Second, once designations are in place, wheeled motorized
travel off of designated routes and areas will be prohibited.
The purpose of this travel plan is to comply with the 2005 Travel Management Rule by providing
a system of roads, trails and areas designated for wheeled vehicle use by class of vehicle and
time of year on the Helena National Forest (36 CFR 212.50). This travel plan will also designate
routes and areas for over-snow motorized vehicle use.
Several actions were needed to comply with the Travel Management Rule, this decision meets
these needs by:

Divide Travel

Having no motorized cross-country travel except in designated areas - Cross
country travel has been prohibited since 2001 on the Helena National Forest.
Clarification of which trails would be open for motorized use - This decision will
result in a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) which will show designated
motorized routes.
The optional designation of the limited use of motor vehicles within a specified
distance of certain designated routes and, if appropriate, within specified time
periods, solely for the purpose of dispersed camping or parking - This decision
restricts parking for dispersed camping to within 70 feet of a designated route
and within 30 feet for all other uses.
Amending the forest plan direction if there is need - This decision requires an
amendment. See Forest Programmatic Amendment for Big Game section in
Chapter 3 of this document.

This decision also achieves the overall objective by meeting the following needs:
•
•

Designate public wheeled motorized use for roads and trails - This decision will
result in a MVUM that will show designated motorized routes.
Ensure the route system provides continued access for resource management
needs - This decision designates routes open for public motorized travel.
Administrative travel for resource management is analyzed, if necessary, and
authorized on a site specific basis. A future site specific analysis will also
consider access needs for future resource management when determining
appropriate closure methods.

Ensure the route system minimized exclusive use from and to private land and mining - In most
cases this decision designated routes that receive regular private land access use open to the
public as well. There are situations in the Divide Travel Planning area where road conditions or
resource concerns indicated it was not feasible for a private land access route.
The Divide Travel Plan was initially part of a forestwide travel planning approach that began in
2000. In January 2001, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a joint
decision known as the 2001 Tri-State Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Decision; this decision
prohibited motorized cross-country wheeled-vehicle travel on all National Forest System (NFS)
and BLM public lands in a three state area except on designated routes and areas. The decision
amended nine Forest Plans, including the Helena National Forest Plan. It also directed all
National Forests to establish a schedule for completing site-specific planning that would
designate appropriate uses on all system and non-system roads and trails.
In 2004, the Helena National Forest completed a Forest Roads analysis report for maintenance
level 1-5 roads (see project record). The Helena National Forest used this as an additional tool
for developing the road-by-road comparison table located in Appendix E of the FEIS.
In November 2005, the Forest Service published new implementing regulations (Federal Register
2005: 70 FR 68264). This rule, known as the 2005 Travel Management Rule (36 CFR Subpart B),
replaced the previous regulations.
In December of 2008, the Helena National Forest mailed a newsletter summarizing the updated
proposal and alternatives with a request for comments. It reiterated the change in scope of the
plan from the forestwide 2003 effort to the Divide Travel Planning area, provided details about
the proposal, contained a public comment sheet and furnished information on the Final Travel
Management Rule of November 2005.
Summary - v

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel

In September 2011, a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
was published in the Federal Register. An additional scoping period ensued, issues were
identified and alternatives developed, which then led to the development of the DEIS.
In February 2013, the Helena National Forest sent a letter to interested parties notifying them
that there would be two separate decisions for this plan; one for the travel plan portion of the
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and the other for the programmatic plan amendment.
This letter also explained the objection process (36 CFR part 219) for the programmatic
amendment; and the potential for the use of the 36 CFR part 218 objection process if it became
available. Since then, the agency has received direction that any decisions that fall under 36 CFR
part 212 made after September 27, 2013 would be made under 36 CFR part 218 regulations.
The Helena District Ranger and Forest Supervisor also met with County Commissioners, tribal
leaders and individuals in addition to a variety of special user groups to discuss the alternatives
and options.
The DEIS was released in March of 2014. Based on the comments from the public and field
reviews a fifth alternative and revised Forest Plan Amendment were developed for the Divide
Travel Plan and released for public comment in September of 2014. The analyses were then
updated to include alternative 5, the preferred alternative and the revised Forest Plan
Amendment. These updates are included in this FEIS.
The Divide Travel Plan Decision would include only open or closed determinations. Any existing
route not identified as a Helena National Forest (HNF) system route in this travel plan decision
would be considered closed to wheeled motorized use. None of the alternatives would prohibit
non-motorized activities. The proposed changes would determine where wheeled and oversnow motorized vehicles could access the Forest System roads and trails and areas open to off
route over-snow travel.
Alternative 1 – No Action: The No Action alternative is required under NEPA regulations [40 CFR
1502.14(d)]. This alternative represents the existing, baseline condition or trends by which the
action alternatives are compared.
The No Action alternative would defer implementation of the Travel Management Rule and
would not result in a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). No changes would be made to the
existing system of available public motorized routes and areas within the Divide Travel Planning
area.
No Action is represented by the current Helena National Forest map and supporting
prohibitions. Permissible motorized uses include those routes and areas not otherwise
prohibited. Under No Action, motorized access for dispersed camping, parking associated with
camping.
The Helena National Forest Plan, as amended, prohibits wheeled cross country travel (2001 TriState OHV Decision). However, wheeled motorized use of unauthorized routes that existed at
that time of that Forest Plan amendment are unaffected by this prohibition. That use is not
defined as cross-country travel under the amended Forest Plan as long as the vehicle fits within
the pre-existing width of the route. The motorized access for dispersed camping is an exception
and that use is also permitted up to 300 feet from these routes. Under the No Action
alternative, these uses could continue.
Alternative 2: Alternative 2 was the proposed action presented to the public during the 2008
scoping period. This alternative was developed using the current Forest Transportation System
maps, information from the 2004 Helena Roads Analysis, field verification and public input.
Summary - vi

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel

Consistent with the travel planning regulations at 36 CFR 212 Subpart B, the resulting available
wheeled motorized access routes and areas would be designated on a MVUM and public use of
a motor vehicle other than in accordance with those designations would be prohibited as per 36
CFR 261.13.
For more specific detail regarding mileage please refer to appendix E in addition to the
alternative maps at the end of the document. If this alternative is selected, it would meet the
intent of subsequent site-specific planning as required by the ‘Off-Highway Vehicle Record of
Decision and Forest Plan Amendment’ (January 2001).
Alternative 3: Comments received in the 2008 scoping process included comments regarding
the desire to enjoy the outdoors in its natural state without the interruption of motorized use.
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments regarding wildlife security issues,
non-motorized uses and general resource concerns relative to erosion and sedimentation from
road conditions.
Consistent with the travel planning regulations at 36 CFR 212 Subpart B, the resulting available
wheeled motorized access routes and areas would be designated on a MVUM and public use of
a motor vehicle other than in accordance with those designations would be prohibited as per 36
CFR 261.13.
If this alternative is selected, it would meet the intent of subsequent site-specific planning as
required by the ‘Off-Highway Vehicle Record of Decision and Forest Plan Amendment’ (January
2001).
Alternative 4: Alternative 4 was developed in response to public comments. This alternative
addresses both social and resource concerns identified by the public.
Consistent with the travel planning regulations at 36 CFR 212 Subpart B, the resulting available
wheeled motorized access routes and areas would be designated on a MVUM and public use of
a motor vehicle other than in accordance with those designations would be prohibited as per 36
CFR 261.13.
If this alternative is selected, it would meet the intent of subsequent site-specific planning as
required by the ‘Off-Highway Vehicle Record of Decision and Forest Plan Amendment’ (January
2001).
Alternative 5: This proposed alternative was developed in response to public comment and field
reviews and is designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities and reduce the short spur
and redundant parallel routes. It also improves big game security as well as addresses resource
concerns relative to erosion and sedimentation from roads and stream crossings. Consideration
was given to further align the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with National
Standards.
The selection of this alternative would result in the production of a Motor Vehicle Use Map
which would identify motorized routes that are open for use along with corresponding
restrictions and designations. In addition, this map would show restrictions regarding dispersed
camping. Use of a motor vehicle other than in accordance with specific designations would be
prohibited. The authority for this action comes from 36 CFR 212 and 36 CFR 261.13.
Alternative 5 would meet the intent of subsequent site-specific planning as required by the ‘OffHighway Vehicle Record of Decision and Forest Plan Amendment’ (January 2001).
Programmatic Plan Amendment: Implementing any of the action alternatives would require a
plan amendment to the Helena National Forest Plan for the planning area regarding the

Divide Travel

standard for the hiding cover/open road density index. The proposed programmatic plan
amendment would establish a new standard for elk security for those herd units within the
planning area. The programmatic amendment includes two alternatives; a no action alternative
and a revised alternative B which is the proposed alternative.
Alternative A - No Action: Alternative A is the existing Forest Plan Standard. In this case, ‘no
action’ means no amendment to the existing Forest Plan. The analysis of effects associated with
alternative A describes the effects of the current Forest Plan standard.
Alternative B: Alternative B was designed to address best science and local knowledge. It also
expanded consideration to all open motorized routes (whereas alternative A only applies to
roads as originally envisioned in the Forest Plan). Alternative B would replace the existing Forest
Plan Big Game Standard 4(a). The Divide Travel Plan area encompasses only about ¾ of the
Divide landscape (portions of the Quartz, Black Mountain – Brooklyn Bridge and Little Prickly
Pear – Ophir EHUs falling into areas covered by previous travel management plans); however,
the proposed amendment would apply to all portions of the herd units included in the Divide
Travel Plan analysis. Under the Forest Plan amendment proposed for the Divide Travel Plan and
applicable to future projects in the Travel Plan Area, the “security area” approach would replace
the “road density/hiding cover index” as the Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability
of elk to hunting. The amendment derives from the Hillis methodology (1991) and adopts
specific guidelines for its application from Recommendations for Big Game Habitat Management
on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena and Lewis and Clark National Forests (MDFWP and USDA
Working Group 2013).
Several public comments received during scoping and the comment period for the DEIS included
the request that a travel plan alternative be developed to meet Standard 4a. An analysis was
completed to determine if the Forest had management discretion to close enough Forest
System roads to achieve compliance with Standard 4a in the elk herd units in the Divide Travel
Plan project area. That analysis indicated that the Forest did have the jurisdiction to close
several miles of open roads during the hunting season to achieve consistency with Standard 4a
in 5 out of 6 herd units. However, for one of those five herd units – Quartz Creek – travel
planning has already been completed in a majority of that herd unit; so even with extensive
closures in the Divide Travel Plan there is no alternative that would be able to meet the
standard. The Greenhorn EHU would also remain out of compliance with Standard 4a because
the Forest simply does not have sufficient jurisdiction on roads or closure discretion to meet the
existing standard. For the most part, the extensive closures that would be necessary to meet the
standard in the remaining EHUs would not provide reasonable access to the HNF during hunting
season.
In the development of alternative five, great consideration was given to maximize the quantity
and quality of security areas while maintaining reasonable access. When designating routes,
the 2005 Travel Management Rule requires Forests to consider effects on the following, with
the objective of minimizing:
•
•
•
•

Damage to soil, watershed, vegetation and other forest resources;
Harassment of wildlife and significant disruption of wildlife habitats;
Conflicts between motor vehicle use and existing or proposed recreational uses
of NFS or neighboring Federal lands; and
Conflicts among different classes of motor vehicle uses of NFS lands or
neighboring Federal lands.

Summary - viii

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel

For the purposes of this planning effort, the Helena National Forest interprets the term
“minimize” to mean meeting Forest Plan standards, moving forest resources toward the goals
and objectives described in the Forest Plan and complying with all state and federal regulations
which would diminish the impacts of the effects on Forest resources.
Based upon the effects of the alternatives, the responsible official will decide what changes, if
any, to make to the current designated wheeled and over-snow motorized system and what, if
any, Forest Plan amendments to adopt within the Divide Travel Planning area. The responsible
official will also review and make a determination on the proposed Forest Plan programmatic
amendment, which is described briefly in Chapter 2 and in full in Chapter 3.
With respect to the scope of the Divide analysis, the decision space is narrow. The decision
centers around designating type and season of motorized use on roads, trails and over-snow
areas.
Per the January 28, 2015 Over-Snow Vehicle Use Rule, the responsible official is including oversnow vehicles in this analysis so that suitable areas, routes and seasons for their operation can
be provided as envisioned in the Helena Forest Plan.

CHAPTER 1. PURPOSE OF AND NEED FOR ACTION
Document Structure
The Forest Service has prepared this Environmental Impact Statement in compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and regulations. This
Environmental Impact Statement discloses the direct, indirect and cumulative environmental impacts
that would result from the proposed action and alternatives. The document is organized into four
chapters:
•

•

•

•
•
•

Chapter 1. Purpose and Need for Action: The chapter includes information on the history
of the project proposal, the purpose of and need for the project and the agency’s
proposal for achieving that purpose and need. This section also details how the Forest
Service informed the public of the proposal and how the public responded.
Chapter 2. Alternatives, including the Proposed Action: This chapter provides a more
detailed description of the agency’s proposed action as well as alternative methods for
achieving the stated purpose. These alternatives were developed based on significant
issues raised by the public and other agencies. This discussion also includes mitigation
measures. Finally, this section provides a summary table of the environmental
consequences associated with each alternative.
Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences: This chapter
describes the environmental effects of implementing the proposed action and other
alternatives. This analysis is organized by [insert topic (i.e., resource area, significant
issues, environmental component)].
Chapter 4. Consultation and Coordination: This chapter provides a list of preparers and
agencies consulted during the development of the environmental impact statement.
Appendices: The appendices provide more detailed information to support the analyses
presented in the environmental impact statement.
Index: The index provides page numbers by document topic.

Additional documentation, including more detailed analyses of project-area resources, may be found in
the project planning record.

Background
The Divide Travel Plan was initially part of a forestwide travel planning approach that began in 2000. In
January 2001, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a joint decision known
as the 2001 Tri-State Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Decision; this decision prohibited motorized crosscountry wheeled-vehicle travel on all National Forest System (NFS) and BLM public lands in a three state
area except on designated routes and areas. The decision amended nine Forest Plans, including the
Helena National Forest Plan. It also directed all National Forests to establish a schedule for completing
site-specific planning that would designate appropriate uses on all system and non-system roads and
trails.
In 2004, the Helena National Forest completed a Forest Roads analysis report for maintenance level 1-5
roads (see project record). The Helena National Forest used this as an additional tool for developing the
route-by-route comparison table located in Appendix E of this FEIS.

Document Structure - 1

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

In November 2005, the Forest Service published new implementing regulations (Federal Register 2005:
70 FR 68264). This rule, known as the 2005 Travel Management Rule (36 CFR Subpart B), replaced the
previous regulations.
In December of 2008, the Helena National Forest mailed a newsletter summarizing the updated
proposal and alternatives with a request for comments. It reiterated the change in scope of the plan
from the forestwide 2003 effort to the Divide Travel Planning area, provided details about the proposal,
contained a public comment sheet and furnished information on the Final Travel Management Rule of
November 2005.
In September 2011, a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was
published in the Federal Register. An additional scoping period ensued, issues were identified and
alternatives developed, which then led to the development of the DEIS.
In February 2013, the Helena National Forest sent a letter to interested parties notifying them that there
would be two separate decisions for this plan; one for the travel plan portion of the Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) and the other for the programmatic plan amendment. This letter also explained
the objection process (36 CFR part 219) for the programmatic amendment; and the potential for the use
of the 36 CFR part 218 objection process if it becomes available. Since then, the agency has received
direction that any decisions that fall under 36 CFR part 212 made after September 27, 2013 would be
made under 36 CFR part 218 regulations.
The DEIS was released in March of 2014. Based on the comments from the public and field reviews a
fifth alternative and revised Forest Plan Amendment were developed for the Divide Travel Plan and
released for public comment in September of 2014. The analyses were updated to include alternative 5,
the preferred alternative and the revised Forest Plan Amendment. These updates are included in this
FEIS.

Purpose and Need for Action
The overall objective of this proposal is to provide a manageable system of designated public motorized
access routes and areas within the Divide area, consistent with and to achieve the purposes of Forest
Plan and travel management regulations at 36 CFR part 212 subpart B.
Executive Order (EO) 11644 (1972) as amended directed the agency to, among other things, designate
“the specific areas and trails on public lands on which the use of off-road vehicles may be permitted and
areas in which the use of off-road vehicles may not be permitted.” The executive order, Section 8, then
requires the agency to “monitor the effects of the use of off-road vehicles [and] from time to time amend
or rescind designations.” The Helena National Forest has updated its travel plan numerous times over
the last three decades, amending or rescinding designations as monitoring indicated the need. This
proposal continues that longstanding approach. Public motor vehicle use of much of the existing system
continues to be manageable and consistent with EO 11644 and current travel management regulations;
however, the Forest has identified a need for change in some locations.
In 2005 the Forest Service published new implementing regulations (Federal Register 2005: 70 FR
68264). This rule, known as the Travel Management Rule (36 CFR 212 Subpart B), replaced the previous
regulations. While carrying forward the requirements of the executive order, it makes two other
national requirements. First, all units will now use a consistent approach to wheeled motor vehicle use
designations by identifying on a map those routes and areas that are open to wheeled motorized use.
Second, once designations are in place, wheeled motorized travel off of designated routes and areas will
be prohibited.

Purpose and Need for Action - 2

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The purpose of this travel plan is to comply with the 2005 Travel Management Rule by providing a
system of roads, trails and areas designated for wheeled vehicle use by class of vehicle and time of year
on the Helena National Forest (36 CFR 212.50). This travel plan will also designate routes and areas for
over-snow motorized vehicle use, per the 2015 Over-Snow Vehicle Use ruling.
On the Helena National Forest, complying with the Travel Management Rule means there is a need for:
•
•
•

•

Having no motorized cross-country travel except in designated areas;
Clarification of which trails would be open for motorized use;
The optional designation of the limited use of motor vehicles within a specified distance
of certain designated routes and if appropriate, within specified time periods, solely for
the purposes of dispersed camping or parking; and
Amending the forest plan direction if there is need (i.e. projects and plans must be
consistent with the forest plan, or the forest plan must be amended.)

For the Helena National Forest, wheeled motorized cross country travel has been prohibited since 2001
and therefore no change is needed for most lands to be consistent with the rule. Existing user-built or
unauthorized motorized routes, however, were unaffected by the 2001 decision. At the time the 2001
Tri-State Decision was signed, several miles of user-created routes existed on Helena National Forest
system lands within the Divide Planning area. These miles, in addition to the existing system routes were
analyzed under each alternative. Therefore, this proposal must determine future use and/or need of all
routes (system and non-system) within the Divide Travel Planning area.
To meet the overall objective, there is a need to:
•
•
•
•
•

Designate public wheeled and over-snow motorized and non-motorized use for roads
and trails;
Ensure the route system provides continued access for resource management needs
(e.g. vegetation management and fire);
Ensure the route system minimizes exclusive use from and to private land and mining
claims;
Reduce the number of different travel restriction types including seasonal restrictions;
and
Maintain inventoried roadless characteristics in the four identified inventoried Roadless
Areas (IRAs)

Alternative 5 - Preferred Alternative
In response to the Purpose and Need for Action, the Helena National Forest developed the preferred
alternative using current Forest Transportation System maps, information from the 2004 Helena Roads
Analysis process, field verification and monitoring and public input. Consistent with our travel planning
regulations, the resulting available wheeled motorized access routes and areas on a MVUM would be
designated and public use of a motor vehicle other than in accordance with those designations would be
prohibited as per 36 CFR 261.13.
The preferred alternative (alternative 5) includes closing some roads and trails that are currently open to
motorized use; and opening some roads and trails for motorized use that are currently closed. No areas
would be designated for off-route wheeled motorized use other than the limited exception for dispersed
camping and parking.

Alternative 5 - Preferred Alternative - 3

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

This alternative is designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities and reduce the short spur and
redundant parallel routes. It also improves big game security and addresses resource concerns relative
to erosion and sedimentation from roads and stream crossings. Consideration was given to further align
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with National Standards.
If this alternative is selected, the wheeled motorized vehicle routes and areas would be identified on a
map as part of the record of decision for this travel plan. In addition, a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM)
would be produced and available to the public for this planning area. Public use of a motor vehicle other
than in accordance with specific designations would be prohibited. The authority for this action comes
from 36 CFR 212 and 36 CFR 261.13.

Design Features Specific to Alternative 5
Seasonal Trail (route) Dates
All motorized trails with seasonal use open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches and less in width
would be open from 5/16 to 8/31 with the exception of the Lava Mountain connector trail # 4009-A1
which would be open from 5/16 to 10/14. There are approximately 14.5 miles of motorized trails that
would have no seasonal restrictions.

Kading-Limburger Springs Area
National Forest System Route (NFSR) #227 would remain open to Kading campground. Beyond Kading
campground, NFSR #227-E1 would become part of non-motorized trail 329. The trailhead parking area
on NFSR #227 past Kading campground where the route would change to non-motorized use would be
expanded to accommodate day use vehicles and horse trailers.
Motorized Trail #501 would remain open to motorized vehicles of 50 inches and less in width from 5/16
to 8/31.
Over snow motorized travel would be allowed in areas north and west of NFSR #227 from 12/2 to 5/15.
Refer to the Alt 5 map for more detailed over-snow motorized travel in this area.

Sweeny Creek Area
With exception of the Priest Pass Road, all routes in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed year-long to
motorized use including over-snow vehicles.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
NFSR #136-D1 would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles yearlong. Approximately, one mile of the
CDNST trail located north of NFSR #136, and just south and east of Meyers Hill, would be rerouted and
designated as a non-motorized section of the CDNST. Refer to the CDNST map for information on
motorized and non-motorized segments of the CDNST.

Larabee Crossing and Golden Anchor Crossing – Little Blackfoot Area
The crossing at Larabee (227-D1) would be closed to wheeled motorized travel. In addition, a foot/stock
bridge would be constructed to connect to the non-motorized Larabee Trail #359. A trailhead would be
designated nearby on NFSR #227.

Alternative 5 - Preferred Alternative - 4

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The stream crossing located on Golden Anchor NFSR #4100 is currently a ford crossing. This alternative
would replace the ford crossing with a bridge, bottomless culvert, or structure installed to accommodate
wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width and less and over-snow motorized vehicles.

Unauthorized Routes
Alternative 5 would designate approximately 1.4 miles of identified unauthorized routes to be added to
the Forest Transportation System. All routes, including unauthorized routes, not identified or included in
this alternative, as well as any future created routes, would be considered closed and would be
physically closed without additional NEPA.

Parking
Parking would be limited up to 30 feet from the edge of a designated route.

Access to Dispersed Campsites up to 70 feet from a designated route
Parking and motor vehicle use associated with dispersed camping would be limited to no more than 70
feet from the edge of a designated route as long as:
•
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources i.e., damage to live trees and
shrubs, rutting, and eroding of stream banks or bare soil.
Travel off-route does not cross streams
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas
Vehicles travel to dispersed campsites would be limited to no closer than 30 feet of a
stream or body of live water.

Access to Dispersed Campsites further than 70 feet from a designated route
Dispersed campsites located more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route that are identified
on the alternative 5 map would remain open for dispersed camping and parking associated with
dispersed camping. The five items identified under the access to dispersed campsites up to 70 feet from
a designated route section are applicable for this as well.

Other Features
•
•
•
•

NFSR #314 would be open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width and less
from 5/16 to 8/31, past the gate in Section 7.
NFSRs #314-J1 and #314-J3 would be closed year-long to motorized travel
Motorized Trails #502, #503, and #504 in the Kading/Limburger Springs area, and NFSR
#1868 would be closed to wheeled motorized use year-long.
NFSR #1870 and NFSR #1871-A2 are currently closed yearlong; however, alternative 5
would open them to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches and less in width from 5/16
to 8/31. This route would connect to NFSR #1871 to create a loop trail. The road spurs
within this area that dead-end would be closed yearlong to wheeled motorized vehicles.

Alternative 5 - Preferred Alternative - 5

Environmental Impact Statement

•

Divide Travel Plan

Two fords on NFSR # 495-D1 would remain open to motorized vehicles to provide access
to Motorized Trail 4101-A1 which will be open to vehicles 50 nches and less in width
from 5/16 to 8/31.

Approximately ½ mile of NFSR #1805-A1 (accessed from NFSR #1805) would be open to wheeled
highway legal vehicles from 5/16 to 10/14; A motorized vehicle trailhead would be developed at this
location where it would connect to a one-mile loop trail open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches
and less in width from 5/16 through 10/14.
Additional details regarding the preferred alternative are provided in Chapter 2.
Public use of a motor vehicle on routes and areas not included in the above designations, including
currently available unauthorized routes, would become prohibited pursuant to 36 CFR 212.50 and
261.13 at the time the MVUM is published.
Analysis indicates the action alternatives in this travel plan would require a programmatic amendment
to the Forest Plan for the area regarding Forest Plan Standard 4a for the hiding cover/open road density
index (HFP, p. II/17-II/18). Four of the six elk herd units in the Divide landscape are deficient in elk
security at this point in time and do not meet the standard. As a result, the Forest Plan standard would
be amended under a separate decision as it relates to the Divide Travel Planning Area.
Temporary closures, for spring break-up, could still be implemented as needed to limit damage to any
such road, trail, or segment thereof (e.g. 36 CFR 261 - Prohibitions).

Decision Framework
The Forest Supervisor of the Helena National Forest is the responsible official for this plan. Given the
purpose and need for this action, the Forest Supervisor will review the five alternatives, the anticipated
effects and public input. The Forest Supervisor will decide what changes, if any, to make to the current
designated wheeled and over-snow motorized system and what, if any, Forest Plan amendments to
adopt within the Divide Travel Planning area. Any combination of the alternatives could be selected.
The responsible official will consider the comments, disclosures of environmental consequences and
applicable laws and regulations and policies in making the decision and stating the rationale in the
Record of Decision (ROD). The responsible official will also review and make a determination on the
amendment to the “Helena National Forest Plan” proposed for each alternative, which is described
briefly in Chapter 2 and in full in Chapter 3.
With respect to the scope of the Divide analysis, the decision space is narrow. The decision centers
around designating type and season of motorized use on existing roads, trails, non-system routes and
over-snow areas.
Per the 2015 Over-Snow Vehicle Use ruling, the responsible official elected to include over-snow
vehicles in this analysis so that suitable areas, routes and seasons for their operation can be provided as
envisioned in the Helena Forest Plan.
In addition, the decision maker chose not to include construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, or
obliteration in the alternatives that were analyzed in detail. The responsible official felt that potential
resource impacts resulting from construction of new roads and trails, or the reconstruction of existing
routes, would be better analyzed in detail at the site-specific level and documented in later analyses and
decisions.

Decision Framework - 6

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Public Involvement
Since 2000, public involvement for the Divide Travel Plan process has been initiated several times.
Varying circumstances have dictated the start and stop of the process since the inception in 2000 when
the Helena National Forest introduced the Forestwide approach to travel planning. The Forestwide
travel plan effort first appeared in the Federal Register as a NOI in December of 2000. It was then
rescinded in March of 2003. In April, 2003 another NOI to prepare an EIS was printed in the Federal
Register and then rescinded in June of 2007.
The Helena National Forest has provided opportunities for public involvement for this travel planning
effort throughout this planning process. This planning effort, as currently proposed, has been posted on
the quarterly Schedule of Proposed Actions (SOPA) report since April of 2008. Information gathered and
received during scoping helped the Helena National Forest develop the action alternatives for the area
within the Divide Travel Plan.
In December of 2008, the Helena National Forest mailed a newsletter that summarized the updated
proposed action alternative with a request for comments. The information was also posted on the
Forest website. The proposed action reiterated the change in scope of the plan from the 2003 effort,
provided details about the proposal, contained a public comment sheet and furnished information on
the Final Travel Management Rule of November 2005.
During the scoping period, the Helena National Forest hosted open houses to provide information and
answer questions regarding the planning effort. The proposal was also covered in the Helena
Independent Record. Over 300 public responses were received during the scoping period. All the letters
and emails were summarized on a spreadsheet and are available for public review in the project record.
A third alternative was developed in response to address some of the input received from those seeking
non-motorized opportunities. The fourth alternative combines attributes from alternatives 2 and 3,
addressing both social and resource concerns. The fifth alternative was designed to increase motorized
loop trail opportunities and reduce the short spur and redundant parallel routes.
The NOI announcing the preparation of an EIS was published in the Federal Register on Thursday
September 8, 2011. This marked the continuation of the scoping comment period; during which time
the Forest received comments in support of the proposed changes to routes in the Sweeny Creek area
specifically. The Forest also received requests for maps of the proposed alternatives. People who
requested maps were informed of the schedule and that maps would be produced and released with
the DEIS for public review and comment. People were also informed that upon release of the DEIS, a
formal 60 day public comment period would be initiated and published in the Federal Register. During
this time, they were encouraged to provide specific comments to assist the deciding official in
understanding their concerns and/or support. Every effort was made to ensure that a comprehensive
mailing list was developed to ensure the widest distribution to the public possible. The Helena National
Forest also provided additional information and planning process updates on the Forest website.
In February 2013, the Helena National Forest sent a letter to the public and other agencies notifying
them that there would be two separate decisions for this travel plan; one for the travel plan portion of
the EIS and the other for the programmatic plan amendment. Each would utilize a separate objection
process which would fall under different regulation processes. The EIS objection process is governed by
36 CFR part 218 and the amendment objection process is governed by 36 CFR 219.53(a).
In March of 2014, the Helena National Forest released the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
and Forest Plan Amendment. A notice of availability and request for comments on the DEIS and Forest
Plan Amendment for comment was published in the Federal Register on April 18, 2014. We received a

Public Involvement - 7

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

total of approximately 148 responses during the 45-day (FEIS) and 60-day (programmatic amendment)
comment period. As a result of a detailed analysis of these comments and additional public input, we
developed a new travel plan alternative, alternative 5 (preferred alternative) and revised proposed
wildlife programmatic plan amendment for big game security.
In September of 2014, the Helena National Forest released a draft alternative 5 and a revised proposed
wildlife programmatic plan amendment for public review and an additional 27 day comment period.
Approximately 90 comments were received and were considered during analysis and used to inform this
FEIS and the Draft Record of Decision (ROD).

Issues
Issues serve to highlight effects or unintended consequences that may occur from the proposed action
and alternatives, giving opportunities during the analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare tradeoffs for the decision maker and public to understand. An issue is phrased as a cause-effect statement
relating actions under consideration to effects. An issue statement describes a specific action and the
environmental affects expected to result from the action (FSH 1909.15.12.4).
The CEQ regulations have specific direction for issues in EISs. Agencies shall determine the scope and
the significant issues to be analyzed in depth in the environmental impact statement (40 CFR 1501.8(a)
(2)) and identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have
been covered by prior environmental review, narrowing the discussion of these issues in the statement
to a brief presentation of why they will not have a significant effect on the human environment (40 CFR
1501.7(a) (3)). We separated the issues into two groups: significant and non-significant issues.
Significant issues were defined as those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the proposed
action. Non-significant issues were identified as those: 1) outside the scope of the proposed action; 2)
already decided by law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; 3) irrelevant to the
decision to be made; or 4) conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council
on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations explains this delineation in Sec. 1501.7, “…identify
and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by
prior environmental review” (Sec. 1506.3).

Significant Issues
The following topics were identified as Significant Issues by the interdisciplinary team for the Divide
Travel Plan.

Wildlife Habitat Security
Forest roads and overall road density have the potential to affect the quality of wildlife habitat including
habitat security for a variety of species. Increasing road density could result in adverse effects while
decreasing road density could result in beneficial effects, depending on the species and the habitat
affected.

Measurement Indicators:
•
•
•

General Habitat – Helena Forest Plan Consistency;
Riparian Habitat – Miles of road in riparian habitat conservation areas and amount of
off-route travel authorized;
Connectivity and Fragmentation – Open road density and large non-motorized habitat
patches;
Issues - 8

Divide Travel Plan

Snags and Woody Debris – Open road density;
Migratory Landbirds and Shorebirds – Open road density;
Big Game, Elk – Road density on summer range, human disturbance on winter range,
security during hunting season; and
Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive Species – Open road density, the size of large
non-motorized habitat patches, motorized use in key habitat areas.

We have conducted an effects analysis and documented this in the wildlife specialist report and wildlife
section of chapter 3 of this document. This section will describe in more detail how these measures are
defined for each species and used in the analysis.

Water Quality and Fisheries
Forest roads can contribute to increased soil erosion, increased sediment delivery and peak flows that
could impact water quality and aquatic habitat, especially if road densities in a watershed are high.
These effects would vary depending on the location of a road on a landscape (sloped or flat ground),
their proximity to streams or drainages and timing of precipitation events.

Measurement Indicators:
•
•

Number of stream-road intersections
Miles of high risk roads (those within INFISH buffers)

We have conducted an effects analysis and documented it in the soil, water and fisheries reports and in
these sections of chapter 3 of this document.

Quality Motorized Trail/Route System
Changes in the transportation system have the potential to affect the quality of the recreation
experience for motorized users. Prohibiting motorized travel on unclassified roads and trails could limit
access throughout the planning area. Reduction in open motorized routes could adversely impact this
experience while increases could result in beneficial effects to the overall motorized experience.

Measurement indicators:
•
•
•
•

Miles of roads open for motorized use;
Miles of trails open for 50 inches or less in width motorized use;
Miles of motorized routes in Inventoried Roadless Areas; and
Overall ease-of-use of the motor vehicle use map for motorized users.

We have conducted an effects analysis and documented this in the recreation and transportation
specialist report and chapter 3 of this document.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) occurs within the planning area. The primary
purpose of this trail is to provide a “continuous, appealing trail route, designed for the hiker and
horseman, but compatible with other land uses…” It is to be managed primarily for non-motorized
recreational opportunities. The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail currently has sections that are
motorized. Motorized use and roads/road density within the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
have the potential to adversely affect the quality of non-motorized recreational opportunities within this
corridor while improved or enhanced non-motorized opportunities have the potential for beneficial
effects.

Other Related Efforts
Kading/Limburger Springs Area
The Kading Grade was once a popular route providing motorized access from the Helena National Forest
to private lands and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. Motorized use on the Kading Grade
route has declined to some extent due to the designated maintenance level for the route. In addition,
National Forest lands west of Kading Grade have been closed to OHV use, with the exception of oversnow vehicles. Forest System Road 1868, Kading Grade (MTR-502) and routes 501, MTR-503 and MTR504 are currently open to wheeled motorized vehicles from May 16th through October 14th. With the
exception of the winter season, these routes are primarily used by wheeled motorized vehicles from the
middle of summer through the fall hunting season.
Additionally, OHVs, which are allowed on the Kading Grade from May 16th through October 14th, also
travel onto adjacent lands on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest which are closed to wheeled
motorized travel.

Sweeny Creek Area
A popular area for off-highway vehicle (OHV) use is Sweeny Creek. While use is currently managed in
accordance with the 2001 Tri-State OHV Decision, there are concerns regarding the amount and type of
motorized use occurring in the Divide Travel Planning area and the associated impacts.
The Sweeny Creek area has been identified through public input (both written and verbal) as a specific
area of concern. It is adjacent to both Forest boundary and a growing number of privately owned
residences. As a result, Sweeny Creek is important to local residents who recreate in that location
and/or may be impacted by others recreating there. For many years this area provided recreation
opportunities for: hiking, picnicking, camping, folfing (Frisbee golf), group use, nature study and hunting.
During the past 10 years the Sweeny Creek area has grown increasingly popular for OHV use (ATVs and
trail bikes), paint ball activities, mountain biking and horseback riding. Increased recreation use has
displaced some recreationists and raised concerns with local residents regarding what they consider to
be unacceptable resource and social impacts. In particular, residents have expressed frustration with
the noise, dust, vandalism, litter, loss of vegetation and soil erosion that is occurring as a result of some
recreation activities.
Wheeled motorized vehicles are used on constructed roads and other routes within the Sweeny Creek
area. Those routes are designated as motorized trails (MTR) on alternative maps 1 and 2: MTR-001,
MTR-004, MTR-008, MTR-011, MTR-016, MTR-017, MTR-018 and MTR-021. Other routes in the Sweeny
Creek area were not carried forward in any of the alternatives as they didn’t meet the definition of a
route as per the 2001 Travel Decision; for various reasons, i.e. they were created after the 2001 Tri-State
Travel decision. Twenty years ago motorized use on the Sweeny Creek routes was limited to an
occasional high clearance vehicle and motorized trail bikes. With the increased popularity of OHVs,
motorized use in Sweeny Creek has greatly expanded. It’s a popular location for motorized use during
the spring because it is close to the town of Helena, Montana and generally snow-free earlier than many
other areas on the Forest. While existing travel restrictions mandate wheeled motorized use on existing
routes only, violations frequently occur and result in new unauthorized routes and resource damage.
The Helena Forest Plan identified most of the Sweeny Creek area as Management Area (MA) T-1. A
management standard for MA T-1, which speaks specifically to motorized recreation, states: “controls

on motorized recreation will be implemented where necessary to protect the vegetation, soil and water
resources and to prevent road damage.” Although the Sweeny Creek area is open to over-snow
vehicles, that use is limited due to the lack of a consistent snow base.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
There were concerns from the public that wheeled motorized travel was occurring on the Continental
Divide National Scenic Trail. In the planning area there are many portions of the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail that are located on designated (NFSR) roads and/or county roads. There are also
many places that the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail crosses or intersects these roads. In
addition, there are sections of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail that have some type of
motorized use permitted.
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST), which extends through the Divide Travel Planning
area, is nationally designated and recognized as an important recreation destination/opportunity.
Travel planning in the analysis area may provide an opportunity to make Continental Divide National
Scenic Trail travel decisions which would move the Helena National Forest toward greater compliance
with national direction for the trail.

Unauthorized Routes
As stated earlier, the agency received public comments that were opposed to the Helena National
Forest analyzing unauthorized routes within the planning area. However, the agency is directed to
analyze all non-system or unauthorized motorized routes that were in existence when the 2001 Tri-State
Decision was signed. This planning effort serves as the site-specific analysis to meet the 2001 Decision
requirements.

Accessibility
We received comments from the public regarding the need for motorized opportunities during the big
game hunting season that would benefit the elderly and person with disabilities. In all alternatives
motorized opportunities are provided during the big game hunting season and within those motorized
routes there are different skill levels provided for elderly and disabled use.

CHAPTER 2. ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE
PROPOSED ACTION
Introduction
This chapter describes and compares the No Action alternative and four action alternatives considered
by the Responsible Official for the Divide Travel Planning effort. Included in this chapter is a detailed
description of the alternatives, how they were developed and tables showing comparisons between
them. There is also a section on alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed analysis. Please
see alternative maps and road and trail details in Appendix E.
The Divide Travel Plan Decision would include only open or closed determinations; decommissioning
would not be specified in this decision. Any existing route not identified as a Helena National Forest
(HNF) system route in this travel plan decision would be considered a non-system route and would not
be considered for future motorized use. Any action resulting from this planning decision would require
additional NEPA analysis.

Introduction - 11

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The IDT used the issues brought forward in comments received through public involvement and field
verification to develop alternatives. Additional issues include: protection of natural resources, amount
and type of motorized access, motorized use on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
and the Kading/Limburger Springs and Sweeny Creek areas.
None of the alternatives would prohibit non-motorized activities. The proposed changes would
determine where wheeled and over-snow motorized vehicles could access the Forest System roads and
trails.
Implementing any action alternative for this Travel Plan would require a programmatic plan amendment
to the Helena National Forest Plan for the planning area regarding the standard for the hiding
cover/open road density index. The proposed programmatic plan amendment would establish a new
standard for elk security for those herd units within the planning area.

Alternatives Considered in Detail
Five alternatives were considered in detail. Alternative 1 (No Action) represents the existing condition in
the Divide Travel Plan area, which is the baseline condition, used to compare and contrast the action
alternatives. Alternative 2 represents a system of motorized roads and trails including winter travel use
while reducing motorized use on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and compliments the
purpose of this trail as described in this Continental Divide National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan of
1985 (p. 10). Alternative 3 increases non-motorized use and reduces resource impacts in areas such as
Sweeny Creek and Kading/Limburger Springs. Alternative 4 is a combination of alternatives 2 and 3.
Alternative 5 was developed based on comments from the public on alternatives 1 through 4 and
additional field reviews. It is designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities, reduce the short
spur and parallel or redundant routes, improve big game security and address resource concerns
relative to erosion and stream sedimentation.
A description of each route and its status by alternative is found in Appendix E of this document. The
alternative descriptions in this chapter summarize the road and trail mileages by category of access for
both summer and winter uses. It is important to note that route mileages listed in this chapter may
slightly differ from those queried for specialist’s reports. Individual resource analysis boundaries may
extend beyond the established planning area boundaries. For official mileages and route-by-route
designations please refer to appendix E.

Features Common to All Alternatives
Laws and Policies
Below are some current laws and policies which apply to all the alternatives analyzed in this analysis:
•
•

•

Motorized use on National Forest System roads and trails is subject to Montana State
Law;
In accordance with 36 CFR 261.12, National Forest System roads and trails, the following
is prohibited: (c) Damaging and leaving in a damaged condition any such road, trail, or
segment thereof;

Divide Travel Plan

As provided for in the Travel Management Rule, none of the alternatives preclude the
forest from closing roads, trails, or areas to motorized use through emergency closure
orders;

The public must continue to follow State and Federal rules and regulations as well as Helena National
Forest regulations.

Types of Routes and Other Definitions
This analysis includes roads as they would be available for vehicles consistent with State laws. A mixed
motorized use analysis and designation requires an engineering evaluation rather than a NEPA analysis.
This will be completed as part of the implementation phase of this travel planning effort.
The following categories of routes used in this planning analysis are taken from the definitions in 36 CFR
212-Travel Management. The Forest Transportation System includes NFS roads (NFSR), NFS trails and
airfields on NFS lands. A glossary is located at the end of this document.

If, through monitoring, the Forest Service finds that motor vehicle use on a route is
directly causing adverse effects on public safety or on natural or cultural resources, it
may be closed immediately per 36 CFR 212.52(b)(2) until the Forest Supervisor
determines that such adverse effects have been mitigated or eliminated. Depending on
the situation, the Forest Service could try other means of preventing or repairing
damage to natural or cultural resources.
Safe parking would be allowed within 30 feet from the edge of a designated motorized
route for the purpose of any legal forest activity (FSM 7700).
A portion of the Nevada Mountain IRA is located on the Lincoln Ranger District and a
portion of the Electric Peak IRA is located on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest.
This travel plan proposal covers only the areas of each IRA located within the Divide
Travel Planning area.
Road closure effectiveness for resource concerns would be monitored.
If temporary closures are necessitated the public will be given adequate notification
The stream crossing that provides access to the Larabee Gulch Trailhead on NFSR #227D1 would be closed to motorized use until the ford can be replaced with a bridge,
bottomless arch or culvert.
The stream crossing that provides access to Golden Anchor on NFSR #4100 would be
closed to motorized use until the ford can be replaced with a bridge, bottomless arch or
culvert.
Two unnamed stream crossings located on NFSR #495-D1 in T8N, R6W Section 28 would
be closed to motorized use until the ford can be replaced with a bridge, bottomless arch
or culvert.
Motorized over-snow use would have seasonal restrictions.
Groomed snowmobile routes located on Forest roads and trails would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicles during their designated period of use.
Seasonal restrictions would be placed on some trails open to motorized wheeled
vehicles 50 inches in width or less.
Roads would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles located in areas open to oversnow motorized vehicles to match the use of the surrounding area. All other motorized
use would continue to be restricted from using these routes unless authorized for
emergency or administrative uses.

Alternative 1 - No Action
The No Action alternative is required under NEPA regulations [40 CFR 1502.14(d)]. This alternative
represents the existing, baseline condition or trends by which the action alternatives are compared.

Alternative 1 - No Action - 14

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The No Action alternative would defer implementation of the Travel Management Rule and would not
result in a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). No changes would be made to the existing system of
available public motorized routes and areas within the Divide Travel Planning area.
No Action is represented by the current Helena National Forest map and supporting prohibitions.
Permissible motorized uses include those routes and areas not otherwise prohibited. Under No Action,
motorized access for dispersed camping, parking associated with camping.
The Helena National Forest Plan, as amended, prohibits wheeled cross country travel (2001 Tri-State
OHV Decision). However, wheeled motorized use of unauthorized routes that existed at that time of
that Forest Plan amendment are unaffected by this prohibition. That use is not defined as cross-country
travel under the amended Forest Plan as long as the vehicle fits within the pre-existing width of the
route. The motorized access for dispersed camping is an exception and that use is also permitted up to
300 feet from these routes. Under the No Action alternative, these uses could continue.

Design Features
Kading-Limburger Springs Area
Under this alternative, Forest Road 1868, Kading Grade (MTR-502) and routes 501, MTR-503 and MTR504 would remain open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less from May 16th through
October 14th. This motorized activity would provide opportunities for off highway vehicle (OHV)
enthusiasts and hunters.
Motorized access on Forest Service Road #227-D1 would continue to provide limited wheeled motorized
vehicle access (with a ford across the Little Blackfoot River) to a trailhead and Miller Cabin in Larabee
Gulch. Although there is no road bridge across the Little Blackfoot River, the short spur road east of the
river is currently open to motorized travel.
The existing non-system motorized routes located in the Kading area would be authorized as designated
motorized trails open from May 16th through October 14th. These routes would be maintained as system
trails.

Sweeny Creek Area
Existing unauthorized motorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would continue to be open as
motorized trails with no seasonal restrictions.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
There are approximately nine miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail which are currently
open to wheeled motorized travel. Per Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2300 direction, motorized use
would only be allowed on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail if the route and type of use was in
existence prior to November 10, 1978. Spur road 136-D1 was identified on the 1977 Helena National
Forest map as a trail open to motorized vehicles under 40 inches wide. As a result, any wheeled
motorized vehicles exceeding 40 inches in width would not be authorized on Forest Road 136-D1.
Other motorized segments of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail are roads which existed prior
to November 10, 1978. In accordance with recent direction, those routes could continue to serve as
segments of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail if they are primitive and motorized use does
not substantially interfere with the nature and purposes of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.
Most of the existing motorized segments of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail are located on
Forest Roads #136, 495, 622, 1802, 1802-B2 and 1855. Motorized use on existing Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail segments would continue. Approximately 19 miles of the Continental Divide

Alternative 1 - No Action - 15

National Scenic Trail would be closed to wheeled motorized travel. The existing single track trail
segments in the vicinity of Priest Pass and Mullan Pass would remain open to motorized trail bikes. In
addition, Forest Road #136–D1 would remain open to motorized use year- long.
Approximately 24.6 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail would continue to be open to
wheeled motorized travel.
Approximately 8 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail would continue to be located in an
area open to over-snow motorized vehicles.
Table 1 at the end of this summary identifies the type of use the trail is currently being managed for.
Some segments are on designated County roads and others are on a portion of the National Forest
System Roads. The segments are arranged from north to south.

Unauthorized Routes
Identified unauthorized routes are considered open within the context of this alternative. Sixteen miles
are identified as unauthorized routes which are currently open to wheeled motorized use. Any
unauthorized routes not identified or included in this alternative are considered closed.

Accessibility
Under the existing condition there are no special for provisions to provide motorized access
opportunities during big game rifle season.

Access to Dispersed Campsites
Under the existing condition, Alternative 1, the 2001 Tri-State Decision allowed off-vehicle camping
within 300 feet of roads and motorized trails; but, required visitors to select campsites by nonmotorized means and access the campsites by the most direct route causing the least damage. Parking
safely adjacent to a road or motorized trail within 30 feet from the edge of the road or motorized trail is
also permitted under the existing condition.

Alternative 2 - The Proposed Action
Alternative 2 was the proposed action presented to the public during the 2008 scoping period. This
alternative was developed using the current Forest Transportation System maps, information from the
2004 Helena Roads Analysis, field verification and public input.
Consistent with the travel planning regulations at 36 CFR 212 Subpart B, the resulting available wheeled
motorized access routes and areas would be designated on a MVUM and public use of a motor vehicle
other than in accordance with those designations would be prohibited as per 36 CFR 261.13.
For more specific detail regarding mileage please refer to appendix E in addition to the alternative maps
at the end of the document. If this alternative is selected, it would meet the intent of subsequent sitespecific planning as required by the ‘Off-Highway Vehicle Record of Decision and Forest Plan

Sweeny Creek Area
The existing unauthorized motorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would be designated as
trails open to motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less from May 16th thru October 14th.
Designation of these routes as system trails would provide another area on the Helena Forest
specifically recognized for OHV use. Although that area does not receive a great deal of over-snow
vehicle use at the current time, it has become popular with OHV riders both during the winter and
spring.
One notable change in the Sweeny Creek area under alternatives 2 is the winter closure to motorized
travel. Approximately 5,700 acres in that area (including the motorized trails) would be closed to oversnow motorized travel from October 16th thru May 14th.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
Under this alternative the majority of Forest Road #136-D1 (two miles) would be closed to wheeled
motorized vehicles yearlong. The remaining 0.5 miles, which provide access to existing stock facilities
and trailhead parking, would remain open to highway legal vehicles yearlong.

Design Features Specific to Alternative 4
Kading-Limburger Springs Area
With the exception of over-snow vehicles during the winter, the unauthorized trails in the Kading area
would be closed to wheeled motorized use.
Kading/Limburger Springs areas would be closed to wheeled motorized use yearlong for resource and
winter wildlife protection.
FSR #227 would be closed at the turn around located just past Kading campground and FSR #227-E1
would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles year-long.
NFSR #1868, Kading Grade (MTR-502) and routes 501, MTR-503 and MTR 504 would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicle travel yearlong; however, open to over-snow motorized vehicles from
December 2nd through May 15th. This would also apply to non-system trails MTR-502, MTR-503 and
MTR-504.

Sweeny Creek Area
Like alternative 3, the existing unauthorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed to
motorized travel yearlong for resource and winter wildlife protection. Similar to alternatives 2 and 3,
approximately 5,700 acres in that area would be closed to over-snow motorized travel. This area does
not receive a great deal of over-snow vehicle use.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
Under this alternative the majority of Forest Road #136-D1 (2 miles) would be closed to wheeled
motorized vehicles yearlong. The remaining 0.5 miles, which provide access to existing stock facilities,
would remain open to highway legal vehicles yearlong. In addition Forest Road #1802 would be closed
to motorized vehicles yearlong.
Forest Road #1802 existed prior to November 10, 1978. Therefore, to meet agency direction for the
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, it “should not be closed to wheeled motorized travel.”
Additional segments of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail would be closed to wheeled
motorized use. This includes the microwave tower road FSR#1802 (please refer to appendix E for
specifics on each segment of the route).
•
•
•

Approximately 18 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail would be open to
wheeled motorized travel.
Approximately 21.9 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail would be closed
to wheeled motorized vehicles.
Approximately 12 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail would be located
in an area open to over-snow motorized vehicles.

Please see appendix E for a comparison of alternatives in Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
designations.

Unauthorized Routes
Alternative 4 would designate six miles of identified unauthorized routes that would be added to the
Forest Transportation System. The existing unauthorized routes not identified or included in this
alternative would be considered closed.

Accessibility
There would be no special provisions to provide motorized opportunity considerations for motorized
access during the big game rifle season under this alternative.
For additional details, please refer to the map packet and appendix E for information that reflects each
individual route by proposed designation (open/seasonal restrictions/closed) by alternative.

Access to Dispersed Campsites
Alternative 4 would permit wheeled motorized vehicle travel within 300 feet of designated system
routes, including roads and trails (unless signed otherwise). It would allow motorized travel in this zone
for legal recreational activities, in addition to camping and parking associated with dispersed camping.
Legal recreation activities include, but are not limited to, parking, camping, big game retrieval, hiking,
hunting, or firewood gathering. These activities would be allowed as long as:
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity,
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resource occurs,
Travel off-route does not cross streams and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

For additional details, please refer to the map packet and appendix E for information that reflects each
individual route by proposed designation (open/seasonal restrictions/closed) by alternative.

Other Features
There would be winter closures in the Hahn Creek area as well as lower elevation west facing slopes in
Clarks Canyon north to Threemile Creek.
FSR #1802 and FSR #1802-C1 would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles yearlong.
FSR #314 in the Spotted Dog area would be open to highway legal vehicles from May 16th to October
14th and closed to wheeled motorized vehicles from October 15th to May 15th.
Areas that remain open would have a season of December 2nd through May 15th for motorized oversnow travel.

Alternative 5 – Preferred Alternative
This proposed alternative was developed in response to public comment and field reviews and is
designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities and reduce the short spur and redundant
parallel routes. It also improves big game security as well as addresses resource concerns relative to
erosion and sedimentation from roads and stream crossings. Consideration was given to further align
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with National Standards.
The selection of this alternative would result in the production of a Motor Vehicle Use Map which would
identify motorized routes that are open for use along with corresponding restrictions and designations.
In addition, this map would show restrictions regarding dispersed camping. Use of a motor vehicle
other than in accordance with specific designations would be prohibited. The authority for this action
comes from 36 CFR 212 and 36 CFR 261.13.

Design Features Specific to Alternative 5
Seasonal Trail (route) Dates
All motorized trails with seasonal use open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less
would be open from May 16th to August 31st with the exception of the Lava Mountain connector trail #
4009-A1 which would be open from May 16th to October 14th. There are approximately 14.5 miles of
motorized trails that would have no seasonal restrictions.

Kading-Limburger Springs Area
National Forest System Route (NFSR) #227 would remain open to Kading campground. Beyond Kading
campground, NFSR #227-E1 would become part of non-motorized trail 329. The trailhead parking area
on NFSR #227 past Kading campground where the route would change to non-motorized use would be
expanded to accommodate day use vehicles and horse trailers.
Motorized Trail #501 would remain open to motorized vehicles of 50 inches in width or less from May
16th to August 31st.
Over-snow motorized travel would be allowed in areas north and west of NFSR #227 from December 2nd

Sweeny Creek Area
With the exception of the Priest Pass Road, all routes in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed
yearlong to motorized use including over-snow vehicles.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
NFSR #136-D1 would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles yearlong. Approximately, one mile of the
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail trail located north of NFSR #136 and just south and east of
Meyers Hill, would be re-routed and designated as a non-motorized section of the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail. Refer to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail map for information on
motorized and non-motorized segments of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.

Larabee Crossing and Golden Anchor Crossing – Little Blackfoot Area
The crossing at Larabee (227-D1) would be closed to wheeled motorized travel. In addition, a foot/stock
bridge would be constructed to connect to the non-motorized Larabee Trail #359. A trailhead would be
designated nearby on NFSR #227.
The stream crossing located on Golden Anchor NFSR #4100 is currently a ford. This alternative proposed
to replace the ford with a bridge, bottomless culvert, or structure installed to accommodate wheeled
motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less and over-snow motorized vehicles. The ford would remain
open for motorized use until the structure is in place or two years from the start of the implementation
phase of this project, whichever is less. If a structure is not installed during this timeframe, the ford
crossing would be closed to vehicle travel until a structure is in place. The area beyond this crossing
would remain open to wheeled vehicles 50 inches in width or less in addition to over-snow motorized
vehicles.

Proposed Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment for the Big
Game Security Index
This section provides an overview of Forestwide standard 4a and the proposed amendment to replace
that standard. This amendment is common to all alternatives. This would be a separate decision as per
36 CFR 219. Alternative A describes the existing condition – the current Forest Plan standard 4a.
Alternative B describes the proposed amendment to the Helena National Forest plan. Detailed
information and background for the proposed programmatic plan amendment is located in chapter 3.

Alternative A, Existing Condition
Alternative A, the No Action alternative, is the existing Forest Plan Standard. In this case, ‘no action’
means no amendment to the existing Forest Plan. The analysis of effects associated with alternative A
describes the effects of the current Forest Plan standard. The exact language of the current standard is
as follows:

Forestwide Standard Big Game 4(a) (HFP pp. II/17 – II/18)
Road management will be implemented to at least maintain big game habitat capability and hunting
opportunity. To provide for a first week bull elk harvest that does not exceed 40 percent of the total bull
harvest, roads will be managed during the general big game hunting season to maintain open road
densities with the following limits.

Forest Service definition - a timber stand which conceals 90 percent or more of a standing elk at 200 feet.
MDFWP definition - a stand of coniferous trees having a crown closure of greater than 40 percent.

The existing hiding cover to open road density ratio should be determined over a large geographic area, such as a timber sale
analysis area, a third order drainage, or an elk herd unit.

The big game security index is calculated for EHUs that include all lands, public and private, within the
respective EHU. This means that elk security as determined by this index is also a function of road
densities and timber harvest on private lands outside management control of the Helena National
Forest.

Alternative B
Alternative B was designed to address best science and local knowledge. It also expanded consideration
to all open motorized routes (whereas alternative A only applies to roads as originally envisioned in the
Forest Plan). Alternative B would replace the existing Forest Plan Big Game Standard 4(a).
The Divide Travel Plan area encompasses only about ¾ of the Divide landscape (portions of the Quartz,
Black Mtn – Brooklyn Bridge and Little Prickly Pear – Ophir EHUs falling into areas covered by previous
travel management plans); however, the proposed amendment would apply to all portions of the herd
units included in the Divide Travel Plan analysis.
Under the Forest Plan amendment proposed for the Divide Travel Plan and applicable to future projects
in the Travel Plan Area, the “security area” approach would replace the “road density/hiding cover
index” as the Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability of elk to hunting. The amendment
derives from the Hillis methodology (1991) and adopts specific guidelines for its application from
Recommendations for Big Game Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena and Lewis and
Clark National Forests (MDFWP and USDA Working Group 2013). The exact language of the standard is
as follows:

Standard
Road management will be implemented to maintain or improve big game security and hunting
opportunity.
Road management will also be implemented to maintain or improve big game intermittent refuge areas.
This standard applies only to the National Forest System lands within those portions of the following elk
herd units that are within the Helena Ranger District, Helena National Forest administrative boundary –
Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge, Greenhorn, Jericho, Little Prickly Pear-Ophir, Quartz Creek and Spotted
Dog-Little Blackfoot.
Public Motorized Use: Public motorized use will be managed during the hunting season (from 9/1 –
12/1) to maintain elk security at the following levels:

Other Use: Administrative use for travel on routes that are closed to public motorized use is permitted
subject to existing authorization procedures (i.e. variances approved by line officers are required prior to
use of motorized routes closed to the public).
Temporary reductions associated with management activities in security blocks and intermittent refuge
areas between 9/1 and 12/1 are allowed as long as impacts to elk or elk security are mitigated at the
project level. Temporary reductions will be evaluated and effects analyzed (including cumulative
effects) at the project level and reviewed by a wildlife biologist. It is at this scale and time when project
design features and/or mitigations would be applied to ensure that impacts to elk or elk security during
hunting season are addressed and reduced during implementation of the project. Temporary
reductions are managed at the project scale and at the herd unit (or across herd units where security
blocks cross into one or more herd units) to ensure big game security during the 9/1 – 12/1 hunting
season is maintained or improved over the long term.
Permanent changes (e.g. reduction in overall secure acres) are allowed in elk security areas as long as
the overall percent of elk security in a herd unit does not decrease and a site-specific analysis indicates
that elk are unlikely to be negatively impacted by that change.
Permanent changes are allowed in intermittent refuge areas as long as the overall percent of
intermittent areas in a herd unit does not decrease and a site-specific analysis indicates that elk are
unlikely to be negatively impacted by that change OR if the decrease is due to those acres becoming part
of a security area.

Divide Travel Plan

Exceptions to the Standard
Emergency situations are not subject to this standard.

Standard Definitions
Security is defined as a proportion of an elk herd unit within the administrative boundary of the Helena
Ranger District that consists of an area of at least 1,000 acres in size that is at least ½ mile from a
motorized route open to the public between 9/1 and 12/1. Security blocks are adjusted for constrictions
less than or equal to ½ mile in width. Security is calculated across all ownerships within the
administrative boundary.
Intermittent Refuge Areas are defined as those areas at least 250 acres in size and less than 1000 acres
in size that are greater than or equal to ½ mile from a motorized route open to the public between 9/1
and 12/1. Intermittent Refuge Areas are adjusted for constrictions less than or equal to ½ mile in width.
Intermittent Refuge Areas are calculated across all ownerships within the administrative boundary.
Administrative use for travel on motorized routes is defined as vehicle use associated with management
activities or projects on National Forest land administered by the Forest Service or under authorization
of the Forest Service. Management Activities include but are not limited to, law enforcement, timber
harvest, reforestation, cultural treatments, prescribed fire, watershed restoration, wildlife and fish
habitat improvement, private land access, allotment management activities and mineral exploration and
development that occur on National Forest land administered by the Forest Service or under
authorization of the Forest Service.
Mitigation is defined as design elements and/or constraints applied to project level activities that
reduce project impacts on elk or elk security. Mitigation measures may include but are not limited to
one or more of the following: timing restrictions of activities in security blocks, confining activities to
one security block at a time, completing as much of the preparatory work as possible prior to the
hunting season, reducing the size/acres/intensity/magnitude of the activity, allowing activities that
benefit elk (particularly in management areas with a wildlife emphasis), limiting activities to one season,
temporarily closing roads open to the public to compensate for the activity, etc.
Alternative B also includes cover guidelines as follows:

Guidelines
1.

2.

3.

Cover should be distributed in a manner that mimics or approximates a natural
range of variation (NRV). NRV is generally defined as the spatial and temporal
variation in ecosystem characteristics under historic disturbance regimes during a
reference period. A reference period should be sufficiently long to include the full
range of variation produced by dominant natural disturbance regimes. Fire, wind
and insect/disease outbreaks are examples of disturbances.
Subject to Guideline #1, provide cover, if available, between elk security areas to
maintain habitat connectivity and facilitate seasonal movement. Saddles, low
divides and heads of drainages are examples of important landscape features within
which cover should be retained when possible in order to provide habitat
connectivity.
Subject to Guideline #1, vegetation management projects should be planned to
recruit or improve cover, where such habitat is limited or not available.

Proposed Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment for the Big Game Security Index - 29

Environmental Impact Statement

4.

5.

6.

Divide Travel Plan

Subject to Guideline #1, provide cover, if available, in elk security areas to maintain
and/or improve elk security in areas known to be used by elk or that have the
potential to be used by elk. The upper third of the slope in moderate to large
drainages and lower third of slope in drainage heads are examples of areas that
have the potential to be used by elk.
Frequent, continuous dense cover, if available, should be provided adjacent to
system roads within and between elk security areas to maintain habitat connectivity
and elk security. ‘Dense’ cover may include trees, shrubs and/or topography among
other factors and is site-specific in nature; as such it is purposefully not defined
here.
Design management activities to avoid reducing hiding cover where recruitment of
hiding cover is an objective.

Guidelines Definitions
Cover is defined as vegetation that provides elk with a means of escape from the threat of predation or
harassment and reduces the chance of detection. Here, the definition of cover may include hiding
cover, screening cover, or concealment cover. Hiding cover is defined in the Helena National Forest Plan
as either (1) vegetation capable of hiding 90 percent of an elk at 200 feet or (2) a standoff coniferous
trees having a crown closure of greater than 40 percent or concealment cover which consists of
vegetation dense enough to aid animals in escaping from predation or harassment. Screening cover
may include conifers and other vegetation that afford longer sight distances then hiding cover but that
can obstruct a clear view toward standing or moving elk. Concealment cover may include small conifers,
shrubs, boulders, or dead fall that can hide calves/fawns and bedded adults and may service to impede
hunter movement. Concealment cover is generally more open than hiding cover.
Habitat connectivity consists of an adequate amount of hiding or screening cover arranged in a way that
allows elk to move around.
System Road is defined as a road that is part of the Forest development transportation system.
Alternative B also includes a goal as follows:

Goal
Maintain or, where opportunities arise, improve big game security in those portions of an elk herd unit
within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District during the 9/1 – 12/1 hunting season
where security is less than 50 percent. Maintain big game security in those portions of an elk herd unit
within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District between 9/1 and 12/1 where security
is greater than or equal to 50 percent.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study
Alternatives were proposed which focused on increasing access for multiple uses and increased
motorized opportunities. These alternatives also included construction of new routes in addition to
routes on private lands that are currently unavailable for public use.
In evaluating these alternatives, the Helena National Forest determined that many of the proposed
motorized routes were already analyzed in alternative 1 (no action) or alternative 2. Portions of these
alternatives were eliminated from detailed study because they fell outside the scope of this planning
effort.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study - 30

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

There were a number of suggestions proposing opportunities for motorized access during the hunting
season. There was also a proposal to open an area to motorized use from dawn until dusk. These
suggestions were considered but eliminated from detailed analysis because part of the purpose and
need for the planning area is the identified need to reduce the number of area closure dates.
Several public comments received during scoping and during the comment period for the DEIS included
the request that a travel plan alternative be developed to meet Standard 4a. An analysis was completed
to determine if the Forest had management discretion to close enough Forest System roads to achieve
compliance with Standard 4a in the elk herd units in the Divide Travel Plan project area. That analysis
indicated that the Forest did have the jurisdiction to close several miles of open roads during the
hunting season to achieve consistency with Standard 4a in 5 out of 6 herd units. However, for one of
those five herd units, Quartz Creek, travel planning has already been completed in a majority of that
herd unit; so there is limited opportunity to close additional roads during the hunting season. The
Greenhorn elk herd unit would remain out of compliance with Standard 4a because the Forest simply
does not have sufficient road closure discretion. Meanwhile, alternative 5 - includes sufficient closures
during the hunting season such that four out of the six herd units achieve compliance with Standard 4a.
The two herd units that remain out of compliance are Quartz Creek and Greenhorn.

Unauthorized Routes
As reflected in the summary of miles of motorized uses table(s) above:
Under the No Action alternative, permissible motorized uses include those routes and areas not
otherwise prohibited.
Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 would all designate additional unauthorized routes that would be added to the
Forest Transportation System. Any existing unauthorized routes not identified or included under these
alternatives would be considered closed.
Alternative 5 would designate unauthorized routes to be added to the Forest Transportation System for
non-motorized use. All routes, including unauthorized routes, not identified or included in this
alternative as part of this planning effort, as well as any future created routes, would be considered
closed and would be physically closed without additional NEPA.

Access to Dispersed Campsites
Under the existing condition, alternative 1, the 2001 Tri-State Decision allowed off-vehicle camping
within 300 feet of roads and motorized trails; but, required visitors to select campsites by nonComparison of Alternatives - 39

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

motorized means and access the campsites by the most direct route causing the least damage. Parking
safely adjacent to a road or motorized trail within 30 feet from the edge of the road or motorized trail is
also permitted under the existing condition.
Under Alternatives 2 and 3, parking safely adjacent to a road within 30 feet from the edge of the road or
motorized trail would be allowed. In addition, wheeled motorized vehicle travel for camping or parking
associated with camping would be allowed within 300 feet of designated system routes, including roads
and trails (unless signed otherwise or specifically closed) as long as:
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity;
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resource occurs;
Travel off-route does not cross streams; and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

Access to dispersed camping is identified as an acceptable use in the planning area under the 2001 TriState Decision and the 2005 Travel Management Rule. Agency personnel have observed that, in
general, this has occurred without causing unacceptable resource damage. Where site-specific issues
have occurred, emergency closures were issued for resource protection. The Forest Service has this tool
available when needed; therefore, the Helena National Forest is proposing to continue this practice
under alternatives 2 and 3.
Alternative 4 would permit wheeled motorized vehicle travel within 300 feet of designated system
routes, including roads and trails (unless signed otherwise). It would allow motorized travel in this zone
for legal recreational activities, in addition to camping and parking associated with dispersed camping.
Legal recreation activities include, but are not limited to, parking, camping, big game retrieval, hiking,
hunting, or firewood gathering. These activities would be allowed as long as:
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity,
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resource occurs,
Travel off-route does not cross streams and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

Alternative 5 would no longer permit wheeled motorized vehicle travel within 300 feet of designated
system routes, including roads and trails. In response to comments received on the DEIS, additional field
review of dispersed sites occurred during the 2014 field season. We found the number of routes being
developed for dispersed camping and firewood cutting have increased. As a result we're seeing an
increase in ground disturbance as a result of the 300 foot rule. This is a concern from a resource
perspective. For example: It's a concern from a weed treatment perspective due to the high cost and
limited funds available to treat beyond primary designated routes. Debris cleanup at these sites also
impacts our recreation program and reduces funding available to maintain and improve the other
aspects of the program. Alternative 5 addresses this concern by permitting wheeled motorized vehicle
travel up to 30 foot from water and 70 foot from a designated route while still allowing for many of the
historic dispersed campsites, greater than 70 feet from the road to remain. These historic dispersed sites
where travel off a designated route would be allowed would be mapped and displayed for the public.
Therefore, alternative 5 would permit parking and motor vehicle use associated with dispersed camping
no more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route as long as:
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity;
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources i.e., damage to live trees and
shrubs, rutting and eroding of stream banks or bare soil;

Travel off-route does not cross streams;
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas; and
Vehicles travel to and parking associated with dispersed campsites would be limited to
no closer than 30 feet of a stream or body of live water.

Dispersed campsites located more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route that are identified
on the alternative 5 map would remain open for dispersed camping and parking associated with
dispersed camping. The five items identified under the access to dispersed campsites up to 70 feet from
a designated route section are applicable for this as well.

CHAPTER 3 - AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
Introduction
This chapter presents the relevant resource components of the existing environment – the baseline
environment. It describes the resources of the area that would be affected by the alternatives. This
chapter also discloses the environmental effects of implementing the alternatives. These form the
scientific and analytical basis for comparing the alternatives described in Chapter 2.
Chapter 3 explains the basic components of the analysis followed by a section on each resource. This
should provide the reader a better understanding of the overall motorized routes and designations for
wheeled and over-snow motorized vehicles within the Divide travel planning area. Acre and mileage
totals are approximate within tables and text due to rounding.
The purpose of this analysis is to compare alternatives, not to make predictions about the future. The
analysis in this chapter focuses on the effects of the proposed changes to the current designated
system. It does not analyze the effects of the whole designated system.
This FEIS looks at effects within the Divide Travel Planning area. The effects of proposed changes to the
Divide Planning area were aggregated rather than describing the site-specific effect at each road or trail.
For instance, specialist’s reports describe the overall effects of reducing or allowing places people could
drive instead of listing every route and predicting the effects at a particular site.
Most specialists used Geographic Information System (GIS) to calculate the miles and areas affected, or
to model habitats. If specialists used models other than GIS, it will be described in their report.
It was assumed that motorized use would occur where it is proposed. In doing so, the effects analysis
describes the effects resulting from the change between where people are currently driving (alternative
1) and where people would drive (alternatives 2 through 5).

Affected Environment
An effects analysis starts by describing the affected environment. As the name implies, this section
describes those parts of the environment or project area that would change as a result of implementing
the action alternatives. The CEQ describes it this way:
“The environmental impact statement shall succinctly describe the environment of the area(s) to be
affected or created by the alternatives under consideration. The descriptions shall be no longer than is
necessary to understand the effects of the alternatives.” (40 CFR 1502.15).
In this project, the Helena National Forest proposes to close some roads and trails to motorized use and
prohibit driving off designated routes, with the exception of some proposed provisions for motorized
travel within 300 feet of a designated route within the Divide Travel Planning Area. The affected
environment, then, would relate to things that would change by opening or closing roads to wheeled
motorized and over-snow vehicle travel, such as wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities.

Past Actions
The interdisciplinary team considered the effects of past actions as part of the existing condition. The
current conditions are the sum total of past actions. The CEQ recognizes “agencies can conduct an
Introduction - 45

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

adequate cumulative effects analysis by focusing on current aggregate effects of past actions without
delving into the historical details of individual past actions” (Council on Environmental Quality 2005).
Innumerable actions over the last century and beyond have shaped the Helena National Forest’s current
designated road system within the Divide Travel Planning Area. Attempting to isolate and catalog these
individual actions and their effects would be nearly impossible. By looking at current conditions, the
effects of past human actions and natural events, regardless of which event contributed to those effects
are captured. Listing the past actions, however, can show trends. On balance, some past actions
increased the amount of motorized use in the Divide Travel Planning Area and others decreased it.

Environmental Consequences
The impact analysis and conclusions contained in this chapter were based on forest staff knowledge of
the resources and site, reviewing existing literature and agency studies, information provided by
specialists within the Forest Service and other agencies and professional judgment. The methodology
section for each resource describes additional specific data collection or analysis or other methods used
for that resource.
Potential impacts in this chapter are described in terms of type (direct, indirect, cumulative and are the
effects beneficial or adverse?); context (are the effects site specific, local or regional?); duration (are the
effects short term or long term?) and intensity.
The CEQ lists different kinds of effects that need to be analyzed under the NEPA:
•
•
•

Direct effects are caused by the action and occur at the same time and in the same
location as the actions that cause them.
Indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in
distance, but still reasonably foreseeable.
Cumulative effects are the sum of the incremental impacts from the action combined
with other actions (past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions in or near
the area). These are described in the next section.

Effects can be both beneficial and detrimental (40 CFR 1508.8). For example, this travel management
project, closing roads to motorized use could improve wildlife habitat (beneficial effect for wildlife
species) and reduce the amount of motorized recreational opportunities (detrimental impact to riders).
The regulations do not require agencies to separate the direct and indirect effects, so in this document
we describe them together by resource. Cumulative effects have their own section by resource.
For the purposes of this analysis, short-term effects are those expected within the next one to 10 years
(throughout the course of project implementation) and long-term effects are those that are expected
between 10 and 20 years or more (after implementation is complete) unless specifically defined in
individual resource sections that follow.

Cumulative Effects
The definition of cumulative impact according to the CEQ is:
“ ‘Cumulative impact’ is the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the
action when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what
agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result
from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time.” (40 CFR
1508.7).
Environmental Consequences - 46

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

To be cumulative, effects must overlap in space and time. Cumulative impacts are important because
they could cause a tipping point, either beneficial or detrimental. To analyze cumulative effects, the
interdisciplinary team looked at the effects from this proposal and added them to the effects from past,
present and reasonably foreseeable future actions.

Reasonably Foreseeable Actions
Courts have interpreted a “reasonably foreseeable future action” as one that has been proposed and is
in the planning stages. To analyze the cumulative effects of present and reasonably foreseeable future
actions, each resource specialist looked at the list of projects in Appendix B. They identified the ones
expected to cause effects to their resource, at the same time and in the same place as effects from the
proposed action or alternatives. Some specialists analyzed additional actions that pertained only to their
resource.

Consistency with Adjacent National Forest Travel Management
Planning
The southwest corner of the Divide Travel Plan Area on the Helena National Forest (HNF) shares a
common boundary with the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (B-D NF). This boundary includes the
Electric Peak Inventoried Roadless Area and the Kading/Limburger Springs area located on the Helena
National Forest. Please see the map below.
The Electric Peak Inventoried Roadless Area is located on both the Helena and Beaverhead Deerlodge
National Forests and is identified as recommended wilderness in both Forest Plans. Proposed Travel
management for this area is consistent in all five alternatives for the Divide Travel Plan Area and
coincides with current management direction on the adjacent B-D NF.
The Helena National Forest Kading Grade/Limburger Springs area is also adjacent to the B-D NF. Oversnow vehicle management for this area is consistent with the B-D NF with both areas being open to
over-snow motorized vehicle use. The adjacent lands administered by the B-D NF are closed to oversnow motorized use from 10/15 through 12/1, which is consistent with Divide alternative 1. Divide
alternatives 2 through 5 propose closure to over-snow motorized use from 5/16 through 12/1 for
resource protection.
However, proposed wheeled motorized use for the Kading/Limburger Springs area varies in the Divide
Travel Plan between the five alternatives and is intended to be consistent with adjacent management on
B-D NF. Those variations are described in further detail below. Motorized Trail 502 located within the
Divide Travel Plan, connects to B-D NF Forest System Route (FSR) 5182 which would be managed as a
non-motorized route from October 15 to December 1 and non-motorized trail 8130. (Please refer to the
map that follows in addition to the Divide alternative maps.) The variations are as follows:
•

•

Alternative 1 (No Action/Existing Condition): Motorized trail route (MTR) 502 located
within the Kading/Limburger Springs area connects the Helena National Forest to the
neighboring B-D NF Route 5182. MTR 502 is open to wheeled vehicles 50 inches or less
in width from May 16 to October 14.
Forest System Route 1868, located on the Helena National Forest, also connects to BD
NF route 5182. FSR 1868 is currently open to wheeled motorized vehicles June 1
through August 31. The B-D NF closed Route 5182 to motorized vehicles from May 16
through December 2 under their 2010 Forest Plan Revision. As a result, these two

routes are not consistent with the B-D NF travel management system where routes from
the Helena National Forest connect to FSR 5182 located on the B-D NF.
Alternative 2: Management of the wheeled motorized routes in the Kading/Limburger
Springs Area would remain the same as alternative 1. However, FSR 1868 would only be
open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width and less from May 16 through
October 14. The B-D NF closed Route 5182 to motorized vehicles from May 16 through
December 2 under their 2010 Forest Plan Revision. Similar to alternative 1, these two
routes are not consistent with the B-D NF travel management system where routes from
the Helena National Forest connect to FSR 5182 located on the B-D NF.
Alternatives 3 and 5: MTR-502 and FSR 1868 would be closed to wheeled motorized
vehicles year-long and would be consistent with the B-D NF.

Specialist Reports
Relevant resource components from each resource specialist’s report are highlighted in this chapter.
Components include the existing environment which is the baseline environmental condition as
described under alternative 1 (No-Action) and the anticipated environmental effects of implementing
the range of alternatives. Please see Appendix A for Forest Plan consistency for each resource.
This FEIS incorporates by reference the Resource Specialist Reports in the Project Record (40 CFR
1502.21). These reports contain the detailed data, executive summaries, regulatory framework,
assumptions and methodologies, analyses, conclusions, maps, references and technical documentation
that the resource specialists relied upon to reach their conclusions. These reports are summarized in this
chapter.
The specialists reports for Lands/Rights of Way and Minerals have not been included in this document as
they did not generate concerns from the public, would not be affected by the actions and would still
meet Forest Plan consistency requirements. These resource reports have been filed in the project record
and are available for review upon request.

Amendment to the Helena National Forest Plan
A proposed programmatic plan amendment to the “Helena National Forest Plan” (Forest Plan) is a
component of this analysis as described in Chapter 2 and in full in Chapter 3. By law, the proposed
actions must be consistent with the Forest Plan or the Plan must be changed. Amendments to the Forest
Plan can have effects because they propose changes in the management of the forest.

Project Record
The Divide Travel Plan Project Record is referenced throughout this document in an effort to keep this
document brief and concise as per 40 CFR 1502.21. The Project Record contains a variety of documents,
including, but not limited to: specialists’ reports, literature, supporting documents and other processrelated documents.

RECREATION
Regulatory Framework
The Divide Travel Management Plan analysis and decision is made in accordance with regulations,
direction and policy. The increased popularity and widespread use of Off-Highway Vehicles (OHVs) on
public lands during the 1960’s and early 1970’s prompted development of unified federal policy that
started with executive orders (EO) 11644 in 1972 and EO 11989 in 1977. Forest Service (FS) regulations,
created to implement the above EO and govern the forest transportation system, are located in the 36
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 212.
Forest Service recreation management is guided by a Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS), which
provides the basic framework for inventorying, planning and managing recreation resources in
accordance with the Forest and Rangeland Resources Planning Act of 1974 (RPA), as amended by the
National Forest Management Act of 1978 (NFMA). ROS is a conceptual scheme that identifies seven
categories which represent a mix or combination of recreational activities, settings and experience
opportunities along a spectrum from Primitive to Urban. In addition, this report was developed by the
principle elements from the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500-1508).

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Forest Plan
The Forest Plan (1986) directs management of all federal lands within the Divide Travel Planning Area. It
establishes Forestwide goals, objectives and management area (MA) direction for multiple uses of the
renewable resources as well as standards and guidelines to assure sustained land productivity and
environmental protection.
The Forest Plan states that most existing roads would be left open. It further states generally, the
Helena National Forest would be open to vehicles except for roads, trails or areas which have
restrictions. Forestwide goals and objectives, pages II/1 and II/6 of the Forest Plan, discuss how roads
and trails will help to meet forest land and resource objectives and visitor needs. Other forestwide
resource goals and objectives identify how the transportation system can help meet those needs.
Forestwide goal #15 on page II/2 in the Forest Plan directs development and implementation of a road
management program with road uses and travel restrictions that are responsive to resource protection
and public concerns.
The Helena National Forest has been divided into 23 management areas each with different
management goals, resource potential and limitations. Travel plan decisions will be made in accordance
with established goals and standards of each management area.
Forest Plan Amendment #20, derived from the 2001 Tri State OHV Record of Decision (ROD), allows
wheeled motorized use on existing open routes or areas with all other National Forest System lands
restricted from off-route motorized use. (reference section below)
Management policy and direction is also provided in Forest Service Manuals (FSM) and Handbooks
(FSH). In particular, FSM 7700 (Travel Management) and FSM 2300 (Recreation, Wilderness and Related
Resource Management) provide specific direction related to the management of Forest Service roads
and trails.

Forest Service/BLM Off-Highway Vehicle Record of Decision 2001 (2001 Tri State
OHV ROD)
In January 2001, the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a joint offhighway vehicle decision which facilitated amendment #20 of the Helena Forest Plan. This decision
restricted wheeled motor vehicles to existing roads, trails and designated areas; however, it allows
motorized travel to access dispersed campsites up to 300 feet off existing motorized routes. The 2001
Tri-State OHV Decision also directed National Forests to establish a schedule for completing site-specific
travel planning that would designate appropriate uses on all system and non-system roads and trails.
Until site-specific planning is accomplished, the OHV amendment restricts wheeled motorized vehicles
to routes that existed prior to 2001. The OHV amendment provides guidance on motorized use
extending from 4-wheel drive routes to single track motorcycle trails.

Travel Management Rule of November 2005 (2005 Travel Rule)
Federal Regulations identified in 36 CFR parts 212 and 295 were combined and clarified as 36 CFR part
212 under the Travel Management Rule; Final Rule of November 2005. The 2005 Travel Rule requires
National Forests to designate those roads, trails and areas that are open to motor vehicle use on
National Forest System (NFS) lands. The final rule prohibits the use of wheeled motor vehicles off the
designated system. As a result, individual Forests are required to conduct a site-specific analysis to
determine the designated motorized route system and areas (36 CFR, Part 212, Sub-part B).

RECREATION - 51

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan
On October 2, 1968 Congress enacted the National Trails System Act which established a nationwide
trail system. On November 10, 1978 Congress amended the National Trails System Act to establish and
designate the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST). The Continental Divide Trail
Comprehensive Plan was approved by the Chief of the Forest Service in 1985. The U.S. Forest Service
goal of the Comprehensive Plan was to provide a uniform Trail Management Program, which reflected
the purposes of the National Scenic Trail System and at the same time allowed for the use and
protection of the natural and cultural resources found along the designated route on lands of all
jurisdictions. In an effort to clarify the Comprehensive Plan Direction, the Deputy Chief of the Forest
Service sent correspondence to Regional Foresters in 1997 that stated, “as the CNSDT is further
developed, it is expected that the trail will eventually be relocated off of roads for its entire length”.
That memorandum further stated, “it is the intent of the Forest Service that the CDT will be for nonmotorized recreation”. CDT segments can be open to motorized use but only in limited situations and
based upon specific criteria.
Additional direction for the CDNST was also provided in a Forest Service Manual Amendment (dated
October 6, 2009). It provided the following guidelines applicable to this travel plan analysis which
should be considered.
(1) Manage the CDNST to provide high-quality scenic, primitive hiking, pack and saddle stock
opportunities. Backpacking, nature walking, day hiking, horseback riding, nature
photography, mountain climbing, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are compatible with
the nature and purposes of the CDNST (FSM 2353.42). Use the Recreation Opportunity
Spectrum (ROS) and the ROS Users Guide in delineating and integrating recreation
opportunities in CDNST unit plans and managing the CDNST (FSM 2311.1). Where possible,
locate the CDNST in primitive and semi-primitive non-motorized ROS classes to provide for
continuous travel between the Montana-Canada and New Mexico-Mexico borders. Locate a
CDNST segment on a road only where it is primitive and offers recreational opportunities
comparable to those provided by a trail with a Designated Use of Pack and Saddle Stock,
provided that the CDNST may have to be located on or across designated routes because of
the inability to locate the trail elsewhere (FSM 2353.44b, paragraph 11).
(2) Motor vehicle use by the general public is prohibited on the CDNST, unless that use is
consistent with the applicable CDNST unit plan and:
(a) Is designated in accordance with 36 CFR Part 212, Subpart B and:
(1) The designated vehicle class and width were allowed on that segment of the CDNST
prior to November 10, 1978 and the use will not substantially interfere with the
nature and purposes of the CDNST (FSM 2353.42) or
(2) The designated segment was constructed as a road prior to November 10, 1978; or

(b) In the case of over-snow vehicles, is allowed in accordance with 36 CFR Part
212, Subpart C and the use will not substantially interfere with the nature and
purposes of the CDNST (FSM 2353.42).
Assumptions
Under all four action alternatives, existing snowmobile routes located on Forest roads would be closed
to wheeled motorized vehicles when they are groomed.
The Divide Travel Plan decision will include only open or closed determinations – no decommissioning
measures will be specified in this decision.
RECREATION - 52

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Any route designated 06; closed year-long to wheeled vehicles, may potentially be fully decommissioned
in a separate NEPA analysis and decision.
Any existing route not identified as a Helena National Forest system route in this travel plan decision
would be considered a non-system route and would be available for decommissioning.
OHV refers to all wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches and less in width.
Undetermined roads and trails are the same as unclassified, unauthorized and/or user created, the
terms are interchangeable. While these routes are not part of the National Forest System routes, as per
the 2001 Tri-State OHV Decision, if a route was on the ground prior to 2001, it needs to be recognized as
existing until a site-specific analysis is complete to determine if it should be incorporated into the
National Forest System. This travel plan is a site-specific plan that will analyze the various undetermined
roads and trails and determine if the route should be incorporated into the National Forest road and/or
trail system or decommissioned as per the Tri-State Decision.

Information Used
Existing road and trail information was acquired from the Helena National Forest Transportation System
in addition to Forest Service employee field observations, input from the public and user groups. This
information coupled with GIS data was obtained to provide spatial information about designated system
roads, trails, Inventoried Roadless Areas and the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum to reflect the existing
motorized roads and trails for analyzing as per the 2001 Tri-State Decision.
Recreation use information has been obtained from a variety of sources. Research papers, publications
and survey information relative to trends or estimated use was acquired for this analysis through the
documents identified below. It should be noted that information referenced is not specific to the Divide
Travel Management Area. The Helena Forest does not generally obtain or document visitor use except
at developed recreation fee sites.

Methodology and Scientific Accuracy
Data was gathered to describe the existing condition and for use as baseline information to analyze
direct, indirect and cumulative effects among the alternatives.
NEPA effects analysis is both quantitative and qualitative. The status of available road and trail miles
provides a quantitative view of project effects by alternative. The extent of effects on travel routes and
other recreation opportunities is necessarily a qualitative assessment based on past forest visitor
patterns, historical trends and the experience of the recreation specialists completing this analysis.

Recreation, Affected Environment
Introduction
The popularity and use of OHVs in Montana and in the Helena area continues to increase, as is
evidenced by the number of those vehicles observed on the National Forest. With the exception of one
year (2000), the number of registered OHVs in Montana increased annually from 1990 through 2008.
Motorized use of public roads and trails in the Divide Travel Plan Area is an important recreation activity
for many. Motorized use is also an important administrative tool for: livestock management, spraying
noxious weeds, minerals management and vegetation management. The perceived “best” allocation of
recreation opportunities in the analysis area, including motorized travel, varies with the backgrounds,
interests and personal biases of different forest users.

Analysis Area
The analysis area consists of National Forest System lands in the Divide Travel Management Area. This
includes approximately 155,480 acres of public land located in Lewis & Clark and Powell counties. The
area encompasses Black Mountain and extends from the Tenmile drainage west to the Little Blackfoot
and Bison Mountain area.
The Divide Travel Plan Area, located on the Helena Ranger District, is popular for recreation throughout
the year. This is due in large part to the proximity of local communities in Helena, Elliston, Avon,
Montana City and Clancy.
Forest roads provide important access for and to a variety of recreation opportunities. Many forest
visitors are primarily interested in viewing scenery and wildlife from the comfort of their vehicles. For
others, roads provide access for hunting, camping, hiking, fishing and a variety of other recreation
activities. Some of the existing national forest roads within the Divide Travel Plan Area are maintained
routinely and provide motorized vehicle access. However, other roads are not maintained to passenger
vehicle standards and require high clearance vehicles.
The Divide Travel Plan Area is a popular area for winter recreation, especially over-snow vehicle use.
Designated snowmobile parking within the Divide travel planning area is located at Moose Creek,
Sweeny Creek, Mullan Pass, Austin and the Little Blackfoot. The “Helena Snowdrifters” snowmobile club
maintains and grooms snowmobile trails during the winter months. There is also a designated parking
area that accesses approximately 10 miles of cross-country ski trails located on the east side of
MacDonald Pass. The existing trail network is maintained primarily through the volunteer efforts of the
Last Chance Nordic Ski Club.
Upland bird hunting, bow hunting and big game hunting season are also very popular with local
residents during the fall months. It is not uncommon for hunters to camp at some of the dispersed
camping sites within the planning area.
RECREATION - 54

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Popular recreation opportunities during the summer and early fall include: fishing, hiking, camping,
horseback riding, OHV use, mountain biking and picnicking.
Overnight camping is very popular at the District’s developed campgrounds in addition to numerous
undeveloped sites within the Divide Travel Plan Area. Most of the frequently used dispersed campsites
are located adjacent to a river or stream including: Tenmile Creek, Telegraph Creek and Little Blackfoot
River. In many areas, impacts associated with dispersed camping are acceptable and limited to soil
compaction, sanitation and litter. However, in several locations resource conditions at the campsites
and/or access routes are badly degraded and require rehabilitation. Currently, off-route wheeled
motorized travel up to 300 feet is allowed to access dispersed campsites, unless specifically prohibited.
Several developed recreation sites are located on the Helena Ranger District within the Divide Travel
Plan Area. There are two trailheads located on MacDonald Pass: one for the cross-country ski trails and
another for the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST). Also located on the top of MacDonald
Pass is the 15 unit Cromwell Dixon Campground. East of the divide are several developed sites located
along the Rimini Road. Moose Creek Campground, Ten Mile Day Use Area, Moose Creek Winter
Trailhead and Moose Creek Rental Cabin are all located within a short distance of each other and
comprise the recreation complex in the Tenmile drainage. There are also developed sites located west
of the divide near the Little Blackfoot River: Kading cabin and Kading campground.

Special Use Permits
In addition to the public recreation sites there are two residence tracts that have privately owned cabins
located on National Forest lands within the Divide Travel Plan Area that are authorized under terms of a
special use permit. The Moose Creek Villa Tract is located along the Rimini Road and consists of five
recreation residences. The Forest Heights Tract, near the top of MacDonald Pass, has seven permitted
recreation residences. Forest Heights contains two separate roads to provide access to the recreation
residences and are only open to authorized cabin permit holders. Permittees cannot use their cabin as a
permanent residence and are restricted to use of their site less than six months per calendar year.
The Forest also administers a special use permit to the Prickly Pear Sportsman’s Association for a target
range located east of MacDonald Pass which is utilized year-long.
West of the divide, along the Little Blackfoot River, is the Lion’s Sunshine Camp that is authorized under
the organizational camp authorities to the Helena Lion’s Club. Use of the Sunshine Camp occurs
primarily from May through September.
Designated system trails are also located within the Divide Travel Plan Area. With the exception of oversnow use, none of the trails are managed for motorized travel. All system trails are closed to wheeled
motorized use with the exception of two short segments of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
(see CDNST information below). Non-motorized trails within the analysis area include: Bison-Blackfoot
Trail #328, Blackfoot Meadows Trail #329, Continental Divide Trail #337, Switchback Ridge Trail #348,
Larabee Gulch Trail #359, Monarch Creek Trail #326, Cave Gulch Trail #371 and Ten Mile Environmental
Trail #375.
Little Blackfoot Road #227 ends at a turn-around approximately ¼ mile south of Kading Cabin. At that
location an un-improved native surface road (#227-E1) extends approximately 1 mile south to the
Kading Grade and the termini of the Blackfoot Meadows Trail #329. Road #227-E1, which contains
several large mud holes, is only accessible by high clearance vehicles. Observations by Forest employees
suggest less than 50 percent of visitors who use Trail #329 drive vehicles to the end of Road #227-E1.
There is existing non-system trails located west of Forest Road #227. These routes existed prior to 2001,

they therefore remain open to motorized vehicles (seasonally). Motorized routes #501, #502, #503 and
#504 are open to vehicles less than 50 inches in width from May 16th through October 14th . These
non-system trails have become increasingly more popular with individuals camping at Kading
Campground and the dispersed sites adjacent to the Little Blackfoot River.
The Forest Plan identified several management areas which consist of large blocks (greater than 3,000
acres) of undeveloped land suited for dispersed recreation. One of those R1 management areas (Mount
Helena) is located within the Divide Travel Planning Area. Portions of T9N, R4W, Section 16, 17 and 20
receive minimal recreation use as there are no designated roads or trails in this area.
In an effort to obtain visitor use information the U.S. Forest Service initiated a national visitor use
monitoring project (NVUM). The information collected by this project is valid and applicable at the
forest, regional and national level.
A growing trend through much of the Helena National Forest, including the Divide Travel Plan Area, is
the construction of new residences on private in-holdings. Occupancy of private homes in and adjacent
to the Divide Travel Plan Area impacts recreation use on National Forest lands. People residing within
the National Forest boundary often use adjacent National Forest lands for their recreation activities. As
a result, recreation use has increased in certain locations including the Little Blackfoot River, Telegraph
Creek corridors and Sweeny Creek area. In addition, residents that live adjacent to the National Forest
are usually concerned about management activities which occur nearby. Forest management and public
recreation use can and frequently does impact adjacent homeowners who moved to a rural setting to
get away from people and their influences. The increased influx of residents within the Forest boundary
has created on-going conflicts in some locations, specifically the Sweeny Creek Area.
In the mid-1990s the Helena National Forest designated special areas for hunters with disabilities. That
opportunity allowed qualified individuals with disabilities to hunt from roads that were otherwise closed
to motorized travel. The practice was discontinued after several years due to conflicts and mixed public
opinion. One of the areas included in the “Hunter Access Program” was the Hahn Creek Road (#1856)
segment located behind a locked gate. Although that opportunity is no longer available on the Helena
National Forest, employees still receive numerous requests to provide special motorized opportunities
for the elderly and individuals with disabilities, especially during the big game hunting season. In
addition, people also request designation of game retrieval routes in many areas which are not currently
provided.
The area within the Divide travel plan offers opportunities for both motorized and non-motorized
recreation across the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS). As stated under the Regulatory
Framework section, the ROS provides the framework for inventorying, planning and managing the
recreation resource. The distribution of the ROS classes in the Divide Travel Plan Area is outlined in the
table below. The travel plan area predominately falls into the Roaded Natural, Semi-primitive Motorized
and Semi-primitive Non-Motorized categories due to past and current development, such as roads and
associated timber harvest, within and near the analysis area. The largest tracks of semi-primitive nonmotorized areas are the Inventoried Roadless Areas.

Recreation Issues of Concern
Past travel plan analysis and public scoping identified several key issues specific to the Divide Travel Plan
Area. Key emphasis issues and/or areas included: Motorized Use; the Continental Divide National Scenic
Trail; Sweeny Creek area; and Kading area.

Motorized Use
It is very unlikely that forest visitors would travel long distances to seek motorized recreation
opportunities in the Divide Travel Plan Area. Because potential motorized opportunities in the Divide
Travel Plan Area are minimal, effects analysis will be limited to those applicable to the Helena National
Forest.
Approximately 286 miles of designated roads within the analysis area are currently open to highway
legal vehicles year-long. In contrast, there are 85 miles of Forest roads that are closed to all motorized
vehicles year-long, including over-snow machines. The remaining 42 miles of road (not including county
roads) within the analysis area are closed year-long to wheeled motorized travel but open to over-snow
vehicles from December 2nd through October 14th. It’s important to note that most Forest roads
provide motorized access to a variety of recreation opportunities.
Of the approximately 85 miles of Forest roads closed to all motorized vehicles year-long, the areas
adjacent to approximately 74 miles of these roads are currently open to over-snow vehicles. While it is
currently illegal to operate an over-snow vehicle on these roads, it is perfectly legal to operate oversnow vehicles adjacent to the road prism. This has presented re-occurring management problems on
the Forest, especially travel violations.
The Divide Travel Plan Area also contains approximately 140 miles of designated snowmobile trails.
About 100 miles are regularly groomed and the other 40 miles are groomed occasionally. The majority
of snowmobile trails in this area are located on existing roads. A current travel restriction, applicable
within the analysis area and throughout the Helena Ranger District, prohibits wheeled motorized
vehicles over 50 inches wide from operating on designated snowmobile trails when they are groomed.
In addition, snowmobiling also occurs on National Forest lands within the Divide Travel Plan Area which
are open to that use. Currently there are about 122,844 acres that are open to snowmobiling with no or
only seasonal restrictions. This equates to approximately 79 percent of the total National Forest acres in
the analysis area. As stated above, a current and unresolved travel restriction issue is the presence of
Forest roads which are closed to over-snow vehicle travel located within areas open to that use.
Currently the Divide Travel Planning Area does not have any designated wheeled motorized trails
identified on the Forest Transportation Inventory. However, there are approximately 12 miles of trail
that are currently open year-long to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less. There are
also seven miles of trail that are open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less from

RECREATION - 57

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

May 16th through October 14th. In addition, there about 16 miles of unauthorized roads and trails open
to wheeled motorized travel.
The seven miles of trail noted above, occur on routes that were in existence prior to 2001. Wheeled
motorized vehicle use occurs on the following routes near Kading campground: Road-501, MTR-502,
MTR-503 and MTR-504 (please see the Kading area discussion below).
A popular area for off-highway vehicle use is Sweeny Creek. While use is currently managed in
accordance with the Tri-State OHV Decision, there are concerns about the amount and type of
motorized use occurring in the Divide Travel Planning Area and the associated impacts.
Although not formally documented, there are routine travel plan violations which occur in some areas.
Located near Bison Mountain, NFSRs 1801-A1 and 1801-A3 are closed to over-snow motorized vehicles
but continue to receive that use each winter. Those roads (once part of the CDNST) provide access to
trails on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest.
Additionally, OHV’s which are allowed on the Kading Grade from May 16th through October 14th also
travel onto adjacent lands on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest which are closed to wheeled
motorized travel.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail

The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST), which extends through the Divide Travel Plan Area,
is nationally designated and recognized as an important recreation destination/opportunity. Travel
planning in the analysis area may provide an opportunity to make CDNST travel decisions which would
move the Helena Forest toward greater compliance with national direction for the trail. The current
route on the Helena Ranger District extends approximately 56 miles from Nevada Mountain south to
Thunderbolt Mountain. This portion of the CDNST is a combination of individual segments that are
located on: jeep trails, single track trails, county roads, private roads, open Forest Service roads and
roads closed to motorized travel. The CDNST on the Helena Ranger District consists primarily of roads
(52 miles, all of which are in the planning area). About 19 miles of the existing CDNST road segments are
closed to wheeled motorized travel. The CDNST is also comprised of several single track trail segments
totaling approximately four miles in length. Although these single track trail segments are not managed
for motorized use, that use is not prohibited. Due to the various locations of route segments and
intersections it can be extremely difficult to follow the CDNST through the Helena Ranger District.
Popularity and use of the CDNST on the Helena Forest is growing, both locally and with visitors who seek
to travel longer segments of the trail. See CDNST map in the map packet at the end of the document.

Sweeny Creek Area
The Sweeny Creek area has been identified through public input (both written and verbal) as a specific
area of concern. That area is adjacent to the Forest boundary and a growing number of privately owned
homes. As a result, Sweeny Creek is important to local residents who recreate in that location and/or
may be impacted by others recreating there. For many years the area provided recreation opportunities
for: hiking, picnicking, camping, folfing (Frisbee golf), group use, nature study and hunting. During the
past 10 years the Sweeny Creek area has grown increasingly popular for OHV use (ATVs and trail bikes),
paint ball activities, mountain biking and horseback riding. Increased recreation use has displaced some
recreationists and raised concerns with local residents about unacceptable resource and social impacts.
In particular, residents have expressed frustration with the noise, dust, vandalism, litter, loss of
vegetation and soil erosion that is occurring as a result of some recreation activities.
RECREATION - 58

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Wheeled motorized vehicles are used on constructed roads and other routes within the Sweeny Creek
area. Those routes are designated as motorized trails (MTR) on Alternative Maps 1 and 2: MTR-001,
MTR-004, MTR-008, MTR-011, MTR-016, MTR-017, MTR-018 and MTR-021. Other routes in the Sweeny
Creek area were not carried forward in any of the alternatives as they didn’t meet the definition of a
route as per the 2001 Travel Decision. Twenty years ago motorized use on the Sweeny Creek routes was
limited to an occasional high clearance vehicle and motorized trail bikes. With the increased popularity
of OHVs, motorized use in Sweeny Creek has greatly expanded. It’s a popular location for motorized use
during the spring because it is snow-free earlier than many other areas on the Forest. While existing
travel restrictions mandate wheeled motorized use on existing routes only, violations frequently occur
and result in new unauthorized routes and resource damage. The Helena Forest Plan identified most of
the Sweeny Creek area as Management Area (MA) T-1 or M-1. An identified management standard for
MA T-1 states, “controls on motorized recreation will be implemented where necessary to protect the
vegetation, soil and water resources and to prevent road damage”. Although the Sweeny Creek area is
open to over-snow vehicles, that use is limited due to the lack of a consistent snow base.

Kading Area
The Kading Grade was once a popular route providing motorized access from the Helena National Forest
to private lands and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. Motorized use on the Kading Grade
route has declined. In addition, National Forest lands west of Kading Grade have been closed to OHV
use, with the exception over-snow vehicles. NFSR 1868, Kading Grade (MTR-502) and routes 501, MTR503 and MTR-504 are currently open to wheeled motorized vehicles from May 16th through October
14th. With the exception of the winter season, these routes are primarily used by wheeled motorized
vehicles from the middle of summer through the fall hunting season.

Recreation, Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to All Alternatives
Because this is strictly an open or closed decision, future travel decisions would be necessary for actions
such as: road or trail re-location, route obliteration and new road or trail construction. Implementation
of any travel plan alternative may result in the displacement of an undetermined number of Forest
visitors. There may be limited visitor displacement if alternative 1 or 2 are selected because that
motorized use currently exists. However, if alternative 3 or 4 is selected, motorized enthusiasts
currently using some routes could be displaced to other areas on the Helena National Forest. Alternative
5 is a response to public comment. Motorizes users will be displaced from some areas while at the same
time gain long loop opportunities in other appropriate landscapes.
There would continue to be increased public demands for both motorized and non-motorized
opportunities. Although it’s impossible to predict future economic conditions or social trends, there is
an existing demand for more motorized opportunities and additional areas which provide semi-primitive
non-motorized recreation.
As per the Tri-State OHV decision site-specific planning at the local level would identify when and where
individual roads and trails would be open and closed to various types of use, implementation of any
alternative would result in the designation of motorized routes within the Divide Travel Plan Area.
Through this decision unauthorized routes would either be closed to motorized travel or added to the
Forest transportation inventory.
RECREATION - 59

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

No motorized routes were designated solely for use by individuals with disabilities during the big game
hunting season.
None of the alternatives would facilitate a large motorized trail network sought by some recreationists.
Wheeled motorized travel would be restricted to existing routes designated for that use. Off-route
travel by wheeled vehicles would be authorized for parking adjacent to existing roads. Wheeled offroute travel would also be allowed to access dispersed campsites but only within 300 feet of open
roads/trails and only by taking the most direct route which does not result in resource damage.
The U.S. Forest Service recognizes that vehicles emit greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate
change; however, this project does not determine “if” motorized activity occurs within the Divide Travel
Plan Area but rather where it may occur. We have seen no evidence to indicate that the general public
would meaningfully alter the amount of their motorized use because of the designation of routes on
National Forest lands, whether their preferred use is to drive to a trailhead to hike, tour in a passenger
vehicle, or to recreate with off-highway vehicles on or off the Forest. Under the action alternatives,
fewer routes would be available for motorized use than are currently authorized, but there is no
indication that would result in a different amount of motorized use by the general public.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives
Although new travel restrictions would be less complex and more easily understood, changes would
require a period of adjustment for Forest visitors. A change in travel restrictions may initially result in
increased violations.

Alternative 1, No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Recreation access and opportunities would remain much as they currently exist.
This alternative would not designate any roads that would be open to wheeled motorized vehicles solely
during the big game rifle season.
The use of motorized vehicles in some locations may have already displaced some Forest visitors who
seek quiet recreation opportunities.
Approximately 16 miles of existing unauthorized routes currently used by motorized vehicles would be
added to the Forest transportation inventory.
Motorized access on NFSR #227-D1 would provide limited wheeled motorized vehicle access (with a ford
across the Little Blackfoot River) to a trailhead and Miller Cabin in Larabee Gulch. The existing ford is
not safe for vehicle travel during most of the year. Although there is no road bridge across the Little
Blackfoot River, the short spur road east of the river is currently open to motorized travel.

Motorized Use
The existing non-system motorized routes located in the Kading area would be authorized as designated
motorized trails open from May 16th through October 14th. Designation of those routes would result in
a need for routine maintenance and possibly reconstruction. These routes would be signed and
maintained as system trails. It is reasonable to assume that improvements to those routes would
increase motorized use.

RECREATION - 60

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Under this alternative approximately 16 miles of existing but non-system routes would remain open to
wheeled motorized travel. These routes would need to be added to the Forest transportation system as
roads or trails.
Wheeled motorized trails in the Kading area would continue to be restricted from use October 15th
through May 15th. This area is currently open to wheeled motorized travel from May 16th through
October 14th which could impact bow season and early fall hunting opportunities. For others, the
wheeled motorized access offers motorized recreation opportunities. Motorized over-snow travel would
remain prohibited on approximately 71 miles of existing Forest roads but would be allowed on land
adjacent to those roads

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
There are approximately 29 miles of the CDNST in the planning area which are currently open to
wheeled motorized travel. Per FSM direction (2300), motorized use should only be allowed on the
CDNST if the route and type of use was in existence prior to November 10, 1978. Spur road 136-D1 was
identified on the 1977 Helena Forest map as a trail open to motorized vehicles under 40 inches wide. As
a result, any wheeled motorized vehicles exceeding 40 inches in width should not be authorized on NFSR
136-D1.
Other motorized segments of the CDNST are roads which existed prior to November 10, 1978. In
accordance with recent direction, those routes could continue to serve as segments of the CDNST if they
are primitive and motorized use does not substantially interfere with the nature and purposes of the
CDNST. Most of the existing motorized segments of the CDNST are located on NFSR #136, 495, 622,
1802, 1802-B2 and 1855. Motorized use on existing CDNST segments would continue as per the current
situation. Approximately 19 miles of the CDNST would be closed to wheeled motorized travel. The
existing single track trail segments in the vicinity of Priest Pass and Mullan Pass would remain open to
motorized trail bikes. In addition, NFSR #136–D1 would remain open to motorized use year-long.
Table 20 under the Conclusions section lists the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) by
mileage and proposed designation for each segment within the Divide travel planning area for each
alternative. The CDNST map in the map packet coincides with the segments listed on the table at the
end of this section.

RECREATION - 61

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Sweeny Creek Area
Existing unauthorized motorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would become designated
motorized trails. It’s reasonable to assume that future improvements to those routes would increase
motorized use. The designation of motorized routes in the Sweeny Creek area would anger some
nearby residents who are concerned about the associated impacts. Conflicts between motorized and
non-motorized recreationists could continue or increase.

Kading Area
Under this alternative, NFSR 1868, the Kading Grade (MTR-502) and routes 501, MTR-503 and MTR-504
would remain open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less from May 16th through
October 14th. This motorized activity would provide opportunities for OHV enthusiasts and hunters.
Continued use of several OHV trails in the Kading area may affect the amount and type of visitor use
that occurs in Kading Campground, Kading Rental Cabin and at dispersed campsites located along the
Little Blackfoot River.
Designation of motorized trails in the Kading area would most likely increase OHV use on portions of the
Little Blackfoot Road #227. Rather than trailer OHVs or motor bikes to the trailheads, most motorized
users would simply travel from their campsite at Kading Campground or a dispersed site adjacent to the
Little Blackfoot Road. Even if those trail vehicles were licensed and street legal, that increased use of a
popular Forest Road may present safety concerns that require additional management actions.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There are no known irreversible or irretrievable commitments associated with this alternative.

Cumulative Effects
Analysis of cumulative effects on recreation considers the effects of past, present and reasonably
foreseeable future activities on the recreation resource. The spatial boundary for the actions considered
in cumulative effects is the planning area. For recreation, only activities within the planning area could
be expected to add to the impact of the project’s activities. Temporally, actions considered date back to
pre-1960 actions that are known and date forward to all reasonably foreseeable planned future
activities. A list of these actions considered is provided in Appendix B. They include timber harvesting,
prescribed burning, road and trail reconstruction, recreational use, mining and private land
development.
Prior to 2001, most Helena Forest lands were open to motorized travel unless specifically closed.
Through the Tri State OHV decision, management direction changed to prohibit off-route wheeled
motorized travel. There was sound resource rationale for that decision but it greatly altered
opportunities for motorized recreation on the Helena National Forest. Wheeled motorized travel is now
authorized on existing routes only.
The Divide travel decision will be considered in respect to projects within or near the Divide Travel Plan
Area and especially to other travel decisions on the Helena National Forest. Past travel decisions made
for the Big Belt Mountains, Elkhorn Mountains, Clancy-Unionville Treatment area and Soundwood
Salvage area resulted in new motorized use restrictions. Those decisions and future travel decisions for
the Lincoln Ranger District would determine not only the motorized trail opportunities provided but also
public road access to the Forest.
Other past decisions that have/will contribute to cumulative effects on recreation in this analysis area
include: Prickly Pear Sportsmen’s Target Range, MacDonald Pass Nordic ski trails, Recreation Residence
RECREATION - 62

Tracts (Forest Heights and Moose Creek Villa), routine use and maintenance of Forest trails, developed
recreation sites, MacDonald Pass Vista Point, Tri Arabian Horse Trail Ride, Jericho Mountain CDNST reroute, CDNST reconstruction Phase I, Monarch Creek trail reconstruction, Treasure Mountain
Snowmobile trail relocation, Austin snowmobile parking lot, Helena Lions Sunshine Camp, Minnehaha
trail project and the EA for the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. Reasonable Foreseeable
projects would include the Ten Mile Road Improvement Project and the ongoing Forestwide Hazard Tree
Removal Project (see appendix B). Impacts from the above identified projects are site-specific and
would not affect travel restrictions.

Alternative 2
Direct and Indirect Effects
This alternative would designate about 10 miles of roads open to wheeled motorized vehicles solely
during the big game rifle season. As a result, that motorized access opportunity would be available in
the Divide Travel Plan Area as well as portions of the North Big Belt Mountains.
Prohibiting wheeled motorized travel on six miles of existing unauthorized routes could displace some
Forest visitors to other locations on the Helena Forest or to other areas off the Forest. However, 10
miles of existing unauthorized routes currently used by motorized vehicles would be added to the Forest
transportation inventory.
The use of motorized vehicles in some locations may have already displaced some Forest visitors who
seek quiet recreation opportunities. Additional displacement would only be slightly different than
alternative 1 because most of the associated motorized use already exists.
Increased use of several OHV trails in the Kading area may affect the amount and type of visitor use that
occurs in Kading campground and rental cabin. The campground and cabin may become more popular
with motorized trail enthusiasts. Increased motorized trail use in the area may detract from the existing
setting in Kading campground and within the Little Blackfoot drainage.
Designation of motorized trails in the Kading area and on NFSR #4104-A1 would most likely increase
OHV use on portions of the Little Blackfoot Road #227. Rather than trailer OHVs or motorcycles to the
trailheads, most motorized users would probably travel from their campsite at Kading campground or a
dispersed site adjacent to the Little Blackfoot road.
This alternative would provide motorized access to the Larabee Gulch Trailhead but only after a bridge is
constructed across the Little Blackfoot River. Until such time as a bridge is constructed, Road #227-D1
would be closed to motorized use.
Alternatives 2 and 4 would designate NFSR #4104-A1 as a trail open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50
inches in width or less from May 16th through October 14th. As such it would provide an important link
between the Little Blackfoot drainage and the Telegraph Creek area. Until such time as a bridge,
bottomless arch or culvert is constructed, Road #4104-A1 would remain closed to wheeled motorized
use.
Alternatives 2 and 4 would also designate two NFSRs (#4001 and #227-D1) open to wheeled motorized
travel. Access to the Golden Anchor Mine area and Larabee Gulch trailhead would provide enhanced
recreation opportunities. These routes would remain closed to wheeled motorized travel until a
suitable crossing is constructed.

RECREATION - 63

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Motorized Use
Approximately 273 miles of designated roads would be open to highway legal vehicles year-long. This is
approximately two miles less than what currently exists under Alternative 1.
Under this alternative approximately 114 miles of Forest roads would be closed to wheeled motorized
vehicles year-long but open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd through May 15th.
Currently, over-snow vehicle use is allowed adjacent to many of those roads but not on the roads. In
addition, Alternative 1 would allow over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd through October
14th. Implementation of Alternative 2 could reduce both social and resource concerns associated with
the use of over-snow motorized vehicles from mid-May through mid-October. If over-snow machines
operate with a marginal amount of snow during the spring or fall, vegetation can be damaged and soils
disturbed. In addition, the use of over-snow vehicles during the big game hunting season can cause user
conflict.
About 15 miles of Forest roads would be closed to all motorized travel, including over-snow vehicles,
year-long.
Approximately 10 miles of existing unauthorized routes currently used by motorized vehicles would be
added to the Forest transportation inventory.
Under Alternative 2 there would be approximately 25 miles of trail open seasonally to motorized
vehicles 50 inches in width or less. Under Alternative 2 there would be one mile of trail open to
motorized travel year-long. Implementation of this alternative would provide seasonal motorized trail
opportunities in two primary locations: Kading area and Sweeny Creek. This alternative would provide
the greatest number of trail miles open to motorized vehicles.
The designation of NFSR #4104-A1 as a trail open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches wide or less
from May 16th through October 14th would provide additional motorized opportunities and access.
Motorized enthusiasts would be able to travel from Ontario Creek to the Telegraph Creek area. If the
vehicles were licensed and street legal, there would be expanded opportunities to travel on Forest roads
in those areas.
This alternative would designate a total of approximately 10 miles of road open to wheeled motorized
vehicles but from October 15th through December 1st. Those four routes, opened during the big game
rifle season, would provide additional motorized access. NFSRs that would be included in this restriction
code include: #335-A1 and #335-A2 (Priest Pass area), #314-J3 (Spotted Dog Creek area) and #1856
(Hahn Creek area). This feature of Alternative 2 responds to requests the Forest receives each fall for
motorized access for hunting during the big game season.
This alternative would clearly designate motorized routes and simplify existing travel restrictions to
foster a greater understanding of motorized regulations in the Divide Travel Plan Area.

Under this alternative the majority of NFSR #136-D1 (2 miles) would be closed to wheeled motorized
vehicles yearlong. The remaining 0.5 miles, which provides access to existing stock facilities and
trailhead parking, would remain open to highway legal vehicles yearlong.
Existing single track trail segments would be closed to wheeled motorized travel year-long. This would
prohibit the occasional wheeled motorized use that occurs on those trails and enhance non-motorized
recreation opportunities.
Table 20 under the Conclusions section lists the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) by
mileage and proposed designation for each segment within the Divide Travel Planning Area for each
alternative. The CDNST map in the map packet coincides with the segments listed on the table at the
end of this section.

Sweeny Creek Area
The existing unauthorized motorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would be designated as
trails open to motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less from May 16th through October 14th.
Designation of those routes would result in a need for routine maintenance, possibly reconstruction and
construction of a parking area to serve as a trailhead. Because those routes would be signed and
maintained as system trails, additional funding would be needed for operation and maintenance. It’s
reasonable to assume that future improvements to those routes would increase motorized use in the
area. Designation of these routes as system trails would provide another area on the Helena Forest
specifically recognized for OHV use.
One notable change in the Sweeny Creek area under Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 is the winter closure to
motorized travel. Approximately 5,700 acres in that area (including the motorized trails) would be
closed to over-snow motorized travel from October 16th through May 14th. Although that area does not
receive a great deal of over-snow vehicle use at the current time, it has become popular with OHV riders
both during the winter and spring.

Kading Area
Similar to Alternative 1, NFSR 1868, the Kading Grade (MTR-502) and routes 501, MTR-503 and MTR-504
would remain open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less from May 16th through
October 14th. This motorized activity would provide opportunities for many OHV enthusiasts that camp

in the Little Blackfoot drainage. It would also be supported by hunters who seek motorized access to
that area during the upland bird and big game bow season.
Increased use of several OHV trails in the Kading area may affect the amount and type of visitor use that
occurs in Kading Campground and Kading Rental Cabin. The campground and cabin may become more
popular with motorized trail enthusiasts. Increased motorized trail use in the area may detract from the
existing setting in Kading campground and within the Little Blackfoot drainage.
Designation of motorized trails in the Kading area and on NFSR #4104-A1 would most likely increase
OHV use on portions of the Little Blackfoot Road #227. Rather than trailer OHVs or motorcycles to the
trailheads, most motorized users would probably travel from their campsite at Kading Campground or a
dispersed site adjacent to the Little Blackfoot Road.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There are no known irreversible or irretrievable commitments associated with this alternative.

Past timber harvesting and road construction contributed to the existing condition of the recreation
landscape, creating an area where human activity is evident and the recreation setting is primarily that
of a working landscape. In addition, past road construction for those past harvest activities have made
positive contributions to the accessibility of recreation activities in the area, such as access to hunting
grounds, dispersed campsites and snowmobile routes. Trails improved over the past several years
include sections of the CDNST and the Monarch Creek Trail and Trailhead. These past activities have
contributed positively to the existing condition of recreation facilities in the planning area.
Present and reasonably foreseeable future activities include continued maintenance on open Forest
roads, including improving road and surface drainage, clearing roadside vegetation and repairing and
maintaining culverts. Ongoing roadside hazardous tree removal projects are also ongoing and will
improve the access to and safety of the recreation setting. When combined with the long-term positive
impact of the action alternatives on a healthy forest recreation setting, present and future activities
would have a positive effect on recreation by improving the access and setting.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
This alternative would reduce existing opportunities for motorized recreation. It would also simplify
travel restrictions and foster a greater understanding of motorized regulations in the Divide Travel Plan
Area.
This alternative would not designate roads open to wheeled motorized travel solely during the big game
rifle season (10/15 through 12/1) As a result, that opportunity would only be available in the Big Belt
Mountains.
Prohibiting wheeled motorized travel on seven miles of existing unauthorized routes could displace
some Forest visitors to other locations on the Helena Forest or to other areas off the Forest.
Approximately nine miles of existing unauthorized routes currently used by motorized vehicles would be
added to the Forest transportation inventory.
Prohibiting motorized use on NFSR #227-E1 would improve resource conditions because the existing
road is rutted and contains several mud holes.
RECREATION - 66

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Approximately 251 miles of designated roads would be open to highway legal vehicles year-long. This is
approximately 24 miles less than what currently exists under Alternative 1.
Under this alternative approximately 156 miles of roads would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles
year-long but open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd through May 15th. This is an
increase of about 42 miles over Alternative 2. In contrast, Alternative 1 would allow over-snow
motorized vehicles from December 2nd through October 14th. Implementation of Alternative 3 could
reduce both social and resource concerns that are associated with the use of over-snow motorized
vehicles from mid-May through mid-October.
Under Alternative 3 there would be no trails open to motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less.
Implementation of this alternative would provide no wheeled motorized trail opportunities in the Divide
Travel Plan Area.
This alternative would not designate motorized opportunities on closed Forest roads during the big
game hunting season.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
Under this alternative the majority of NFSR #136-D1 (two miles) would be closed to wheeled motorized
vehicles yearlong. The remaining 0.5 miles, which provide access to existing stock facilities, would
remain open to highway legal vehicles yearlong. Approximately 0.6 additional miles of CDNST would be
closed to wheeled motorized travel over Alternative 1.
Existing single track trail segments would be closed to wheeled motorized travel year-long. This would
prohibit the occasional wheeled motorized use that occurs on those trails and enhance non-motorized
recreation opportunities.
Table 20 under the Conclusions section lists the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) by
mileage and proposed designation for each segment within the Divide travel planning area for each
alternative. The CDNST map in the map packet coincides with the segments listed on the table at the
end of this section.

Sweeny Creek Area
The existing unauthorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed to motorized travel
year-long. This would eliminate the existing motorized use and resulting resource damage, user
conflicts and impacts to adjacent residents. Prohibiting motorized vehicles in the Sweeny Creek area
RECREATION - 67

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

could facilitate increased non-motorized recreation opportunities such as: hiking, horseback riding,
picnicking and nature study.
Similar to Alternative 2, approximately 5,700 acres in that area would be closed to over-snow motorized
travel. Although that area does not receive a great deal of over-snow vehicle travel at the current time,
this restriction would ensure quiet winter recreation opportunities for nearby residents.

Kading Area
Under this alternative, NFSRs 1868 and 501 would be closed to wheeled motorized travel year-long but
open to over-snow vehicles from December 2nd through May 15th. That is also true for non-system
trails MTR-502, MTR-503 and MTR-504. Current OHV travel for wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches or
less would be prohibited. Existing over-snow motorized travel on those routes would continue.
NFSR #227-D1 would be closed to motorized use.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There are no known irreversible or irretrievable commitments associated with this alternative.

Cumulative Effects
Please see the discussion under Alternative 1.

Alternative 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
This alternative would reduce existing opportunities for motorized recreation. It would also simplify
travel restrictions and foster a greater understanding of motorized regulations in the Divide Travel Plan
Area
Under this alternative there would be no designated roads open to wheeled motorized travel solely
during the big game hunting season (10/15 through 12/1).
Prohibiting wheeled motorized travel on six miles of existing unauthorized routes could displace some
Forest visitors to other locations on the Helena Forest or to other areas off the Forest. However, 10
miles of existing unauthorized routes currently used by wheeled motorized vehicles would be added to
the Forest transportation inventory.
Alternatives 2 and 4 would designate NFSR #4104-A1 as a trail open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50
inches in width or less from May 16th through October 14th. As such it would provide an important link
between the Little Blackfoot/Ontario Creek drainages and the Telegraph Creek area. Until such time as
a bridge, bottomless arch or culvert is constructed, Road #4104-A1 would remain closed to wheeled
motorized use.
Alternatives 2 and 4 would also designate two NFSRs (#4001 and #227-D1) open to wheeled motorized
travel. Access to the Golden Anchor Mine area NFSR #4001 and Larabee Gulch trailhead NFSR #227would provide enhanced recreation opportunities. These routes would remain closed to wheeled
motorized travel until a suitable crossing is constructed.

Motorized Use
Approximately 264 miles of designated roads would be open to highway legal vehicles year-long. This is
approximately 11 miles less than what currently exists under Alternative 1. Under this alternative
approximately 106 miles of roads would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles year-long but open to
RECREATION - 68

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd through May 15th. This is a decrease of eight miles
from Alternative 2. In contrast, Alternative 1 would allow over-snow motorized vehicles from December
2nd through October 14th.
Alternative 4 would designate four miles of trails open to wheeled motorized vehicles (50 inches in
width or less) from May 16th through October 14th.
In addition to Alternative 1, under Alternative 4 NFSRs #4104-A1, #227-D1 and #4001 would remain
closed until improved stream crossings are constructed.
One additional cumulative impact unique to Alternative 4 is the closure of the Microwave Tower Road
(#1802) to all motorized travel yearlong. This would have several implications. That road would no
longer provide wheeled motorized access for recreation opportunities during the summer or fall
months. In the past that road has enabled wheeled motorized access to an area popular for hunting,
firewood gathering and wildlife/scenery viewing. However, NFSR #1802 would still continue to serve as
a segment of the CDNST. Because the road was in existence prior to 1978, motorized travel restrictions
would not be implemented solely for benefit of the CDNST.
This alternative would designate a total of approximately three miles of road open to wheeled
motorized vehicles but from October 15th through December 1st. These three routes, opened during
the big game rifle season, would provide additional motorized access. NFSRs that would be included in
this restriction code include: #335-A1 and #335-A2 (Priest Pass area). This feature of Alternative 4
responds to requests the Forest receives each fall for motorized access for hunting during the big game
season.
This alternative would designate wheeled motorized opportunities on NFSR #335-A1, #335-A2 (Priest
Pass Area) and NFSR #314-J3 located in the Spotted Dog Creek area for hunting during the big game rifle
season.

Under this alternative, the majority of NFSR #136-D1 (two miles) would be closed to wheeled motorized
vehicles yearlong. The remaining 0.5 miles, which provide access to existing stock facilities, would
remain open to highway legal vehicles year-long. In addition Forest Road #1802 would be closed to
motorized vehicles year-long.

RECREATION - 69

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Because NFSR #1802 existed prior to November 10, 1978, it should not be closed to wheeled motorized
travel to meet agency direction for the CDNST. Under Alternative 4 approximately nine miles of the
existing CDNST which allows some type of wheeled motorized use would become non-motorized.
Table 20 in the Conclusions section lists the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) by mileage
and proposed designation for each segment within the Divide travel planning area for each alternative.
The CDNST map in the map packet coincides with the segments listed on the table at the end of this
section.

Sweeny Creek Area
Like Alternative 3, the existing unauthorized routes located in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed to
motorized travel year-long. It’s also possible this change could displace existing motorized use to other
areas on the Forest. Similar to Alternatives 2 and 3 approximately 5,700 acres in that area would be
closed to over-snow motorized travel. Although that area does not receive a great deal of over-snow
vehicle use at the current time, this restriction might slightly enhance non-motorized winter recreation
opportunities for nearby residents.

Kading Area
With the exception of over-snow vehicles during the winter, the unauthorized trails in the Kading area
would be closed to wheeled motorized use. The prohibition of motorized travel on existing
unauthorized trails could impact some hunters who currently use OHVs or motor bikes to access
traditional hunting areas until October 15th.
This alternative could result in travel conflicts during the winter. If over-snow motorized travel is
allowed on the Kading Grade (MTR-502) but prohibited on NFSR #227-E1 anyone traveling from the
Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest to the Helena Forest would not have access to over-snow motorized trails
in the Little Blackfoot area.
Wheeled motorized travel on Forest Road #227-E1 would be prohibited.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There are no known irreversible or irretrievable commitments associated with this alternative.

Cumulative Effects
Please see the discussion under Alternative 1.

Alternative 5
Direct and Indirect Effects:
Alternative 5 is a well thought out mix of multiple use recreation opportunities in the Divide Travel Plan
Area. This proposed alternative was developed in response to public comment and field reviews and is
designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities and reduce the short spur and redundant
parallel routes. It also improves big game security as well as addresses resource concerns relative to
erosion and sedimentation from roads and stream crossings. Consideration was given to further align
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with National Standards.
The selection of this alternative would result in the production of a Motor Vehicle Use Map which would
identify motorized routes that are open for use along with corresponding restrictions and designations.
In addition, this map would show restrictions regarding dispersed camping. Use of a motor vehicle
RECREATION - 70

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

other than in accordance with specific designations would be prohibited. The authority for this action
comes from 36 CFR 212 and 36 CFR 261.13.

Motorized Use
Under this alternative approximately 63 miles of existing routes would be converted to trails open to
motorized use 50 inches or less. These routes would need to be added to the Forest transportation
system as trails.
Designation of those routes would result in a need for routine maintenance and possibly reconstruction.
These routes would be signed and maintained as system trails. It is reasonable to assume that
improvements to those routes would increase motorized use.
Wheeled motorized trails in the Kading area would be restricted from use September 1st through May
15th. This area is currently open to wheeled motorized travel from May 16th through October 14th
which could impact bow season and early fall hunting opportunities. For others, the wheeled motorized
access offers motorized recreation opportunities.

of motorized trails that would have no seasonal restrictions.

Kading-Limburger Springs Area
National Forest System Route (NFSR) #227 would remain open to Kading campground. Beyond Kading
campground, NFSR #227-E1 would become part of non-motorized trail 329. The trailhead parking area
on NFSR #227 past Kading campground where the route would change to non-motorized use would be
expanded to accommodate day use vehicles and horse trailers.
Motorized Trail #501 would remain open to motorized vehicles of 50 inches and less in width from May
16th to August 31st. The prohibition of motorized travel on existing trails could impact some hunters who
currently use OHVs or motor bikes to access traditional hunting areas until October 15th.
Over-snow motorized travel would be allowed in areas north and west of NFSR #227 from December 2nd
to May 15th. Refer to the Alternative 5 map for detailed over-snow motorized travel in this area.

Sweeny Creek Area
With the exception of the Priest Pass road, all routes in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed yearlong
to motorized use including over-snow vehicles. As a mitigation measure to closing Sweeny Creek there
will be development of an OHV trail system in the Austin area will provide motorized trails that are close
to town and easily accessible throughout the year. This area will be accessible for use for family
gatherings and short rides close to town.

bridge would be constructed to connect to the non-motorized Larabee Trail #359. A trailhead would be
designated nearby on NFSR #227.
The stream crossing located on Golden Anchor NFSR #4100 is currently a ford. This alternative proposed
to replace the ford with a bridge, bottomless culvert, or structure installed to accommodate wheeled
motorized vehicles 50 inches in width and less and over-snow motorized vehicles. The ford would
remain open for motorized use until the structure is in place or two years from the start of the
implementation phase of this project, whichever is less. If a structure is not installed during this
timeframe, the ford crossing would be closed to vehicle travel until a structure is in place. The area

beyond this crossing would remain open to wheeled vehicles 50 inches in width and less in addition to
over-snow motorized vehicles.

Unauthorized Routes
Alternative 5 would designate approximately 1.4 miles of identified unauthorized routes to be added to
the Forest Transportation System for non-motorized use. All routes, including unauthorized routes, not
identified or included in this alternative as part of this planning effort, as well as any future created
routes, would be considered closed and would be physically closed without additional NEPA.

Parking
Parking would be allowed up to 30 feet from the edge of a designated route.

Access to Dispersed Campsites up to 70 Feet from a Designated Route
Parking and motor vehicle use associated with dispersed camping would be allowed up to no more than
70 feet from the edge of a designated route as long as:
•
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity;
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources i.e., damage to live trees and
shrubs, rutting and eroding of streambanks or bare soil;
Travel off-route does not cross streams;
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas; and
Travel to and parking associated with dispersed campsites would be limited to no closer
than 30 feet of a stream or body of live water.

Access to Dispersed Campsites further than 70 feet from a designated route
Dispersed campsites located more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route that are identified
on the alternative 5 map would remain open for dispersed camping and parking associated with
dispersed camping. The five items identified under the access to dispersed campsites up to 70 feet from
a designated route section are applicable for this as well.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments:
There are no known irreversible or irretrievable commitments associated with this alternative.

Cumulative Effects:
Analysis of cumulative effects on recreation considers the effects of past, present and reasonably
foreseeable future activities on the recreation resource. The spatial boundary for the actions considered
in cumulative effects is the project boundary. For recreation, only activities within the project area could
be expected to add to the impact of the project’s activities. Temporally, actions considered date back to
pre-1960 actions that are known and date forward to all reasonably foreseeable planned future
activities They include timber harvesting, prescribed burning, road and trail reconstruction, recreational
use, mining and private land development.
Past timber harvesting and road construction contributed to the existing condition of the recreation
landscape, creating an area where human activity is evident and the recreation setting is primarily that
of a working landscape. In addition, past road construction for those past harvest activities have made
positive contributions to the accessibility of recreation activities in the area, such as access to hunting
grounds, dispersed campsites and snowmobile routes. Trails improved over the past several years
include sections of the CDNST and the Monarch Creek trail and trailhead. These past activities have
contributed positively to the existing condition of recreation facilities in the project area.
Present and reasonably foreseeable future activities include continued maintenance on open forest
roads, including improving road and surface drainage, clearing roadside vegetation and repairing and
maintaining culverts. Ongoing roadside hazardous tree removal projects are also ongoing and will
improve the access to and safety of the recreation setting. When combined with the long-term positive
impact of the action alternatives on a healthy forest recreation setting, present and future activities
would have a positive effect on recreation by improving the access and setting.

Conclusions
All alternatives would cause a certain degree of motorized vehicle travel restrictions, primarily expected
during the summer, fall and winter. Alternative 5 the most impactive to recreation, offers a blend of
motorized recreation opportunities while at the same time maintaining wildlife security. As a result of
public comments long OHV loop trails where identified as mitigation to short dead end routes.
Alternative 5 also tries to limit the negative impact of unmanaged recreation buy identifying some
control measure on dispersed recreation. The actions proposed by all alternatives are consistent with
Forest Plan direction. Therefore, the impacts of the proposed activities on the recreation resource will
remain within Forest Plan standards because the actions proposed are consistent with recreation
standards, both Management Area specific and Forestwide.

Alternative 1
Under this alternative the existing condition would continue. Existing unauthorized routes currently
being used by wheeled motorized vehicles would be designated and become part of the Forest
transportation inventory. This would include two existing trail segments and one road segment of the
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.

RECREATION - 75

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

An existing over-snow motorized travel discrepancy would continue. Although 71 miles of Forest Roads
would remain closed to over-snow vehicles, National Forest lands adjacent to those roads would remain
open to that use.

Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would add fewer existing unauthorized routes to the Forest transportation system than
Alternative 1. These routes are currently open for that use under the Tri State Off-Highway Vehicle
Decision of 2001. It’s also likely that motorized use on those routes would increase as the trails are
improved.
This alternative would result in a 4.5 mile decrease of CDNST currently open to wheeled motorized use.
This alternative identified three routes open to wheeled motorized vehicles during the big game rifle
season. Because this alternative would end the existing restriction that prohibits over-snow motorized
travel on about 71 miles of roads in areas open to over-snow motorized travel, it would be easier for the
public to understand and follow winter travel regulations.

Alternative 3
Because Alternatives 3 and 4 feature no miles of wheeled motorized trail, these alternatives would have
a greater impact upon existing recreation use. Individuals who currently use the Divide Travel Plan Area
for OHVs would be displaced to other areas. There would be additional recreation opportunities for
non-motorized activities.
This alternative would result in a 6.1 mile decrease of CDNST currently open to wheeled motorized use.
This alternative has fewer acres open to motorized over-snow travel than Alternatives 1 and 2 and could
enhance the non-motorized recreation experience during the winter.

Alternative 4
Because Alternatives 3 and 4 feature no miles of wheeled motorized trail, they would have a greater
impact upon existing recreation use. Individuals who currently use the Divide Travel Plan Area for OHVs
use would be displaced to other areas. Persons who favor non-motorized recreation activities would
have additional opportunities.
This alternative would close (25) road miles to wheeled motorized travel year-long. As a result, it would
have a greater impact on existing recreation opportunities associated with wheeled motorized travel
than the previous alternatives.
This alternative would result in an 8.8 mile decrease of CDNST currently open to wheeled motorized use.
Unique to this alternative is the closure of wheeled motorized travel on the Microwave Road #1802.
This route would only be open to wheeled motorized travel for administrative use and permit holders
authorized to access the electronic site on MacDonald Pass. Individuals who currently utilize this road to
collect firewood, pick berries, hunt and view wildlife would be displaced.

Alternative 5
All alternatives would cause a certain degree of motorized vehicle travel restrictions, primarily expected
during the summer, fall and winter. Alternative 5 offers a blend of motorized recreation opportunities

while at the same time maintaining wildlife security. Alternative 5 also tries to limit the negative impact
of unmanaged recreation buy identifying some control measure on dispersed recreation. The actions
proposed by all alternatives are consistent with Forest Plan direction. Therefore, the impacts of the
proposed activities on the recreation resource will remain within Forest Plan standards because the
actions proposed are consistent with recreation standards, both Management Area specific and
Forestwide.
Table 20 below compares the segments of Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) by mileage
within the Divide Travel Planning Area with Alternative 1 being the No Action alternative in comparison
to the action alternatives with the proposed designations for each segment. The FEIS map packet has a
map of the CDNST that identifies the location of each segment listed in the table below.

Forest Plan Consistency
All alternatives would be consistent with Forest Plan goals, objectives and standards. Please refer to
recreation standards contained in the Forest Plan Consistency Table (appendix A).

UNROADED and ROADLESS
Regulatory Framework
Direction for the evaluation of unroaded lands for potential wilderness can be found in Forest Service
Handbook (FSH) 1909.12(72). This handbook direction specifically defines wilderness characteristics for
potential wilderness and how they should be evaluated.
There are no Forest Service regulations or laws that prohibit development of unroaded areas. In
addition, there are no Forestwide or management area standards specific to unroaded areas. Although
the unroaded areas are not designated as wilderness or located within Inventoried Roadless Areas, the
effects of the Divide Travel Plan project will be assessed using the wilderness attributes identified in
Forest Service Handbook 1909.12 and the 1964 Wilderness Act. Because the Left Hand Fork
Cottonwood Gulch unroaded area is contiguous with the Nevada Mountain inventoried roadless area,
the effects of the proposed actions on the inventoried roadless area itself will also be analyzed.

Forest Plan Direction
Portions or all of the four inventoried roadless areas (Nevada Mountain, Jericho Mountain, Lazyman and
Electric Peak) are within the planning area. These unroaded areas were identified as inventoried
roadless areas. For more details on each of these Inventoried Roadless Areas, please see appendix C of
the Helena National Forest Plan Final EIS. There is also management direction in the Forest Plan that
applies to these Inventoried Roadless Areas. In addition to the four identified inventoried roadless areas,
there are contiguous unroaded lands within the planning area that also might potentially be affected by
this proposal.
Approximately 50 percent of the project area is within the “Roaded Natural” Recreation Opportunity
Spectrum category, meaning that timber harvest or other surface use practices are evident and
motorized vehicles are permitted on all parts of the road system.
Management areas H1, H2, L1, L2, M1, P3, T1, T3, T4, T5, W1 and W2 cover the four inventoried
roadless areas and the one contiguous unroaded area.

Roadless Area Review and Evaluation (RARE II)

UNROADED and ROADLESS - 77

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The RARE II inventory was completed in anticipation of development of the Forest Plan which was
completed in 1986. Appendix C of the Forest Plan analyzed all of the inventoried roadless areas and
rated them for wilderness suitability. Some of the lands were ultimately selected in the Forest Plan
decision for Forest Plan recommended wilderness (P-3 management areas totaling 32,900 acres). These
were in addition to the designated wilderness areas (Scapegoat and Gates of the Mountains totaling
111,600 acres). Some inventoried lands were not recommended for wilderness but instead have Forest
Plan direction to maintain their unroaded character for semi-primitive non-motorized recreation and for
wildlife values (R-1 totaling 34,300 acres and E-2 totaling 22,200 acres). There is an R-1 area within the
project boundary – Mount Helena. This R-1 area is an area that has been designated as undeveloped
land suited for dispersed recreation. It provides opportunities for semi-primitive non-motorized
recreation and is characterized predominantly by natural or natural appearing environments where
there is a high probability of isolation from man’s activity.

2001 Roadless Rule
The 2001 Roadless Rule provides management direction for timber cutting, sale, or removal and road
construction/reconstruction (36 CFR 294 Subpart B [66 FR 3244] January 12, 2001). The Rule has been
subject to continuous litigation. At the writing of this report the Rule is in effect. The Rule does not apply
to motorized or non-motorized trails (66 FR 3251).

Assumptions
The Divide Travel Plan would not authorize construction of new routes or decommissioning of existing
routes. This analysis is focused on determining whether existing roads and trails would be open to
motorized vehicles, the type of vehicle and season of use.
There is an increased emphasis and public demand for both undeveloped areas and motorized routes on
National Forest lands.
Generally, the sight and sound of motorized vehicles would diminish the recreation experience for most
visitors who seek solitude and/or undeveloped recreation opportunities.
Although the presence of motorized routes does not preclude the possibility of designating National
Forest System lands for wilderness, the amount and type of that use could influence that decision.

Information Used
Helena National Forest GIS data, aerial photos and local resource-specific knowledge of the Divide Travel
Plan project area were used in this analysis.

Methodology & Scientific Accuracy
The collection of recreation use data, including the National Visitor Use Monitoring survey done in 2003,
personal contacts with Forest visitors and local recreation club(s) were used to develop this report.
Forest Service Handbook 1909.12 (72) identifies potential characteristics that can be used to identify an
unroaded area’s capability to be considered for future wilderness. The Divide Travel Plan project uses
these five characteristics as a way of measuring the effects of the project on the inventoried roadless
areas and contiguous unroaded lands within the project area.
Natural – the general condition of the ecological function of the natural environment.
Undeveloped – the degree to which the area is without permanent improvements or human habitation.
Outstanding Opportunities for Solitude or Primitive and Unconfined Recreation - Solitude is a personal,
subjective value defined as the isolation from sights, sounds and presence of others and from

developments and evidence of humans. Primitive recreation is characterized by meeting nature on its
own terms, without comfort and convenience of facilities
Special Features – the capability of the area to provide other unique values.
Manageability – the ability to manage the area as potential future wilderness.
This analysis focuses on the potential effects of project activities on wilderness characteristics as defined
in FSH 1909.12. It is recognized that expanses of inventoried roadless areas and other unroaded lands
provide other resource values as well. Potential project effects to other values are evaluated elsewhere
as they relate to specific resources. This analysis concentrates on wilderness characteristics and
compares any changes to the existing conditions of the identified inventoried roadless areas, as well as
any other contiguous unroaded lands, with potential wilderness characteristics within the project area
boundary.

Unroaded and Roadless, Affected Environment
The affected environment is within the project area boundary for the Divide Travel Plan – extending
from the Nevada area in the northwest, south to the Little Blackfoot and Bison Mountain area and east
to the Tenmile drainage. This area is managed by the Helena Ranger District of the Helena National
Forest.

Introduction
This report discusses four discrete IRA’s and one discrete unroaded area which is contiguous with the
Nevada Mountain IRA.
There are four inventoried roadless areas and one smaller area of unroaded lands (which do not have
special designation) contiguous to the Nevada Mountain in the Divide Travel Plan area. The four IRA’s
are: Nevada Mountain, Jericho Mountain, Lazyman Gulch and Electric Peak. These four IRA’s were
analyzed using the same characteristics of the roadless area inventory (RAREII).
The one small unroaded area located outside of but contiguous to one of the IRA’s was analyzed using
the same characteristics as were used in the roadless area inventory (RAREII).
The Helena Forest Plan established forestwide multiple-use goals, objectives and management
requirements as well as management area prescriptions. The analysis of roadless lands, documented in
appendix C of the FEIS for the Plan, described each roadless area, the resources and values considered,
the range of alternative land uses studied and the effects of management under each alternative. As a
result of the analysis some roadless areas were recommended for inclusion in the National Wilderness
Preservation System and others were assigned various non-wilderness prescriptions. The four IRA’s
were assigned to management areas. The unroaded land contiguous to the roadless areas was assigned
to management area T-1. The proposed activities tied to the action alternatives would occur within the
“T” lands (available and suitable for timber management) management areas.
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the environmental consequences of the proposed action and
alternatives on the wilderness characteristics of the IRA’s and roadless area expanse.
Semi-primitive motorized recreation is recognized as an acceptable roadless characteristic under the
Forest Plan. Motorized trails were not prohibited in IRAs under the 2001 Roadless Rule (66 CFR 3251).

Analysis Area
The analysis area is within the project area boundary for the Divide Travel Plan – extending from the
Nevada area in the northwest, south to the Little Blackfoot and Bison Mountain area and east to the
Tenmile drainage. This area is managed by the Helena Ranger District of the Helena National Forest.
The analysis area for the unroaded areas of the Divide Project area includes those portions of the IRA’s
within the project area boundary as well as the contiguous unroaded areas outside of the IRA’s that may
have contributing characteristics to future wilderness designation in the area.

Recreation Opportunity Spectrum
Forest Service recreation management is guided by the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS), which
allocates and manages outdoor recreation opportunities and activities by natural resource setting. The
distribution of summer ROS classes in the Divide Travel Plan area is shown in the following table. The
acres displayed include the four IRA’s and the one unroaded area analyzed in this report.

The roaded natural, semi-primitive motorized and semi-primitive non-motorized categories
predominate because of past and current development, such as roads and associated mining and timber
harvest within and near the analysis area. The largest tracts of semi-primitive non-motorized areas are
the IRA’s.
See the recreation report for additional descriptions of the motorized and non-motorized uses within
the project area found in the project file.

Inventoried Roadless
The Helena Forest Plan, appendix C (1986) contains the evaluation of inventoried roadless areas on the
Helena National Forest. This evaluation assessed the wilderness suitability of each IRA using the
characteristics identified in the Wilderness Act of 1964 to define wilderness. The project area includes
four IRA’s within the project area as indicated on the alternative maps attached to this report. However,
no ground disturbance or vegetation treatment is proposed within these roadless areas.
Located within the project area are the following four inventoried roadless areas: Electric Peak, Jericho
Mountain, Lazyman and Nevada Mountain. In total, these inventoried roadless areas comprise
approximately 1,107 acres of private land and 56,204 acres of National Forest lands within the Divide
Travel Plan area. Currently there are motorized travel routes located within three of the Inventoried
Roadless Areas as indicated in the following table and shown on alternative maps. The characteristics of
each inventoried roadless areas are described below. Additional information pertaining to the IRAs is
found in the Helena Forest Plan Environmental Impact Statement appendices A, B and C.

*These 2 miles are within the IRA, but located on the Lincoln Ranger District, outside of this planning area boundary.

Nevada Mountain (1606)
The Nevada Mountain inventoried roadless area straddles the Continental Divide approximately 30
miles northwest of Helena, Montana in both Lewis & Clark and Powell Counties. A portion of this IRA is
located on the Lincoln Ranger District. Local roads access the IRA and a wheeled motorized trail is
located on the north end (Lincoln Ranger District). Topography includes steep slopes capped with broad
rounded ridges on the main divides. Elevations vary from about 5,500 feet in Jefferson Creek to 8,330
feet at the summit of Black Mountain. This IRA includes the following management areas; M1, T1, T3
and W1.
The only portion of the Nevada Mountain IRA considered within this analysis area is that which is
located on the Helena Ranger District, approximately 8,435 acres or 17 percent of the IRA. The Lincoln
Ranger District is currently analyzing the Blackfoot Non-Winter Travel Plan which incorporates the
remainder of the IRA. Therefore, from this point on, unless otherwise noted, when this IRA is discussed,
it will only pertain to that portion of the IRA within the Helena Ranger District.

Wilderness Attributes

Natural
Evidence of past mining activity can be found along stream bottoms near the edge of the area. Although
there are almost two miles of road within the IRA open to motorized vehicles, the roads are not located
within the planning area. Hunting is the most popular recreation activity within the Nevada Creek area.
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail passes through the area and provides opportunities
primarily for hiking and horseback riding. An old jeep road (#136-D1) extends from Ophir Road #136 to
a scenic bench near Black Mountain. A segment of this route is currently open to wheeled motorized
vehicles yearlong but only to the middle of Section 5 in T11N, R7W. It is occasionally used by OHV’s,
four wheel drive vehicles, trail bikes and snowmobiles. Currently all National Forest lands in the IRA are
open for snowmobiling.

Undeveloped
The Nevada Mountain inventoried roadless area is about 30 miles northwest of Helena in both Lewis
and Clark and Powell counties. The undeveloped attribute describes the degree to which developments
and uses are apparent to most visitors. Factors that contribute to the level of development include:
•
•
•

Presence of roads and trails;
Presence of developments (campgrounds, dams, structures, facilities); and
Use of motorized equipment, mechanical transport, landing of aircraft.

Inventoried Roadless Areas lands on the Helena Ranger District are currently open for cross-country
snowmobile travel.
UNROADED and ROADLESS - 81

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

With the exception of a few existing roads and trails, the area is undeveloped. The Cellar Ogilvie Trail
#312, which is located in the northeast corner of the IRA and outside of this planning area, is managed
seasonally for OHVs.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
Solitude is a personal, subjective value defined as the isolation from sights, sounds and presence of
others and from developments and evidence of humans. Primitive recreation is characterized by
meeting nature on its own terms, without comfort and convenience of facilities. Factors that add to
solitude within the IRA area are:
•
•
•

Distance from roads and trails;
Topographic features, including screening from sights and sounds; and
Experiences available (with and without developments).

In the southeast portion several roads exist, but are closed yearlong. An old jeep road (136D) bisects the
southeast section of the IRA. Private land exists along the southern boundary. There are limited
opportunities for visitors to enjoy solitude and unconfined recreation unless they are within about ½
mile of the Continental Divide.

Special Features
A section of the Continental Divide Trail runs along the eastern boundary of the planning area.

Manageability
The current IRA boundary on the Helena Ranger District does not follow any topographic features or
roads. As a result, the eastern IRA boundary located within the planning area is difficult to identify on
the ground.

Jericho Mountain (1607)
The Jericho Mountain inventoried roadless area straddles the Continental Divide and is approximately
10 air miles southwest of Helena, Montana in both Lewis and Clark and Powell Counties. It encompasses
approximately 8,439 acres. This IRA includes the following management areas: H1, H2, L1, M1, T1, T4, T5
and W1.
The area is easily accessible from adjacent roads and one open road (# 1863) extends from Bullion Parks
into the IRA. The eastern boundary of the area runs along the Tenmile and Minnehaha Creek Roads.
Topography changes from the 5,200 foot valley floor to an elevation of 7,200 feet on the divide. There
are several parcels of private land (with evidence of past mining activity) located within the IRA. Due to
the close proximity of Helena, the Jericho Mountain IRA is popular for hiking, hunting and some
mountain biking. There have been a few reports of motorized incursions in this area. Currently, all
National Forest lands within the Jericho Mountain IRA and Divide Travel Plan area are open for
snowmobiling.
The IRA is bordered by private land, roads and mining claims. Therefore, there are no contiguous
unroaded areas adjacent to the IRA that would be suitable to analyze.

Wilderness Attributes

UNROADED and ROADLESS - 82

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Natural
The impacts of human activity are present in much of the area. Past mining has created access roads
throughout the area. There are many roads that provide access to private land. Mining claims and cabins
are scattered throughout the area.

Undeveloped
The Jericho Mountain inventoried roadless area is about 10 miles southwest of Helena in both Lewis and
Clark and Powell counties. The land is open for cross-country snowmobile travel.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
This IRA is long and narrow. The Continental Divide splits the area – creating most of the topographic
screening. People traveling along the higher open ridges on the north end can see human activities and
development within the area or adjacent areas.

Special Features
A key feature within this area is the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) which extends from
MacDonald Pass to Road #1863. This segment of the CDNST was closed to any type of motorized use in
a special order signed September 2004.

Manageability
The northern boundary is just south of U.S. Highway 12. The east and south sides are bordered by the
Tenmile-Minnehaha Road – this road accesses the Forest and a subdivision.
The boundaries are defined by forest roads, private land and topographic features.

Lazyman (1608)
The Lazyman Gulch inventoried roadless area is approximately 10 air miles southwest of Helena,
Montana in Lewis and Clark County. It encompasses approximately 11,569 acres. This IRA includes the
following management areas: H1, L1, L2, M1, R1, T1, T4, T5, W1 and W2.
The northern boundary runs adjacent to private land. The west side of this area is easily accessible off
the Rimini Road #695 and the east side is accessible from a county road. Non-motorized access into the
IRA from the south is available off a former road (#578) which extends between Travis Creek and the
Chessman Road. An old roadbed (#4177), which is closed to motorized travel, also extends to the top of
Colorado Mountain. That road was used to access a fire lookout tower which was removed many years
ago. Elevation varies from approximately 4,800 feet on the north to about 7,223 feet on Colorado
Mountain. Sounds associated with human activity are evident throughout most of the area.
The IRA is bordered by private land and roads. Therefore, there are no contiguous unroaded areas
adjacent to the IRA that would be suitable to analyze.

Wilderness Attributes

Natural
Highway 12 is approximately one mile to the north and the Tenmile Road, which is heavily-used, runs
along the western boundary. The impacts of human activities are present in much of the area. Past
mining and logging activities have created access roads throughout the area. There are many roads that

UNROADED and ROADLESS - 83

Environmental Impact Statement

provide access to private land. Homes are easily visible from high points. Private lands account for more
than 500 acres. Sounds due to human activity can be heard throughout most of this IRA.

Undeveloped
The Lazyman Mountain inventoried roadless area is about 10 miles southwest of Helena in Lewis and
Clark County. All National Forest lands within the Lazyman IRA are currently closed to snowmobiles.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
The area is dissected with tributaries of Colorado Gulch and Tenmile Creek and is used for hiking,
hunting and camping. Hiking within the IRA is popular near the Ten Mile Picnic area and in Black Hall
Meadows. Because the IRA is close to Helena and residents in the Rimini area, it’s a popular area for big
game hunting. Visitors from the Feathered Pipe Ranch frequent the north end of the IRA on existing
non-system trails. Again, human activities are easily seen and heard within this area.

Special Features
Colorado Mountain is the highest point in this inventoried roadless area. It sits at 7,223 feet. Major
topographic features, in addition to Colorado Mountain, include Black Mountain and Black Hall
Meadows.

Manageability
The northern boundary is approximately one mile south of U.S. Highway 12. The northern boundary
runs along private land. The eastern boundary is defined by the road to Park City and the Travis Creek
Road. The southern boundary runs just south of Black Mountain and then turns north along the Tenmile
Creek Road.
Public access in the north is restricted by private land adjacent to the IRA. Much of the private land was
acquired by historic patented mining claims.

Electric Peak IRA (1609)
The Electric Peak inventoried roadless area is located in Powell and Jefferson Counties, approximately 30
air miles southwest of Helena, Montana. Approximately 60 percent of it is on the Helena National
Forest, the remainder is on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. The Little Blackfoot Road (227)
and Kading Campground, which are in the north end, are excluded from the inventoried acres.
Approximately 27,857 acres of the IRA is on the Helena National Forest. This IRA includes the following
management areas: L1, M1, P3, T1, T3, T4, T5 and W1.
The Record of Decision (ROD) for the Forest Plan (FP) determined that the lower two-thirds
(approximate) of this IRA is suitable for wilderness designation and thereby designated it as
management area P3 (Forest Plan proposed wilderness). Activities in accordance with FSM 2300 and
Forest Plan direction are allowed in proposed wilderness.
The Helena National Forest portion of the IRA is bordered by private land and roads. Therefore, there
are no contiguous unroaded areas adjacent to the IRA included in this analysis.

Wilderness Attributes

Natural
People recreating along the higher ridgelines may view human activities and development within the
IRA. Signs of past mineral and logging activities are found throughout the area.
UNROADED and ROADLESS - 84

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Recreation activity in the Electric Peak IRA is extensive and includes both motorized and non-motorized
trail use including: OHV’s, trail bikes, snowmobiles, horseback riding, mountain bikes and hiking.
However, there is an exception – the portion of the Electric Peak IRA that is proposed wilderness
excludes motorized vehicle use including over-snow vehicles. Dispersed camping is popular along the
Blackfoot River corridor and near Blackfoot Meadows. Most of the IRA is extremely popular for big
game hunting, during the bow and rifle seasons.
An extension of the Little Blackfoot Road (#227–E1) proceeds from just south of the campground to an
undeveloped trailhead located in Section 29. Two additional roads, closed to wheeled motorized travel,
are also located in the IRA. There are four non-system trails (501, MTR-502, MTR-503 and MTR-504)
currently open to wheeled motorized vehicles located within the area, all in the vicinity of Kading Cabin.
The inventoried roadless area also contains about 530 acres of private land.
Forest Road #1870–A1, which provides access to private land, is located in the northern portion of the
IRA.
Forest Road 1801-A1 is closed to all motorized vehicles yearlong.

Undeveloped
The Blackfoot Meadows area is popular for a variety of dispersed recreation such as: hiking, hunting,
camping and fishing.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
In the northern portion of the IRA, recreation activities tend to be concentrated along the Little
Blackfoot River. Associated road noise can be heard near the Little Blackfoot River Road (#227) and the
Ontario Creek Road (#123).
There are several non-motorized trails in the IRA located on the Helena National Forest, which include:
Bison-Blackfoot #328, Blackfoot Meadows #329, Continental Divide #337, Larabee Gulch #359 and
Monarch Creek #362. Segments of three designated snowmobile trails are located within the planning
area and Electric Peak IRA. It should be noted snowmobiling is allowed on approximately 34 percent
(9,550 acres) of the Electric Peak IRA within the Divide Travel Plan area. An area restriction which
prohibits motorized vehicles within part of the Electric Peak Roadless Area was signed in December of
1997.
The best opportunities for solitude and/or primitive recreation are located within the interior of the IRA,
especially near Blackfoot Meadows.

Special Features
Approximately 10 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail are located within or adjacent to
the Electric Peak IRA. The IRA also includes other special features such as: Bison Mountain, Thunderbolt
Mountain, Electric Peak and Cliff Mountain. These mountains are over 8,000 feet in elevation.
Eleven miles of the Little Blackfoot River located within the IRA have been classified as eligible for Wild
and Scenic River designation. A suitability study for these segments is the next step in the designation
process.

Manageability
Many of the IRA boundaries are well-defined by topographic features (such as roads) along more than
half of the perimeter.

Defining Unroaded Areas
The analysis evaluates the effects to areas that have not been previously roaded, otherwise referred to
as “unroaded” areas that are contiguous to IRA’s. One area was identified within the Divide Travel Plan
area.
Unroaded areas were defined by identifying areas within the Divide Travel Plan area that appeared to be
unroaded, where unroaded was described as areas without classified roads that weren’t already
inventoried as roadless and of a size and configuration that may be sufficient to protect the inherent
characteristics associated with its unroaded condition. One area was identified using this approach. The
area contiguous to the southeast border of the Nevada Mountain IRA.
The area was analyzed to determine if it might have some of the “wilderness characteristics” normally
attributed to the IRA’s. The same five characteristics that were used for IRA’s were used for this
contiguous unroaded area.
•

•

Natural – The extent to which long-term ecological processes are intact and operating;
Undeveloped – The degree to which the impacts documented in natural integrity are
apparent to most visitors;
Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation – Solitude is a
personal, subjective value defined as the isolation from sights, sounds and presence of
others and from developments and evidence of humans. Primitive recreation is
characterized by meeting nature on its own terms, without comfort and convenience of
facilities;
Special features and values – Unique ecological, geographical, scenic and historical
features of an area; and
Manageability – The ability to manage an area for wilderness consideration and
maintain wilderness attributes.

The affected environment of the unroaded area was determined based on team member knowledge
and interaction. The area is described using the attributes and characteristics identified above. As part
of the planning area, other characteristics of the unroaded areas were considered in the other resources
analyzed for this project, though the other resources did not address them individually as discrete
entities.
The majority of the Divide Travel Plan area was determined to have a Recreation Opportunity Spectrum
(ROS) classification of Roaded Natural which means the area has a mostly natural appearance with
access by conventional motorized vehicles.

Rationale for inclusion/exclusion of areas to be considered as Contiguous
Unroaded
When looking at the Divide Travel Plan area for contiguous unroaded areas, several features were
considered. The Divide Travel Plan area is already heavily developed with roads, private land, mining and
developed recreation sites. All of these features play into the wilderness characteristics that were
UNROADED and ROADLESS - 86

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

evaluated. These features produce sights and sounds that are not conducive to wilderness experiences.
These features were found to be prevalent throughout most of the planning area except in one location.
This location is an area that is adjacent to the southeast part of the Nevada Mountain IRA.

Nevada Mountain IRA and Contiguous Unroaded Lands (Left Hand Fork Cottonwood
Gulch)
Federal land in the planning area of the Nevada Mountain IRA is 8,435 acres. When combined with the
approximate 480 acre Left Hand Fork unroaded area, the area encompasses 8,915 acres. The unroaded
area runs along the southeast boundary of the Nevada Mountain IRA in T11N R9W Section 1. This land
was analyzed for its capabilities as part of the Forest Plan analysis and was given a T-1 (timber
production emphasis) management allocation.
In assessing the wilderness capability of the Nevada Mountain IRA, appendix C of the 1986 Helena
Forest Plan states under the heading “Natural Integrity and Appearance”:
“Roads and trails on the ridges, mining and irrigation ditches are the disturbances to the natural
appearance. When away from these relatively small scale disturbances, the area appears quite natural.”
(p. C/115.)
The Record of Decision for the Plan designated this unroaded area as a T-1 management area (Forest
Plan timber management). Again, this unroaded area is contiguous with the Nevada Mountain IRA
which is not considered suitable for management as wilderness.
The Left Hand Fork Cottonwood Gulch unroaded area is small (about 480 acres), but it is contiguous to
the southeastern portion of the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area (1606). The northwest part of the area
can be accessed by a two-track road (Forest Road #774-B1) which originates to the north, in Section 36.
There is also access to the northeast part of the section via another two-track road that originates in
Section 31. This two track road runs parallel to the Right Hand Fork of Dry Creek. The southern boundary
runs parallel to Forest Road #136. The western boundary is defined by the Nevada Mountain IRA. As was
common during the RAREII inventory, this unroaded parcel defined a narrow buffer between the
inventoried roadless area and an existing road.

Natural
This unroaded area is entirely located on National Forest System lands. There has been no previous
management within this area. The coniferous vegetation component has recently been subject to high
levels of mountain pine beetle mortality. Native vegetation predominates in this area. The Left Hand
Fork of Cottonwood Gulch runs along the northeast part of the area.

Undeveloped
Although this area is small, it does retain a natural appearing landscape in the areas between the IRA
and the existing roads: #136, #774 and #4036. When this unroaded area is combined with the IRA to the
north, it provides approximately 480 additional acres of landscape in a natural appearance.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
The ROS classification for this unroaded area is semi-primitive motorized. The ROS for the Nevada
Mountain IRA is also semi-primitive motorized. Semi-primitive motorized indicates there are moderate
opportunities for solitude, tranquility and closeness to nature. There is a high degree of self-reliance,
challenge and risk in using motorized equipment. There is a predominantly natural appearing
environment. There is a low concentration of users but there is also often evidence of other users on

trails. On site controls and restrictions are minimum and subtle. Vegetative alterations are very small in
size and number and are widely dispersed.

Special Features and Values
There are no special features or values within this unroaded area. It is primarily used during the big
game hunting season. Other than it being adjacent to the inventoried roadless area and near the CDNST,
there are no other special features.

Manageability
This area would not incorporate additional readily identifiable topographic boundaries per the
manageability discussion of the contiguous Nevada Mountain IRA. Due to its adjacency to a portion of
the IRA not considered manageable as wilderness, it does not lend itself to management as wilderness.
It could be considered for management as an extension of the Nevada Mountain IRA, though this would
not be consistent with the Forest Plan management direction for the area.

Unroaded and Roadless, Environmental Consequences
This effects analysis considers the four IRA’s as well as the contiguous unroaded piece adjacent to the
Nevada Mountain IRA. The Nevada Mountain IRA and the contiguous unroaded lands in the Left Hand
Fork Cottonwood Gulch are combined so as to evaluate the impacts of proposed actions on the entire
unroaded expanse.
This section describes the environmental consequences of implementing alternative 1 and four other
alternatives. Effects are disclosed by tracking the following indicators: changes to the wilderness
attributes of the unroaded areas, specifically:
•
•
•

•
•

Natural – The extent to which long-term ecological processes are intact and
operating;
Undeveloped – The degree to which the impacts documented in natural integrity
are apparent to most visitors;
Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation –
Solitude is a personal, subjective value defined as the isolation from sights, sounds
and presence of others and from developments and evidence of humans. Primitive
recreation is characterized by meeting nature on its own terms, without comfort
and convenience of facilities;
Special features and values – Unique ecological, geological, scenic and historical
features of an area; and
Manageability – The ability to manage an area for wilderness consideration and
maintain wilderness attributes.

There are no thresholds of significance for any of the indicators because there are no pertinent laws or
Forest Plan standards that place any absolute threshold on effects to otherwise undesignated unroaded
areas. It is, however, important for the decision-maker and the public to be aware of the potential for
changes in the indicators. Also, the effects analysis was prepared with the premise that mitigations
identified in Chapter Two would be implemented.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives
Under all action alternatives, impacts to wilderness attributes 1 through 3 (Natural, Undeveloped and
Remoteness/Solitude) would occur during the timeframes when open motorized routes are being
traveled on. The effects to Natural and Undeveloped in particular would persist in the long-term as well,
perhaps 50 years. This effects analysis focuses on assessing effects to the unroaded resource following
implementation of the selected alternative.

Alternative 1 - No Action
The No Action Alternative would leave the current unroaded character unchanged from the descriptions
presented in the Affected Environment section.

Alternative 2
Nevada Mountain IRA and contiguous unroaded lands (Left Hand Fork
Cottonwood Gulch)
The portion of the Nevada Mountain IRA that is being analyzed in this report is approximately 8,435
acres in extent. When combined with the approximate 480 acre Left Hand Fork Cottonwood Gulch
contiguous unroaded area, the area encompasses approximately 8,915 acres. The contiguous unroaded
area is approximately one mile south of the Forest boundary.

Divide Travel Plan

Road 4044-E1 could reduce the apparent naturalness of this part of the IRA during the winter – visually
from the tracks. Over-snow motorized vehicles could temporarily change the natural characteristics of
the area from the visual appearance of snowmobile tracks. However, it should not change the physical
characteristics. This would provide an additional 1.7 miles of road available to over-snow motorized
vehicles. However, at the same time, acres available to over-snow motorized vehicles would be reduced
by approximately 1,005. This would occur in the southwest part of the IRA, adjacent to the private land
boundary. This decrease in acres would improve the natural integrity of the IRA. Therefore, in regards to
over-snow motorized vehicles, the newly available route #4044-E1 would provide access into the IRA,
but at the same time the number of acres available to this type of use would be reduced.
In regards to Road #136-D1, the reduction in the numbers of motorized vehicles would enhance the
naturalness of the IRA. However, the presence of over-snow motorized vehicles could reduce the
natural integrity of the area during the winter.
In addition, trail #136-007 would be open to motorized vehicles 50 inches or less in width with no
seasonal restrictions. This could increase use along the southern part of the IRA, thereby reducing the
naturalness of the area.
Increased use of motorized vehicles also poses an indirect risk of noxious weed establishment. While
Alternative 2 would potentially prevent and/or address this problem, invasive species would
compromise the natural integrity of the area. Please refer also to the noxious weed specialist report for
this project.
The approximate 480 additional acres landscape in a natural appearance would directly serve to
enhance this quality within the adjacent Nevada Mountain IRA. However, indirectly, the additional
potential for increased access into the area via over-snow motorized vehicles could reduce this quality.

Undeveloped
While route #4044-E1 would provide over-snow motorized vehicle access into the IRA, the number of
acres available to this type of use would be reduced. The undeveloped character would remain the
same.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
As noted in the discussion of the Nevada Mountain IRA, the IRA perimeter offers a somewhat reduced
opportunity for a primitive experience. The contiguous unroaded area abuts and extends the perimeter
of the IRA. Access into the IRA on existing routes would not be changed. However, access into the IRA
via over-snow motorized vehicles would be enhanced. This use could greatly reduce the opportunities
for solitude. While at the same time, the number of acres available to over-snow motorized vehicles
would be reduced, thereby possibly increasing the opportunities for solitude. Therefore, the overall
change to the opportunities for solitude would be negligible.

Special Features and Values
A portion of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) is located within the Nevada Mountain
IRA. The closure of 2.5 miles of Road # 136-D1 to wheeled motorized vehicles may enhance the special
values associated with this nationally designated trail.

Manageability
The contiguous unroaded area adjacent to the Nevada Mountain IRA does not have any additional
readily identifiable topographic features. It does not lend itself to management as wilderness. It could

be considered for management as an extension of the Nevada Mountain IRA, though this would not be
consistent with the Forest Plan management direction for the area.
Because this unroaded area does not meet the criteria for potential wilderness designation, alternative
2 would not reduce the existing capability of this area’s suitability for wilderness recommendation. In
other words, neither this unroaded area nor the portions of the adjacent inventoried roadless area
indirectly affected by the activities are considered suitable for future wilderness designation and both
would remain unsuitable after project implementation.

the past. Because of the decrease in availability of authorized trails in other areas on the Forest, use on
the trail could increase. This increase would affect the natural integrity of the IRA and the contiguous
unroaded area.
Increased use of motorized vehicles also poses an indirect risk of noxious weed establishment. While
alternative 4 would potentially prevent and/or address this problem, invasive species would
compromise the natural integrity of the area. Please refer also to the noxious weed specialist report for

In addition, converting the unauthorized trail to one available to motorized vehicles 50 inches or less in
width (seasonally) could reduce the opportunity for solitude. Although the trail isn’t located within the

Special Features and Values
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail passes through the west side of this IRA. There are no
changes proposed to the CDNST. The area is comprised of forested slopes similar to many other areas
on the Helena Ranger District, so there would be no effect from implementation of alternative 4 on this
portion of wilderness criteria.

Manageability
Because much of this IRA is already bordered by roads, private lands and trails, the proposed changes
under alternative 4 would not affect the manageability of the IRA.

available to over-snow motorized vehicles. Therefore, the effects to the apparent naturalness would not
change.

Undeveloped
Because there would be no physical changes to the landscape, the undeveloped character would remain

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
The reduced presence of highway and wheeled vehicles due to fewer miles of wheeled motorized routes
would enhance the opportunities for solitude in the IRA. Since the number of acres available to oversnow motorized vehicles would remain the same, the impacts from those types of vehicles would not
change.

Special Features and Values
Access into the Electric Peak IRA for over-snow motorized vehicles would not change.
There are no changes proposed to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.
The area is comprised of forested slopes similar to many other areas on the Helena Ranger District, so
there would be no effect from implementation of alternative 4 on this portion of wilderness criteria.

Manageability
The majority of this IRA in the project boundary is bordered by roads and topographic features. The
proposed changes under alternative 4 would not affect the manageability of the IRA.

Access into the southeast part of the IRA via route #774 would remain the same.
Access into the contiguous unroaded does not currently exist and would not change under alternative 5.

Natural
The direct effects of alternative 5 would be very similar to alternative 2, with the exception of the
change of 136-007 from an unauthorized trail to a trail (with seasonal restrictions) open to motorized
vehicles 50 inches or less in width. During the open season, this trail would see increased use, as
compared to the past. Because of the decrease in availability of authorized trails in other areas on the
Forest, use on the trail could increase. This increase would affect the natural integrity of the IRA and the
contiguous unroaded area.
Increased use of motorized vehicles also poses an indirect risk of noxious weed establishment. While
alternative 5 would potentially prevent and/or address this problem, invasive species would
compromise the natural integrity of the area. Please refer also to the noxious weed specialist report for
this project which can be found in the project file.

Undeveloped
Physical changes to the landscape would include the development of the unauthorized trail to an
authorized trail. This would include disturbing the trail/road bed, making it usable for motorized vehicles
50 inches or less in width. Therefore, the undeveloped character would be slightly reduced.

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
As noted in the discussion of the Nevada Mountain IRA, the IRA perimeter offers a somewhat reduced
opportunity for a primitive experience. The contiguous unroaded area abuts and extends the perimeter
of the IRA. Access into the IRA on existing routes and via over-snow motorized vehicles would be similar
to alternative 2.
In addition, converting the unauthorized trail to one available to motorized vehicles 50 inches or less in
width (seasonally) could reduce the opportunity for solitude. Although the trail isn’t located within the
IRA, it is adjacent to the southern border and those individuals looking for solitude in that portion of the
IRA could be affected by the additional presence and noise of motorized vehicles.

Special Features and Values
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) is located within the Nevada Mountain IRA. The
closure of 2.5 miles of Road # 136-D1 to wheeled motorized vehicles may enhance the special values
associated with this nationally designated trail.

Manageability
The contiguous unroaded area adjacent to the Nevada Mountain IRA does not have any additional
readily identifiable topographic features. It does not lend itself to management as wilderness. It could
be considered an extension of the Nevada Mountain IRA, though this would not be consistent with the
Forest Plan management direction for the area.
Because this unroaded area does not meet the criteria for potential wilderness designation, alternative
5 would not reduce the existing capability of this area’s suitability for wilderness recommendation. In
other words, neither this unroaded area nor the portions of the adjacent inventoried roadless area
indirectly affected by the activities are considered suitable for future wilderness designation and both
would remain unsuitable after project implementation.

Because there would be no physical changes to the landscape, the undeveloped character would remain

Outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive unconfined recreation
The increased access to the area by Roads 1017 and 1016, although they are outside the IRA, provide
increased motorized access to the IRA perimeter which could result in a reduced sense of solitude in the
northern portion of this IRA. The closure of Road 527-B1, would reduce the presence of highway and
wheeled vehicles within the IRA boundary itself, due to fewer miles of wheeled motorized routes would
enhance the opportunities for solitude in the IRA the further one moved into the interior of the IRA. In
addition, the reduction in acres open to over-snow motorized vehicles would add to the opportunities
for solitude.

Manageability
The majority of this IRA in the project boundary is bordered by roads and topographic features. The
proposed changes under alternative 5 would not affect the manageability of the IRA.

Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects in the Divide Travel Plan area include past, present and reasonably foreseeable
actions. The cumulative effects analysis area boundary for the unroaded analysis is the same as the
project area boundary.
The activities proposed by all of the action alternatives are not consumptive. Roads and trails are being
proposed for opening/closing, along with timing restrictions. None of the actions are ground disturbing.
As described below, the effects would be common to all of the action alternatives.
None of the alternatives would directly affect the roadless character of the four IRAs and the one
identified contiguous unroaded area. Under the action alternatives, the feeling of naturalness and sense
of solitude could be affected. However, cumulatively, these effects are expected to be short-term. In the
long-term, Forest Plan standards would still be met.

Livestock grazing
Grazing affects wilderness character by the presence of structures used to manage the livestock – gates,
fences and water improvements. The presence of livestock also affects the characteristics of remoteness
and solitude. In addition, as a result of the grazing, landscapes may appear to have shorter grasses.
However, overall, these impacts would have minimal effects to the wilderness characteristics of the
IRA’s.

Noxious Weed Treatments
Noxious weeds are typically treated along roads using mechanized equipment. Hand treatments can
occur in patches that are off the roads. Livestock and biological agents may also be used. The presence
of mechanized equipment and livestock could affect a user’s sense of remoteness and solitude. Using
hand treatments and biological agents would have a minimal effect. The sight of dead weeds, regardless
of treatment type, may also affect ones sense of remoteness and solitude. However, overall, these
effects would have minimal impacts to the wilderness characteristics of the IRAs.

Hazard Tree Removal
Roadside hazard tree removal would open the road corridor, visually making the road(s) more visible
from within and around the IRAs. The sights and sounds of the mechanized equipment used during
operations could also have a short-term impact. These could affect the sense of naturalness and
solitude. Over time, as the vegetation grows back and fills in this space, the effects would lessen.
Hazard tree removal in existing developed recreation sites would also visually change the areas. As with
roadside hazard tree removal, this could affect ones sense of solitude and remoteness. However, while
these sites may be within sight of an IRA, the effects would be minimal and over time as the vegetation
grows and fills in these areas, the effects would be even less.

UNROADED and ROADLESS - 105

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Road Maintenance
There are numerous roads within and adjacent to the IRAs. Periodic road maintenance activities would
not change the roads or add to them. The sight and sound of equipment when maintenance activities
occur may indirectly affect ones sense of solitude or remoteness. However, these effects are short-term
and overall; the wilderness character would not be affected by these activities.

Trail Maintenance/Reconstruction
Routine maintenance and reconstruction of non-motorized and motorized trails could incorporate the
use of mechanized equipment and hand tools. This could indirectly affect ones sense of solitude and
naturalness. At the same time, these trails are often considered to be the unique features found in the
IRAs and often used to access the IRAs. Overall, these effects would be short-term and would have
minimal impacts to the wilderness characteristics.

Private Timber Harvest
Private timber harvest on lands within sight distance of IRAs would further reduce the natural integrity
and feelings of solitude and remoteness. Private harvest has occurred in the past within the Jericho
Mountain IRA. The harvest activities including the associated hauling would have had an impact to the
natural integrity and sense of solitude and remoteness. These characteristics have since improved over
the past 15+years due to re-vegetation.

Private Roads/Special Use Permit Roads
There are several private roads/special use permit roads in the Lazyman Gulch and Jericho Mountain
IRAs due to private lands and mining claims. The presence of these roads already affects the naturalness
and solitude of the IRAs. When combined with the actions proposed in any of the alternatives, the
effects would have a minimal impact to the overall wilderness characteristics of the IRAs.

Divide Travel Plan

Alternative 1 would not alter the existing conditions of the four IRAs and the one contiguous unroaded
area.
All the action alternatives would improve the five wilderness characteristics of the unroaded areas in
some of the IRAs. Reducing the number of acres open to over-snow motorized vehicles and the number
of miles of wheeled motorized routes would improve the perception of natural integrity, undeveloped
characteristics, opportunities for solitude and special features. The manageability of the areas would not
substantially change because of the existing roads, private lands, mining claims and topography.
However, alternative 3 would reduce the number of wheeled motorized routes within the IRAs more
than any of the other alternatives – including alternative 1. In summary, all of the action alternatives
would improve the overall roadless character of unroaded lands.

Forest Plan Consistency
As previously stated, the Divide Travel Plan area was assigned management area designations which
allow for wheeled motorized routes and over-snow motorized vehicles. All alternatives are consistent
with the Forest Plan in this regard. All alternatives are consistent with Forest Plan forestwide and
management area standards. All effects were found to be consistent with Forest Plan standards and
would not harm or erode the identified wilderness characteristics of these unroaded areas.
This analysis would also be consistent with the 2001 Roadless Rule in that it does not propose or
authorize the construction or reconstruction of roads within designated IRAs. The analysis only
evaluates the opportunities to designate existing routes for motorized travel.

TRANSPORTATION
Regulatory Framework
Transportation management regulations for the National Forest System are located in the 36 Code of
Federal Regulations parts 212 (forest transportation system) and 261 (use of motor vehicles off forest
roads). Management policy direction and guidelines are contained in Forest Service Manuals (FSM) and
Handbooks (FSH), including FSM 7700 (transportation system) and FSH 7709 (transportation).
Management direction specific to the Helena National Forest is also provided by the 1986 Helena Forest
Plan.

Assumptions
The transportation system in the Divide Travel Planning Area has evolved from a variety of past activities
including mining, logging, grazing and recreational use. Over the past 30 years the majority of new road
construction has been driven by timber harvest. It is assumed that these activities will continue to
shape the transportation system with recreation, commercial and administrative uses being the primary
drivers for change.
It is assumed that the use of the transportation system will trend upward. There are no firm numbers to
confirm this trend, but personal observations, comments by forest users and adjacent landowners as
well as the increasing population in the area indicate that use will increase. It is also assumed that
maintenance on the transportation system would continue to lag behind needs.
Very little new road construction is anticipated in the future. Any new construction would be completed
using current design practices in compliance with the National BMP standards (2012).

Management Activities: Past management activities within the analysis area such as timber and grazing
management, fire and watershed restoration, drainage improvements and bridge replacement efforts
have affected the transportation system in the short term by temporarily closing a section of road for
several days or weeks. Upon opening the roads, the effects disappeared immediately. Management
activities would continue, as they have in the past and are projected to be the same for all alternatives.
Motorized Mixed Use: Motorized mixed use is defined as designation of a NFS road for use by both
highway-legal and non-highway-legal motor vehicles. Designating NFS roads for motorized mixed use
requires an engineering analysis and must be completed by a qualified engineer. The assumption is
made that engineering analysis of roads in the analysis for the purposes of addressing motorized mixed
use would be completed on a case by case basis upon completion of the planning process and
implemented over time.
Completed Travel Plans-Several Travel Plans on nearby/adjacent Forests have been completed, reducing
motorized travel. These would potentially impact use of the Divide Travel Planning Area as visitors
modify how and where they use the forest and adjacent areas.
Any action resulting from the implementation of any alternative selected would be fully implemented.

Information Used
The roads and trails in the Divide Travel Planning Area are identified on a GIS spatial layer. Information
about the system roads and trails is stored in a database that is linked to the spatial layer. Non-system
roads and trails have basic information stored in a data table linked to the spatial layer.

In this report the description “unauthorized” road or route is equivalent to “non-system” route in INFRA.
Much of the information presented in this analysis comes directly from field examination of the planning
area and the surrounding region.

Roads Analysis Process (RAP)
The Helena NF Roads Analysis Process divided all of the roads in the area into nine categories
(combinations of high, medium or low value and high, medium or low concern). A map showing the
roads by category for the Divide Travel Planning Area is in the roads analysis document (Final, August
2004). In addition to categorizing the roads in the Divide area, the Roads Analysis Process identified a
minimal roads system necessary for Helena National Forest operation. The minimal roads system
identifies the roads necessary to meet the agency mission of protecting resources, providing adequate
access for the public while considering impacts on global climate change. One aspect of the Divide
travel planning process is to verify the information in the Roads Analysis Process as well as determine
appropriate long-term management of undetermined and user created routes that may not have been
identified during the Roads Analysis Process. Necessary changes to the minimum roads system were
made in conjunction with the additional analysis completed as part of this travel planning effort.
The roads analysis recommends that roads rated low value-high concern (LVHC) be removed from the
road system. There are two roads in this area that were classified in the roads analysis as LVHC – Road
527-C1 and road 4044 E-1.

Methodology and Scientific Accuracy
The transportation system existing condition was developed using transportation planning data from the
sources listed previously. This data was used to evaluate the effects of each alternative. Information in
the roads inventory is constantly being updated and corrected. All mileages in this report are
approximate.
Alternatives were evaluated on the following basis:
•

•
•

Transportation System - how the alternative changes the open transportation system
and ability to conduct maintenance, including management of unauthorized (nonsystem) roads.
Road Conditions - how the alternative affects conditions on the roads and trails.
Enforcement issues - complexity of travel maps due to seasonal closures and vehicle
types, areas of enforcement problems and conflicts between uses and the differences
between the alternatives.

Transportation, Affected Environment
Introduction
The Divide Travel Planning Area is accessed by an extensive road and trail system. Most of the early
roads were developed primarily for mining and grazing activities. Many of these roads were first used in
the mid-1800’s as wagon roads and then improved in the early 1900’s to accommodate motorized
vehicles. Since the 1950’s, roads have been built to access forest stands for commercial timber sales.
These roads have been built to a higher standard than the old mining and grazing roads. The road
system now consists of a mixture of old and new roads, with many of the older roads in disrepair. See
the Heritage Resources Specialists Report for more detailed information regarding historical
development of the areas road and trail network.

Analysis Area
The analysis area is presented both in terms of the condition of the transportation system as well as
specifics as they relate to certain geographic areas within the Divide Travel Planning Area.

Transportation System
The majority of the roads are single-lane, native surface roads. Within the analysis area, there are roads
under the jurisdiction of counties, the State, private landowners and the Forest Service. These roads are
included as part of the analysis and on the maps where they are the connectors between other primary
forest roads.

Road Maintenance
Road maintenance is performed annually on the main county/state and NFSR’s and sporadically on all of
the other roads. Some of the roads are in poor locations (i.e. narrow canyon bottoms which increase
both maintenance needs and the risk that sediment from the road surface could enter adjacent
streams). Many of the local and collector roads in the area receive little maintenance.

Maintenance Level
There are five levels of maintenance identified by the Forest Service on National Forest System Roads
(NFSR).
•

•
•

•

•

Maintenance Level 1 These are roads that have been placed in storage between
intermittent uses. The period of storage must exceed one year. Basic custodial
maintenance is performed to prevent damage to adjacent resources and to perpetuate
the road for future resource management needs.
Maintenance Level 2 Assigned to roads open for use by high clearance vehicles.
Passenger car traffic, user comfort and user convenience are not considerations.
Maintenance Level 3 Assigned to roads open and maintained for travel by a prudent
driver in a standard passenger car. User comfort and convenience are not considered
priorities.
Maintenance Level 4 Assigned to roads that provide a moderate degree of user comfort
and convenience at moderate speeds. Most roads are double lane and aggregate
surfaced. However, some roads may be single lane.
Maintenance Level 5 Assigned to roads that provide a high degree of user comfort and
convenience. These roads are normally double lane, paved facilities. Some may be
aggregate surfaced and dust abated.

Many of the roads in the Divide Travel Planning Area lie in and out of private jurisdiction. In many cases
where the private land intersects National Forest land the assigned maintenance level is carried through
uninterrupted in the database. That may or may not be accurate in all cases. ROW information is
currently being reviewed.
In the Divide area there are approximately 36 miles of maintenance level 4 roads maintained by the
Forest Service and one maintenance level 5 road which is located in a campground. Maintenance level 4
roads on the forest include the Ten Mile road, Little Blackfoot, Priest Pass, Elliston-Spotted Dog, Frontier
Town and Moose Creek campground and McDonald Pass Vista. There are approximately 87 miles of
maintenance level 3 roads, which include Snowshoe, Greenhorn Mountain, Dog Creek, Banner Creek
and Clarks Canyon. There are approximately 209 miles of maintenance level 2 roads in the project area.

Functional Class
The roads are divided by Functional Class where an arterial road is a high capacity forest road that is
used to deliver traffic to and from collector roads throughout the national forest, a collector road is a
road that is used to deliver traffic to and from local roads to arterial roads and local roads are low
capacity roads that carry low volumes of traffic to and from collector roads. The miles of roads by
Functional Class in the Divide Travel Planning Area are as follows:
•
•
•

Arterial- Road 218-Ten Mile Road is classified as an arterial (6.759 Miles)
Collector - Approximately 213.87 miles are classified as collector roads
Local - Approximately 363 miles are classified as local.

Unauthorized Roads
There were approximately 16 miles of non-system roads in the Divide Travel Planning Area identified by
the interdisciplinary team or by permittees and other users during collaborative field review activities in
2008. Most of the routes identified were made by full size vehicles. Many of these routes originate
from private land and therefore are not accessible to forest users. As part of the travel planning process
these roads are being considered for inclusion in the National Forest System of Roads. Those roads and
corresponding proposed travel restrictions are identified in Table 4 of the Transportation specialist
report.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
The CDNST is a route within this travel planning area made up of a combination of both motorized and
non-motorized routes. A map showing how the CDNST lays on the land is located in the map packet and
a table describing the alternatives is included in the recreation section of this chapter.

Road Closures
Since adoption of the Helena Forest Plan in 1986, roads have been closed across the forest and in the
Divide area for a variety of reasons. Closures are often with gates but have also been done by
contouring, barrier placement and ripping/seeding. Currently, many National Forest System roads
(NFSR) in the Divide areas are closed yearlong (about 126 miles) to wheeled motorized vehicles. These
closures have occurred in the past 25 years almost entirely associated with timber harvest. Other NFS
roads in the area are closed to motor vehicle use for at least a portion of the year. These seasonal
closures are either spring closures to protect the road surface from rutting during the wet time of the
year, or hunting season closures to provide big game security. With the adoption of the Multi-State OHV
decision in 2001, wheeled motorized vehicles are restricted to existing roads and trails within the
analysis area.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Road Conditions
Road conditions vary across the analysis area with many factors influencing road surfaces including
amount of use, type of use, maintenance level, type of surface and weather. Forestwide maintenance
plans are developed annually and maintenance funding applied in accordance with targets assigned and
other priorities set by engineering and line officers. Level of Service (formally referred to as Traffic
Service Levels) for the analysis area are adequate for the amount of traffic occurring and are expected to
continue to provide adequate service into the future, accounting for area population growth and
potential displacement. Levels of Service are evaluated and adjusted as necessary as part of normal
management activities. Maintenance is performed in accordance with the Forest Annual Maintenance
Plan which is reviewed annually. All action alternatives propose for an increase in the number of road
miles to be closed. It is assumed that the current maintenance and reconstruction activities would
continue as they have in the recent past and in accordance with management direction. Project specific
work as well as partnerships would continue to provide opportunities for additional road maintenance
and improvements.

Enforcement
User compliance of Forest regulations on roads and trails is generally related to the level of user
understanding of the sign system and available maps. The Helena National Forest has identified that the
complexity of its current visitor use map is high, resulting in confusion for forest users and violations of
regulations.
Specific travel plan related law enforcement issues include off road use by OHVs and full size vehicles,
woodcutting road proliferation, dropping bug kill logs within the road prism and leaving limbs causing
drainage problems, youth party areas, garbage and damage to sites. Off route use and woodcutting
road proliferation are the more problematic issues tied to travel planning.

Specific Geographic Areas within the Divide Planning Area
The analysis area is also presented in four distinct geographic areas, with specifics pertaining to
each area. The areas are:
•
•
•
•

Area 1 - Northwest-Dog Creek-Ophir Cave Area
Area 2 - North Central-Sweeny Creek Area
Area 3 - Southwest – Kading Area-West of Telegraph Road
Area 4 - Southeast-Banner-Rimini Area- East of Telegraph Road

Northwest-Dog Creek-Ophir Cave Area
Transportation System
The main road through the west side of Area 1 is National Forest System Road (NFSR) 136 Ophir Cave.
This is a maintenance level 3 road that is open with no restrictions. There are many spur roads along
Ophir Cave road that are closed year-long. These spur roads were originally constructed for timber
harvest. Ophir Cave road also provides access to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) as
well as private land.
The primary road on the east side of Area 1 is NFSR 1855, Dog Creek Road, which is also a maintenance
level 3 road. The majority of the roads in the Dog Creek Area are open with no restrictions; however,
many of the roads in this area that cross private land do not have easements in place. The Dog Creek
road and spurs also provide access to the CDNST and private land within the National Forest boundary.

TRANSPORTATION - 112

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Road Conditions
The majority of the open and closed roads in Area 1 are in adequate surface and drainage condition.
Most of the road miles in this area are single lane with turnouts. The road locations are generally good
and the roads were designed with drainage features.

Enforcement
There are no major enforcement problems in the Ophir Cave-Dog Creek Area. There is evidence of
OHV/pickup use on some closed roads and trails, but few user created routes have been observed in this
area.

North Central-Sweeny Creek Area
Transportation System
NFSR 335-Priest Pass Road provides access to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. There are
unauthorized roads in this area. Road 1860 Sweeny Creek Road crosses a small section of private land.
There is a Forest Service easement in place for this area.

Road Conditions
With the exception of Road 335-Priest Pass (a maintenance level 4 road) and the maintenance level 3
road 1898 Gravel Pit Road (access to the shooting range), the open roads in this area are maintenance
level 2. The roads in this area were constructed with drainage features. Most of the road miles in this
area are single lane with turnouts.

Enforcement
The major law enforcement issue in this area is wood cutting. There has been an increase of
woodcutters in this area dropping trees within the road prism due to the prevalence of dead and dying
trees.

Southwest – Kading Area-West of Telegraph Road
Transportation System
The Kading area has an extensive system of roads with the primary roads being NFSR 1870-Baldy Ridge
(ML 2), 227-Little Blackfoot (ML 4) and 495-Telegraph (ML 3). These roads access the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail as well as a system of non-motorized trails in the Little Blackfoot Meadows area.
All three of the main roads travel in and out of private and county jurisdiction. The first 3.96 miles of
NFSR 227 and the first 2.305 miles of NFSR 495 are county jurisdiction, maintained by Lewis and Clark
County. The majority of the roads passing through private land in this area do not have easements in
place. In addition, there are several spur roads that were built for timber harvest that are closed year
round.

Road Conditions
The primary roads in this area are in good condition.

Enforcement
There is a significant amount of dispersed camping in this area. There is evidence of minor OHV/pickup
use on some closed roads and trails. Few user created routes have been observed in this area.

TRANSPORTATION - 113

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Southeast-Banner Creek-Rimini Area- East of Telegraph Road
Transportation System
In the Banner Creek-Rimini area the primary roads are 495-Telegraph and County Road 695- Rimini
Road. These roads access the Rimini town site and multiple active and abandoned mine sites on the
forest. The majority of the roads in this area are open with no restrictions. Spurs off Road 495 provide
access to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST).

Road Conditions
The primary roads in this area are in good condition. The Rimini road is maintained by Lewis & Clark
County. The roads are constructed with drainage features and are maintained through a maintenance
program.

Enforcement
There is a considerable amount of dispersed camping that takes place in this area with resource damage
becoming more significant over time. There is evidence of minor OHV/pickup use on some closed roads
and trails, but few user created routes have been observed in this area.

Transportation, Environmental Consequences
Alternatives were evaluated on the following basis:
•

•
•

Transportation System - how the alternative changes the open transportation system
and ability to conduct maintenance, including management of unauthorized (nonsystem) roads.
Road Conditions – whether or not the alternative affects road/trail conditions.
Enforcement issues - complexity of travel maps due to seasonal closures and vehicle
types, areas of enforcement problems and conflicts between uses and the differences
between the alternatives.

Effects Common to All Alternatives
Road Use Trends
Past travel management decisions in the surrounding National Forest areas have closed many roads and
trails on public land to motorized vehicles. The road and trail closures in the Elkhorn Mountains, North
Belts and in surrounding National Forest have resulted in an increase in some non-local users including
Gallatin and Lewis and Clark counties using the Divide area of the Helena National Forest for
recreational purposes. In addition, the increase in local populations and enhanced dependability of
trucks and other OHV’s has also resulted in increased use on the roads and trails in this area, but at this
time, the traffic increase has not adversely affected the traffic service levels on any of the forest roads
or trails. Traffic use tends to be higher during summer holiday weekends and around the opening of big
game rifle season. The Multi-State OHV Decision of 2001 restricted wheeled motorized vehicles to
existing roads and trails. This decision did not affect the traffic service levels in the planning area.
Past management activities within the Divide area such as timber and grazing management, fire and
watershed restoration efforts have affected the transportation system in the short term by temporarily
closing a section of road for several days or weeks. Upon opening the roads, the effects disappeared
immediately. Some roads in the Divide area have been closed as mitigation for timber sales, but since
TRANSPORTATION - 114

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

there are alternate routes to most of the areas accessed by the closed roads, the loss of public access to
National Forest Land has been limited.
None of the routes are currently operating near capacity. There are several factors that could result in
an increase in road use in the Divide area. For example:
•

•

The Divide area is easily accessible. An increase in use may eventually trigger a need for
a higher traffic service level on some roads attributed to continued population growth in
the Helena area.
Closures resulting from planning efforts on other parts of the Helena National Forest
may shift some traffic to the Divide area.

Right of Way Concerns-common to all alternatives: In all alternatives, there are roads and trails
identified as travel routes that cross private land where there is no recorded easement. To ensure that
these routes remain open to both administrative and public use, easements would need to be obtained
from the appropriate parties. Efforts are ongoing in this area.
Ensure access for future resource management including vegetation management and roads as an
investment in meeting resource management objectives: In all alternatives there are few changes
proposed to any of the main roads leaving intact a road system that accesses every area of the forest. All
alternatives provide for adequate future vegetation management therefore this is not discussed by
alternative.
Motorized Mixed-Use - None of the alternatives provide for Mixed Motorized-Use on NFSR for Off
Highway Vehicles (OHV) that are not street legal. Motorized Mixed-Use requires an engineering
evaluation and recommendation, not an environmental evaluation (NEPA). Motorized Mixed-Use
evaluations would be conducted following the project decision and would occur incrementally.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives
Transportation System-Effects common to all action alternatives- Alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5 increase the
number of miles that are closed, increase the over-snow opportunities and provide clarification
regarding currently unclassified routes.
Road Conditions – common to all action alternatives: in all action alternatives it is expected that the
condition of open roads will gradually improve due to the increase in closures in Alternatives 2, 3, 4 and
5.
Off Route Travel – is clarified in all action alternatives.

Alternative 1, No Action
Transportation System Description – Alternative 1
System Roads-Under the no action alternative there would continue to be approximately 313 miles of
road open to highway legal vehicles either year-round or seasonally.

Closures – Alternative 1
Spring closures would continue to occur resulting in road closures being in place until as late as June 1st
regardless of road conditions. Table 37 for specific information regarding numbers of miles closed in
this alternative. Specific route management in key areas is as follows:
•
•

•
•

Designated Routes in parts of Area 1 near the Sweeny Creek area would be open year
long.
Routes in parts of Area 3 near the Limburger Spring/Kading area are open to over-snow
motorized vehicles from December 1st to October 14th. Routes 314, 314-J3 and 314-J1
(Area 3) have seasonal restrictions.
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) – Routes 1802-B2 (Area 4) and 136-D1
(Area 1) are open to motorized use year-long.
Hunting Season Access – Routes 335-A1 and A2 (Area 2), 1856 (Area 4) and 314-J3 (Area
3) are closed year-long to wheeled vehicles.

Winter Closures – Alternative 1
There are seasonal closures for over-snow use on roads in areas such as the Telegraph, Mullan Pass and
the Microwave area.
There is a winter closure from October 15th to December 2nd for the Limburger Springs/Spotted Dog
Area. The Little Blackfoot area has a seasonal closure of October 15th to December 2nd for everything
south of the Little Blackfoot Road and west of the Ontario Creek Road.

Unauthorized Roads – Alternative 1
Under Alternative 1 there are 16 miles of road that are unauthorized and open year-round to highway
legal vehicles. Non-system routes in Alternative 1 would keep their current status as open to travel in
accordance with the 2001 Tri-State OHV environmental impact statement for Montana, North Dakota
and South Dakota. Exclusive access across forest routes to access private land would continue under a
special use agreement. Creation of new unauthorized routes would likely occur at a low rate with
violators subject to citation. New unauthorized routes would be considered closed.

Off Route Travel – Alternative 1
Off Route travel would continue to be allowed as established in the 2001 Tri-State OHV environmental
impact statement for Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.

MVUM Production – Alternative 1
No MVUM would be produced as part of this alternative.

Road Conditions – Alternative 1
Most routes are in fair to good condition with some individual routes in poor condition. Trends for
future maintenance dollars do not show significant change from the current amount, however, future
proposed projects may provide additional opportunities for road improvements.

Enforcement/Complexity – Alternative 1
Travel management for this alternative is moderately complex. There are several restriction codes
governing the use of the roads and trails in this area and in many instances all existing roads and trails
are open to motorized vehicles, including unauthorized routes, based on the 2001 Tri-State OHV
Decision. Effective enforcement of the existing travel plan is difficult due to complexity of closure types
and lack of a site specific road-trail decision.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments – Alternative 1
There are no irreversible and irretrievable commitments associated with alternative 1.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 1
The general cumulative effects are listed in the section Effects Common to All Alternatives. Specific
cumulative effects include the slow natural reclamation process of roads that see infrequent use or are
closed. While natural reclamation would likely occur over time the road prism would remain on the
landscape. Roads that are unauthorized may not meet current design standards and could possibly
contribute to resource damage over time. Off-road use would continue at the current rate as allowed
for under the 2001 Tri-State OHV rule with the option available to put in place closures to minimize
resource damage as necessary.
The cumulative effects of this project in relation to the Cumulative Effects table “Past, Present and
Reasonably Foreseeable Projects within or Near the Divide Travel Boundary” are projected to be as
follows:

TRANSPORTATION - 118

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The Divide area is currently being managed for the removal of Hazard Trees. This
involves removal of beetle killed trees within one and one-half tree length along the
major roads as well as along some of the spur roads throughout the project area.
The foreseeable action to improve the Ten Mile Complex roads (including Rimini Road)
could potentially result in an increase in cumulative effects in this area because an
improvement to the condition of the roads will result in an increase in traffic to this
area.

Summary of Effects – Alternative 1
The number of miles of roads as well as road conditions would remain unchanged in alternative 1.
Maintenance would continue in accordance with the forest maintenance plan. Additional maintenance
opportunities would continue to be capitalized on through the development of other projects in the
analysis area and through partnership activities. No MVUM would be produced. This would potentially
increase maintenance needs because roads that would be designated as open but were not originally
designed using the National best management practice standards (2012) would require some degree of
maintenance to address environmental concerns and bring them up to current design standards.
Enforcement would continue to be complicated with a number of miles of short, dead end roads staying
open and therefore requiring attention as part of the patrolled area. This alternative meets the purpose
and need from the perspective that it continues to provide a manageable transportation system and
access to the national forest. It does, however; leave a number of miles of the road template on the
ground not considered necessary for the management of the national forest.
Off-road vehicle travel would continue to occur within 300 feet of the designated route as allowed for in
the 2001 Tri-State OHV decision. The potential impacts of this would be greater than that of any of the
action alternatives because there are a greater number of roads that would continue to be open for
public use. Parking safely next to the side of a road within 30 feet from the edge of the road is also
permitted as part of alternative 1.

Alternative 2
The biggest change from alternative 1 to alternative 2 is the substantial reduction in the number of
roads that are closed year long. Most of the roads that would be closed yearlong are classified as open
to over-snow vehicles use during the winter in alternative 2 but are closed to all other motorized
vehicles. Motor vehicle use maps that identify routes and designations for motorized use within the
planning area would be available to the public.
The roads analysis recommends that roads rated low value-high concern (LVHC) be removed from the
road system. Road 4044-E1 would remain closed in Alternative 2.

Alternative 2 - Closures
Spring closures would be implemented as needed rather than the current closures until June 1st. The
public would be informed by signage and information published by the Forest. Alternative 2 has a
significant increase in the number of roads open for over-snow vehicle use when compared to
Alternative 1. Under Alternative 1, the area on either side of the closed road prism is open to crosscountry over-snow motorized vehicle travel. Alternative 2 identifies these roads as open for over-snow
motorized vehicles to be consistent with the designated use of the surrounding landscape. All other
motorized use would continue to be restricted from routes when groomed. The majority of these roads
are located north of route 136 in the upper northwest corner of the project area.

Winter Use – Additional winter closures in the Sweeny Creek and Hahn Creek areas (Area 4), as well
as lower elevation west facing slopes Clarks Canyon north to Threemile Creek (Area 2). Those areas that
remain open have a season of December 2nd to May 15th for over-snow motorized vehicle travel.
Unauthorized Routes – Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would incorporate approximately 10 of the 16 miles of non-system routes into the forest’s
system of roads and trails. These roads will be assigned travel management codes. The remaining roads
would continue to be classified as closed non-system roads. Table 40 for general information and Table
4 of the transportation specialist report for specific information, which can be found in the project file.

MVUM – Alternative 2
An MVUM would be produced as part of this alternative.

Road Conditions – Alternative 2
Most routes are in fair to good condition with some individual routes in poor condition. There are four
roads that cross live streams. Under this alternative these fords would be closed until suitable crossings
are in place. Trends for future maintenance dollars do not show significant change in the current dollar
amounts being allocated; however, future proposed projects within the planning area may provide
additional opportunities for road improvements.

Enforcement/Complexity – Alternative 2
The enforcement for this alternative will be slightly different then Alternative 1. Summer type wheeled
vehicle use restrictions have been reduced but there is an added layer of over-snow motorized vehicle
use restrictions.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments – Alternative 2
There are no irreversible or irretrievable commitments as a result of implementing this alternative.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 2
The biggest change from alternative 1 to alternative 2 is the substantial reduction in the number of
roads that are closed year around. Most of these roads that were closed year around are classified as
open to over-snow vehicles use during the winter in alternative 2 but are closed to all other motorized
vehicles. The cumulative effects for this alternative are the same as those listed under the section
“Cumulative Effects Common to all Alternatives” except that there would be an increased need for law
enforcement in the short-term to patrol the roads that would be closed to wheeled motorized use.
Motor vehicle use maps that identify routes and designations for motorized use within the planning area
would be available to the public.

Summary – Alternative 2
This alternative meets the purpose and need by providing a manageable system of designated public
motorized access routes and by providing detailed analysis of every road on the system to determine
the effective management of that road. This alternative is in compliance with the Planning Rule by
providing clarity to the 2001 Tri-State OHV decision, establishing a road by road plan that provides for
efficient management of the forest through a responsible transportation system that provides for
recreational opportunities throughout the forest. Effects on the ground would be continued
maintenance on the existing high-use roads and capitalizing on opportunities for road improvements
when presented as part of other projects. All roads that are considered not necessary for long term
forest management and fail to provide public access would be placed in storage.

Specific status of key areas under alternative 3 is as follows:

Sweeny Creek – Roads and trails would be closed year-long to wheeled motorized vehicles.
Limburger Spring/Kading – Little Blackfoot Road (NFSR 227) would be closed just past the
campground and under this alternative NFSR 227-E1 would become a non-motorized trail. Road 314
would be closed year-long to wheeled vehicles past the gate in Section 7. Roads 314-J1 and J3 would
also be closed year-long to wheeled vehicles. Trails 501, MTR’s 503, 502 and 1868 and road 1871-002
would be closed year-long to wheeled motorized vehicles.
Negro Mountain – 1857 –D2 and 1859 D4 and E1 would be closed yearlong.
Ontario Creek – The connection from 491-D1 and 4104-A1 would be closed year-long to wheeled
vehicles.

Hunting Season Access – Routes 335-A1 and A2 (Area 2), 1856 (Area 4) and 314-J3 (Area 3)
would be closed year-long to wheeled motorized vehicles.
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail – Roads 1802-B2 (Area 2), 335-B2 (Area 2) and 136D1 (Area 1) would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles yearlong.
Winter Use – The area south of MacDonald Pass to approximately the Hahn Creek Road (Area 4)

would be closed to wheeled and motorized over-snow vehicle travel. There would also be winter
closures in the Sweeny Creek (Area 1) and Hahn Creek areas, as well as lower elevation west facing
slopes Clarks Canyon north to Threemile Creek (Area 2). Those areas that remain open have a season of
December 2nd to May 15th for over-snow travel.

Alternative 3 - Unauthorized Roads
In this alternative approximately nine of the 16 miles of non-system routes would be incorporated into
the existing system of National Forest System Roads. Table 42 for general information and Table 4 of the
transportation specialist report for specific information, which can be found in the project file.

Alternative 3 - Enforcement/Complexity
The enforcement for this alternative will be similar to Alternative 2.

Alternative 3 - Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There are no irreversible or irretrievable commitments as a result of implementing this alternative.

Alternative 3 - Cumulative Effects
The most significant change from alternative 1 (no action) to alternatives 2 and alternative 3 is the
substantial reduction in the number of roads that are closed year around. Most of the roads that were
closed year-long are classified as open to over-snow vehicles use during the winter but still closed to all
other motorized vehicles. The cumulative effects for this alternative are the same as those listed under

enforcement in the short-term to patrol the roads that would be closed to wheeled motorized use.
Motor vehicle use maps that identify routes and designations for motorized use within the planning area
would be available to the public.

Summary of Effects – Alternative 3
Implementation of alternative 3 would provide for compliance with Travel Planning Regulations, provide
clarity to users regarding the 2001 Tri-State OHV decision and establish a route by route plan that
provides for a manageable system of designated public access routes throughout the planning area. This
alternative would provide for a variety of recreational motorized and non-motorized opportunities
throughout the forest. Effects on the ground would be continued maintenance on the existing high use
roads as well as capitalizing on additional opportunities to increase road maintenance when presented
as part of other projects. Decommissioning would be accomplished as part of a proactive,
comprehensive plan over-time and as the budget allows. In alternative 3, the line officer made the
decision to take a much more aggressive approach towards unclassified routes and acquired routes in
that rather than being proposed for storage, they are proposed for decommissioning. Roads that fail to
provide public access to the National Forest would be placed in storage or decommissioned.

Closures – Alternative 5
Off Route Travel – Alternative 5
In accordance with FSM 7716.1 – A designation of a road or trail includes all terminal facilities,
trailheads, parking lots and turnouts associated with the road or trail. The designation also includes
parking a motor vehicle on the side of the road when it is safe to do so without causing damage to NFS
resources or facilities, unless prohibited by state law, a traffic sign, or an order (36 CFR 261.54). Road
designations must specify either that they include parking within one vehicle length, or within a
specified distance of up to 30 feet, from the edge of the road surface. Designations that include limited
use of motor vehicles within a specified distance from certain forest roads and forest trails for dispersed
camping or big game retrieval must specify the distance, the vehicle class, the time of year the use is
permitted, if appropriate and any other conditions on use.
In alternative 5 motorized travel and parking is proposed to be allowed up to 30 feet from the edge or
the road for any legal purpose on the forest as long as no permanent routes are created and as long as
no resource damage takes place. In addition, for resource protection, no off-route motor vehicle travel
will be allowed within 30 feet of any water body. Where the designated route is less than 30 feet from a
water body, no off-route parking will be allowed. All allowed dispersed camping areas greater than 30
feet from the edge of a designated route will be shown on the MVUM. The size of the dispersed
camping area shall not exceed 20 feet x 20 feet in width and length. Vehicle travel off route between
dispersed camp sites is not permitted.
Temporary Emergency Closures for resource protection will be issued in accordance with FSM 7716.51.
In the existing condition, the 2001-Tri State ROD states that motorized wheeled cross-country travel to a
campsite is permissible within 300 feet of roads and trails. Site selection must be completed by nonmotorized means and accessed by the most direct route causing the least damage. This exception does
not apply where existing seasonal restrictions prohibit traveling off designated routes to a campsite.
Existing local rules take precedence over this exception. This distance could be modified through
subsequent site-specific planning. In alternative 5, through this site specific planning effort this distance
will be modified to be 70 feet from the edge of the road but not within 30 feet of a body of water.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments – Alternative 5
There are no irreversible or irretrievable commitments as a result of implementing this alternative.

Cumulative Effects – Alternative 5
The most significant change from alternative 1 to alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5 is the substantial reduction in
the miles of roads that are closed year-around. Most of the roads that were closed year-long are
classified as open to over-snow vehicles use during the winter but still closed to all other motorized
vehicles. The cumulative effects for this alternative are the same as those listed under “Cumulative
Effects Common to All Alternatives” except that there would be an increased need for law enforcement
in the short-term to patrol the roads that would be closed to wheeled motorized use. Motor vehicle
use maps (MVUM) that identify routes and designations for motorized use within the planning area
would be available to the public.

Conclusions
Implementation of any of the action alternatives 2, 3, 4 or 5 would result in the following outcomes
common to all alternatives:
•
•
•

•

Access to the National Forest during the winter would be significantly increased by
allowing over-snow vehicle use on previously closed roads, as described above.
There would be clarification regarding closed roads that are closed to all activity and
those that are closed but allow over-snow use.
Roads that are located in areas that are already open to over-snow motorized vehicle
use to over-snow motorized travel. By doing so, the road use would be consistent with
the area surrounding the road prism allowing over-snow motorized vehicle access from
December 2nd to May 15th.
Wheeled motorized vehicle trails that currently have no seasonal restrictions would be
modified to have a seasonal closure.

or reconstruction, maintenance would continue as part of all alternatives and input would be provided
by Forest Resource specialists, transportation planning and road management would be coordinated

restrictions would be evaluated annually, enforcement of the Road Management Program would be a
high priority, road maintenance would occur based on resource protection, road investment protection,
user safety, user comfort and travel efficiency and maintenance levels would be constantly monitored
for appropriateness and schedules would be prepared annually.

HERITAGE
Regulatory Framework
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended and its implementing regulations in
36 CFR 800, provide the legal framework for considering cultural resources in project planning. National
Historic Preservation Act Section 106 requires that federal agencies take into account, in consultation
with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), Tribes and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation (ACHP), the potential effects of agency actions on places and sites of archaeological or
historical significance. The Act establishes the National Register of Historic Places, a listing of locally,
regionally and nationally significant heritage properties (36 CFR 60). In project planning, agency historic
preservation specialists use the National Register eligibility criteria to determine the scientific, historical
or cultural value of cultural resources affected by projects.
The Archaeological Resources Protection Act, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act, Executive Order 11593 (Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment) and Executive
Order 13007 (Indian Sacred Sites) also require federal agencies to identify, monitor, protect and
preserve cultural resources under their jurisdictions.

Assumptions
It is assumed that Geographic Information System maps showing known cultural resource distributions
and existing inventory (field survey) data, provide an adequate means of assessing the general effects of
the five travel plan alternatives on cultural resources (see Methodology section).
The 2001 State Off-highway-vehicles (OHV) plan describes a range of OHV impacts to cultural resources
on public lands across Montana. These data are largely anecdotal rather than quantitative and no
attempt was made to compare OHV damage to cultural resources with other recreational and nonrecreational activities, such as horseback riding, livestock grazing or minerals exploration. Still, it is
apparent from these data that cultural resources common to the Helena National Forest are similarly
exposed and vulnerable to OHV travel. Specifically, vehicles cause compaction, rutting, erosion and
other disturbances atop cultural resources. Off-highway-vehicles use facilitates access to otherwise
remote areas, leaving archaeological and historic ruins exposed to the effects of off-route riding,
vandalism, artifact-collecting and theft. Therefore, this analysis assumes that motorized recreation has
the potential to cause similar impacts to cultural resources on the Helena National Forest. It also
assumed that non-motorized recreation (i.e. hiking, biking and skiing) has similar but lesser capacity to
cause damage to cultural resources.

Information Used
This analysis for the Divide travel planning relied on cultural resource inventory data and site records on
file at the Helena National Forest (HNF) Supervisor’s Office. These data were generated through project
and reconnaissance-level field inventories completed from 1979 to 2010. Cultural resource site and
inventory records are contained in Infra, GIS and hard copy records at the Helena National Forest
Supervisor’s Office.

Background context for the planning area are available in various archaeological and historical
documents pertinent to the Helena Valley areas (i.e. Beck 1989; Knight 1989).

Methodology & Scientific Accuracy (40 CFR 1502.15)
This analysis focused on cultural resources identified within the Divide travel planning area in the
Continental Divide Range of southwestern Montana.
Using GIS data layers, the currently known distribution of cultural resources, as identified during
previous project inventories, was displayed atop the road and trail system proposed under each
alternative to determine where there were overlaps. Cultural resource size and boundary data are not
always precise, particularly in absence of intensive surface investigation and mapping (historic sites) or
subsurface testing (archaeological sites). For this reason, GIS analysis identified all sites within 600 feet
of the roads and trails in each alternative. A 600 foot analysis buffer also takes into account the wheeled
motorized vehicle travel which is allowed within 300 feet of designated system routes (unless signed
otherwise), including roads and trails for camping under alternatives 2 and 3 and for all recreation
activities (parking, camping, firewood gathering, etc.) under alternatives 4 and 5.
Approximately 75 percent of the identified cultural resources in the planning area are either bisected by
or lie within 100 foot or less of existing road and trails. These cultural resources could be directly
affected by closures, seasonal restrictions, camping/recreation or permanent road use and
maintenance.
The remaining 25 percent of cultural resources are located at further distances (100-600 feet) from
existing roads or trails. These could be indirectly affected by road and trail use or closure, as well as
parking, camping, firewood gathering or other recreational activities. Specifically, these routes provide
access to cultural resources and thus invite vandalism, artifact collecting, arson and other resourcedepreciative behaviors. For example, old access roads to late 19th Century granite quarries in Sweeny
Creek have been converted to a network of OHV trails. Because these trails now draw attention to the
old quarry ruins, many have suffered various kinds of vandalism and abuse.
The effects of the Divide travel plan on cultural resources were evaluated on this basis:
•
•

cultural resources effected permanently by road and trail closures in each alternative
cultural resources effected by road and trail operations and maintenance

Closed roads and trails that are eventually proposed for reclamation/decommissioning would require
National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 compliance reviews since they may be:
•
•
•

historic in origin;
linked to a significant cultural resource; or
contain an exposed historic or prehistoric archaeological site within the roadbed or
prism.

Heritage, Affected Environment
Introduction
Archaeological research, ethnographic data and tribal oral tradition confirm that American Indian
peoples have occupied or used the Divide Travel Plan Area of southwestern Montana for thousands of
years. Prior to Euroamerican settlement and during the historic period, Indian groups living in what
would become Idaho and western Montana made seasonal trips over Continental Divide at MacDonald,
Mullan, Priest and other mountain passes en route to hunt bison, trade, socialize and raid on the
HERITAGE - 135

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Montana plains. After ca. 1720 A.D., these seasonal journeys were facilitated by horse-drawn travois,
which transported supplies, hides and meat. As a result of these treks, Indian trails became equestrian
thoroughfares or, quite literally, “roads”. The Continental Divide area was also used for hunting, wild
plant food collecting, tool stone quarrying and other cultural activities. Today, the Salish, Kootenai,
Blackfeet, Shoshone and other tribes attach cultural significance to archaeological sites found
throughout the travel planning area. Contemporary American Indian religious activity occurs at one
mountain pass in the Divide area.
During the early 1800s, fur trappers sought beaver in mountain streams throughout the Divide travel
planning area. The mountain range was officially explored by the Stevens Expedition in 1854. The Mullan
Road, linking Fort Walla Walla with Fort Benton, was subsequently built in 1859-1860 atop one of the
Steven Expedition routes, under the supervision of Lieutenant John Mullan, for whom Mullan Pass in the
Divide travel planning area is named. Military use was limited but the wagon road greatly facilitated the
non-Indian settlement of both Montana and Washington Territories. The first meeting of the
Freemasons of Montana (who may have formed the nucleus of the Vigilantes during the early, violent
days of the Montana Gold rush) occurred atop Mullan Pass in 1862. An outdoor lodge (with paths,
benches and altars), developed in 1955 under a Forest Service special use permit, is maintained on this
spot by the Masons.
The Mullan Road served as an important travel route until the Northern Pacific (NP) Railroad (and
Mullan Tunnel) was completed in 1883. The Northern Pacific railroad spurred development of large
hardrock (lode) mines and mills throughout the Continental Divide Range, as exemplified by the
Drumlummon Mine in Marysville and the Lee Mountain and Ontario mines in the Ten Mile and Little
Blackfoot drainages, respectively. The Divide travel planning area encompasses four major mining
districts (Austin/Blossburg, Elliston, Ophir Creek and Rimini). The abundant (checkerboard) private lands
and extensive network of mining ditches and roads throughout the travel planning area demonstrate
the scale of mining activity and development. Most patented (private) mining claims (operations) have
long since been abandoned. Reclamation has occurred at some of these hardrock mining sites. The
reclaimed Charter Oak Mine and Millsite is now a well-used forest interpretive site.
Logging to support mining, community building and ore smelting in Anaconda and (later) East Helena
followed. An extensive flume and ditch system to transport logs to the Elliston railhead is located in the
Little Blackfoot River area. Grassy basins atop the Continental Divide seasonally sustained large sheep
and cattle herds, as attested by old photographs and the remains of old camps in aspen groves and
“sheepherder” monuments atop high promontories. Granite quarrying in the eastern foothills of the
Continental Divide provided durable building materials for fire-prone Helena and other fledgling
communities across the newly formed State of Montana (1889). Much of the Divide travel planning area
was incorporated into the National Forest system in 1906.The Moose Creek Ranger Station was
established in the Ten Mile drainage in 1908 to facilitate timber, range, fire, minerals and recreation
management by the Forest Service.
The current road and trail system within the Divide travel planning area owes much of its existence to
the early cultural history of this region. Upon its formation, the Forest Service simply preempted existing
historic travel routes, parts of which had antecedents in American Indian trails and “buffalo roads”. By
this process, a variety of historic cultural resources (i.e., mines, homesteads, line camps, trappers cabins,
log flumes) to which these roads were intimately connected also came into federal ownership at the
turn of the 20th Century. Road improvements and new road construction, particularly that spurred by
an extensive Forest Service timber harvesting program beginning in the 1940s, followed. More recently
Forest Service administrative uses, coupled with housing development at the wildlands-urban interface

and growing OHV use, have added another tier of both non-system and system roads and trails across
the Divide travel planning landscape.

Analysis Area
A total of 181 cultural resources are currently identified within or near roads and trails that are the focus
of the Divide travel planning analysis. A mix of prehistoric and historic cultural resources are identified
north of Highway 12. Most of the identified cultural resources south of Highway 12 in the Ten Mile and
Little Blackfoot drainages are historic in origin and relate to placer and lode mining. The historical or
scientific value of many cultural resources in the analysis area has not been determined. The exceptions
are major lode mines sites such as the Ontario and Charter Oak, which have been the focus of National
Historic Preservation Act Section 106 compliance for recent mine reclamation work. For purposes of this
NEPA analysis, all identified cultural resources are treated as eligible (significant) for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, in accordance with FSM 2363.22.

Heritage, Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to All Alternatives
Direct and Indirect Effects
The 2001 State OHV Plan benefited cultural resources by confining motorized travel to designated
routes, as defined in alternative 1 (Existing Condition). alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5 provide area-specific
travel plans that replace, in part, the State OHV Plan.
Road and trail closures benefit cultural resources by preventing easy vehicle access to sensitive cultural
resources which helps to abate vandalism and artifact theft. For example, because of relatively easy
vehicle access across the Divide travel planning area, historic mining buildings have been dismantled to
obtain antique wood for various decorative uses such as in home remodeling and picture frames. Mining
equipment, such as ore carts and old equipment parts, has found new homes as lawn and landscaping
ornaments. Valuable artifacts are collected for sale in antique shows and on the Internet.
Roads and trails often bisect prehistoric (American Indian) and historic archaeological sites, exposing
artifacts in their tread. As time goes by, these treads get deeper and deeper, leading to by-pass routes
and multiple treads. The exposed archaeological remains become highly visible and vulnerable to illegal
collection, crushing by vehicles, erosion damage and other processes. Permanent roads and trails
closures would eliminate some of these problems.
Conversely, permanent road closures under any alternative may limit access to historic sites that people
want to visit. This can be construed as a negative effect. Further, some (primitive) roads retain historical
value by virtue of their linkage to specific cultural resource sites. Their permanent closure and potential
obliteration (considered under a separate NEPA decision), may diminish the historical value of some of
these cultural resources.
Fall to spring road and trail closures provide limited benefit to cultural resources since public use of
National Forest System land diminishes during this time period and cultural resources are usually
blanketed in snow or are otherwise inaccessible due to poor road conditions. However, once these
roads are open from late spring through early fall, cultural resources become vulnerable to artifact
collection, vandalism, arson and other depreciative behavior.
Winter use with snowmobiles has limited effects on cultural resources because most cultural resources
are obscured by deep snow. Standing historic ruins (i.e., old cabins) are vulnerable to public activity,
HERITAGE - 137

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

including use as winter shelter and a ready source of dry firewood. However, there is no strong
correlation between snowmobile activity and the dismantling of historic ruins for winter firewood on the
Helena National Forest.
A variety of cultural resources are located within or near major roads and trails that would remain open
and available for public use under any alternative. Annual road maintenance continues to degrade some
cultural resources exposed in the roadbeds and berms. For example, road grading and drainage clearing
incrementally pick away at archaeological sites (i.e., Hope Creek) and standing historic ruins. Regardless
of alternative, public use will continue on these travel routes and may increase due to road and trail
closures elsewhere in the Continental Divide Range and on adjacent public lands managed by the Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management. This situation could potentially accelerate on-going impacts to
cultural resources from road maintenance and use.
Road closures will eventually necessitate evaluation and implementation of closure methods, which
could include road obliteration, ripping and seeding. Contingent on the targeted roads and OHV trails,
this could have an adverse effect on cultural resources. The effect of this activity could be mitigated by
using various closure methods in areas where cultural resources are currently exposed in roads and trailbeds. For example, road segments within identified archaeological sites could be buried with soil, as
opposed to being ripped and seeded. As an outcome of road and trail closures, any future obliteration
will require careful long-range planning to insure that cultural resource inventory, evaluation and
treatment precede such undertakings (ground-disturbance), in accordance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), as amended.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives
Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
Travel management may increase public access and as a consequence, enhance opportunities for
artifact collecting and vandalism. Travel management may inadvertently expose previously
undiscovered prehistoric or historic sites. It is possible that exposed artifacts and/or ruins would be
observed and not reported to the Forest Service, thus providing opportunities for artifact collecting and
vandalism. However, the results of past cultural resources monitoring and inventories suggest that
these kinds of indirect effects would be negligible.

Cumulative Effects
All action alternatives would improve cultural resource protection in the Divide travel planning area in
the short- and long-term. See alternative 1 for a description of past, present and reasonably foreseeable
future actions.

Alternative 1, No Action
Alternative 1 falls under the purview of the 2001 State OHV Plan and eliminates cross-country travel. It
provides the same level of protection to the culture resource base within the travel planning area as
currently exists. Some 85 miles of roads and trails are closed under this alternative, the bulk of which are
snowmobile routes which are open under alternative 2.
Cultural resources would remain vulnerable to vandalism and related impacts because OHV riding would
be allowed yearlong on a wide range of designated routes.
The numerous open roads and trails provide ample access to cultural resources for purposes of
monitoring, scientific investigation and potentially interpretation, which is a beneficial effect.
HERITAGE - 138

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Road maintenance will continue to degrade some cultural resources in the travel planning area under
alternative 1.

Indirect Effects
The Existing Condition protects many vulnerable cultural resources by confining motorized travel to
designated routes. It would preclude the opportunity to further protect cultural resources that may
currently be vulnerable to vehicle traffic, artifact collecting and natural deterioration in undesignated
routes.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
Since no actions associated with this project would occur, there would not be a need to inventory the
planning area. Therefore, additional cultural resources data would not be realized.

Cumulative Effects
This alternative is the existing condition and does not improve cultural resource protection in the Divide
travel planning area.
Past Actions – The Continental Divide Range and its adjacent foothills and valley bottoms, has supported
livestock grazing, logging, recreation and utility development during the last 140 years. These activities
and particularly the road construction associated with them, have exposed and in some cases damaged,
cultural resources. However, it is difficult to quantify the effects of these past actions on cultural
resources in the Divide travel planning area.
Since the late 1970s, cultural resource inventories have preceded all ground-disturbing Forest Service
projects in the Divide travel planning area including vegetation treatments, livestock grazing, restoration
and recreation development. The majority of the cultural resources described in this travel plan analysis
were discovered as a result of these compliance inventories. In fact, many archaeological sites were
found because they were exposed in old road and trail beds. In most cases, project boundaries and
treatments were reconfigured to avoid impacting important cultural resources so the cumulative effect
of these actions on cultural resources has been relatively minor.
Present Actions – Cultural resource inventory and evaluation has preceded restoration work, fencing,
weed treatment, road and trail repairs, reforestation and stock watering repairs. On-going forest
activities will continue to have a cumulative effect on cultural resources. Livestock grazing, in particular,
continues to degrade prehistoric and historic resources, especially where they concentrate near water
sources. Roads and trails have been constructed through archaeological and historic sites over a period
of many years. Regardless of alternative, road maintenance, especially road grading and road use will
continue to degrade cultural resources, particularly prehistoric archaeological sites. Cultural resources
exposed in roadbeds and borrow pits invite illegal artifact collecting.
Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions – Future actions in the analysis area focus on public safety and
environmental health and include fire and watershed restoration, hazardous fuels reduction, abandoned
mine reclamation and minor recreation developments and mineral operations. In all likelihood, the
effects of these projects on cultural resources can be mitigated through project re-design and
avoidance.
Despite economic uncertainty and other factors, Lewis and Clark and Jefferson Counties will continue to
be developed at an incremental pace. The cumulative effect of this demographic growth (i.e., rural
subdivisions, commercial development) at the forest-urban interface on Helena National Forest cultural
resources is difficult to estimate but easier access (i.e., trails out of subdivisions) into Continental Divide

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Range (i.e., Sweeny Creek area) may increase the problems described above, such as user-built trail
proliferation atop cultural resources, artifact collecting and vandalism.

Alternative 2
Direct Effects
Alternative 2 would close additional miles of non-system and system roads and trails to wheeled
vehicles that pass closely or directly through 53 identified cultural resources, as compared to alternative
1. This alternative will leave 110 miles of road open to over-snow vehicles. Permanent closures would
protect these cultural resources from on-going damage by continued wheeled vehicle traffic and public
use and be a beneficial effect.
At the same time, permanent closures would constrain public access for purposes of agency or agencyauthorized scientific investigation, monitoring and protection-related activities.
Road maintenance would continue to degrade cultural resources in the Divide travel planning area.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 2 would improve cultural resource protection over alternative 1 by decreasing road access
across the Divide travel planning area. This, in turn, would reduce cultural resource exposure to artifact
collecting, vandalism and other depreciative behavior.

Alternative 3
Direct Effects
Alternative 3 would also close additional miles of non-system and system roads and trails yearlong to
wheeled motorized vehicles that pass closely or directly through 77 identified cultural resources, as
compared to alternative 1. These various closures would benefit cultural resources by limiting public
access. However, this alternative will leave 154 miles of road open to over-snow vehicles. The negative
effect would be constraining Forest Service administrative and public recreational access to these
historic ruins and features.
Road maintenance would continue to degrade cultural resources in the Divide travel planning area.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 3 would improve cultural resource protection over alternatives 1 and 2 by decreasing road
access across the Divide travel planning area. This, in turn, would reduce cultural resource exposure to
artifact collecting, vandalism and other depreciative behavior.

Alternative 4
Direct Effects
In comparison to alternative 1, alternative 4 would close miles of non-system and system roads and
trails yearlong to wheeled motorized vehicles that pass closely or directly through 65 identified cultural
resources. These various closures would benefit cultural resources by limiting public access. However,
this alternative will leave 137 miles of road open to over-snow vehicles. The negative effect would be
constraining Forest Service administrative and public recreational access to these historic ruins and
features.
HERITAGE - 140

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Roads and trails in Sweeny Creek would be closed year-long to motorized vehicles, which would benefit
cultural resources.
Road maintenance would continue to degrade cultural resources in the Divide travel planning area.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 4 would improve cultural resource protection over alternatives 1 by decreasing road access
across the Divide travel planning area. This, in turn, would reduce cultural resource exposure to artifact
collecting, vandalism and other depreciative behavior.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would close non-system and system roads and trails yearlong to wheeled motorized
vehicles that pass near or directly through 88 identified cultural resources, as compared to alternative 1.
These various closures would benefit cultural resources by limiting public access. However, this
alternative will leave 169 miles of road open to over-snow vehicles. In contrast to alternatives 3 and 4, it
would leave 14.5 miles of trail open to vehicles 50 inches or less with no seasonal restriction. This newly
open 14.5 miles of trails have the potential to impact 2 cultural sites if resource protection measures are
not established. For this factor alone, alternative 5 provides the least cultural resource protection of the
five alternatives. Alternatives 2-4 provide for one mile or less of trail open to vehicles 50 inches or less
with no seasonal restriction. When compared strictly on the basis of total miles to be restricted,
alternative 5 remains the most restrictive and thus provides the most over-all benefit to cultural
resources. The negative effect of decreased motorized access would be constraining Forest Service
administrative and public recreational access to these historic ruins and features.
As in alternative 4, roads and trails in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed yearlong to motorized
vehicles, except for County Road 335, which would benefit cultural resources.
Road maintenance would continue to degrade cultural resources in the Divide Travel Plan area.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 5 would generally improve cultural resource protection over alternatives 1-4 by decreasing
road access across the Divide Travel Planning area. This is despite the fact that unlike alternatives 1-4, it
provides 14.5 miles of trail for vehicles 50 inches or less. The general reduction in access, in turn, would
reduce cultural resource exposure to artifact collecting, vandalism and other depreciative behavior.

Conclusions
The Divide Travel Plan project area contains a variety of cultural resources. Overall, travel planning
would have a beneficial effect on cultural resources. Alternative 1 essentially implements the State OHV
Plan by eliminating cross-country travel and confining motorized travel, including snowmobiles in some
areas, to designated routes. It does not increase protection of cultural resources by closing numerous
open roads and trails but it does provide ample access to cultural resources for purposes of monitoring,
scientific investigation and potentially interpretation.
Alternative 2 would permanently close approximately six miles of non-system roads and trails, which
would benefit cultural resources over alternative 1. These closures might constrain some administrative
and public access to cultural resources, but overall there would remain ample opportunity for the public
to visit cultural resources in the Divide Travel Plan area.

HERITAGE - 141

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Alternative 3 would permanently close approximately seven miles of system and non-system roads and
trails, which would benefit cultural resources over both alternatives 1 and 2.
Alternative 4 would permanently close approximately six miles of system and non-system roads and
trails, which would benefit cultural resources over alternatives 1, 2 and 3.
Alternative 5 would permanently close approximately five miles of non-system roads and trails, which is
less than in alternatives 1-4. When judged on this factor alone, alternative 5 would provide the least
benefit to cultural resources derived from the permanent closure of non-system roads and trails of the
five alternatives.
Permanent road and trail closures that eventually lead to obliteration (ripping, seeding), as based on
future site-specific NEPA and National Historic Preservation Act analyses, could adversely affect
identified cultural resources unless mitigation treatments are imposed (e.g., bury the road bed with
topsoil as opposed to ripping of tread and the archaeological deposit). Road closure methods are not
part of the current Divide Travel Plan decision, but they are linked.
Compliance inventory, evaluation of site significance and project effect, consultation with the Montana
State Historic Preservation Office and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers and implementation of design
features for project-affected cultural resources would comply with the National Historic Preservation
Act and its implementing regulations in 36 CFR 800, as well as Helena National Forest Plan (USDA 1986)
standards and guidelines.

Forest Plan Consistency
The Forest Plan requires the integration of cultural resources in project planning and forest
management. Compliance inventory, evaluation of site significance and project effect, consultation with
the Montana State Historic Preservation Office and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers and
implementation of design features for project-affected cultural resources would comply with the
National Historic Preservation Act and its implementing regulations in 36 CFR 800, as well as Helena
National Forest Plan (USDA 1986) standards and guidelines.

National Forest Management Act of 1976 (90 Stat. 2949; 16 U.S.C. 1608)

Section 8(b) of the National Forest Management Act states, “any road constructed on land of

with the goal of re-establishing vegetation cover on the roadway and areas where vegetation
cover has been disturbed by the construction of the road, within 10 years after the termination

taken unless it is determined that the road is needed for use as a part of the National Forest
Transportation System”.
This legal direction states that lands no longer needed for and dedicated to, transportation or
access uses should be returned to a vegetated state. Implicit in this legal direction is Forest
Service responsibility to recover soil productivity on these lands, to the extent that vegetation
can be re-established. Type and degree of soil recovery necessary for re-establishment of
vegetation will depend on site-specific conditions and land management objectives for that

Helena National Forest Plan of 1986

The Helena National Forest Plan provides further guidance: “Areas of decomposed granite soils
will be identified and erosion control measures planned prior to ground disturbing activities”;
“To reduce sedimentation associated with management activities, the highly sensitive granitic
soils, which cover about 20 percent of the Forest, will have first priority for erosion control”
(USDA Forest Service 1986, page II-26).

Assumptions
Roads located on private land and those that are not under Forest Service management
were not considered in this analysis.
•
The Divide Travel Plan decision will include only open-or-closed determinations. No
ground disturbing activities are proposed as part of this project.
•
Use of over-snow vehicles would not result in soil disturbance as the ground would be
covered with snow.
•
Soil impacts would be greater on roads than compared to non-motorized and motorized
trails 50 inches in width or less. This is because cut and fill associated with roads
frequently results in a larger area of soil disturbance than that of trails.
•
Other than roads and trails over sensitive soils (typically riparian areas), areas most
prone to extensive soil degradation would include routes that run parallel to the slope
and complex networks or “spaghetti” road patterns.
Existing dispersed use sites or new sites would be closed if impacts were observed to occur
based on criteria of use and consistency with 36 CFR 212.52 (b)(2) for this activity.

Information Used
Helena National Forest Soil Survey - Professional interpretations of landtypes based upon the
“Soil Survey of Helena National Forest Area, Montana” USDA Forest Service and Natural
Resource Conservation Service 2001.
Helena National Forest Geospatial Data – Analysis and interpretations of GIS Landtype and
Divide Travel Plan alternatives datasets. Subsequent tables produced are located in an Excel
database file, located in the project record and summarized in appendix A.
Roads Analysis Process (RAP) Report – An analysis of the Helena National Forest road network
was completed in 2004. The analysis designated road risk ratings based on road mileage within
riparian habitat conservation areas, wet areas, erosive and slide-prone soils, Total Maximum
Daily Loads (TMDL) watersheds and the number of road-stream crossings (USDA, 2004).

Methodology and Scientific Accuracy
The data used for the analysis of this report is the best available data with regards to accuracy of
route location, soil type and associated soil properties. The road and trail layer was overlaid
with the soil landtypes designated as “sensitive” for a GIS product displaying the miles of roads
and trails occurring on specific designated sensitive landtypes. Sensitive landtypes were

grouped into four categories of geologic hazard as identified in the Soil Survey of the Helena
National Forest, 2001. These hazards address soils that occur in positions identified as landslide
and slump prone, wet soils and flood prone areas, loess soils with volcanic ash surfaces and
granitic soils. From this information, all routes were stratified based on these geologic hazards
and then further divided by open or closed travel restriction.
For this analysis report, all routes from each geologic hazard were grouped into open or closed
travel restriction. Routes with travel restrictions that allow any wheeled motorized travel at any
time of year were placed into the open category. The closed category was applied to those
routes that are closed to all wheeled motorized travel yearlong. Travel restriction codes in the
open category include: 02, 03, 05, 07, 13, 15, open highway legal, U open highway legal, M-07,
MT, MT 5/16 – 10/14, MT May 16th to August 31st and M-08.1. Travel restriction codes in the
closed category include: 01, 06, 06-SPC, CDNST, NS-01-RES, MT-01, NS-01-RES and NONMT.
This assumption is based on the premises that as long as routes are open to wheeled motorized
use, for any length of time, the potential for natural reclamation or to perform decommissioning
would not be possible.

Alternatives Considered
Five alternatives were considered in this analysis. Alternative 1 is the no-action alternative,
alternative 2 is the original proposed action, alternative 3 was developed as part of the scoping
process, alternative 4 was the preferred alternative based on public feedback prior to release of
the draft EIS and alternative 5 was developed in response to comments received from the draft
EIS in conjunction with recent field reviews.

Soils, Affected Environment
Introduction
The planning area is the southern portion Continental Divide area, known as the Divide travel
planning area, located west of Helena Montana on the Helena Ranger District of the Helena
National Forest.

Analysis Area
Within the Divide Travel Planning Area, there are 60 landtypes affected by roads and trails; 12A,
12B, 12C, 12D, 13A, 14, 14A, 14B, 14C, 15, 21, 26, 31, 32, 32A, 32B, 36, 36A, 36B, 39, 39A, 41,
44, 46, 47, 47B, 49, 49A, 49B, 56, 56A, 57A, 59, 59A, 76, 76A, 77, 77A, 77B, 79, 79B, 80, 86, 87,
90, 100, 101, 110, 120, 130, 136, 150, 210, 260, 320, 360, 390, 470, 490, 790.
Soil effects from roads and trails include: removal of vegetative cover, compaction, degradation
of soil structure, decreased infiltration and water holding capacity, reduction in organic material,
accelerated surface erosion and exacerbation of mass failure, such as landslides or slumps.
These types of soil impacts can occur on the prism of all roads and trails, whether those routes
are used for motorized or non-motorized access.
Past road and trail management has taken steps on the Helena National Forest to minimize
damage to soils from wheeled motorized use. These actions include:
•

Forest Supervisor closure orders have been implemented on roads and trails to reduce
impacts to soil and water resources.

SOILS - 145

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Forest Supervisor closure orders have been implemented limiting travel to designated
routes in certain areas.
•
Roads and trails are maintained in order to prevent erosion and mass wasting events.
•
Projects have been completed re-routing and/or decommissioning roads and trails that
were located on sensitive soils.
•
In this analysis, sensitive soils are used as indicators because they represent landscapes
most vulnerable to watershed impacts from roads or trails. These detrimental
watershed impacts would include:
•
Soil compaction with increased surface water runoff and/or concentration causing
accelerated erosion and increased risk of landslides on and near roads
•
Routing of sediment and surface water runoff from road or trail prisms to streams
•
Direct connection between roads or trails and streams at crossings, including culverts,
fill material, etc.
Sensitive soils are identified in 44 landtypes within the Helena National Forest. These landtype
sensitivities are identified as landslide and slump prone, wet soils and flood prone areas, loess
soils with volcanic ash surfaces and granitic soils. This project occurs on 37 of the 44 sensitive
landtypes. These determinations are based upon the “Soil Survey of Helena National Forest
Area, Montana” USDA Forest Service and Natural Resource Conservation Service 2001. Table 48
displays the sensitive landtypes on the Helena National Forest.

Landslide and Slump Prone Landtypes
Landtypes considered landslide and slump prone have been identified as colluvial deposits and
former landslides. These landtypes are characterized by formation in unconsolidated material
with hummocky microrelief and a predominance of springs and seeps. Landslides are most
likely to occur in areas where they have already occurred in the past, on roaded landscapes and
in areas of past wildfire. The landslide and slump-prone landtypes in this project area include
landtypes 14, 14A, 14B, 14C, 15 and 150.

SOILS - 146

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Wet Soil and Flood Prone Landtypes
Wet soils and flood prone landtypes typically occur in areas with high water tables or areas at
risk of seasonal flooding. These landtypes can be identified by presence of surface water (either
seasonal or yearlong), poor drainage, riparian areas near streams and presence of springs or
seeps. These sites are usually found in geographical depressions, concave shaped areas or along
fault zones. The wet soil and flood prone landtypes in this project area include landtypes 12A,
12B, 12C, 12D, 13A, 14, 14A, 14B, 14C, 15, 36B, 100, 101, 110, 130, 136 and 150.
Loess with Volcanic Ash Landtypes
The most significant and influential layer of this loess, or wind-blown soil, was deposited on the
Forest approximately 6,700 years ago by the eruption of Mount Mazama, or Crater Lake, in
Oregon. These soil’s textures range from silt to sand sized particles that have been deposited by
wind events. Ash cap layers tend to be resistant to erosive forces when fully vegetated due to
high infiltration rates and strong soil structure. When vegetation and litter layers are removed,
the ashy surface is highly susceptible to erosion. Loess with volcanic ash surface layers in this
project area include landtypes 12B, 12C, 49B, 56, 57A, 59, 59A, 76, 76A, 77, 77B, 79, 90 and 790.
Granitic Landtypes
These landtypes have formed from granitic parent materials such as granite, grandiorites and
diorites. These parent materials weakly to moderately fractured and weather into moderately coarse to coarse textured soils. The subsoil of these landtypes is subject to a high erosion
hazard. Granitic landtypes in the project area include landtypes 12C, 26, 36, 36A, 36B, 56, 56A,
76, 76A, 86, 120, 260 and 360.

Soils, Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to All Alternatives

Although no road decommissioning is proposed in the scope of this project, this action sets up
the potential for roads on sensitive soils to be reclaimed in future projects. Simply removing the
road bed from motorized use would encourage revegetation which would in turn begin to allow
the road bed to act more as a natural site, however, soil impacts such as compaction and
decreased infiltration capacity on road or trail prisms can persist for several decades even
though transportation or access use is discouraged. Physical features, such as compaction,
would not be mitigated until mechanical treatments can be applied (Lloyd et al. 2013).

Impact on Soils from Off-route Activity
Transportation uses can indirectly impact soil productivity on lands outside the road or trail
prism when travelers establish new routes, especially to avoid trail obstructions and crossing
difficult terrain or wet areas. Soil impacts associated with non-system routes can occur on all
types of roads and trails, whether those routes are used for motorized or non-motorized access.
This activity results in soil quality degradation on areas that are identified for other types of uses
in the Forest Plan, such as timber or forage production and provision for wildlife or fisheries
habitat. A portion of these routes have been identified as U open highway legal (under
alternative 1) and NS-01-RES (under alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5) in the Divide Travel Planning
corridor.

Impact on Soils from Roads and Trails
Generally, roads and trails are a dedicated use for lands that comprise the road prism. Regional
Soil Quality Standards direct Forest Service personnel to manage National Forest System lands
without permanent impairment of land productivity and to maintain or improve soil quality. Soil
quality standards apply to lands where vegetation and water resource management are the
principal objectives. The standards do not apply to intensively developed sites such as mines,
developed recreation sites, administrative sites, rock quarries, or the permanent transportation
system.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives

Alternative 2, 3, 4 and 5 would close unauthorized routes (user created), which would in turn be
considered a benefit to soils. These routes are assumed to be the most detrimental to soil
conditions because they were not constructed with any erosion prevention measures. User
created routes added to the permanent transportation system and designated open will be
brought up to Forest Service standards through the annual maintenance program.

Alternative 1, No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Below is a description of the miles of road on each identified sensitive landtype feature. The
quantities described do not take into account state highways, county roads or routes on private
land occurring on sensitive landtypes.

As directed by 36 CFR 212.50(b), wheeled motorized travel within 300 feet of designated system
routes would be permitted as long as the following criteria are met:
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created,
No damage to existing vegetation, soil or water resource occurs;
Travel off-route does not cross streams; and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
No ground disturbing activity is proposed as part of this scope or decision, therefore no soil
related irreversible and/or irretrievable commitments exist.

Cumulative Effects
There are approximately 5.5, U open or NS-01-RES, miles of identified unauthorized roads or
trails (user created) occurring on sensitive landtypes. These routes are assumed to be the most
detrimental to soil conditions because they were not constructed with any erosion prevention

measures. Therefore, no action would leave these routes open to use and would potentially
further degrade soil conditions.
No action taken would only perpetuate further degradation of areas which contain sensitive
soils, however small. Degradation may include compaction and increased run-off from nonvegetated areas which would transport sediment off the native site.

Alternative 2, 3 and 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
Below is a description of the miles of road on each identified sensitive landtype feature for
action alternatives 2 through 4. The quantities described analyses roads on National Forest
Lands and do not take into account state highways, county roads or routes on private land
occurring on sensitive landtypes.
When comparing alternative 2 to alternative 1, the miles of routes opened for wheeled
motorized use increase for routes occurring on Landslide/Slump prone areas, Granitic soils and
those soils occurring on Volcanic Ash dominated soils by approximately 1.5 miles. The routes
occurring on Wet/Flood prone areas decrease by approximately 0.7 of a mile.

When comparing alternative 3 to alternative 1, the miles of routes opened for wheeled
motorized use decreases by approximately 35 miles for sensitive landtypes (Landslide/Slump
prone areas, Wet/Flood prone areas, routes on Granitic soils and for routes occurring on
Volcanic Ash soils).

Wet/Flood prone areas, routes on Granitic soils and for routes occurring on Volcanic Ash soils
overall.

The effects of alternative 4 include a net reduction in the number of miles of routes open to
wheeled motorized use on sensitive soils.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would permit off-road wheeled motorized use within 300 feet of a road or
trail for dispersed camping only. Alternative 4 would permit off-road vehicle use within 300 feet
of roads for all legal recreational activities. The 300 feet motorized travel authorization would
be contingent upon meeting the following criteria;
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created,
No damage to existing vegetation, soil or water resource occurs;
Travel off-route does not cross streams; and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

Soil displacement, compaction or impacts to water quality through sedimentation could occur
from off route travel through sensitive areas. The above dispersed vehicle use restrictions are
consistent with 36 CFR 212.52 (b) (2) for this activity. This resource analysis does assume that
existing sites or new sites would then be closed if impacts were observed to occur.
Professional observation suggests that the distinction between the two activities (camping only
versus multiple-use) is indistinguishable in terms of impacts to the soil resource. Once camping
activities occur, then firewood and general recreational use occurs in the same areas.
Additionally, based on experience, the vast majority of opportunities for camping or multipleuses within 300 feet of designated system routes has already been established and is part of the
existing condition in this area. The terrain does not lend itself to many more, if any possibilities
for additional dispersed recreational use (Marr, personal communication).

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
No ground disturbing activity is proposed as part of this scope or decision, therefore no soil
related irreversible and/or irretrievable commitments exist.

Cumulative Effects
Since no ground disturbing activities are proposed as part of alternatives 2, 3 and 4, there is no
potential for cumulative effects from the soil resource when analyzing past, present and
reasonably foreseeable actions.
Excluding some forms of wheeled motorized use such as full-sized vehicles would decrease
exposed soil surfaces by removing a portion of the road from regular travel. Once vegetation
begins to establish on the un-used surfaces, run-off and sediment transport will decrease.
Compaction will still be a factor.

Alternative 5 – Preferred Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
Below is a description of the miles of road on each identified sensitive landtype feature. The
quantities described do not take into account state highways, county roads or routes on private
land occurring on sensitive landtypes.
When comparing alternative 5 to alternative 1, the miles of routes opened for wheeled
motorized use decreases by approximately 44 miles for Landslide/Slump prone areas,
Wet/Flood prone areas, routes on Granitic soils and for routes occurring on Volcanic Ash soils

The effects of alternative 5 include a net reduction of routes open to wheeled motorized use on

Alternative 5 would restrict off-road wheeled motorized use to within 70 feet of a road or trail.
The wheeled motorized travel authorization would be contingent upon meeting the following
criteria;
No new permanent routes are created,
•
No damage to existing vegetation, soil or water resource occurs;
•
Travel off-route does not cross streams; and
•
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.
Alternative 5 has the additional restriction that vehicle travel to dispersed campsites would be
limited to no closer than 30 feet of a stream or body of live water.
•

Soil displacement, compaction or impacts to water quality through sedimentation could occur
from off route travel through sensitive areas. The above dispersed vehicle use restrictions are
consistent with 36 CFR 212.52 (b) (2) for this activity. This resource analysis does assume that
existing sites or new sites would then be closed if impacts were observed to occur.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
No ground disturbing activity is proposed as part of this scope or decision, therefore no soil
related irreversible and/or irretrievable commitments exist.

Cumulative Effects
Since no ground disturbing activities are proposed as part of alternative 5, there is no potential
for cumulative effects from the soil resource when analyzing past, present and reasonably
foreseeable actions.

exposed soil surfaces by removing a portion of the road from regular travel. Once vegetation

begins to establish on the un-used surfaces, run-off and sediment transport will decrease.
Compaction will still be a factor.

Conclusions

Combining Landslide/Slump prone, Wet/Flood prone, Granitic and Volcanic Ash soils, there are
currently about 165 total miles of routes open to wheeled motorized use on sensitive soils
within the Divide Travel Planning Area. Implementing alternative 2 there would cause a
negligible net increase of approximately one mile of road accessible to wheeled motorized use
on sensitive soils. Alternative 3 would result in an approximate reduction of 35 miles of routes
open to wheeled motorized use on sensitive soils. Alternative 4 would result in an approximate
reduction of 27 miles of routes open to wheeled motorized use on sensitive soils. Alternative 5
would result in an approximate reduction of 44 miles of routes open to wheeled motorized use
on sensitive soils.
Soil effects from roads and trails include: removal of vegetative cover, compaction, degradation
of soil structure, decreased infiltration and water holding capacity, reduction in organic material,
accelerated surface erosion and exacerbation of mass failure, such as landslides or slumps.
These types of soil impacts can occur on the prism of all roads and trails, whether those routes
are used for motorized or non-motorized access.
Implementation of alternative 5 would provide for the monitoring and enforcement of the 70
feet off-road wheeled motorized use restriction. Alternative 5 would provide the most potential
benefits and resource protection; in that this alternative reduces the number of heavily used
dispersed recreation sites and reduces the impacts of camping activities on sensitive landtypes.
Although no travel route decommissioning is proposed in the scope of this project, this action
sets up the potential for travel routes on sensitive soils to be reclaimed in future projects.
Administrative changes such as installation of a sign or barrier at the entrance to the route,
changing the maintenance level or type of use without making any physical improvements to
the road or trail prism would be evaluated as having low effectiveness for improving watershed
conditions. These methods would not be considered effective in reclaiming soil productivity.
Soil impacts such as compaction and decreased infiltration capacity on road or trail prisms can
persist for several decades without implementation of physical reclamation measures, even
though transportation or access use is discontinued. Physical features, such as compaction, will
not be mitigated until mechanical treatments can be applied (Lloyd et al. 2013).

Forest Plan Consistency

The Forest Plan Consistency table does not apply to the soils portion of this decision because
there are no ground disturbing activities proposed.
The Forest Plan direction for soils applies to areas outside the permanent transportation system.
The soil quality standards apply to management activities, but not to management schemes in
the broad sense. Forest Plan consistency under all the alternatives was not evaluated from a
soils perspective because, with the exception of unauthorized roads and trails, routes were
constructed for management purposes.
Alternative 2 would not move in the direction outlined in the Helena National Forest’s Plan
when managing for preservation of granitic soils. The criteria are described on page II/26
section 3 under Soil Guidance; which states: (Section 3) “To reduce sedimentation associated
SOILS - 152

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

with management activities, the highly sensitive granitic soils, which cover about 20 percent of
the Forest, will have first priority for soil erosion control.“
Alternative 2 would result in an increase of routes open to wheeled motorized use occurring on
granitic soils. Although, completely eliminating routes on all granitic landtypes would be most
beneficial, it would be simply impractical to effectively manage the Forest. Designated Forest
routes are designed to minimize erosion and sediment potential.
Alternatives 3, 4 and 5 are moving in the direction as outlined in the Helena National Forest’s
Plan when managing for preservation of granitic soils. The criteria are described in the Forest
Plan on page II/26 section 3 under Soil Guidance and as described above.
Alternatives 3, 4 and 5 would result in a reduction of routes open to wheeled motorized use
occurring on granitic soils. Although, completely eliminating routes on all Granitic landtypes
would be most beneficial, it would be simply impractical to effectively manage the Forest.
Designated Forest routes are designed to minimize erosion and sediment potential.

HYDROLOGY
Introduction
The Divide Travel Plan proposes designations for motorized routes in portions of 22 Sixth
Hydrologic Unit Code (6th-HUC) watersheds, primarily in the Little Blackfoot River and Tenmile
Creek drainages on the Helena National Forest (HNF). This decision would provide only open or
closed designations. Any route designated as closed yearlong to wheeled motorized vehicles
may potentially be fully decommissioned in a separate future NEPA analysis. From the
standpoint of watershed improvement, the primary value of this travel plan is that it would
identify closed routes which could be stabilized and are also available to be decommissioned
through separate, future analysis.
This decision would not include any ground-disturbing activities, all of the affected roads are
already on the landscape and none would be removed as a result of this decision. Therefore, the
direct effect from this decision would be only to cease motorized vehicle disturbance on roads
proposed for closure while opening a few roadbeds to motorized activity elsewhere in some
watersheds. Overall there would be a net reduction in wheeled motorized traffic from baseline
conditions in the planning area.
A road closed by this decision may generate less, the same, or more sediment over time as a
result of the closure, depending on the road surface condition, the topography of the road and
surrounding terrain, the effectiveness of the closure and other factors. Similarly, a road opened
by this decision may or may not become a greater source of sediment, depending on level of
use, maintenance, improvements and other factors. Given this uncertainty, sediment delivery
from the road network under each alternative was not estimated for this analysis. Instead, in
order to estimate the potential impact of the proposed alternatives on water resources in the
analysis area, the following management indicators were compared for each alternative,
following the assumption that at least some of the closed routes would eventually be
decommissioned or stabilized:
•
•
•

number of road-stream crossings on open and closed roads;
miles of road within specified stream buffers on open and closed roads; and
total miles of open and closed roads.

Regulatory Framework
Clean Water Act (CWA)
The Clean Water Act stipulates that states are to adopt water quality standards. Included in
these standards are provisions for identifying beneficial uses, establishing the status of
beneficial uses, setting water quality criteria and establishing Best Management Practices
(BMP’s) to control non-point sources of pollution. Executive Order 12088 also requires the
Forest Service to meet the requirements of the Act. Section 313 of the Clean Water Act requires
Federal agencies to comply with all Federal State, interstate and local requirements,
administrative authority and processes and sanctions with respect to control and abatement of
water pollution. Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act stipulates that states must identify and
prioritize water bodies that are water quality limited (i.e., water bodies that do not meet water
quality standards). For waters identified on this list, states must develop a total maximum daily
load (TMDL) for the pollutants, set at a level to achieve water quality standards.

Forest Service Manual sections 2532.02, 2532.03
Sections 2532.02 and 2532.03 of the Manual describe the objectives and policies relevant to
protection (and where needed, improvement) of water quality on National Forest System Lands
so that designated beneficial uses are protected. Guidelines for data collection activities
(inventory and monitoring) are also described.

Montana Code Annotated (MCA) 75-5-303: Non-Degradation Policy
This policy mandates that “existing uses of state waters and the level of water quality necessary
to protect those uses must be maintained and protected,” although activities existing as of April
1993 that generate non-point-source pollution are exempted from this policy (MCA 75-5-303[12], MCA 75-5-317[2][a]). This exemption would apply to most Helena National Forest system
roads.

Montana Code Annotated (MCA) 75-5-703: Development and Implementation of
TMDLs
In water bodies for which a TMDL has been developed and implemented, Montana law supports
a “voluntary program of reasonable land, soil and water conservation practices for nonpoint
source activities for water bodies” in order to achieve compliance with water quality standards
(MCA 75-5-703 [8]). In water bodies identified as impaired and in need of TMDL development,
but for which no TMDL has been completed, “new or expanded nonpoint source activities
affecting a listed water body may commence and continue if those activities are conducted in
accordance with reasonable land, soil and water conservation practices” (MCA 75-5-703 [10][c]).

Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.30.6: Surface Water Quality Standards
and Procedures
Montana law links water quality to the attainment of “beneficial uses” in a water body.
Designated beneficial uses vary by water body classification. The state has classified most of the

“maintained suitable for drinking, culinary and food processing purposes, after conventional

Water bodies classified as A-1 have the same beneficial uses as B-1 waters, with some additional
specific standards (ARM 17.30.622[3]) similar to those listed for B-1 waters.
The additional standards for A-1 and B-1 waters that are pertinent to this project include “no
increases are allowed above naturally occurring concentrations of sediment or suspended
sediment (except as permitted in 75-5-318 , MCA), …, which will or are likely to create a nuisance
or render the waters harmful, detrimental, or injurious to public health, recreation, safety,
welfare, livestock, wild animals, birds, fish, or other wildlife” (ARM 17.30.622[3][f]) for both
categories and “no increase above naturally occurring turbidity or suspended sediment is
allowed except as permitted in 75-5-318, MCA” for A-1 waters (ARM 17.30.623[3][d]) and “the
maximum allowable increase above naturally occurring turbidity is five nephelometric turbidity
units except as permitted in 75-5-318, MCA” for B-1 waters (ARM 17.30.622[3][d]). The term
naturally occurring implies “conditions or material present from runoff or percolation over which
man has no control or from developed land where all reasonable land, soil and water
conservation practices have been applied” (ARM 17.30.602). Reasonable land, soil and water
conservation practices consist of “methods, measures, or practices that protect present and
reasonably anticipated beneficial uses” (ARM 17.30.602).

National Forest Management Act (NFMA)
Roads constructed on National Forest System (NFS) lands shall be designed to standards
appropriate for the intended uses, considering safety, cost of transportation and impacts on
land and resources. This is understood to mean that the transportation system on NFS lands
provides protection for streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands and other bodies of
water from detrimental changes in water temperature, blockages of water courses and deposits
of sediment, where roads are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish
habitat.

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
This report was developed using the principle elements from the NEPA of 1969 and the
regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the NEPA from the Council on
Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) and Regulation 36 CFR Part 220.

Forest Plan Standards
Forestwide standards relating to water resources include the following:
Water currently meeting state water quality standards will be maintained by applying soil and
water conservation practices. Any project which causes excessive water pollution or undesirable
water yield will be corrected where feasible, or the project will be re-evaluated or terminated
(II/25).
Practices in the Soil and Water Conservation Practices Handbook (FSH 2509.22) developed
cooperatively by the State Water Quality Agency and the Forest Service will be incorporated,
where appropriate, into all land use and project plans as a principal mechanism for controlling
non-point pollution sources and meeting State water quality standards and other resource goals
(II/25).

Divide Travel Plan

The act of closing a road to motorized use without action to stabilize the road (e.g.
improving drainage, removing culverts, de-compacting, seeding) may not result in any
benefit to the watershed;
Any route designated as closed yearlong to wheeled vehicles may potentially be fully
decommissioned in a separate NEPA analysis and decision;
Any existing route not identified as a Helena National Forest system route in this travel
plan decision would be considered an unauthorized route and would be available for
decommissioning;
Existing or future dispersed-use sites would be closed if impacts were observed to occur
based on criteria of use and consistency with 36 CFR 212.52 (b)(2) for this activity;
Analysis for and decisions on future projects (e.g. Telegraph Vegetation Project) may
determine methods of closure (e.g. decommissioning) for closed roads within the Divide
travel planning area;
Road maintenance and improvements in the Divide Travel Planning area following this
decision would occur at a pace similar to that of the past several years (i.e. there would
continue to be a road maintenance backlog for roads within the Divide Travel Planning
area);
Road maintenance (blading, culvert clearing) and improvements (surfacing, replacing
culverts) may result in temporary increases in sediment delivery to streams, but would
result in a long-term (3 to 5+ year) reduction in sediment delivery from planning area
roads; and
No measurable change in water yield would occur as a result of this decision, because
the decision only describes the open-or-closed status of existing roads (i.e. no tree
removal would occur as a result of this decision).

Information Used
Helena National Forest GIS data – Datasets used in this analysis include the National
Hydrography Dataset streams and 6th-HUC watersheds, roads and planned road designations.
The analysis for the hydrology specialist report relied heavily upon datasets providing the
number of stream crossings and length of roadway within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams and
150 feet of non-fish-bearing streams.
Road sediment-source survey – Roads in some watersheds within the planning area were
evaluated in the field seasons from 2008 to 2014 to determine points where sediment from
roads could be transported to streams. Information collected in this survey includes location
information as well as parameters required to predict sediment delivery using the WEPP: Roads
model (Elliot et al., 1999). However, no effort was made to model sedimentation due to the
uncertainty in future sediment generation from roads opened or closed by this decision.
Roads Analysis Process (RAP) Report – An analysis of the Helena National Forest road network
was completed in 2004. The analysis designated road risk ratings based on road mileage within
riparian habitat conservation areas, wet areas, erosive and slide-prone soils, TMDL watersheds
and the number of road-stream crossings (USDA, 2004). The RAP assessment of watershed road
risks was found to be consistent with more recent GIS data on stream crossings and roads within
the buffers based on INFISH riparian habitat conservation areas. Thus, the latter datasets were
used. For discussion of the RAP data, see the fisheries specialist report.

Methodology and Scientific Accuracy
Scale of analysis – The spatial scale of analysis is the 6th-HUC watershed. This is an appropriate
scale for this analysis given the types of watershed impacts that are associated with road
networks (e.g. increased sediment delivery) are generally discernible at the 6th-HUC scale. The
temporal scale of the analysis for all effects is greater than five years, given that the decision to
designate a route as either opened or closed does not necessarily determine whether that route
would have a reduced, neutral, or increased impact on water resources in the short-term (less
than five years).
GIS data – GIS data was used as a surrogate for field data in the analysis because field data for
the planning area were incomplete. The accuracy of Helena National Forest GIS datasets is
described in GIS metadata files available in the public record. Updated GIS data on stream/road
crossings and miles of road within buffers specified by INFISH standards (USDA, 1995) were used
in place of RAP data as indicators of problematic roads. Roads within these buffers and the
number of stream crossings were selected as indicators because a road must be hydraulically
connected to a stream for sediment-laden runoff to flow from the road to the stream. Roads
with stream crossings or that run parallel and adjacent to streams are likely to deliver sediment
to streams, while roads that are far from a stream are unlikely to be hydraulically connected.
The buffer distances used to comply with direction specified in the INFISH standards are 300
feet for fish-bearing streams and 150 feet for non-fish-bearing streams. In practice, the width of
an adequate sediment buffer depends on buffer slope, vegetation and other site-specific
characteristics. A distance of 150 feet generally affords a buffer of sufficient width to minimize
most sediment delivery from roads, while roads beyond 300 feet from a stream are unlikely to
deliver measurable amounts of sediment (Haupt 1959; Swift 1986; Ketcheson and Megahan
1990; Ellis 2008).
Road sediment data – Road sediment surveys were completed by trained Helena National
Forest hydrologic technicians from 2008-2014. The work performed by technicians was fieldvalidated by the forest hydrologist. Data collected in the road sediment survey were of a degree
of precision and accuracy that exceeded the sensitivity of the sediment modeling software
typically used. However, sediment modeling was not performed as a part of this analysis.

Hydrology, Affected Environment
Analysis Area
The analysis area for the Hydrology Report consists of all drainages covered by roads affected in
this decision. This includes 22 6th-HUC watersheds primarily in the Little Blackfoot River and
Tenmile Creek drainages (Table 54). Several streams within the travel planning area are listed by
Montana DEQ as having impaired water quality (MT DEQ, 2014). Most of these streams are not
fully meeting beneficial uses due to sedimentation, among other impairments. Additionally,
some non-listed stream reaches within the planning area flow directly into listed impaired
reaches (e.g. Spotted Dog Creek). Streams in the Divide Travel Planning area are covered by
three Montana DEQ TMDL planning areas: the Lake Helena, Little Blackfoot and Holter. The Lake
Helena and Little Blackfoot TMDL reports recommend sediment reductions ranging from 40
percent to 80 percent from unpaved roads, depending on 6th-HUC (US EPA, 2006; MT DEQ and
US EPA, 2011 ). The Holter planning area (covering streams in the Iron Horse Creek drainage)
does not have a TMDL at the time of writing.

Water Quality
Forest roads, by virtue of their existence on the landscape, have a negative effect on watershed
values. The impact of a road is generally continuous whether the road is open or closed to public
use, although unused roads are often partially stabilized by vegetation over time. The Divide
Travel Plan decides only the open-closed status of system roads and does not determine
whether or how any system roads will be decommissioned. The act of closing roads to all
motorized use provides some benefit to watershed conditions, in that over time these roadbeds
could likely become revegetated and stabilized. Vegetation regrowth on the road surface has
been linked to lower levels of road sediment reaching stream channels (MacCaffery et al. 2007).
However, without decompaction of the road surface, top soil may remain unavailable to plant
roots, preventing the road prism from revegetating to a point that sufficiently decreases
concentrated runoff. Additionally, subsurface hydraulic connectivity would continue to be
impaired on roads with cut-fill construction without decompaction and recontouring of the road
(Gucinski et al. 2001). Further, undersized culverts or improperly designed road/stream
crossings on closed, but not decommissioned roads, could continue to be a source of road
sediment without restoration and stabilization of the stream channel (Madej 2000). Thus, this
decision is unlikely to result in any substantial change in the existing impacts of roads on
HYDROLOGY - 158

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

streams and riparian areas within planning area watersheds. The primary benefit to a watershed
with the route designations provided in this decision is in the opportunity it affords to
subsequently decommission closed roads to remove them from the landscape, following
additional NEPA analysis and public review.
The primary water quality concern related to the network of routes in the Divide Travel Planning
area is sediment from roads. Other documented impairments in these watersheds include
various metals related mainly to past mining activities, low pH, flow alteration and alteration of
riparian vegetation. This analysis focuses on sediment, as this impairment stems in large part
from forest roads in the planning area and has the greatest potential to be affected by the travel
planning decision, assuming subsequent road decommissioning occurs.

Sediment
Roads
Unpaved roads are a dominant source of sediment in most forested drainages, including the 6thHUC watersheds covered by this travel plan. Specifically, unpaved roads (especially nativesurface roads) that cross or run adjacent to streams generally deliver sediment to streams
during rain and snowmelt events. In contrast, roads without a hydraulic connection to a stream
channel may lose eroded sediment from the road surface, but do not deliver sediment to stream
channels and are thus generally not a stream water quality concern. In the hydrology analysis,
motorized trails, open to wheeled-motorized vehicles 50 inches in width or less, are assessed
the same as engineered roads open to full-sized vehicles. Motorized trails have been observed
to contribute more sediment than unpaved forest roads (Chen et al. 2006; Welsh 2008). This
occurs because motorized trails tend to lack the design features of engineered roads that help
minimize erosion and sedimentation. Additionally, routes intended for off-highway vehicles are
more likely to have steep gradients that result in higher runoff energy and thus greater erosion
and transport capacity. Motorized trails also tend to be located in valley bottoms allowing them
to be hydraulically connected to adjacent stream channels (Chin et al. 2006; Meadows et al.
2008; Welsh 2008).
Road and culvert maintenance and gravel surfacing can reduce the number and/or magnitude of
sediment delivery points on a road for a period of years, but a road hydraulically connected to a
stream will remain an episodic source of sediment as long as it remains on the landscape. Thus,
the most important indirect indicators of the potential for road sedimentation in streams are
the number of road/stream crossings and the length of road near a stream. The number of
observed sediment delivery points generally increases with the length of road near a stream and
the number of stream crossings (Table 55).
Unauthorized, non-system routes can also be major contributors of sediment to adjacent
streams. Non-system roads and motorized trails lack the design features and maintenance
required for Helena National Forest system roads intended to mitigate negative impacts of use.
As a result, the impacts to water quality and riparian resources can be greater on unauthorized
routes than on system routes. During 2010 to 2011, Helena National Forest hydrologic
technicians inventoried previously unidentified non-system routes in portions of the Divide
Travel Planning area and documented impacts to adjacent water resources (Table 56). Although
nearly 100 miles of non-system routes were identified, there are almost certainly additional
routes on the landscape that were not identified.

these impaired stream reaches are not fully meeting the aquatic life and cold water fishery
designated beneficial uses (MT DEQ, 2014). The Lake Helena TMDL recommends a 60 percent
reduction in sediment delivery from system roads and 100 percent reduction for non-system

dependent on 6th-HUC in the planning area, with recommended reductions ranging from 40

Culverts (particularly those that are undersized) at road/stream crossings also present a risk of
large-scale sediment delivery through failure of the crossing. During a flood event, especially
following a wildfire, a culvert can become partially or fully obstructed, leading to its failure and a
breach of the road fill. This commonly leads to the erosion and deposition/transport of a large
volume of fine sediment into the stream system.

Non-Road Sediment Sources

Streambank erosion occurs in undisturbed drainages as a part of natural channel geomorphic
processes. Streambank erosion can be accelerated by management activities, for example cattle
trampling on grazing allotments. Along several planning-area streams, bank trampling was
evaluated by Helena National Forest hydrology crews during the summers of 2008-2010 using
the Region 1 Bank Alteration Protocol (Enk et al. 2005). Several reaches were observed to be
impacted by bank trampling (data available in the project record). Although this information is
now somewhat dated, the allotments surveyed are generally operating in the same manner and
trampled streambanks are likely a continuing source of sediment to area streams. The Lake
Helena TMDL estimated that anthropogenic streambank erosion accounted for 11 percent and
16 percent of the total sediment loading in Tenmile Creek and Sevenmile Creek, respectively (US
EPA, 2006). The Little Blackfoot TMDL reports that streambank erosion makes up 18 percent of
the annual sediment load in the drainage (MT DEQ and US EPA 2011). However, much of the
sediment generated from eroding streambanks in both TMDL planning areas comes from
agricultural areas downstream of the forest boundary (US EPA, 2006; MT DEQ and US EPA,
HYDROLOGY - 162

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

2011). There is also likely, accelerated streambank erosion along other streams within the
planning area due to past mining activities and cattle grazing.
Other sources of sediment in planning area streams include natural watershed erosion, erosion
from timber harvest activities on private and federal land and abandoned mining lands (see
cumulative effects discussion). Aside from natural erosion, these sources likely contribute less
sediment than erosion from roads, based on estimates made in the Lake Helena assessment and
other area TMDL reports (US EPA 2006; Montana DEQ 2004; MT DEQ and US EPA 2011).

Non-Sediment Impairments

A common impairment of stream water quality in the study area is elevated metals from past
mining activities. For example, an adit failure in the Tramway Creek drainage delivered elevated
metals loads to the Little Blackfoot River for several weeks during the winter of 2008-2009
(metals contamination in the flow from this adit has greatly diminished since the adit failure).
Another vector for metals transport to streams is contaminated roads, where mine waste rock
was used in road construction (e.g. Rimini Road along Tenmile Creek). Many of the streams in
the planning area do not fully meet designated beneficial uses as a result of metals impairments
(MT DEQ, 2014).

Water Yield

Water yield in most if not all of the drainages in the planning area will likely be measurably
greater than baseline conditions as a result of widespread tree mortality from insect infestation,
in concert with other activities that have removed large numbers of trees from the watersheds
(e.g. green-tree timber harvest) over the past few decades. Baseline conditions are defined to
be the expected water yield given a natural extent of forest cover throughout a watershed. In
practice, the concept of a static baseline water yield is of limited value, as forest cover in
undisturbed watersheds is generally in a state of flux based on several factors, including fire and
insect-induced mortality.

Water yield would not be meaningfully affected by a decision under any alternative of the
Divide Travel Plan, as it would designate only open and closed routes. Even if the plan facilitates
the eventual stabilization or removal of roads from the landscape and recovery of forest on
former road beds, the area of trees gained would be insignificant with respect to basin water
yield at the 6th-HUC scale. Decommissioning several hydraulically connected roads in a
watershed might alter the flow regime marginally, as efficient vectors of runoff (roads) are
removed from the landscape, although this too would be difficult to measure.

Riparian Conditions

Riparian areas include zones at the interface of land and water and are important ecological
niches on the landscape of the analysis area. The condition of riparian areas within the travel
planning area varies widely. Within grazing allotments, riparian areas are generally impacted by
cattle grazing and trampling. Several stream riparian areas were evaluated by Helena National
Forest hydrologic technicians using an abbreviated Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) protocol
(Prichard 1998) during the 2008 to 2010 field seasons (Table 58). Although this dataset is four to
six years old at this time, allotment management has not changed substantially. Thus, riparian
conditions are likely similar to what was observed during the survey years. The PFC approach
specifies field review by an interdisciplinary team of resource specialists, because this dataset
was not collected by such a team, the results presented in
HYDROLOGY - 163

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Table 58 is preliminary. The PFC methodology qualitatively evaluates riparian area vegetation,
channel and floodplain characteristics to arrive at an estimate of how well the riparian area
functions in dissipating flow energy and maintaining floodplain stability during larger flood
events. Past mining, livestock and native ungulate grazing, browsing and trampling and other
land use activities can all negatively impact riparian area form and function. Streams outside of
grazing allotments and legacy mining areas have in the past generally been rated as properly
functioning.

*PFC: Properly Functioning Condition; FAR: Functioning At Risk; NF: Not Functioning
Bold text indicates that the watershed contains a stream on the Montana 303(d) list as impaired by sediment

There are many non-riparian wetlands in the travel planning area, however their extent has not
been quantitatively described and their condition is largely unknown. Professional observation
within allotments has shown that wetlands in some locations see degradation from trampling
and grazing. Impacts from recreational activities (camping and campfires, off highway vehicle
use, etc.) have also been observed in non-riparian wetlands.

Hydrology, Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to All Alternatives

Road maintenance and improvements unrelated to this decision, but carried out as part of
routine operations or as part of future projects, would generally reduce sediment delivery from
system routes to streams for a period of years following the work. However, maintenance
backlogs continue to leave many system roads in need of improvement.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives
The action alternatives would each designate Helena National Forest system routes. Roads or
trails not designated system routes would by default be considered unauthorized routes and
would be closed to motorized use and available for decommissioning in future projects.
Unauthorized routes have been surveyed in some, but not all areas within the planning area and
have been observed in some areas to negatively impact water quality and riparian form and
function. Alternative 1 does not identify unauthorized routes as available for decommissioning.
Thus, implementation of Alternatives 2, 3, 4 or 5 would likely result in somewhat improved
water quality and riparian conditions within the planning area. This conclusion is based on the
assumption that unauthorized routes that impact water quality or riparian conditions would be
decommissioned as watershed improvement projects in the first few years following the
decision. However, the potential unauthorized route decommissioning would not be mandated
by the decision and therefore cannot be considered a direct or indirect effect of the decision.

Alternative 1, No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
Under alternative 1, no new management actions are proposed. If no new actions are
undertaken, no new management-related water resource impacts would occur. Past and
ongoing management activities, such as road use, OHV use, mining and livestock grazing would
continue to affect water resources. No new additions to watershed-scale cumulative effects
would be predicted, because no new management activities are proposed with alternative 1.

HYDROLOGY - 165

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
An irretrievable commitment represents a temporary loss of a resource, which can be replaced
over time. An irreversible commitment represents a total loss of a resource, which cannot be
replaced. An irretrievable commitment of alternative 1 would be continued sediment delivery to
streams from the existing road network and continued impact to riparian areas traversed by
roads. There are no irreversible commitments from this alternative.

Alternatives 2, 3, 4, 5
Direct and Indirect Effects
Direct and indirect effects of the four action alternatives are essentially the same and are
therefore presented together. Direct and indirect effects of the action alternatives are also
similar to those of the no-action alternative, in that no new construction is proposed and no
system roads are specified for decommissioning. New construction and decommissioning would
be left to subsequent analysis. However, implementation of all the action alternatives would set
the stage for decommissioning of any unauthorized routes. As stated above, the impacts of
unauthorized routes on water resources in the planning area have not been fully quantified, but
are likely to be considerable.
An additional indirect benefit of the action alternatives to water resources in the planning area
lies in their designation of routes. By placing all routes in the planning area into one of several
categories, the four action alternatives provide the framework for future projects to
decommission or stabilize roads. Any route designated as closed to wheeled motorized vehicles
yearlong could be decommissioned in a separate, subsequent NEPA analysis. The routes that fit
this definition include routes with the designated map code of 01-Res (Closed), 06-Res (oversnow vehicles only), MT-01-Res (trail closed to motorized vehicles) and NS-01-Res (non-system
routes). All of the action alternatives have more miles of roads in these categories that are
within the buffers specified by INFISH because Alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5 incorporate and close
routes that are currently unclassified. Similarly, roads in these categories under the action
alternatives have a higher number of stream crossings than do those under the no action
alternative, again because of the incorporation of miles that are currently unclassified.
Each of the action alternatives also incorporates a number of miles of currently unclassified
roads that would be designated as open, at least seasonally. Most of these routes are currently
on the landscape and are receiving motorized use. Under the action alternatives, these newly
incorporated routes would add to the Helena National Forest travel system at most 1.1 miles of
open roads within INFISH buffers and three open stream crossings (Table 59 and Table 60). Of
the eight roads that would be added to the system with alternative 5, FSR# 123-001 has the
greatest impact on water resources. This road, in the Ontario Creek drainage, parallels Ontario
Creek for 0.6 miles within the INFISH buffer. The route also has two culvert stream crossings
over tributaries to Ontario Creek and accesses a ford on FSR# 123-A1 (an open route that
connects FSR# 123-001 to FSR# 123). However, FSR# 123-001 provides an alternate route to
FSR# 4104-A1 and closing FSR# 4104-A1 to wheeled-motorized traffic would allow the closure
and stabilization of five stream crossings, including two problematic fords and close an
equivalent distance (0.6 miles) within the INFISH buffer. A route-by-route description for all
proposed unclassified routes is provided in the project record. Although the action alternatives
would incorporate up to 1.1 miles of road within INFISH buffers and three stream crossings, only
the action alternatives provide a mechanism by which to eventually decommission or stabilize

stream adjacent roads and unneeded stream crossings, a potential benefit to water quality and
riparian condition.
The potential for road decommissioning does not constitute a direct or indirect effect resulting
from the travel planning decision, but it should be considered a benefit. Additionally, the de
facto recognition of all unauthorized, non-system routes as illegal and available for
decommissioning is an indirect effect of all four action alternatives; in that the full benefit to
watershed values would not be realized until the routes were decommissioned, this decision
would not specify the decommissioning of these routes.

Bold text indicates that the watershed contains a stream on the Montana 303(d) list as impaired by sediment
* INFISH standards specify riparian habitat conservation areas (RHCAs) within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams and 150
feet of non-fish-bearing streams
** Watersheds not listed currently have no identified unclassified roads within INFISH buffers

With respect to water quality, the primary difference among the four action alternatives is in the
total number of road/stream crossings and miles of road within INFISH buffers (a 300-foot
buffer distance for fish-bearing and 150-foot buffer for non-fish-bearing streams) available for
future decommissioning or stabilization (Table 60 and Table 61). However, because no road
decommissioning would occur as a direct result of this decision, these differences are generally
not pertinent to direct or indirect effects of the alternatives. There would likely be some indirect
benefit to watershed conditions in the effective closure of roads to motorized use, in that over
time these roadbeds could be expected to revegetate and stabilize. However, without
decompaction and recontouring, restoration of subsurface flow-path connectivity and soil
productivity would not be realized until decades into the future. In any case, the differences do
give alternative 5 the greatest potential for future work that would benefit watershed values.

An additional difference between the four action alternatives occurs with the dispersed camping
rule. As described in chapter 2 of the FEIS, alternatives 2, 3 and 4 would permit off-road
wheeled motorized use within 300 feet of a road or trail for dispersed camping. Alternative 4
would also permit off-road vehicle use within 300 feet of roads for all legal recreational
activities. However, alternative 5 would permit wheeled motorized vehicle travel up to 30 foot
from water and 70 foot from a designated route while still allowing for many of the historic
dispersed campsites, greater than 70 feet from the road to remain. For all action alternatives,
wheeled motorized vehicle travel for camping opportunities would be allowed within the
specified distance of designated system routes, including roads and trails (unless signed
otherwise or specifically closed) as long as:
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity,
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resource occurs,
Travel off-route does not cross streams and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

Dispersed recreation sites currently exist and are heavily used within the planning area.
Implementation of any of the action alternatives would provide for the monitoring and
enforcement of the provisions for resource protection and would ensure that adverse impacts
are minimized. This component is particularly important to the quality of water resources
HYDROLOGY - 169

Environmental Impact Statement

because many dispersed sites are located adjacent to or provide access to waterbodies and lack
the design features found at developed sites to mitigate negative impacts of use. As a result, the
impacts of dispersed recreation use on soils, water quality and riparian resources can be greater
than impacts at developed sites. It is difficult to quantify the positive impact that restrictions for
dispersed recreation would have on water quality and riparian condition; however positive
effects would be realized with the removal of sediment sources and re-establishment of riparian
vegetation in areas previously accessible to dispersed camping. Alternative 5 would provide the
most potential benefits and resource protection, in that this alternative reduces the number of
heavily used dispersed recreation sites in sensitive riparian areas. With the implementation of
the action alternatives, monitoring of dispersed sites and enforcement of the Motorized Vehicle
Use Map (MVUM) established by this decision should help to prevent additional degradation of
water quality and riparian areas by minimizing the negative effects of off-road travel.

road network. Under each action alternative, the open road density would be reduced for most

benefits from this decision. In this analysis, a road was counted as open unless it had the
designation 01-RES (closed yearlong to motorized use) or 06-RES (over-snow use only), as these
are generally the only designations which would allow for stabilization or decommissioning in a
subsequent analysis and decision.

Implementing any action alternative for this project could require a programmatic Helena
National Forest Plan amendment for the planning area regarding the standard for big game
security index as described in chapter 2 of the FEIS. This proposed amendment would not
measurably impact water resources. Although managing seasonal closures would decrease
traffic levels during certain months, it would not directly eliminate the potential for sediment
delivery to streams from adjacent roads or road/stream crossings.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
Irretrievable commitments of the action alternatives would include continued sediment delivery
to streams from the existing road network and continued impacts to riparian areas traversed by
roads. There are no irreversible commitments from this alternative.

HYDROLOGY - 173

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Cumulative Effects
In addition to the impacts of roads on water quality, riparian condition and stream form and
function, several past and present federal and non-federal activities have affected and continue
to affect water quality, water yield and riparian health in the cumulative effects analysis area.
Past timber harvest has likely caused temporary increases in water yield and sediment delivery,
though these effects generally attenuate over time. In the past, mining has contributed metals
and sediment to stream channels in the watersheds. In some cases, ongoing mining activity
continues to be a chronic source of sediment to streams and of riparian degradation. Old mine
workings can also pose chronic or episodic water quality problems to forest streams, as in the
Tramway Creek (Little Blackfoot) adit plug failure of November 2008. Past pulses of elevated
sediment (e.g. from timber harvest or mining) can remain stored in stream channels (banks,
bed, floodplain) for many years following deposition. Continued grazing in riparian areas and
cattle trailing along streams within grazing allotments would likely continue to contribute
elevated sediment levels to streams in watersheds with grazing allotments. Road work
completed in recent years should reduce erosion and sediment delivery from certain projectarea roads (appendix B). Thus, some past and ongoing activities have been and continue to
generate elevated sediment delivery, whereas other activities will reduce sediment delivery.
This decision would not directly result in measurable additions to or reductions from cumulative
watershed effects.
In planning area watersheds, water yield most likely has been and would continue to be affected
by large-scale tree mortality. Large-scale loss of live trees reduces the volume of water removed
from a watershed by transpiration. Increases in water yield could result in higher peak flows
than would otherwise occur; higher flows have the potential to increase streambank and bed
scour. As discussed above, none of the alternatives would meaningfully affect water yield.
Extensive tree mortality could also potentially affect stream temperature in streams that cross
the affected stands through multiple mechanisms. For instance, whereas reduced shade may
result in an increase in stream temperature, increased base flow resulting from decreased
transpiration could have the opposite effect. Regardless, understory vegetation is generally
unaffected by insect mortality and would continue to provide shade to streams. Furthermore,
understory and riparian vegetation exposed to increased levels of sunlight (due to loss of
overstory canopy) can expand and provide additional shade (Gravelle & Link 2007). None of the
alternatives would measurably influence stream temperature.
Reasonably foreseeable federal and non-federal activities that could affect water quality, water
yield and riparian health in the cumulative effects analysis area include future timber harvest,
fuels-reduction projects, small-scale mining or failure of old mines, continued livestock impacts,
roads and fire. Foreseeable timber harvest and fuels reduction activities in the analysis area (e.g.
Telegraph Vegetation Project, Tenmile-South Helena Project) on the national forest are not
likely to substantially affect water quality or riparian area viability, assuming compliance with
the streamside management zone (SMZ) law and strict adherence to the Montana Department
of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) forestry best management practices (Montana
DNRC 2008). Timber sale road improvements (e.g. Telegraph, Tenmile projects) would be
expected to reduce sediment delivery from project area roads through implementation of road
best management practices. The road impacts on water quality, as outlined in the Affected
Environment section of this report, would not change as a direct result of any of the action
alternatives. However, the action alternatives lay the groundwork for future road stabilization
and decommissioning, which if implemented would reduce sediment delivery from forest roads.
HYDROLOGY - 174

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Other activities that would serve to reduce sediment delivery to streams in project watersheds
would likely be implemented periodically in the future within the cumulative effects analysis
area. Such activities include watershed improvement projects, culvert upgrades and effectively
implemented allotment management plan (AMP) revisions, among others.

Conclusions
Alternative 1, No Action
Currently, many streams do not fully support all beneficial uses within several of the planningarea 6th-HUC watersheds. In some of these impaired streams, beneficial uses are compromised
due at least in part to land use activities off of the Helena National Forest. Under the no action
alternative, full attainment of all beneficial uses would still not be met in planning-area
watersheds. Existing activities (e.g. forest roads) on the Helena National Forest portions of these
watersheds might in some cases not meet the state requirement that “all reasonable land, soil
and water conservation practices have been applied” (ARM 17.30.602) to minimize pollution,
although effects of forest roads and other management practices in place before April 1993 are
exempt from this standard (MCA 75-5-317). This exemption notwithstanding, many of these
roads could be considered to “cause excessive water pollution” (HNF Forest Plan, II/25) and
should thus be “corrected where feasible” (ibid.), or stand in violation of the Forest Plan. Road
maintenance can and should continue in the planning area under this alternative and would
address some chronic sediment sources on the existing road network. However, future road
decommissioning in the planning area would be greatly facilitated by a travel management
decision and would allow for work to restore areas that under existing conditions are chronic
sources of sediment. With these matters considered, alternative 1 would hold the least promise
of the alternatives for future work to reduce the impact of the Forest’s road network on water
quality and riparian conditions.

Alternatives 2, 3, 4, 5
The action alternatives are similar to alternative 1 in that the open-or-closed constraint of this
decision would not specifically provide for actions that would alleviate current water quality
problems in the planning area. Thus, the remarks above under Conclusions—Alternative 1 also
apply to alternatives 2 through 5, with the important exceptions that the action alternatives
would provide the framework for future system road decommissioning.
From the standpoint of protecting watershed values and reducing impacts of the Helena
National Forest travel system on water quality, a travel planning decision that contained specific
road closure measures would be more desirable than one that offered only open-or-closed
prescriptions. Therefore, Helena National Forest hydrology specialists recommend that NEPA
analyses for future decommissioning begin immediately upon finalizing the Divide Travel Plan
Decision, so that routes closed by this decision can be decommissioned as soon as funding
becomes available. Furthermore, many routes that are known sediment sources to streams on
the Montana list of water-quality-limited segments (WQLS) would remain open under all action
alternatives. All action alternatives would also include re-opening of some routes that are
currently closed year-round. However, a road opened by this decision may or may not become a
greater source of sediment, depending on level of use, maintenance, improvements and other
factors. Nevertheless, with respect to water resources, it is recommended that open roads
hydraulically connected to streams should receive improved maintenance, as funding allows; to

HYDROLOGY - 175

Environmental Impact Statement

move towards meeting the sediment reductions recommended in the Little Blackfoot and Lake
Helena TMDL documents.
The action alternatives would realize a net reduction in open-road stream crossings, open-road
miles within INFISH buffers and overall road density. The decision would be a positive step
toward route decommissioning and stabilization, which would result in reduction of sediment
delivery to streams throughout the project area. Thus, any of the action alternatives are
preferable to the no action alternative. Alternative 5 makes the most progress in addressing
road related watershed concerns, but each of the action alternatives would move toward Forest
Plan consistency on the maintenance of acceptable water quality in streams on the Helena
National Forest. The implementation of this plan would also move the Forest toward meeting
the Lake Helena and Little Blackfoot TMDL sediment reduction goals.

Forest Plan Consistency

Although several water bodies in the planning area are not currently meeting state water quality
standards (i.e. several streams are on the Montana 303(d) list of WQLS), the no-action
alternative is in compliance with water-related Forest Plan standards. The proposed travel plan,
under any of the action alternatives, does not specify any activities that would directly result in
the degradation of water quality in the planning area. In this sense, the travel plan is in
compliance with the Forest Plan standard requiring that a project resulting in water pollution be
modified or discontinued (see Regulatory Framework above). The Divide Travel Plan is also
consistent with the Forest Plan standard requiring that BMPs are employed in projects to
minimize non-point-source pollution, in that the decreased number of open routes would allow
limited road improvement funds to be concentrated on fewer roads, potentially decreasing the
maintenance backlog. Additionally, unauthorized routes would be available to be stabilized or
removed from the landscape, which would move the Forest Service towards meeting State
water quality recommendations. While this decision would not directly specify road
improvements or decommissioning, its route designations set the stage for this work.

FISHERIES
Regulatory Framework
1976 National Forest Management Act

Under the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA), the Forest Service is charged with
maintaining the viability of all existing native and desired non-native vertebrate species in a
planning area. A forest plan must identify management indicator species (MIS) that serve as
proxies for fulfilling this NFMA viability requirement. Westslope cutthroat trout (WCT) is the
fisheries management indicator species on the Helena National Forest. The regulations (36 CFR
219.9) impose a standard by requiring habitat objectives to be established for maintaining
viability of management indicator species throughout a planning area.

Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (section 2) is designed to protect imperiled species, which
are officially listed as endangered or threatened, from extinction as a “consequence of economic
growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation.” The stated
purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to provide a means to protect listed species and
FISHERIES - 176

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

“conserve the ecosystems upon which they depend.” Bull trout are listed as a threatened fish
species under the ESA and occur west of the Continental Divide on the Helena National Forest
within the Upper Clark Fork and Blackfoot River sub-basins.
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act states each Federal agency shall, in consultation with the Secretaries
of Interior and Commerce (Secretary), insure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is
not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or
adverse modification of designated critical habitat. This section of the Act defines the
consultation process, which is further developed in regulations promulgated at 50 CFR §402.
Section 7(a)(1) of the Act makes clear that all Federal agencies should participate in the
conservation and recovery of listed threatened and endangered species. It directs all other
Federal agencies to utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of the Act by carrying
out programs for the conservation of species listed pursuant to the Act. Under this provision,
Federal agencies often enter into partnerships with the Fish and Wildlife Service for
implementing and funding conservation agreements, management plans and recovery plans
developed for listed species.
Pertinent also to this project is road management guidance in the biological opinion (BO) on
Forest Plans (USDI 1998, pgs 23, 24, 71-73, 82, 89, 90, 94, 95, 100) that emphasize commitments
to implement existing standards in INFISH for ESA listed fish. Specific INFISH standards RF-2, RF3 and RF-4 will be a priority as discussed under the Helena National Forest Plan. From a
dispersed and developed recreation aspect, standard RM-2 (pg 9) specifies where adjustment
measures such as education, use limitations, traffic control devices and/or specific site closures
fail to meet Riparian Management Objectives and avoid adverse effects to native fish habitat,
eliminate the practice or occupancy. The 1998 biological opinion (pg 89) emphasizes given the
negative impact of roads on aquatic species and a habitat, moving forward on the development
of comprehensive plans addressing road system related effects is extremely important to bull
trout conservation.

Helena National Forest Plan

Direction for fisheries management under the Helena National Forest Plan (USDA 1986)
emphasizes maintenance or enhancement of cold-water habitat and water quality to meet the
needs of fisheries (Forest Plan pages II-1 and II-4). The general forestwide standard (pg II-22)
states: “Maintain quality water and habitat for fish by coordinating activities and by direct
habitat improvement.” The analysis will also identify opportunities, if any exist, for mitigating
adverse effects on water related beneficial uses.

For road management (pgs II-31 to II-32), the Plan states that unacceptable damage to soils,
watershed, fish, wildlife, or historical/archaeological sites will be mitigated by road restrictions
or other road management actions as necessary. Forest specialists representing soils and
watershed shall provide input to the road maintenance planning process to verify standards,
identify rehabilitation needs and designate roads which should be permanently closed for
resource protection. Road standard #3 (pg II-30) provides where forest specialists representing
soils, watershed and fisheries shall identify potential soil erosion, water quality and fisheries
problems and provide input, including project design features or mitigation measures, to the
development of road design standards.
In riparian areas, page II-35 of the Forest Plan specifies that wet meadows and wet areas are
closed to OHV use. Construction of roads will avoid stream course encroachment and

channelization, including the avoidance of all riparian areas except to cross them. In addition,
the Plan states the Forest will provide for vegetative cover adjacent to streams to serve as a
filter strip for sediment and maintain optimum water temperatures, as well as provide large
debris for long-term instream fish cover and pooling. For stream crossings, Plan standards call
for stream crossing structure design that allows free water flow and fish passage. Additionally,
the Plan requires riparian areas are to be managed compatible with dependent wildlife species.
The Forest Plan (USDA 1986) was amended on August 30, 1995 to incorporate the INFISH (USDA
Forest Service 1995). This interim strategy was designed to provide additional protection for
existing populations of native trout, especially bull trout, outside the range of anadromous
(moving from ocean to fresh water to spawn) fish, on 22 National Forests in the Pacific
Northwest, Northern and Intermountain Regions throughout the Columbia River Basin including
the Helena National Forest. This strategy, therefore, applies to riparian habitats for only those
watersheds west of the Continental Divide in the Divide Travel Planning area. INFISH
established riparian management objectives (RMOs) and riparian habitat conservation areas
(RHCAs) including project and site-specific standards and guidelines for drainages west of the
Divide in the interior Columbia River. INFISH standards pertinent to this project include road
standards RF-2, RF-3 and RF-4. RF-3c requires closing, stabilizing, or obliterating roads not
needed for future management activities and prioritizing these actions based on
current/potential damage to inland native fish in priority watersheds.

Forest Service Manual

The Forest Service Manual (FSM) contains legal authorities, policies, instructions and guidance
needed in the proper management of aquatic resources. Where other resource activities have
potential to impact fish habitat, FSM 2634 provides for integrating prescriptions during project
planning to help meet fisheries habitat objectives and to mitigate adverse impacts of resource
management activities. After a half-century of rigorous research, fine sediment originating from
a broad array of human activities has been singled out as the principal factor in the degradation
of stream fisheries (Waters 1995, pg 79). Water quality management shall recognize sediment
as the major non-point pollutant from Forest Service lands and establish guidelines and
procedures for preventing unacceptable resource impacts from introduced sediment (FSM
2542.02).
In addition, FSM 2672.1 imposes a strict standard for treatment of sensitive species. The Forest
Service designates westslope cutthroat trout (WCT) on the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species
(RFSS) list and therefore, confers special attention in WCT management to ensure their viability
and preclude trends toward endangerment that would result in warranting listing under the
Endangered Species Act. A biological evaluation (BE) is required to be completed to display the
effects of the selected alternative.

Assumptions
This analysis draws upon the following assumptions:
•
•

Research confirms roads have the greatest effect of all forest management practices on
erosion and sedimentation (Megahan and King 2004).
The stream road proximity indicator (high risk roads less than 300 feet of a stream)
provides a reasonable approximation of the hydrologic connectivity (sedimentation) and
physical alterations on streams.

The road-stream intersections indicator provides a reasonable estimate of stream
crossings that act as sediment delivery sites and fragment aquatic habitats.
Road-stream intersections and roads within 300 feet of a stream (high risk roads)
respond most predictably and reliably to the action alternatives as a barometer of
potential change.
An important effect to salmonid fish and habitat relates to increased sediment delivery
and deposition due to high risk roads and stream route intersections. (USDA FS 1998;
USDA FS 1999, pgs 143-145, 179-180)
Excess sediment delivery and deposition in stream channels is an important source of
mortality to trout (Chapman 1988, Waters 1995). Other variables (temperature,
dissolved oxygen, food, cover and angler harvest) are outside the scope of this analysis
as the project focuses on designating routes open for motorized vehicle use and gating
select routes identified for administrative closure.
Critical channel reaches (core sampling reaches) within a watershed generally represent
an estimate of sediment effects on spawning habitat for the watershed as a whole.
(Stowell et al., 1983)
For the purposes of this analysis, roads defined as “closed” include all those with the
following restriction codes: 01, 06, NS-01, MT-01-Res, NM and NOMTR. The “06”
restricted roads would be closed year-round to motorized use except where
snowmobiles would be allowed due to surrounding lands available for over-snow use.
All high risk roads, whether open or closed in this travel analysis can be considered for
future obliteration/recontour projects to protect soil, watershed and fish resources.
It is assumed that over-snow travel with snowmobiles presents no sediment risk to
streams except at stream ford crossings.
Sediment risk associated with winter travel increases on high risk road segments when
wheeled vehicles needed to accommodate both motorized (snowmobile) and nonmotorized recreationists travel these routes during periods of winter/springtime thaws.
The erosion and rutting hazard on roads becomes high under rapidly warming weather
conditions (e.g chinook winds) increasing the potential for road top materials to enter
the surface water system. (Burroughs & King 1989; Kennedy 1997; Walch 2008)
The closure of existing open roads tends to decrease road surface erosion and sediment
delivery to the surface water system over the long-term due to passive revegetation of
the road prism.

Information Used
Information on fish populations within the Divide Travel Planning area was drawn from updated
GIS fishery spatial layers and associated linked data. Geographic information systems spatial
layers were derived from a variety of sources including past and ongoing fisheries electrofishing
surveys conducted by Forest Service and Fish, Wildlife and Parks fisheries personnel over the
past 30 years, WCT sub-basin updates in 2009, WCT biological evaluations, past NEPA fisheries
reports and bull trout biological assessments in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS). Additionally, information specific to bull trout watersheds came from
watershed baselines for the Little Blackfoot River portion of the Upper Clark Fork bull trout
Section 7 Watershed (USDA 2000) including any updates to those baselines for consultation with
the USFWS.

Divide Travel Plan

Relevant to measures used to evaluate effects of roads on fisheries resources, GIS road and
stream GIS coverages helped to estimate the number of stream/road intersections (culverts,
bridges, fords) and miles of high risk roads (those inside INFISH buffers). In lieu of complete
field data across portions or entire areas encompassed by twenty-six (26) NRCS 6th field HUCs,
the transportation and stream coverages were attributed in GIS as an aid to project ongoing and
potential effects on fish habitat for the various alternatives. A roads database for the Divide
Travel Planning area was the basis for monitoring any changes in measures used to evaluate
potential effects on fish habitat.
Information to help characterize fish habitat conditions in the planning area was drawn from
past sediment and riparian monitoring data, cursory fish habitat condition surveys, fish species
and distribution surveys, road sediment surveys and culvert assessments on the Helena National
Forest. All resource information was collected by Forest Service fisheries and hydrology
personnel for over the past 28 years. Other sources included previous analysis specific to the
Little Blackfoot River and Tenmile Creek drainages, the Divide Landscape Analysis, stream permit
applications and westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout biological evaluations. Watershed
baselines for the Little Blackfoot River portion of the Upper Clark bull trout Section 7 Watershed
(USDA 2000) including updates to the various sub-watershed documents were also used.
Field data from road sediment inventories and culvert inventories/assessments since 2008 in
sub-watersheds south of Highway 12 in the project area are mostly complete and on-going.
These surveys will provide a baseline comparison for the indicators and observed effects on the
ground within this analysis area. Road surveys within the Divide Travel Plan area north of
Highway 12 are ongoing and will be strategically conducted to address the highest risk areas for
listed species and their habitat.

Methodology and Scientific Accuracy
This report follows procedures outlined in Report FS-683, Roads Analysis: Informing Decisions
about the National Forest Transportation System (USDA Forest Service, 1999) customized to
local situations. The effects section takes the broad scale forestwide roads analysis down to the
finer sub-watershed scale (6th field hydrologic unit code (HUC)) specific to the Divide Travel Plan
area. Key road related issues identified are: stream substrate conditions, road proximity to
streams and stream crossings/intersections. Two measures determined most useful at
quantifying these important road/fish habitat interactions were: 1) high risk roads (roads within
INFISH buffers) and 2) stream/road intersections (crossings).
These two measures, used to evaluate effects, were chosen with an understanding about how
the mechanisms impact fish habitat (sediment, channel alterations and habitat fragmentation)
are tied specifically to high risk roads and stream crossings. Therefore, the road and stream
coverages were attributed in GIS for all sub-watersheds encompassed by the project area. This
GIS based analysis systematically examined the motorized transportation system aimed at the
two measures in evaluating potential effects on fish habitat. Determining miles of high risk road
involved buffering the stream coverage by a 300-foot distance each side of streams for fishbearing habitat and 150-foot distance for non-fish-bearing streams consistent with INFISH
riparian habitat conservation areas (buffers), then clipping out all road segments within these
buffers as a reasonable approximation of the length of high risk roads in each sub-watershed.
Stream/road intersection points were produced by intersecting the road and stream layers and
placing the intersection nodes into point coverage for each sub-watershed.

Streams delineated on topographic maps may, however, under represent actual streams;
conversely crenulated contour coverages may over represent streams depending on the rules
applied and individual crenulation (USDAFS 1999, pgs 140 and 180). The accuracy of the
indicators in this analysis is probably moderate at best. Past analyses in the North Belts Travel
Plan found that comparing GIS based stream/road intersections with actual on-the-ground
measurements amongst four arterial routes indicated the GIS coverages over represented the
amount of stream/road intersections by approximately 30 percent. Conversely, field checking
stream/road intersections for the Cabin Gulch Vegetation Treatment project found that GISbased stream/road intersections were under represented up to 45 percent of the actual number
of intersections in East Cabin Gulch, yet GIS coverages over represented this indicator 21
percent in the North Fork Deep Creek drainage. Therefore, this analysis likely provides a
reasonable approximation of relative differences between the alternatives. Ground truthing can
provide accurate data as it relates to actual miles of high risk roads and number of stream/road
intersections in a watershed. Portions of the analysis area have been ground-truthed and this
monitoring is ongoing.
To separate the differences amongst alternatives since there is no ground disturbance or
physical changes planned to the transportation system under this “open/closed” roads
administrative decision, a risk/benefit assessment was performed for each road segment by subwatershed. The benefits of closing currently open segments of road to motorized use yearround is based on the premise that erosion and sedimentation are reduced as a function of
passive re-vegetation and lack of motorized disturbance over closed roadbeds in the long-term.
Additionally, permanently closing roads sets the stage for future road treatment opportunities
that fully restore slopes and drainages impacted by roads to contour over the long-term.
Conversely, the consequence of opening currently closed segments of road to motorized use
relates to the potential to destabilize the road bed and inhibit re-vegetation over the long-term.
Additionally, access decisions to open closed roads have implications for the extent and nature
of recreational use and subsequent effects on fish habitat (Clark and Gibbons 1991, pg 476).

Fisheries, Affected Environment
Introduction
This section is organized under two major subsections: fish populations and fish habitat. The
first discusses the current known distribution and status of fish populations in the Divide Travel
Plan area including discussions about non-native and native fish species that occupy project area
streams. The second subsection gives an overview of stream habitat conditions and trends as
influenced by past and ongoing land-use activities that can affect fish populations.

Analysis Area
The Divide Travel Planning area encompasses twenty-six (26) National Resource Conservation
Service (NRCS) 6th field HUCs, commonly referred to as sub-watersheds. Four sub-watersheds
are dropped from the fisheries analysis area since there are no fish populations and/or roads
occurring in the portion of these sub-watersheds encompassed by the planning area. Therefore,
22 sub-watersheds - seven east of the Continental Divide and 15 west of the Divide are
considered for potential effects to fisheries resources in this travel planning decision.
Natural processes and landuse activities unique at the sub-watershed scale influence local fish
habitats independently of other sub-watershed units. Logically the geographic unit of
preference is delineated at the sub-watershed (6th-field HUC) scale as the range for examining

direct/indirect and cumulative effects in the fisheries analysis area. It is possible, however, for
water quality in a sub-watershed to be influenced by activities in another sub-watershed located
upstream from it.

Fish Populations in Planning Area
Trout species occupy approximately 140.7 miles of stream in the planning area. Other fish
species found in the planning area include longnose suckers and sculpins. Appendix A of the
fisheries specialist report shows maps that display the current known distribution of native and
non-native salmonid trout in the Divide Travel Plan area respectively.
In the Upper Missouri sub-basin side of the Divide Travel Plan area non-native trout occupy
approximately 27.7 miles (96 percent) of fish habitat while native WCT (90+ percent pure)
occupy about 1.6 miles (5.5 percent) of available fish habitat. In the Upper Clark Fork sub-basin
side of the planning area, non-native trout occupy about 73.1 miles (65.3 percent) of fishbearing habitat while native WCT (those populations 90+ percent pure included those untested)
occupy about 109.7 miles (98 percent) of fish habitat. Although rare, bull trout, a native char
listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, had occupied about 20.9 miles (18.7
percent) of fish habitat in the Upper Clark Fork sub-basin side of the planning area; however,
recent electrofishing surveys conducted from 2000 to 2010 suggest these numbers are
questionable. The Little Blackfoot River local bull trout population is believed nearly extinct
based on extensive sampling efforts by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks surveys in 2007 and
2008 and sampling by Forest Service fishery personnel in 2010 (USDA 2013, pgs 69-71).
The Divide Travel Plan area straddles both east and west sides of the Continental Divide and
includes six fish-bearing sub-watersheds in the Upper Missouri 4th field HUC (sub-basin) and 15
fish-bearing sub-watersheds in the Upper Clark Fork 4th field HUC. Table 64 lists six subwatersheds east of the Divide having streams supporting a fishery. One of the seven eastside
watersheds having no fish populations on forest is Lower Tenmile Creek and is therefore not
listed in Table 64.
Table 65 outlines the 15 sub-watersheds west of the Divide having fish-bearing streams.
A summary of key aspects of known fish populations in the planning area is provided below in
two separate tables. Table 64 summarizes aspects of fish populations found in the Upper
Missouri sub-basin (east) side of the project area and Table 65 summarizes aspects of fish
populations for the Upper Clark Fork sub-basin (west) side of the project area.

Non-native fishes

Non-native fish in planning area streams include rainbow trout, brook trout, brown trout and
Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT). These non-native trout do not occur in all streams or in equal
proportions throughout planning area streams. The introduction of non-native trout into
Montana streams began with brook trout, rainbow trout and brown trout in 1889 (Brown 1971)
starting with the Madison River drainage. Yellowstone cutthroat trout, as the name implies, is
native to the Yellowstone River drainage in southwest and southcentral Montana. They have
been used extensively for stocking mountain lakes on both sides of the Continental Divide.
Unknown at the time of these early introductions, non-native trout impose inherent risks to the
viability of native westslope cutthroat trout populations that historically occupied area streams
on both sides of the Divide and to native bull trout populations indigenous west of the Divide.
Adverse interactions from introduced fish species is a principal way in which the negative effects
of habitat alteration on bull trout can be compounded (MBTSG 1998, pg 46-47; Shepard 2004).

Rainbow trout were introduced from numerous west coast hatchery stocks into virtually every
suitable habitat in Montana beginning in 1889 (Brown 1971; Fredenburg and Gould 1990).
Within the planning area, rainbow trout are found in three 6th HUC watersheds east of the
Divide and west of the Divide they are found only in a private pond in the North Trout Creek
sub-watershed. Rainbow trout hybridize with native westslope cutthroat trout risking the loss
of genetic integrity in localized westslope cutthroat trout populations. Evidence of rainbow
hybridism in westslope cutthroat trout populations has been confirmed in Cottonwood Gulch
east of the Divide and in North Trout Creek west of the Divide. The local westslope cutthroat
trout population in the North Fork Trout Creek has a 47 percent rainbow genetic contribution
based on testing by Leary and Sage (1990). In addition to hybrid influence, rainbow trout
compete with native fishes for food, space and cover.
Yellowstone cutthroat trout (YCT) are the other cutthroat trout subspecies in Montana and they
are indigenous only to the Yellowstone River basin of southeast and south central Montana,
including northwest Wyoming. This cutthroat subspecies has been used extensively for stocking
mountain lakes in Montana outside of the Yellowstone River basin (Fredenburg and Gould
1990). Although no yellowstone cutthroat trout populations occur in any one sub-watershed of
the Divide Travel Plan area, past stocking of this subspecies in or near the planning area is
evident. Like rainbow trout, yellowstone cutthroat trout also readily hybridize with westslope
cutthroat trout. The local westslope cutthroat trout population in Upper Silver Creek HUC east
of the Divide was confirmed genetically introgressed with yellowstone cutthroat trout and
LaSalle Gulch and portions of upper Dog Creek west of the Divide also tested slightly
introgressed with yellowstone cutthroat trout in 1989. The latest genetic sampling of westslope
cutthroat trout in Dog Creek by Montana Department Fish Wildlife and Parks fisheries (MFWP)
crews in 2008, however, has found westslope cutthroat trout to be genetically pure throughout
the stream.
Brook trout were first introduced into Montana in 1889 from eastern North America, primarily
from the Appalachian Mountains. It was extensively propagated and distributed throughout the
state until 1954. Brook trout prefer cold, small headwater streams, which are also preferred by
most remaining native westslope cutthroat trout populations. Because brook trout interact
negatively (predation and competition) with indigenous westslope cutthroat trout, they can
substantially reduce or totally eliminate local westslope cutthroat trout populations altogether
from their historic habitats (Likness 1984; Griffith 1988; Rieman and Apperson 1989; Fauch
1988, 1989). Peterson and Fausch (2003) concluded brook trout depress cutthroat trout

Environmental Impact Statement

populations at mid-elevations through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce age 0 and age
1 cutthroat trout survival; whereas, westslope cutthroat trout populations restricted to high
elevations by brook trout invasion decline because an abiotic factor (very low temperatures)
increases recruitment failure. Since brook trout spawn in the fall and are more sedimenttolerant than native cutthroat, they tend to have a competitive size and numerical advantage
over westslope cutthroat trout in their first year of life. Native bull trout are also at risk from
brook trout predation and competition, as well as introgressive hybridization with this species
(Kanda et al, 2002). Brook trout currently occupy 15 of the 22 6th HUC watersheds in the
analysis area.
The brown trout is native to Europe and was first introduced into Montana in 1889 by the
Bureau of Sport Fisheries (Brown 1971). Most varieties originated from Germany or Scotland
and were distributed in most of the larger streams from state and federal hatcheries (Brown
1971; Holton 1990). Stocking was discontinued after 1956 since natural propagation was found
to be adequate. Brown trout prefer larger, low gradient streams and pose a threat to both
westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. This species is highly competitive in lower gradient
streams and more predaceous on other fish than are rainbows or cutthroat trout (Fredenburg
and Gould 1990). When brook trout and/or brown trout are present or have access to bull trout
habitat, the ability of bull trout (and other native species) to survive and recover from habitat
alterations can be irreversibly compromised (MBTSG 1998, pg 47). Brown trout prevail west of
the Divide in this travel planning area especially in the main stem of the Little Blackfoot River.
Planning area sub-watersheds occupied by brown trout include Upper Dog Creek, Telegraph
Creek, Snowshoe Creek and Ontario Creek. They are also found downstream from the Forest
boundary in many tributaries to the Little Blackfoot River.
Many subsequent stockings of non-native species continued in larger streams of Montana by
fisheries agencies and local citizens; however, stocking of brook trout and brown trout was
largely discontinued in the 1950s once natural reproduction was adequate to sustain fish
populations. Rainbow trout stocking in streams was later discontinued beginning in the early
1970s after it was determined that hatchery raised rainbow stocked in streams containing wild
rainbow trout proved counter-productive to the natural productivity of wild rainbow. However,
stocking of hatchery rainbow (and yellowstone cutthroat trout) into Montana lakes and ponds is
still practiced in Montana to meet recreational fish management goals. Currently, brook trout
are the most pervasive of introduced fish species in the planning area occupying over 88 miles
(79 percent) of fish habitat.

Native Species

Native fishes present within the planning area include the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species
listed westslope cutthroat trout, listed threatened bull trout, mountain whitefish, slimy sculpin
and longnose suckers. In addition, an invertebrate species known as the western pearlshell
mussel was added to the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species listed list of aquatic sensitive
species in 2011 and is considered in this report. Further discussion about sensitive westslope
cutthroat trout including the western pearlshell mussel and listed bull trout follows under
separate sections addressing each species.
Mapping of sculpin and whitefish populations has not been a priority and therefore, their
distribution within the project area is not well-defined other than both species have been found
extensively throughout the main stem Little Blackfoot River and Dog Creek. Sculpins are most
abundant in cold, rocky riffle areas and because of their small size (two to three inches) they are

considered an important forage fish for trout. Mountain whitefish are widespread both sides of
the Divide and occur in large schools during fall spawning runs to broadcast their eggs over
gravel bars. Like sculpins, small whitefish provide an important forage fish for larger trout
(Fredenburg and Gould 1990, pg 24).

Westslope Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi)

Status Overview

Westslope cutthroat trout are one of two subspecies of cutthroat trout, which have been
designated Montana’s state fish. Regionally, westslope cutthroat trout are one of several
distinct interior subspecies of cutthroat trout (Behnke 1992, pgs 2 through 5). Currently
westslope cutthroat trout are referred to as a Species of Concern by the State of Montana, a
Special Status Species by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and a Sensitive Species by the
northern region of the US Forest Service. On the Helena National Forest, westslope cutthroat
trout have been identified as a management indicator species. Factors associated with declines
in westslope cutthroat trout have lead up to these special categories include introductions of
non-native fish, habitat loss or degradation and over exploitation (Hanzel 1959; Liknes and
Graham 1988; Behnke 1992; McIntyre and Rieman 1995).

In May of 1997, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) were petitioned to list westslope cutthroat
trout as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In 2000, several environmental groups
brought suit to compel the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue its final determination as to the
species’ listing. After the Fish and Wildlife Service determined listing westslope cutthroat trout
was “not warranted” at that time, the plaintiffs filed suit claiming the FWS failed to reconcile its
recognition of hybridization as a threat to westslope cutthroat trout viability. Subsequently, the
Fish and Wildlife Service initiated a new comprehensive status review for westslope cutthroat
trout in 2002 and determined, based on best scientific information available, that introgressed
westslope cutthroat trout with less than 20 percent of their genes derived from another taxon
would still conform morphologically to the taxonomic description of westslope cutthroat trout.
After considering evidence supporting its morphology-based approach to classifying westslope
cutthroat trout populations (including broad westslope cutthroat trout distribution, habitat
available on public lands and state and federal conservation efforts underway), the District
Court for the District of Columbia concluded in March, 2007 in favor of the Fish and Wildlife
Service’s Reconsidered Listing Determination that westslope cutthroat trout is not warranted for
listing at this time.
The westslope cutthroat trout status assessment by Shepard et al. (2003) estimates that of the
39 percent of historical habitat westslope cutthroat trout currently occupy in Montana, the
decline of the westslope cutthroat trout subspecies is most pronounced east of the Continental
Divide. East of the Divide, genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout populations occupy less
than 5 percent of their historical habitat (Shepard et al. 2003, pgs 87-90) and most westslope
cutthroat trout populations have been found restricted to headwater streams primarily above
barriers. Consistent with findings for westslope cutthroat trout east of the Divide, westslope
cutthroat trout populations in the Upper Missouri sub-basin side of the planning area account
for only 5.5 percent of the fish-bearing habitat. These isolated resident westslope cutthroat
trout populations (isolates) are considered extremely important to the conservation and
restoration of westslope cutthroat trout in Montana.
Management and conservation actions undertaken on behalf of westslope cutthroat trout in
Montana include: more restrictive fishing regulations; accelerated westslope cutthroat trout

surveys and inventories; non-lethal genetic testing protocols; development of captive brood
stocks for stocking/recovery programs; education programs; and stepped-up compliance with
water and habitat protection laws, policies and guidelines; non-native species removals; and
habitat improvement. These efforts culminated in a formalized Montana MOU and
Conservation Agreement for westslope cutthroat trout (MDFWP 1999) co-signed by nine
government agencies and conservation groups including the Forest Service and Bureau of Land
Management. The initial agreement was a five-year agreement, which expired in 2005 and has
been superseded by the 2007 MOU and Conservation Agreement (MDFWP 2007) to expedite
conservation measures for westslope cutthroat trout and yellowstone cutthroat trout
throughout their respective historical ranges in Montana.
One outcome of the latest westslope cutthroat trout status review and agreement is the
designation of three categories of cutthroat trout populations:
Core populations – Cutthroat populations having no evidence of hybridization (i.e. genetically
pure) that can serve as donors for restoration efforts.
Conservation populations – Populations that include all the “core” populations as described
above plus those that have unique ecological and behavioral traits of the subspecies.
Introgressed conservation populations will typically be less than 10 percent introgressed.
Sportfish populations – Wild or hatchery-sustained cutthroat populations that are managed
especially for the benefit of recreational fisheries. Often these are found in high mountain
lakes. Some wild sport-fish populations may have conservation value.
All conservation populations of westslope cutthroat trout merit additional management
emphasis on preserving them (Shepard et al. 2003, pg 8). Conservation coordination focuses on
species management with the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks as the lead agency and habitat
management on NFS/BLM lands with land management agencies taking lead responsibility.
Regional/sub-basin scale conservation plans developed by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks in
cooperation with land management agencies will identify management needs of westslope
cutthroat trout conservation populations required to accomplish the conservation and
restoration objectives outlined in the 2007 agreement across each 4th field HUC or sub-basin.

Distribution

On the Helena National Forest westslope cutthroat trout are found in the Blackfoot River, Little
Blackfoot River portion of the Upper Clark Fork River, Upper Missouri River, Dearborn River,
Smith River and Boulder River 4th field HUCs. Distribution of westslope cutthroat trout within
these 4th HUC hydrologic units extends into a number of streams on the Helena National Forest
with many more streams supporting westslope cutthroat trout west of the Continental Divide
than east of the Divide. Only one stream on the Helena Forest in the Boulder drainage supports
westslope cutthroat trout. Although the Dearborn River supports westslope cutthroat trout in
its headwaters on the Lewis and Clark Forest, there are no known westslope cutthroat trout on
Helena National Forest streams within the Dearborn 4th field HUC. The westslope cutthroat
trout distribution information is detailed on 4th field hydrologic unit maps available at the
Helena Forest Supervisor’s Office fishery files and the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Park’s Helena
office. Many of the streams on the Helena Forest that support westslope cutthroat trout are
small with many young-of-the-year and yearling westslope cutthroat trout found in Helena
National Forest streams less than 18 inches in width.

Divide Travel Plan

For the Divide Travel Plan area, westslope cutthroat trout are distributed both sides of the
Continental Divide. The subspecies is well distributed throughout the Little Blackfoot River and
its tributaries of the travel plan area accounting for up to 98 percent of occupied fish habitat.
Conversely, westslope cutthroat trout are poorly distributed east of the Divide within the travel
plan area accounting for only about 5.5 percent of occupied fish habitat. A fish distribution
map showing the range of native salmonids within the Divide Travel Plan area is shown as figure
1 in appendix A of the fisheries specialist report.

General Life History Characteristics

Detailed information on Life History, Habitat Relations and biotic interactions for westslope
cutthroat trout is discussed in depth in McIntyre and Rieman (1995 pages 1-6), Behnke (1992
pgs 77-87) and Liknes and Graham (1988 pgs 53-59) and is summarized below. Additional
citations are included if information varies from what is described by these authors.

Westslope cutthroat trout are adfluvial, fluvial, or resident. All three forms may use the same
river and stream system. They begin to mature at age three but usually spawn first at age four
or five. They spawn between March and July at water temperatures near 50 degrees
Fahrenheit. The ratio of females to males has been found to vary from 1:1 up to 6:1. Alternate
year spawning has been documented and repeat spawning also occurs, but generally spawning
more than twice during an individual westslope cutthroat trout lifespan does not occur.
Mortality following spawning has ranged from 27 percent to 60 percent with mortality rates
slightly higher for males than for females.
Westslope cutthroat trout are generally thought to spawn in small tributaries. The headwaters
and upper reaches of large river basins tend to be dominated by fluvial and resident forms while
tributaries to lakes primarily support adfluvial fish. Migratory forms may spawn in the lower
reaches of tributaries used by resident westslope cutthroat trout. Body size influences the
nature of habitat selected for spawning.
Fry generally emerge from gravels between mid-June and mid-July, although emergence
extending into August has been documented (Averitt and MacPhee 1971). Fry emerge following
yolk absorption at a length of about 20 millimeters. After emergence many fry disperse
downstream. Peaks in downstream movements of fry generally coincide with peaks in stream
discharge. After an initial exodus of fry, the offspring of migratory forms may remain one to
four years in their natal stream. Most juvenile migrants leave tributaries in spring or early
summer and most movement is at night.
Adult and sub-adult fluvial westslope cutthroat trout often make long seasonal migrations. This
type of migration is characterized by downstream movements in the fall followed by upstream
movements in the spring. Downstream movement is presumably related to find areas of
suitable winter habitat. Little or no winter movement was found in systems with an abundance
of high quality pools that could be used for winter habitat.

Habitat Relations
Waters inhabited by WCT generally are cold and nutrient poor. Growth varies widely, but is
probably strongly influenced by habitat productivity. Generally growth is higher for migrant
forms that spend some period of time in larger rivers (fluvial) or lakes (adfluvial). Although
westslope cutthroat trout can be found throughout large river basins spawning and early rearing
generally occurs in headwater streams. Spawning habitat has been characterized as gravel
substrates ranging in size from 2 millimeters to 75 millimeters, mean water depths ranging from
17 centimeters to 20 centimeters and mean velocities of 0.3 to 0.4 meters per second.
FISHERIES - 190

Environmental Impact Statement

Substrate composition is believed to strongly influence survival. Highly embedded substrates
may be particularly harmful to juveniles that typically over-winter between spaces in stream
cobbles and rubble. Evidence for the negative influence of fine sediment is widespread and in
general, increased sediment in substrates must be viewed as an increased risk for any westslope
cutthroat trout population.
Westslope cutthroat trout micro-habitats are associated with velocities ranging 0.1 to 0.3
meters per second. Westslope cutthroat trout less than 100 millimeters in length are generally
found in pools and runs while larger cutthroat trout are found in pools. Generally stream
reaches with numerous pools support the highest densities of fish. Habitats that provide some
form of cover also seem to be preferred. In winter small fish tend to use areas where cover is
provided by the interstitial spaces in the stream substrates. Larger fish congregate in pools
during the winter.

Biotic Interactions

Westslope cutthroat trout co-evolved with mountain and pygmy whitefish, several sculpins,
cyprinids (minnows) and catastomids (suckers). In Columbia River tributaries the westslope
cutthroat trout is most commonly associated with bull trout, resident and anadromous rainbow
trout or steelhead and chinook salmon.
Where bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout overlap in distribution the species have
selectively segregated their use of habitat and prey with westslope cutthroat trout focusing on a
diet primarily of invertebrates.
Where introductions of non-native rainbow trout have occurred the two species tend to
segregate themselves with rainbow in downstream reaches and westslope cutthroat trout in the
upper reaches. However, segregation is incomplete and hybridization is common. Yellowstone
cutthroat trout were commonly used as a stocking source, especially for mountain lakes and
some larger rivers; therefore, hybridization between Yellowstone cutthroat trout and westslope
cutthroat trout is also common.
Brook trout have replaced cutthroat trout populations, including the westslope cutthroat trout
subspecies, in many streams (Peterson and Fausch 2003b) and several authors have discussed
the possible mechanisms by which this occurs (Peterson et al 2004; Shepard 2004; De Staso and
Rahel 1994). There is some evidence that water temperatures and increased water velocities
associated with higher stream gradients are important factors (De Staso and Rahel 1994). In
addition to temperature and stream gradient Peterson et al (2004) suggested that a very
important factor in the interspecific species population dynamics between brook trout and
cutthroat species may be the interaction of brook trout with age classes one and two of
cutthroat trout. When there is much overlap of brook trout with the young age classes of
westslope cutthroat trout, Peterson et al (2004) found that westslope cutthroat trout did not
compete well. Upstream movements by brook trout during spring runoff and a general
tendency to move upstream are possibly factors allowing adult and sub-adult brook trout to
extend their upstream distributions into habitats occupied by cutthroat trout (Peterson and
Fausch, 2003a). Shepard (2004) discusses past literature in relation to his findings and suggests
that a number of factors or combination of factors such as pools, increased woody debris,
increased fine sediment levels and increased water temperatures may facilitate brook trout
invasion.

Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus)

Status Overview and Upper Clark Fork River Core Population

Bull trout were listed as a threatened species within the Columbia River and Klamath River
Basins beginning July 10, 1998 by the Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS 1998). In November
1999 all populations of bull trout were listed threatened within the coterminous United States
pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (USFWS 1999). Section 7(a)(2) of the
Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 as amended requires all federal agencies to review
actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them to ensure such actions do not jeopardize the
continued existence of listed species.

Since 1999 three separate draft bull trout recovery plans were developed by the Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS), but none were finalized. However, these draft recovery plans served
to identify recovery actions across the range of bull trout and provide a framework to
implement numerous recovery actions. Then in 2014 the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a new
Revised Draft Recovery Plan for bull trout (USFWS 2014) that supersedes and replaces all
previous recovery plans. This revised draft recovery plan builds upon new information and
studies about bull trout and revises recovery criteria from earlier draft recovery plans to focus
on effective management of threats to bull trout at the core area level. The 2014 Revised Draft
Recovery Plan reorganized the recovery unit structure for the coterminous United States bull
trout population by combining the previous 27 recovery units (RUs) into six newly defined
recovery units consistent with Distinct Population Segment (DPS) policy. Drainages west of the
Divide on the Helena portion of the Helena-Lewis & Clark NF fall within the Columbia
Headwaters recovery unit.
Recovery units are broken down into bull trout core areas defined as a combination of core
habitat (habitat that could supply all elements for long-term security of bull trout) and a core
population (a group of one or more local bull trout populations that exist within core habitat). A
local population is considered to be the smallest group of fish representing an interacting
reproductive unit, which may occupy a single headwater tributary or complex of headwater
tributaries. Therefore, core areas represent the functional equivalent of a meta-population for
bull trout and the local populations within these core areas are interconnected by occasional
dispersal amongst them thereby potentially sharing some genetic characteristics. Core areas
constitute the basic unit on which to gauge bull trout recovery within a recovery unit. Within
the Columbia Headwaters recovery unit there are 35 bull trout core areas of which two
encompass drainages west of the Divide on the Helena and Lewis & Clark National Forests: 1)
the Blackfoot River core area and 2) Upper Clark Fork River core area (formerly Clark Fork River
Section 1).
The Upper Clark Fork River core area (UCFCA) includes all of the Clark Fork River and its
tributaries upstream of the Blackfoot River (near the site of former Milltown Dam). Since 1906,
Milltown Dam isolated bull trout populations in the UCFCA from the rest of the basin till its
removal in 2008. Currently, there are believed to be approximately 100 to 250 adult bull trout
remaining in the UCFCA and most bull trout are resident. Three local populations make up the
bulk of bull trout within this core area. They include: Warm Springs, Twin Lakes and Boulder
Creek outside of the Helena National Forest. Harvey Creek (Lolo NF) and Little Blackfoot River
(Helena National Forest) are also included but both are no longer designated as local
populations by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Together, these five resident populations are
currently not functioning as a connected fluvial population. It is possible that a few individual
bull trout from the various local populations migrate downstream to the Upper Clark Fork River
FISHERIES - 192

Environmental Impact Statement

or to lower reaches of streams within a given local population, but have escaped detection.
Hence, there is some possibility for a remnant fluvial population.
Bull trout in the Little Blackfoot River drainage are believed to be nearly extinct based on
extensive sampling efforts by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and Forest Service fisheries
crews from 2007 to 2010 and therefore, considered the weakest local population in the Upper
Clark Fork River core area. The 2010 final rule on bull trout critical habitat removed the Little
Blackfoot as critical habitat; therefore, its relative importance to the core area was assessed as
low. Currently, bull trout are known present only in three of 16 6th field HUCs on Helena
National Forest lands. Table 65 shows the 6th field HUCs with the streams known to recently
support bull trout. Although not shown on fish distribution maps or in Table 65, bull trout were
also documented in lower Dog Creek on private reaches below the Divide Travel Plan area.
Declines of bull trout in the Little Blackfoot drainage have been attributed largely to non-native
species interactions. Bull trout have suffered from hybridization and competition with brook
trout in the headwater reaches and tributaries of the Little Blackfoot (hybrids have been
documented) and from brown trout competition and predation in the middle and lower reaches
of the river. Additionally, multiple water diversions below the Forest contribute to low flows
and increased water temperatures that inhibit fish movements and production capabilities in
the river. Habitat alterations from highway and railroad locations in conjunction with sediment
delivery from roads and agricultural development below the Forest has affected stream
morphology and reduced fish habitat quality. There is general lack of connectivity from the river
below the Forest to upper reaches of most tributaries during bull trout migration to traditional
spawning areas.
Prior to bull trout listing under the ESA, the Inland Native Fish Strategy or INFISH (USDA 1995)
amended Regional Guides and 22 Forest Plans for watersheds west of the Continental Divide in
1995, including the Helena National Forest. This strategy provides interim direction to protect
habitat and native fish populations outside the range of anadromous fish habitat. The direction
is in the form of riparian management objectives, standards and guidelines and monitoring
requirements. In addition, priority watersheds were designated that have excellent habitat or
strong assemblages of native fish, particularly bull trout, or where they provide for metapopulation objectives, or watersheds that have a high restoration potential. Priority watersheds
have the highest priority for monitoring and restoration efforts. On the Helena National Forest,
priority drainages include Landers Fork/Copper Creek in the Blackfoot sub-basin and the Little
Blackfoot River drainage upstream of the confluence of Dog Creek in the Upper Clark Fork subbasin.
Besides the priority drainages, a secondary tier of bull trout Special Emphasis Watersheds were
established under Additional Agency Commitments in the 1998 Biological Opinion for continued
Land and Resource Management Plans (USDI 1998 page 24). Special Emphasis Watersheds were
specified as a means of identifying a refugia network of streams that would assist in the
protection and recovery of bull trout. On the Helena National Forest Special Emphasis
Watersheds include Arrastra Creek, Beaver Creek, Moose Creek, Willow Creek, Poorman Creek,
Hogum Creek, Alice Creek and upper Nevada Creek in the Blackfoot drainage. In the Little
Blackfoot drainage, upper and lower Dog Creek were added as Special Emphasis Watersheds.
In support of the draft Fish and Wildlife Service Bull Trout Recovery Plan for the Montana
portion of the proposed Columbia Headwaters, the Bull Trout Conservation Strategy on Forest
Service lands in western Montana (USDA FS 2013) was developed. The USDA Bull Trout
Conservation Strategy helps the Forest Service address Forest Plan Amendment requirements

under INFISH and provide a framework for planning and implementing actions to improve local
bull trout habitat and populations. Importantly, this strategy forms the basis for an aquatic
conservation approach during Forest Plan revisions (USDA FS 2013, page 4).

General Habitat Requirements for Bull Trout

The following discussion of bull trout habitat requirements in Montana is taken from Montana
Bull Trout Scientific Group 1998. The majority of migratory bull trout spawning in Montana
occurs in a small percentage of the total stream habitat available. Spawning occurs between
late August and early November, principally in third and fourth order streams. Spawning adults
use low gradient areas (< 2 percent) of gravel/cobble substrate with water depths between 0.1
and 0.6 meters and velocities from 0.1 to 0.6 meters per second. Proximity of cover for the adult
fish before and during spawning is an important habitat component. Spawning tends to be
concentrated in reaches influenced by groundwater where temperature and flow conditions
tend to be more stable. The relationship between groundwater exchange and migratory bull
trout spawning requires more investigation. Spawning habitat requirements of resident bull
trout are poorly documented.

Successful incubation of bull trout embryos requires water temperatures below 8 degrees
Celsius, spawning gravels with less than 35 to 40 percent of sediments smaller than 6.35
millimeters in diameter and high gravel permeability. Eggs are deposited as deep as 25
centimeters below the streambed surface and the incubation period varies depending on water
temperature. Spawning adults alter streambed characteristics during redd construction to
improve survival of embryos, but conditions in redds often degrade during the incubation
period. Mortality of eggs or fry can be caused by scouring during high flows, freezing during low
flows, superimposition of redds, or deposition of fine sediments or organic materials during the
incubation period. A significant inverse relationship exists between the percentage of fine
sediment in the incubation environment and bull trout survival to emergence. Embryo/fry
entombment appeared to be the largest mortality factor in incubation studies in the Flathead
drainage. Groundwater influence plays a large role in embryo development and survival by
mitigating mortality factors.
Rearing habitat requirements for juvenile bull trout include cold summer water temperatures
(15 degrees Celsius) provided by sufficient surface and groundwater flows. Warmer
temperatures are associated with lower bull trout densities and can increase the risk of invasion
by non-native species that could displace, compete with, or prey on juvenile bull trout. Juvenile
bull trout are generally benthic foragers rarely straying from cover and they prefer complex
forms of cover. High sediment levels and embeddedness can result in decreased rearing
densities. Unembedded cobble/rubble substrate is preferred for cover and feeding and also
provides for higher invertebrate production. Highly variable streamflow, reduced large woody
debris, increased bedload movement and other forms of channel instability can limit the
distribution and abundance of juvenile bull trout. Habitat characteristics that are important for
juvenile bull trout of migratory (fluvial) populations are also important for stream resident subadults and adults. However, stream resident adults are more strongly associated with deep pool
habitats than are migratory juveniles.
Both migratory and stream-resident bull trout move in response to developmental and seasonal
habitat requirements. Migratory individuals can move great distances (up to 250 kilometers)
among lakes, rivers and tributary streams in response to spawning, rearing and adult habitat
needs. Stream-resident bull trout migrate within tributary stream networks for spawning
purposes, as well as in response to changes in seasonal habitat requirements and conditions.

Open migratory corridors, both within and among tributary streams, larger rivers and lake
systems are critical for maintaining bull trout populations.

Western Pearlshell Mussel (Margaritifera falcata)
After completion of the Montana Comprehensive Fish & Wildlife Conservation Strategy (CFWCS)
for native species management in 2005 (MFWP 2005), it was apparent basic scientific
information about the state’s invertebrate species was lacking and that more comprehensive
treatment specific to the state’s mussels was needed. The Western pearlshell mussel had been
listed as a potential species of concern in 2004 and later became a Tier I invertebrate species of
greatest conservation need after completion of the 2005 Montana Comprehensive Fish &
Wildlife Conservation Strategy. Subsequently, the Montana Natural Heritage Program launched
a comprehensive survey plan in 2007 to determine the distribution and population viability of all
three mussel species native to Montana, including the western pearlshell mussel. A report
documenting populations of these freshwater mussels was completed in 2010 by Stagliano
(2010). Information in this segment is based primarily on findings from Stagliano (2010)
including information online from the Montana Natural Heritage Program site and the 2005
CFW Comprehensive Fish & Wildlife Conservation Strategy CS.
Western Pearlshell mussels are one of five freshwater mussels of the family Margaritiferidae in
North America. Their range is reported in Pacific drainages from California to southern Alaska.
In Montana, the western pearlshell is the only freshwater mussel found in coldwater trout
streams west of the Continental Divide and east of the Divide in headwater streams of the
Missouri River basin (MFWP 2005).
This mussel species appears to have crossed the Continental Divide from west to east in
Montana with its host fish, the westslope cutthroat trout, when the upper Missouri River flowed
south to the Snake River (Gangloff and Gustafson 2000, cited by Stagliano 2010). As glochidia
(larvae on the fish gills), they use their fish host (generally salmonids) for upstream and
downstream dispersal into suitable habitats. Adult pearlshell mussels are sedentary. Western
pearlshell mussel habitat consists of cool-cold running low gradient (1 to 2 percent) streams,
typically those of Rosgen type C4 morphology and the species prefers coarse sand and gravel
substrates stabilized by cobbles and boulders that shelter mussel beds from significant bed
scour during high flows from floods and storm events.
The western pearlshell mussel was added to Montana’s Species of Concern (S2) list in 2008 due
to declining and/or very limited numbers, range and/or habitat, making it vulnerable to
extirpation in Montana. Mussel beds previously reported in larger rivers (Blackfoot, Big Hole
and the Clark Fork) are extirpated or at such low densities that long-term viability is
questionable. Surrounding states listed it as state threatened or unranked and declining in
Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon (NatureServe 2005, online at
http://www.natureserve.org/explorer). In Utah the species appears to have been extirpated.
Threats to western pearlshell mussel populations include extensive damming, diversions,
hydroelectric and other water supply projects that have substantially reduced the range of this
species. Agricultural runoff (eutrophication), unstable substrate and siltation have also been
cited as major problems to the species (Western Pearlshell – MT Field Guide, online at
http://fieldguide.mt.gov/detail_IMBIV27020.aspx). These ongoing disruptions of western
pearlshell habitats together with the most recent delineation of the species viability in Montana
(Stagliano 2010) has led to it being added to the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species list.

FISHERIES - 195

Environmental Impact Statement

Systematic surveys in 2007 to 2009 by Stagliano (2010) showed the western pearlshell mussel is
widespread in western Montana, but viability is threatened. Presently, only 14 western
pearlshell populations from eight streams were ranked excellent (A-viability) statewide using
ranks of occurrences online at http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/keyforgenericranking.pdf
and described in Hammerson et al. (2008). Site revisits at 40 originally reported occurrences of
pearlshell mussel found 25 ocurrences not viable or extinct. Of the six mussel species reported
to occur in Montana (three native and three introduced), western pearlshell mussel had the
highest percentage of negative mussel searches (no live individuals) at 81.2 percent or an 18.8
percent detection probability (Stagliano 2010, pg 21).
Of 70 occurrence records for western pearlshell mussel so far documented east of the
Continental Divide in Montana (Stagliano 2010) only seven (10 percent) populations ranked
excellent or good viability (A, B viability). Thirty-two (46 percent) other known western
pearlshell populations east of the Divide ranked not viable (D viability) and five populations are
now extinct. Of the remaining known eastside populations, all ranked fair (C viability) in that
persistence is considered uncertain under current conditions.
For areas in and around the Helena National Forest, the latest surveys by Stagliano (2010) found
six of western pearlshell mussel occurrences in the Blackfoot drainage; four in the Smith River;
three in the Boulder River; and one each in Deep Creek and Dry Creek of the Big Belts range.
According to Stagliano’s surveys (2010) sampling for western pearlshell mussel in the Little
Blackfoot River and major streams draining the east flank of the Divide Travel Plan area failed to
find any occurrences of pearlshell mussel. There are no documented occurrences of western
pearlshell in the Divide Travel Plan area. However, based on habitats where the species have
been found throughout their range, a map provided by Stagliano (appendix A of the fisheries
specialist report) shows current predicted western pearlshell reaches closest to the Divide Travel
Plan area. The map shows no predicted pearlshell mussel habitat in the project area west of the
Divide, but predicted western pearlshell mussel reaches may exist in the project area east of the
Divide in the lower reach of Tenmile Creek where it exits the Helena National Forest.

Fish Habitat
Background
Trout habitat in the travel planning area is essentially the product of interactions among
underlying geologies, soils, topography, vegetation, climate and hydrology unique to the area’s
watersheds (Meehan 1991, pg 5; Swanston 1991, pg 139). These drainage characteristics and
processes remain fairly constant setting up conditions for optimum production of aquatic
lifeforms (Meehan 1991, pg 5). When natural disturbance reshapes stream channels, the actual
effects on aquatic organisms are often short-lived. In their natural context, accessory processes
like fire, flood flows, insect infestations, disease, windthrow and animal activities (e.g. beaver)
operate on the stream system to produce improved habitat quality and productivity in the longterm (Swanston 1991, pgs 139-142).
Human land-use activities can disrupt the delicate balance of these interactions producing
persistent changes in habitat that can reduce natural fish production and population viability
(Meehan 1991, pgs 1-6; Waters 1995, pgs 1, 17). The Divide Travel Plan area traditionally has
been managed for non-fishery resources. These include timber harvest, mining, livestock
grazing, forest transportation and recreation. Other human activities that affected fish habitat
included beaver removal, irrigation withdrawals, development activities on private inholdings
and utility corridors.

Environmental Impact Statement

Cumulatively, these activities impair natural stream functions to varying degrees in the analysis
area by accelerating erosion and sedimentation, altering surface flows, reducing vegetation
cover and destabilizing or degrading stream channels. In general, any ground disturbing activity
has potential to increase erosion and exacerbate excess sediment delivery within a watershed,
in turn lowering the natural fish production capabilities (carrying capacity) of streams (Hicks et
al. 1991). Hence, excessive sediment delivery that persists beyond natural background levels
becomes the common denominator of various land-use activities affecting fish habitat (Meehan
1991). A list of ground disturbing activities, both past and ongoing, occurring within the travel
plan project area is shown in appendix C of the fisheries specialist report. Table 71 references
those land-use activities specific to each individual sub-watershed in the travel plan project area
that likely contribute sediment to streams. Activities listed in appendix C of the fisheries
specialist report that are confined to upland terrain or have no connection to the surface water
system are discounted for consideration in Table 71 (cumulative effects) as sediment
contributors to the stream network.
Forest roads have been tagged as producing the majority of excess sediment amongst forest
activities and they often create conditions for mass soil failures and landslides (Anderson 1971;
Anderson et al. 1976; Cederholm et al. 1981; Furniss et al. 1991; Waters 1995). The degree to
which road construction and maintenance has on altering sediment production in a watershed
varies substantially and is not possible to quantify accurately. In general, the magnitude and risk
for sediment delivery from roads, including other land use activities, is a function of the amount
of surface disturbance (acres disturbed) and proximity to streams within a given sub-watershed.
The specific effects on trout and trout habitat from excessive erosion and sedimentation are
discussed in more detail under the Environmental Consequences section.
The road/fisheries relationship extends beyond the risk of chronic excess sedimentation. A
second risk element is road proximity to streams. Alterations in channel morphology also can
result wherever roads are built parallel to streams and at flow restrictions such as culverts.
When roads are constructed adjacent to a stream they constrain the channel resulting in a
stream limited in its ability to access its historic floodplain and often result in the removal of
riparian vegetation to accommodate the road right-of-way. Such roads change the physical
attributes of trout habitat by reducing pools, meanders, undercut banks, streamside
vegetation/shading, large woody debris recruitment and result in higher energy gradients all
rendering the stream less productive for fisheries. An example in the Divide Travel Plan area is
0.35 miles of Forest Road #227 in the Hat Creek area that parallels the Little Blackfoot River.
Stream crossings represent a third road risk factor to fish habitat and fish populations. Roads
that cross streams most frequently rely on culverts instead of bridges that often disrupt
upstream fish migration. This limits a fish population’s access to habitat types needed to fulfill
their life stage requirements for spawning, rearing, feeding, over-wintering, security and
escapement. Additionally, stream crossings, particularly culverts, can result in chronic
sedimentation impacts during typical water years and catastrophic effects when floods trigger
crossing failure (USDAFS 1998, pg 2). Ford crossings, especially unimproved fords, directly alter
the bed and banks of fish habitat and act as chronic sources of sediment. Ford crossings located
in or near spawning and nursery areas are particularly risky for sensitive incubating salmonid
embryos and fry due to direct vehicular disturbance to the streambed and banks and traffic
generally causes the streambanks to widen as the banks break down and wash away (Clarkin et
al 2006. pg 5-1).

FISHERIES - 197

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Stream/road intersections can also influence the probability for increased opportunities of
concentrated recreational use alongside stream courses imposing increased effects on fish
habitat (Clark and Gibbons 1991, pg 476). An example of this is the complex of user-created
dispersed sites situated along the banks of the Little Blackfoot River associated with two ford
crossings: one on National Forest System road # 4100 that accesses Negro Mountain from the
west and another ford on a user-create route off of NFS road # 123 (Ontario Creek road).
Integrating the three risk factors of roads into this analysis relies on two important indicators or
measures to evaluate: stream/road intersections and high risk roads (defined as those roads
within 300 feet of fish-bearing streams or 150 feet of non-fish-bearing streams). This is
consistent with INFISH riparian habitat conservation areas (RHCA buffers). Together they serve
to help quantify these important interactions of the road-fisheries relationship and respond
most predictably and reliably to the action alternatives as a barometer of change. However, it is
important to point out that not all stream/road intersections and high risk roads have the same
effect in terms of the magnitude and risk to salmonid habitat. For instance, crossings in prime
bull trout or westslope cutthroat trout habitat present far greater risks to these populations
than do crossings located in areas much more isolated from occupied fish habitat. Therefore,
more detailed discussions address those crucial crossing sites where stream habitat and the
trout that depend on those areas are at substantially higher risk from direct vehicular
disturbance than other crossings.
Other aquatic habitat criteria are not considered in detail in this travel plan as the decision will
not affect them. More discussion about fish habitat conditions in various sub-watershed units
west of the Continental Divide in the analysis area is available in watershed baselines for the
Little Blackfoot River portion of the Upper Clark bull trout section 7 watershed (USDA 2000)
including updates to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Two Measures to Evaluate the Stream-Road Relationship
Stream/road intersections are a measure of all points within the planning area where roads
intersect streams and relate specifically to road/stream crossings including culverts, bridges and
fords. Measuring this indicator aids in assessing the environmental risk of flow restrictions or
potential fish migration barriers at culverts, hydrologic connectivity and sedimentation and
alterations in channel morphology that result from stream crossings. Culverts are the most
common type of stream crossing. Bridges impact fish habitat the least of the three types of
stream crossings. An overview of existing conditions in each 6th field HUC relative to this
measurement indicator is provided in Table 66.

In summary, 25 percent (110) of the 439 total stream crossings in the Divide Travel Plan area are
not under Forest Service jurisdiction. These crossings on lands of other ownership are
considered an ongoing cumulative effect to aquatics resources in the project area. Forest
Service roads account for the other 329 crossings in the planning area and 34 percent (112) of
these crossings are currently closed to wheeled motorized use. On the Upper Missouri subbasin side of the project, Upper Tenmile Creek has the highest incidence of Forest Service
stream/road intersections with 31. On the Upper Clark Fork River side, Telegraph Creek has the
highest incidence of stream/road intersections with 51, but Upper Dog Creek (north of highway
12) has the highest number of crossings open to wheeled motorized traffic with 38. Four
crossings are fords in bull trout occupied habitat: two fords are on Ontario Creek and two are on
the mainstem of the Little Blackfoot River.

High risk roads are a measure used to evaluate potential effects in this analysis, which attempts
to address the issue of road/stream proximity especially as it relates to excessive sediment
delivery risk and stream physical alteration. Essentially, this element provides a measure of the
degree of hydrologic connectivity between roads and streams. A hydrologically connected road
is defined as any road segment having a continuous surface flow path to a stream channel.
Wherever any hydrologic connection exists, excessive fine sediment and other pollutants
associated with roads (oils, dust abatement, spill) are provided an efficient route directly into
the natural surface water system.
During the 2002 Forestwide Roads Analysis project, fisheries personnel produced a guide to help
rate the risk of a particular road or road segment on aquatic resources within the context of 6th
field HUCs or sub-watershed units. The product of that roads analysis was a fish risk rating for
roads that assigned one of three specified risk categories: high, moderate and low risk.
Generally, high risk roads were those associated with high value fisheries, which involved
recreational or listed and sensitive species habitat. These commonly included stretches of road
over 0.5 miles long with two or more road crossings, or were within the stream corridor and had
one or more road crossings (culverts, fords, bridges). Moderate risk roads were those that
posed the same problems as high risk roads except they generally involved stretches less than
0.5 mile in the stream corridor with one or no crossings. They also exhibited qualities similar to
high risk roads except they occurred in watersheds that lacked high value fisheries. Low risk
roads represent little or no problems to the stream system since they typically occur over
upland terrain outside stream corridors such as along ridgelines where there is no perennial or
intermittent surface connection to the stream system. Therefore, low risk roads are not
considered in the fisheries analysis. More information about the rationale used at deriving
these risk ratings for roads can be found in the project file.
Because the two measures to evaluate potential effects on fish habitat (stream/road
intersections and high risk roads within INFISH buffers) used for this analysis integrate the same
environmental risks implied in the fisheries risk rating system discussed above, they serve as an
excellent surrogate for the concept of high and moderate risk roads commonly relied upon to
rate the road-fisheries relationship under the 2002 Forest Road Analyses project. For this
analysis, roads within INFISH buffers (as they pertain west of the Divide) will be referred to as
high risk roads and encompass both high and moderate risk roads under the 2002 Forestwide
Roads Analysis Project. In general, roads within INFISH buffer zones (within 300 feet of streams)
present a high risk for non-channelized sediment inputs to stream surface waters for lack of
insufficient vegetated buffer widths to filter out road-sourced sediment from accessing streams
(Belt et al. 1992).
An overview of existing conditions in each 6th field HUC relative to this particular measurement
indicator is provided in Table 67 below. The unit of measure used for assessing the amount of
high risk roads in this analysis is by miles per sub-watershed.

In summary, approximately 165 miles (22.9 percent) of 719 total miles of roads inside the
planning area are considered high risk roads to the stream system (see map appendix B of the
fisheries specialist report). About 76 percent (125.2 miles) of them are under Forest Service
jurisdiction, which would warrant further ground surveys in many sub-watersheds to quantify
sediment delivery to nearby streams. The other 24 percent (39.5 miles) of high risk roads are on
lands of other ownership, which would be considered an ongoing cumulative effect in the
planning area beyond Forest Service control. Of the Forest Service high risk roads,
approximately 29.24 miles or 23 percent are currently closed to motorized vehicle traffic.
Another way of looking at it is 95.96 miles or 77 percent of the high risk roads under Forest
Service jurisdiction in the planning area are currently open to wheeled motorized use.

Divide Travel Plan

On the Upper Missouri sub-basin side of the planning area (or east of the Divide), the Upper
Tenmile Creek 6th field HUC has the most miles of Forest Service high risk roads with about 10.63
miles. On the Upper Clark Fork side of the planning area (or west of the Divide), the Telegraph
Creek 6th field HUC has the highest miles of Forest Service high risk roads with about 15.61
miles.
Road sediment source surveys performed by Forest watershed staff in the years 2008 – 2014
were completed for some watersheds at the 6th field HUC level in the Divide Travel Planning
area south of Hwy 12. Watersheds north of Hwy 12 have not had comprehensive surveys
completed. These road surveys are ongoing and hinge upon staff and funding availability.
Preliminary data show a relationship between the miles of high risk roads occurring in a subwatershed and the number of sediment delivery sites documented. East of the Divide in Upper
Tenmile Creek, 177 sediment delivery points on open Forest Service roads have been recorded,
which corresponds directly with the most miles of high risk roads in a 6th HUC watershed south
of Hwy 12. West of the Divide in Telegraph Creek, which has the most miles of high risk roads,
there were 39 road sediment delivery points recorded on open Forest Service roads, which is
the next highest amount of sediment delivery sites for all 6th HUC watersheds south of Hwy 12.
Ontario Creek with 8.84 miles of high risk roads the most sediment delivery points at 40
recorded on both open and closed Forest Service roads. The data so far show a relationship
between the amount of high risk roads and frequency of road sediment delivery points
occurring in a 6th HUC watershed.

Other (secondary) measures to evaluate associated with roads:

Dispersed recreational sites

Dispersed recreational sites associated with the transportation system can impact fish habitat
ranging from minor where use is infrequent to substantial when use is more concentrated such
as along trails or popular campsites (Clark and Gibbons 1991, pg 475). The Little Blackfoot River
corridor is a popular recreational zone (Kurt Cuneo, pers comm. 5/14/2009) based on
observations by Forest Service recreation and resource staff over the past 25 years. West of the
Continental Divide most campsites have been found occupied or full on weekends, especially
over the holidays and variably during the hunting season. At least 75 to 80 percent of campsites
along the Little Blackfoot River and its main tributaries, Ontario Creek and Telegraph Creek,
were observed as occupied especially over the weekends during onsite visits by Forest
recreation staff (Dave Payne, pers. comm. 5/14/2009).

In 2004, the Helena Ranger District conducted a comprehensive inventory of dispersed
recreational campsites within four sub-watersheds of the Little Blackfoot River drainage south of
Hwy 12. The purpose for the survey was to collect information for planning about the extent
and characteristics of dispersed campsites associated with National Forest System roads 227
and 4100 (Little Blackfoot River), NFS roads 123 and 4104 (Ontario Creek), NFS roads 4104 and
1801 (Monarch Creek) and NFS road 495 (Telegraph Creek).
Additionally, this inventory was used to help determine both the specific locations and degree of
riparian impacts caused from dispersed recreational sites often associated with high risk roads
within the INFISH buffer (300 feet of inland native fish habitat) by assessing which campsites
were contributing sediment or retarding riparian management objectives or both under the
INFISH amended Forest Plan. Findings from the 2004 inventory show there were at least 46
dispersed recreational sites associated with stream corridor roads and ford crossings within the
four 6th field HUC watersheds as displayed in Table 68 below. Nine dispersed campsites were

documented as retarding the attainment of riparian management objectives or continue risking
adverse effects to listed bull trout because of observed bank erosion, sediment delivery and lost
vegetation ground cover or bare mineral soil within one hundred feet of nearby surface water.
The nine sites which retard the attainment of riparian management objectives are considered as
having the highest priority for post-implementation monitoring and possible rehabilitation work
in the future.

¹RMO is an acronym for Riparian Management Objectives used to describe six environmental features used as
habitat indicators of ecosystem health for inland native fish under the INFISH amendment to the Forest Plan.
The term “retard” under INFISH means to slow the rate of recovery below the near natural rate of recovery if no
additional human caused disturbance was placed on the system.

Figure 2 shows one of the nine dispersed recreation campsites representative of the observed
impacts to inland native fish habitat in the Little Blackfoot River. This site is located upstream
from Elliston on the Helena National Forest, which is a designated priority watershed under
INFISH. A priority watershed serves as an anchor for the potential recovery of depressed stocks
with a priority on bull trout populations (USDA 1995, pg A-13). The intent of designating priority
watersheds is to provide a pattern of protection where habitat for inland native fish receives
special attention and treatment.

High Risk Fords of Concern to Threatened, Endangered, Sensitive (TES) Fish Habitat
There are two fords located on the Little Blackfoot River and two fords on Ontario Creek all in
documented bull trout habitat. Three of these fords are of special concern to fisheries
management because they are open to wheeled motorized use that risks direct disturbance to
fish habitat on an ongoing basis including the potential for direct mortality to listed bull trout
and sensitive westslope cutthroat trout. The largest open ford in the entire Divide Travel Plan
area occurs on the mainstem Little Blackfoot River in occupied bull trout and westslope
cutthroat habitat and is associated with NFS road # 4100. This ford crossing is located near the
beginning of the access route to the Golden Anchor abandoned mine site. The second Little
Blackfoot River ford is located at the mouth of Larabee Gulch where a bridge was removed in
1994. This crossing provides important access to the Larabee trail. Because the old (closed)
bridge was removed, there currently is no safe way to cross the stream via full sized wheeled
motorized vehicles and users are fording it on foot, horseback and to a lesser degree ATVs.
In Ontario Creek, one open ford occurs near its mouth where the stream crosses the floodplain
of the Little Blackfoot River and is associated with non-system road # 123-013. The other ford is
located several miles upstream on Ontario Creek near Bison Creek and is associated with a short
segment of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) that bisects Ontario Creek
between NFS roads 4104-A2 and 495-D1. This upper ford in Ontario Creek is currently closed to
motorized wheeled traffic, but has experienced violations of the closure.

FISHERIES - 204

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Three additional fords of concern to fisheries management are all located in occupied westslope
cutthroat trout habitat. One ford is located on Sawmill Creek (Upper Dog Creek 6th HUC
watershed north of Hwy 12); a second is located on an unnamed westslope cutthroat trout
tributary to Ontario Creek; and the third ford occurs east of the Divide in Skelly Gulch (Skelly
Gulch 6th HUC watershed). All three fords are currently open to wheeled motorized use and are
considered an ongoing risk to the local westslope cutthroat trout populations that occur in each
respective stream due to hydrologically connected road segments associated with each ford and
the potential for direct westslope cutthroat trout egg/fry mortality due to wheeled motorized
traffic through each ford during the spawning and incubation period for this species of trout.
Therefore, there are seven unimproved fords in the planning area considered to be high risk
fords of concern where ongoing motorized vehicle traffic has caused the stream to widen
substantially and the raw banks in conjunction with the road approaches provide a continuous
surface flow path for road sediment into fish habitat that support both bull trout and westslope
cutthroat trout. No riparian vegetation remains on the banks either side of each ford for a
distance at least twice the width of each crossing. The approach topography at all fords is
variable, but each slopes directly into their respective streams resulting in direct sediment
delivery during periods of storm runoff and spring breakup.
Observations of traffic disturbance of the channel bottom at all unimproved fords show where
most gravel typically associated with trout spawning and rearing habitat was lost and moved
from locations where vehicle traffic disrupted the streambed. Common at all ford sites was the
lack of coarse and fine woody debris components important for pool formation and retention of
streambed material during bankfull discharge. Results of an experimental removal of woody
debris from a gravel-bed stream in a forested environment have shown a four-fold increase in
bedload transport at bankfull flows (Smith et.al. 1993 pg 153-178). The streambed in the
vicinity of all unimproved fords often displays a coarser bottom or higher energy gradient.
Fine sediment becomes re-suspended into the water column during vehicular contact at fords,
which is soon replaced during storm runoff events. Sediment plumes at two ford sites were
personally observed during vehicle passage. It has also been shown how fords provide
opportunities for concentrated recreation use next to fish habitat. Disturbance of riparian areas
is often tied to concentrated recreational use along high risk routes as documented in Table 68
(above). The largest ford associated with NFS road # 4100 is an example how recreational use
and its impacts on inland native fish habitat tend to increase use is allowed (Figure 3).

Fisheries, Environmental Consequences and Biological Evaluation
Introduction
The direct, indirect and cumulative effects of the action alternatives relative to no action
(baseline conditions) on fisheries resources within this travel planning area are presented in this
section. Secondary measures used to evaluate effects are also included to further clarify specific
effects from fords and dispersed campsites. This analysis relies on a GIS based quantitative
approach which is partially field verified and supplemented with supporting qualitative
discussions about crossings and high risk roads for projecting potential effects of all the action
alternatives relative to baseline conditions on the fisheries resource in the Divide Travel Plan
area.

Fisheries Background Summary Related to Road Effects
Direct and Indirect Effects
Fish Habitat
An overview of road effects on streams and fish habitat is distilled from Furniss et al (1991),
Waters (1995), the Water/Road Interaction Technology Series (USDAFS 1998), the USDA Forest
Service Roads Analysis guide (USDAFS 1999) and the Montana Bull Trout Scientific Group report
(MBTSG 1998). The primary impacts of roads on fish habitat and populations can be organized
under three main categories: 1) accelerated erosion and sedimentation; 2) physical alterations
of channel morphology; and 3) fragmentation of fish populations and habitat. Other ways roads
FISHERIES - 206

Environmental Impact Statement

impact streams involve changes in hill slope drainage (Hauge et al 1979), changes in organic
debris in channels, reduction in streamside vegetative cover, potential chemical contamination
and increased human access to sensitive fish habitat that can impact key habitat components
and increase angling/poaching pressure.
Chronic excessive sedimentation generated as anthropogenic erosion and sediment deposition
degrades streams and lowers the natural fish production capabilities of stream bottoms (Waters
1995). Trout use redds (nests dug by fish in bottom gravels) in flowing waters for their
reproductive strategy. When chronic excessive sediment derived from roads and other sources
accrues to trout spawning and rearing areas, it can substantially reduce trout egg/fry survival
rates compared with stream conditions in pristine or unmanaged watersheds. Incubating
salmonid eggs and sac-fry rely on gravel permeability for oxygen delivery and the flushing of
metabolic wastes. Gravel permeability and in turn egg-to-fry survival can be reduced markedly
by modest increases in streambed sediment (Everest et al. 1987). Additionally, emerging fry
suffer entrapment if an armor of excess fine sediments accrues to spawning beds (Waters 1995,
pg 109 citing Hall and Lantz, 1969).
The scientific consensus about forest roads is that they generate the most sediment amongst all
forest management activities (Anderson et al. 1976; Furniss 1991). Bechta and Jackson (1979,
pg 209) report that flushing of fine sediments from gravels during high flow periods can be
offset by stream energy used to transport and intrude additional sediment load as a
consequence of upstream land-use activities. Therefore, the greatest attention to techniques
for restoring streams and protecting fish habitat has been directed toward more careful
planning and design of roads compatible with stream systems (Furniss et al. 1991).
Beyond the problems of excessive sediment upon the embryo and fry stages of trout life, other
life history stages can suffer the deleterious effects of excessive sediment. The filling of
interstitial spaces of cobble/rubble substrate can seriously reduce critical juvenile rearing
habitat for salmonids (MBTSG 1998, pg 10; Waters 1995, pgs 113-114). Pool volume reduced by
excessive sediment decreases physical carrying capacity for sub-adult and adult fish during
summer growth stages (Waters 1995, pg 111-115; Bjornn and Reiser 1991 pg 122; MBTSG 1998,
pg 10). Chronic sedimentation from roads is considered as damaging as that from catastrophic
sediment inputs (e.g. wildfire); then again, the particles are finer and delivered over longer
periods than burned drainages (Furniss et al. 1991). Everest et al. (1987) concluded trout
species can cope with natural variability in sediments, but population viability can be reduced by
persistent sedimentation that exceeds the natural background levels they evolved in.
Second, paralleling roads and road crossings often result in stream adjustments detrimental to
fish habitat (Furniss et al 1991). Streams are dynamic and migrate within historic flood plains
transporting large woody and organic debris that provides critical physical structure and
diversifies aquatic habitat. Floodplain dynamics and processes are modified by road alignment
and road fills resulting in the loss of habitat for riparian and aquatic species. Streams
constrained by roads and crossings self-adjust resulting in less pool frequency or structure,
fewer spawning beds, less bank cover, higher energy gradients and less stable hillslopes
wherever streamflows are necessarily diverted to the opposite banks. These changes, in turn,
lower the fish production capabilities of stream-riparian habitat.
Third, forest roads often cross streams and culverts are by far the most common type of
crossing structure. Preferred bridge crossings in the project area make up less than 0.1 percent
of all stream crossings. All migratory and many resident trout move extensively upstream and
downstream during their life cycles to seek food, cover, spawning areas and escape detrimental

changes in water quality. Culvert crossings often restrict migration of fishes and other stream
organisms which can have consequences for fish population viability (USDAFS 1999, pg 67).
When culvert crossings fail, they often do so catastrophically causing failure of fill material at
crossings, local scour, streambank erosion and excessive sediment delivery into downstream fish
habitat (Furniss et al. 1991, pg 300). Wood debris and sediment are prone to becoming trapped
behind culvert crossings reducing downstream transport and increasing the risk of crossing
failure (USDAFS 1999, pg 65-66). The consequences are often major increased sediment loading
and persistent channel damage downstream of failed crossing structures.
Ford crossings associated with the transportation system present another risk element to inland
native and non-native fisheries. Fords provide a more direct surface link of road top sediment
and chemical transport to the stream channel than culvert crossings and bridges. In addition to
sediment transported during periods of rainfall and spring runoff, vehicles crossing unimproved
fords degrade water quality as they move through the ford (Sample et al 1999; Taylor 2006).
Another risk other than fine sediment is pollution by engine fluids. Taylor (2006) reported oil on
gravel beds of the Nueces River from vehicles frequently crossing fords deep enough to dislodge
or wash off engine fluids into the stream. Repeat traffic through fords located in sensitive
spawning and rearing habitats disturbs these areas so that the risk of direct mortality to
incubating trout and swim-up fry becomes a concern as motorized traffic on streams directly
disturbs bottom substrates where trout lay eggs or emergent fry seek rearing space in the
substrates. These risks on TES fish species are shared amongst fords located on NFS road #
4100, the Larabee ford on mainstem Little Blackfoot River, three fords in the Ontario Creek
drainage and fords on westslope cutthroat trout habitat in Skelly Gulch (NFS road # 1853-A1)
and Sawmill Gulch (NFS road # 4005).
On non-fish-bearing streams, an open ford exists directly above Kading campground (west of the
Continental Divide) where road 227-E1 bisects a small perennial tributary approximately 300
feet above its confluence with the Little Blackfoot River. Although situated in unoccupied fish
habitat, this site occurs directly upstream from occupied bull trout and westslope cutthroat
trout habitat in the Little Blackfoot River where road sediment transports directly to surface
waters during periods of storm runoff and becomes re-suspended whenever motorized traffic
passes through the ford.
Ford crossings likewise provide access opportunities for recreationists that may inadvertently
lead to changed patterns of use in riparian habitat and subsequently the potential for
detrimental effects on fish (increased fishing pressure and/or poaching) and fish habitat like loss
of vegetation, soil compaction, bank disturbance and increased sedimentation (Clark and
Gibbons 1991 pg 476; MBTSG 1998, pg 41-42). Brown trout and westslope cutthroat trout
occupy the Little Blackfoot River along with bull trout and brook trout where more concentrated
recreational uses associated with dispersed campsites occur, including the developed Kading
campground. As such, risks for direct effects increase near popular streamside camping areas
like the large ford site (NFS road #4100) on the Little Blackfoot River.
Patterns of more concentrated recreational use have been documented and mapped in the
dispersed recreational campsite inventory completed by the Helena Ranger District in 2005. At
that time there were 46 dispersed recreational sites associated with stream corridor roads and
ford crossings within four west side sub-watersheds south of Hwy 12. Nine of the dispersed
campsites posed a direct adverse impact on trout habitat. At least four of those dispersed
campsites were associated with the large ford crossing on the Little Blackfoot River and two
others were tied to the ford crossing in upper Ontario Creek near the confluence of Bison Creek.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

These risks on the fisheries resource are common and ongoing to all alternatives for the Divide
Travel Plan area because the physical presence of the transportation system and all its crossings
remain on the landscape regardless of the decision to administratively close and/or open roads
in the planning area. Excess sediment delivery, stream alteration and habitat fragmentation are
all implicated as common effects under this analysis and the two measurement indicators used
for integrating these impacts on fisheries include: 1) number of stream/road intersections; and
2) miles of high risk roads (those within INFISH buffers). The term indicator used here refers to a
measure or characteristic of man-made features that can be interpretable in terms of effects of
roads on fisheries values (USDAFS 1999, pg 46).
The extent and location of much of the road system within the inner valley corridors in much of
the planning area implies an ongoing cumulative disturbance regime upon streams and the fish
communities they support (Furniss 1991, pg 297). The magnitude and extent of the primary and
secondary indicators is used in this report in making inferences about road hazards because they
help determine whether a geomorphic or hydrologic process may be impacting the resource of
concern or endpoint (USDAFS 1999, pgs 144 and 179).
Table 69 reflects a quantitative overview of baseline effects as measured by the primary and
secondary indicators (columns 2 through 5) to evaluate the Forest Service road system
throughout the Divide Travel Plan area.

¹High risk campsites in this context relate to those retarding INFISH RMOs or adversely affecting TES fish
species or habitat.

In summary, there are approximately 329 stream/road intersections and 125.2 miles of high risk
roads in the planning area under Forest Service jurisdiction. Currently about 34 percent (112) of
the Forest Service stream crossings and 23 percent (29.24 miles) of Forest Service high risk roads
are closed to wheeled motorized use in the planning area. Indirect effects associated with the
transportation system relate specifically to access opportunities for concentrated recreational
uses along the stream-valley corridor as well as disturbance associated with the presence of
high risk ford crossings. There are nine undeveloped Forest Service dispersed campsites along
the Little Blackfoot River and seven fords in TES fish habitat; six fords occur west of the Divide
and one ford occurs east of the Divide in Skelly Gulch. The importance of Skelly Gulch is it is one
of very few streams that support a core conservation (100 percent genetically pure) population

of westslope cutthroat trout east of the Continental Divide in Montana. As a general reference
point, under pristine or unmanaged conditions the measurement indicators evaluated and
summarized under Table 69 would zero out for this exercise.
Table 66, Table 67 and Table 69 provide clear evidence how the current existing transportation
system in the planning area is the primary contributor for accelerated erosion and sediment
loading, altered channel morphology and fragmented fish habitat and populations in most subwatersheds in the Divide Travel Plan area. A screening of 6th field HUCs in the Divide area shows
that Upper Tenmile Creek, Telegraph Creek and Upper Dog Creek appear the most heavily
impacted sub-watersheds as a function of the transportation network. Those HUCs
experiencing additional risks from dispersed campsites and high risk fords include Little
Blackfoot River-Hat Creek, Little Blackfoot River-Larabee Gulch and Ontario Creek. This
represents a departure from optimum salmonid habitat compared to unmanaged/pristine
conditions and an ongoing effect of the transportation system discussed further under the
cumulative effects discussion below.
Amongst westslope cutthroat trout sub-watersheds east of the Continental Divide, Skelly Gulch
and Greenhorn Creek are most at risk from the transportation system. The Greenhorn Creek
westslope cutthroat trout population may have already become extinct based on 2010 to 2012
electrofishing surveys by Forest Service and Montana Department Fish Wildlife and Parks
fisheries crews. For westslope cutthroat trout sub-watersheds west of the Divide, those most at
risk from roads support isolated (resident) westslope cutthroat trout populations. These include
Snowshoe Creek, Carpenter Creek and North Trout Creek. The remaining westslope cutthroat
trout fishery west of the Divide appears mostly to be a connected network of fish habitat
(metapopulation) with a fluvial component occurring in Dog Creek and the Little Blackfoot River
upstream from Elliston. For bull trout habitat in the planning area, Dog Creek downstream of
the Forest boundary and the mainstem Little Blackfoot River and Ontario Creek remain at high
risk as a function of the primary and secondary indicators outlined in Table 69.

Population Viability
Westslope cutthroat trout are the fish management indicator species of concern for the Helena
National Forest that represent a measure of the effects of management activities on habitat
with the objective of ensuring population viability (Forest Plan pg II-17).
A formal population viability analysis is restricted to the use of quantitative modeling that
estimates risk of extinction over a specified time period, typically 100 years (Ralls et al. 2002, pgs
522-523). These mathematical exercises can be expensive requiring comprehensive data about
many factors influencing probability of extinction for a population. Moreover, there are no
consensus guidelines on when and how population viability analysis should be applied (Ralls et
al 2002, pg 521) and insufficient data to build an appropriate model has proven not feasible to
this situation. In practice, agency biologists must assess whether a proposed action will increase
the likelihood of loss of viability or lead to a trend toward federal listing of a sensitive species
from more limited information and resources.
This viability analysis focuses on westslope cutthroat trout and relies on a recommended
alternative method of risk assessment based on viability models by Ruggiero et al. (1994) that
center on criteria established by Rieman et al. (1993). More detailed physical and biological
effects upon sensitive westslope cutthroat trout and listed bull trout are reserved for two
separate framework documents, a biological evaluation for westslope cutthroat trout and a
biological assessment for bull trout.
FISHERIES - 211

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Briefly, these more in depth biological analyses borrow from concepts presented in Ruggiero et
al. (1994) in conjunction with criteria established by Rieman et al. (1993) such that an analysis of
population viability is fundamentally about birth, death, immigration and emigration rates and
how environmental factors affect these rates over time (Ruggiero et al. 1994, pg 366). Select
habitat attributes considered significant to fish and sensitive to land management disturbances
were reviewed in Overton et al. (1995, pg 1). Research has shown how increasing and
decreasing levels of sediment in trout reproductive habitat is the common denominator
affecting trout embryo and fry survival rates negatively and positively (Waters 1995).
Once fine sediments increase beyond average natural levels in trout spawning habitat (typically
28 to 30 percent on Helena National Forest streams), the reproductive quality of that habitat
diminishes proportionately resulting in corresponding declines in fry production. Risk of
increasing the amount of fine sediments in fish spawning habitat rises in drainages as the
amount of high risk roads and stream/road intersections increases.
In reference to the indicators in Table 69, direct and indirect effects to sensitive westslope
cutthroat trout and listed bull trout (and other salmonids) vary amongst the 6th field HUCs as a
function of changes in the amount of open stream/road intersections and miles of high risk road
open in a sub-watershed. Generally, the risk for negative effects to salmonid embryo/fry
production including growth and survival increases when more crossings and high risk roads
become open and vice versa. Exceptions to this rule can occur whenever key crossings or high
risk roads occur in TES habitat that do not change in spite of a net increase/decrease of
crossings or roads in other non-fish-bearing streams within the same HUC or sub-watershed.
Details how these effects indicators relate to the effects specific to each 6th field HUC are
reserved for the biological evaluation and biological assessment for the selected alternative. A
qualitative overview for the Divide Travel Plan area concerning road effects upon listed bull
trout, sensitive westslope cutthroat trout and western pearlshell mussel common to all
alternatives is provided below in Table 70.

watersheds. There are 22 6th field HUC watersheds of which seven occur east of the Divide in
the Upper Missouri River sub-basin and 15 occur west of the Divide (see figures 1 and 2,
appendix A of the fisheries specialist report).

Past and Present (ongoing) Actions
Past and ongoing land-use activities in planning area sub-watersheds are cataloged in Table 71
below as numbers assigned to each activity from a master list of past and ongoing activities in
appendix B. Additionally, cumulative effects from past/ongoing activities in drainages west of
the Divide are reflected in 6th field HUC evaluations for the Little Blackfoot portion of the Upper
Clark Fork Watershed Baseline (USDA 2000). The combined effects of these activities are
impossible to measure exactly and the science of watershed management has not produced the
tools or techniques to allow managers the capability to quantify cumulative effects with
precision and accuracy. Natural ecosystems exhibit wide variation, complexities and
uncertainties that result in generalized expressions of combined effects.
McNeil core sampling data for the planning area streams has not been completed in all subwatersheds, but ample sampling between 1988 and the present has been obtained from 17 of
21 fish-bearing sub-watersheds in the planning area. Numbers under column 2, Table 71
assigned to the individual 6th field HUCs correspond to activities listed in appendix B and are
intended to show which past and ongoing activities are likely responsible for elevated sediment
levels in spawning habitat for individual sub-watersheds. Sampling data under column 4 reflect
the sediment-generating effects of ongoing land use disturbance and background sediment by
sub-watershed. It shows a range of fine sediments by depth (<1/4 inch in diameter) in select
Divide Travel Plan area streams as a consequence of the cumulative effect from the existing
transportation system combined with other ongoing activities in appendix C. Some past or
ongoing activities having no effect or risk upon the surface water system have been excluded
from consideration in Table 71. More information about the application of McNeil core
sampling methodologies as applied to this travel project follows the table below.

Although measuring the effects of any project in the context of past and ongoing actions cannot
be predicted or measured precisely, it is commonly accepted in watershed practice that the
streambed is the ultimate integrator of land-use activities including natural processes unique to
a given drainage. The common denominator of various land-use actions affecting fish habitat is
excess sediment in the streambed beyond natural background levels (Meehan 1991, pg 5-6).
Hence, baseline conditions and the cumulative effect of proposed actions are best measured in
the streambed where sediment accrues in critical reaches. Fine sediment in salmonid spawning
gravels is the accepted indicator of current habitat conditions and trends on the Helena National
Forest.
Helena National Forest fish biologists rely on critical (response) reaches for sampling fine
sediments in spawning habitat using McNeil substrate core sampling methodologies (Platts et al.
1983, pgs 17-20; Bunte and Abt 2001, pgs 30-31 and 203-205). Critical reaches are
representative stream segments that reflect changes in fish habitat as a function of altered
sediment yields upstream of the reach of interest (Stowell et al. 1983). This approach is applied
as a practical means to assess existing (baseline) conditions of salmonid spawning habitat from a
host of land-use activities, particularly roads. It is also useful to help monitor trends in the
quality of salmonid spawning habitat in response to disturbance activities in a drainage.
Reference sediment levels for the Helena National Forest gathered in the 1980s to 2000s relied
on McNeil core data from unmanaged drainages or undisturbed portions of drainages on the
Helena National Forest. It was found that 30 percent fines represented a plausible mean
reference value of fine sediment levels in salmonid spawning habitat and ± 9.9 percent about
the mean is assumed to be a reasonable measure of natural variation for fisheries management
goals based on data collected from Helena National Forest streams matching Lake Helena 303(d)
listed streams. This would equate to fine sediment levels within the range of approximately 20
to 40 percent at most sites in unmanaged drainages.
McNeil core data was obtained from four streams in unmanaged tributaries in the planning
area. Two streams, No Grass Creek and Bison Creek, lie within the Electric Peak roadless area.
The other two are unnamed tributaries that lie outside roadless areas but have no roads or
vehicle crossings upstream from the sampled reach. Average sediment levels for these streams
measured 28.9 percent, 36.9 percent, 31.4 percent and 30.2 percent respectively with a
weighted average of the means for all four streams at 31.9 percent. For this analysis, 30 percent
and 31.9 percent are used as benchmarks to judge the degree of cumulative effects on area
streams using ± 9.9 percent either side of the mean as a reasonable measure of natural variation
for salmonid spawning habitat.

Reasonably Foreseeable Future Actions
Reasonably foreseeable projects or programs considered for review were drawn from the
master list provided (see appendix B). Foreseeable actions are discussed qualitatively in terms
of how they might influence trends in sedimentation and subsequently, salmonid spawning
habitat.
The Telegraph Creek Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) Salvage project involves the removal of
mountain pine beetle infested stands of mostly lodgepole pine trees on about 8,000 acres of
land within the Telegraph Creek, Ontario Creek and Mike Renig 6th field HUCs. This also includes
a pre-commercial thinning component. There may be accelerated erosion and sediment
delivery into downstream fisheries habitat from high risk roads proposed for log hauling and
access to and from treatment units. Each large-scale vegetation treatment project has a road

Environmental Impact Statement

improvement package with mitigation and design measures intended to sequester sediment as
an important resource protection measure of the project. With implementation of the road
improvement component, the risk of accelerating sediment delivery into streams within the
three sub-drainages is predicted to be low. There would be high risk for short-term sediment
increases during initial road improvement stages as specified segments of high risk roads would
be subject to temporary ground disturbance in preparation for hauling logs.
An important element common to all alternatives has been added to the Telegraph Creek
Mountain Pine Beetle Salvage project. This would involve the replacement of the large ford on
the Little Blackfoot River Figure 3 associated with road # 4100 with a bridge. This would
markedly mitigate the ongoing impacts from the current large ford by reducing sediment
delivery to surface waters and eliminating direct instream disturbance from wheeled motorized
use in TES fish habitat. In addition, there would be permanent removal of the bridge upstream
of the ford associated with road # 123 (Ontario Creek Road), including removal of all road fill
(and two overflow pipes) that bisects the Little Blackfoot River floodplain. This would return an
area of the Little Blackfoot River floodplain back to natural functioning condition. Access to
Ontario Creek would be via a new road segment that branches off from road # 4100 on the east
side of the Little Blackfoot River and connects back to road # 123 avoiding the Little Blackfoot
and Ontario Creek floodplains.
On the Upper Missouri River sub-basin side of the planning area, the Tenmile Road
Improvement project would likely reduce sediment levels in Tenmile Creek. This project
involves re-aligning several road segments, replacing three bridges and paving about six miles of
county road # 695 from Hwy 12 to the community of Rimini. Therefore, this project would likely
risk delivering some fine sediment into nearby Tenmile Creek in the short-term because it
parallels Tenmile Creek up to the Rimini townsite and involves some instream work associated
with replacing three bridges. Ground disturbance activities associated with the project would
increase sediment risk until paving and re-vegetation of disturbed areas is complete. In the
long-term, there would be some decreases in the amount of road sediment into nearby Tenmile
Creek due to the paving of this road. This may be offset somewhat by county winter sanding
operations expected for this route.
Road drainage repairs are planned on roads 136 (Ophir Cr), 314 (Elliston Cr to Spotted Dog Cr),
335 (Sweeney Cr), 571 (Dog/Hope Cr), 708 (Snowshoe Cr), 1805 (Austin Cr) and 1855 (upper Dog
Cr). A total of about 54 miles of road would be re-bladed/reshaped with approximately 286
drain dips installed and 12 cattle guards cleaned of silt. One new 18 inch diameter CMP culvert
is proposed at an existing crossing. These improvements would likely risk short-term sediment
increases to fish habitat from initial disturbance of the road bed. There would be a long-term
sediment reduction from the road bed with these drainage improvements in Upper Dog,
Snowshoe Creek, Ophir Creek, Greenhorn Creek and the Little Blackfoot River-Elliston 6th field
HUCs.

Effects Common to All Alternatives

The physical presence of the transportation system as it relates to high risk road segments and
associated stream crossings and dispersed campsites outlined in Table 69 remain on the
landscape as an ongoing (cumulative) effect regardless of any decision to administratively close
or open roads. No alternative under this decision would directly eliminate or relocate the
physical presence of those features from stream corridors as the Divide Travel Plan Decision
includes only open or closed designations. Therefore, sediment delivery from high risk roads
FISHERIES - 216

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

remains a common element in all alternatives simply due to where and how certain road
segments are hydrologically connected to the stream system. Additionally, large volumes of
sediment held in storage as roadfills associated with some culverts remain at risk of being
unleashed downstream into fish habitat. Where stream crossings and roads encroach on
streams there would continue to be alterations of channel morphology and disruption to
floodplain processes resulting in less pool frequency, less bank cover, reduced spawning gravels,
higher energy gradients and partially fragmented fish habitat.
A reasonably foreseeable federal action common amongst all alternatives is additional review of
roads to determine which segments on both open and closed roads are having adverse effects
to inland native fish habitat prerequisite to developing a plan to minimize those effects. Such
future federal action would move the Forest closer in meeting the intent of the Conservation
Strategy for Bull Trout in Western Montana by cataloging road sediment sources and identifying
opportunities to reduce sediment delivery.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives

Each action alternative has the common element to either close or open a pre-determined
amount of high risk roads and associated crossings and to place seasonal restrictions on some
routes in the planning area. This would directly affect the nature and extent of motorized
recreational use in riparian corridors and indirectly affect fish habitat (Clark and Gibbons 1991,
pg 476). Opening high risk routes that are currently closed would potentially accelerate
sedimentation and disturb fish habitat while closing high risk routes would have the reverse
effect.

On the other hand, closing most high risk roads and associated crossings would likely result in
road surfaces becoming passively re-vegetated over the long-term, thereby reducing sediment
runoff into the stream system. Roads proposed for closure would also improve opportunities
for future road obliteration and removal of crossings under an implementation plan that would
help restore watershed function and fish habitat.
Under action alternatives 2 through 4, the proposed 300 foot language for the planning area
would allow wheeled motorized travel off designated routes up to 300 feet with some
restrictions intended to mitigate potential resource damage. Unless signed, wheeled motorized
travel would be allowed within 300 feet of designated routes as long as:
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created;
No damage to existing vegetation, soils or water resource occurs;
Travel off-route does not cross streams; and
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.

Without clearly defined designated routes to dispersed campsites, however, there is potential
for the creation of new user-created routes and dispersed camps at public user’s discretion.
Under alternative 5, dispersed camping and associated parking would be more limited to 70 feet
or less from the edge of a designated route using the same restrictions (above) under the 300
foot language for action alternatives 2 through 4. In addition, vehicle travel would be limited no
closer than 30 feet from streams or other bodies of water. Consequently, the potential for
creation of additional user-created routes and dispersed campsites that could risk damage to
streams at public users’ discretion becomes substantially reduced or minimized under
alternative 5. Clearly defined restrictions in this sense would help reduce confusion amongst
FISHERIES - 217

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

users how far is acceptable to travel off designated routes and what constitutes damage to
vegetation, soils, or water resources.

Alternative 1, No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
The no action alternative has the direct effect of maintaining the status quo in terms of open
high risk roads and stream crossings in the planning area see Table 66 and Table 67. Currently
there are 125.2 miles of high risk Forest Service roads and 329 stream crossings in the planning
area. Approximately 77 percent of the Forest Service high risk roads and 66 percent of Forest
Service stream crossings would remain open to wheeled motorized use. The indirect effect of
no action would be continued risk for accelerated sediment delivery into the surface water
system and sediment accrual into fish habitat over natural background levels due to roads.
Dispersed recreational campsites associated with the Forest Service transportation system in
the planning area south of Hwy 12 totaled 46 in 2005. Nine of these dispersed campsites are
located adjacent to streams: eight are on the Little Blackfoot River and one is on Ontario Creek.
Surveys found these nine dispersed campsites inhibit attainment of riparian management
objectives under INFISH. Lacking measures to address concentrated recreation use at each of
these sites, the direct effect of the no action alternative would be continued concentrated
recreation use at these nine campsites that indirectly generates observable impacts see Table
68 to stream-riparian habitat at these dispersed campsites.
Seven unimproved fords on TES fish habitat associated with the existing transportation system
would also remain under this alternative. Six fords are currently open and one closed to
motorized vehicle use. Four fords (three are open) occur in documented bull trout habitat and
the other three open fords occur on sensitive westslope cutthroat trout streams. The direct
effect of no action would be to maintain the status quo of leaving open six fords to recurring
wheeled vehicle traffic. The indirect effect would be ongoing motorized vehicle disturbance to
the channel at open fords, which exacerbates sediment delivery and risks direct mortality to the
embryonic and fry life stages of bull trout and/or westslope cutthroat trout at those crossings.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There would be no irreversible commitment or permanent loss of future options in regards to
the existing road system. Under no action there is always the possibility for any road, closed or
open, that is adversely affecting water quality, stream function, TES fish habitat or public safety,
to be removed or relocated so that stream processes can be restored that would benefit water
quality and fish populations. This would occur under a separate NEPA analysis.
There would be an irretrievable (temporary) commitment of resources in the matter of ongoing
road sediment delivery to fish-bearing habitat due to some road locations resulting in a direct
surface flow path (hydrologic connection) to planning area streams. Approximately 17.4
percent of the entire transportation system consists of Forest Service high risk roads, including
associated Forest Service stream/road intersections that can cause an irretrievable commitment
or temporary reduction in fish habitat quality restorable by eliminating or relocating those
particular roads. High risk roads when left untreated would continue being an ongoing
cumulative effect that diminishes the fish production capabilities of fish habitat within the
project area.

FISHERIES - 218

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Culverts present an ongoing risk for releases of substantial stores of sediment in the form of
roadfills at culvert crossings including potential barriers to fish migration. Culverts that either
have not been removed or upgraded with bridges or aquatic organisms passage-compliant
structures designed to pass 100-year floods impose an irretrievable commitment upon streamriparian dependent fisheries.

Cumulative Effects
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions applicable to Divide Travel Plan project
sub-watersheds are addressed in appendix B. The transportation system in the project area was
excluded from this list as it is addressed in detail here and in the background discussion for fish
habitat under the fisheries affected environment section above.
Table 66 and Table 67 of the affected environment section provide a quantitative overview of
all the stream/road intersections and miles of high risk roads for the various 6th field HUCs (subwatersheds) of the planning area. Each table treats these two indicators of effect by addressing
them as either open or closed status per sub-watershed.
There is a total of about 719 miles of road in the planning area including National Forest System
routes and routes under other ownership. About 165 miles are considered high risk roads that
pose a risk for chronic excessive sediment delivery to the surface water system, fragment
stream habitat and/or alter stream-floodplain functions. The Forest Service maintains
jurisdiction on about 125.2 miles of the high risk roads and 29.24 miles (23 percent) of these are
closed under the no action alternative. Non- Forest Service roads account for the remaining
39.5 miles of high risk roads; these roads represent an ongoing cumulative effect to the surface
water system in the planning area outside Forest Service management.
There are also currently 439 stream/road intersections (crossings) in the planning area. The
Forest Service has jurisdiction on about 329 crossings and 112 Forest Service crossings (33
percent) are closed under the no action alternative. Stream crossings are principal access sites
for road sediment into the stream system. Due to their presence in the various planning area
drainages, chronic road sediment delivery and physical alteration of stream habitat would
remain an ongoing cumulative effect on fisheries habitat in the planning area.
Additionally, Forest Service dispersed recreation campsites and fords open to public access
contribute to ongoing cumulative effects under this alternative. Nine dispersed campsites are
directly adjacent to TES fish habitat and six open fords occur on TES fishery streams that risk
chronic disturbance of the streambed from direct motorized wheeled vehicle use and
potentially direct mortality of incubating trout eggs and fry. A seventh ford located in Ontario
Creek is currently closed to wheeled motorized traffic.
In non-fish-bearing streams, a ford occurs on an unnamed tributary to the Little Blackfoot River
above Kading campground. This ford does not directly risk mortality to salmonid embryos and
fry, but provides an avenue for chronic sediment delivery into inland native fish habitat in
nearby Little Blackfoot River.
An important project common amongst all alternatives is currently under consideration for
funding to help improve access needs prerequisite to the foreseeable Telegraph Creek Mountain
Pine Beetle Salvage project. This project would replace the large ford on the Little Blackfoot
River with a bridge associated with road # 4100 (Negro Mountain Road). Consequently, there
would be the permanent removal of 0.1 mile of high risk road and three other stream crossings
in TES fish habitat. There would also be foreseeable future direction under a biological opinion
FISHERIES - 219

Environmental Impact Statement

for bull trout to determine which segments of roads are having adverse effects to inland native
fish habitat prerequisite to developing a plan to eliminate or minimize those impacts.

Forest Plan Consistency

Numerous road segments and crossings that have risks to inland native fish and fish habitat are
quantified under Table 66 and Table 67 and would continue to remain open under the no action
alternative. Even with future reviews on roads having adverse effects to streams to help
determine what actions are needed to avoid adverse effects on native fish and habitat, the no
action alternative results in the slowest pace in meeting the Forest Plan INFISH amendment for
avoiding adverse effects on fisheries. This is because no action closes no roads and crossings
that are impacting fish habitat as a tool considered very effective at removing sediment sources
in the long-term.

A reasonably foreseeable federal action under this alternative (and other action alternatives) is
additional review of roads to determine which segments on both open and closed roads are
having adverse effects to inland native fish habitat prerequisite to developing a plan to minimize
those impacts. This future federal action moves the Forest closer in meeting the intent of
avoiding adverse effects to inland native fish and fish habitat.

Alternative 2
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 2 would have the direct effect of closing a net additional 5.89 miles (4.7 percent) of
Forest Service high risk roads to motorized wheeled vehicle use from the current status. Table
72 summarizes the changes in the miles of open high risk roads for each 6th field HUC in the
planning area. Ten sub-watersheds would experience a reduction in open high risk roads;
therefore, these same sub-watersheds would potentially experience varying reductions in longterm road sediment delivery as an indirect effect of closing some segments of high risk roads. In
addition, there would likely be increased opportunities to obliterate roadbeds to restore natural
drainage and stream habitat especially in those drainages that would experience half-a-mile or
more of high risk roads being closed. Nine sub-watersheds would experience no change from
the current miles of open high risk roads so the indirect effect for these drainages (see Table 72)
reflects the no action alternative in terms of road sediment delivery risk. The 0.02 mile of road
in the Little Blackfoot-Hat 6th HUC for this exercise is not likely a sediment risk based on its short
distance and upper location in the INFISH zone and lack of crossings. The small number may
also relate to GIS mapping inconsistencies
Four sub-watersheds west of the Divide would undergo a net increase in open high risk roads
from their current levels as a direct effect of this alternative (see Table 72). These include
Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch and the Elliston sub-watershed portion of the Little Blackfoot
River drainage. The Hat Creek sub-watershed portion of the Little Blackfoot River drainage also
experiences some minor increase in open high risk roads; however, the 0.02 miles as show in
the table probably relate more to a GIS mapping error so this sub-watershed likely experiences
no change from the current open status of high risk roads. The increased miles of open high risk
roads are a mainly a result of proposals to open closed road # 4104-A1 in Ontario Creek; road #
1856 in the Mike Renig drainage; and roads 314-A1 and 314-E1 in Elliston Creek.
The indirect effect of opening these high risk roads to wheeled motorized use relates to
increasing risk of sediment production and delivery to streams that can impact trout
FISHERIES - 220

Environmental Impact Statement

reproduction. Road traffic is recognized to increase production of road sediment ranging from
two to 30 times the sediment production compared to roads without traffic (Luce and Black
2001, pg 1). Surface rutting resulting from repeat traffic was reported to increase sediment
production 200 to 500 percent in contrast to unrutted roads (Burroughs and King 1989, pg 1;
Kennedy 1997). Foltz (1999, pg 3) reported 96 percent to 99 percent of the sediment generated
from road surfaces of high to marginal aggregate surface quality was less than 6 millimeters in
diameter. A major concern for fisheries management is the accrual of excess sediment less than
6.4 millimeters in size into salmonid spawning and rearing habitat. Waters (1995, pgs 86-109)
provides an overview of research on sediment that show most reductions in egg-embryo success
result when sediment particles of 0.83 millimeters and smaller occur in redds in proportions of
about 15 percent or higher. Fry mortality increases as larger sediment particles (3 to 6
millimeters in size) increase in overlying strata.

Alternative 2 also has the direct effect of closing six more stream crossings to motorized
wheeled vehicle use in the planning area from the current status (alternative 1). Table 73
summarizes the changes in the amount of open stream route intersections for each subwatershed. Ten sub-watersheds would experience no change in the current open status of
stream crossings so the indirect effect in these drainages reflects the no action alternative in
terms of sediment risk and opportunity in improving drainage. Seven sub-watersheds would
experience varying reductions in open stream crossings; therefore, an indirect effect would be
the potential for variable reductions in long-term road sediment delivery in these drainages with
increased opportunities to remove crossing structures for restoring natural drainage and stream
habitat.
FISHERIES - 222

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Five sub-watersheds (one east of the Divide and four west of the Divide) would experience
increases in crossings open to wheeled motorized vehicle use from their current levels as a
direct effect of this alternative (see Table 73). These include Middle Tenmile Creek (east of the
Divide), Ontario Creek, Telegraph Creek, Mike Renig Gulch and the Elliston sub-watershed
portion of the Little Blackfoot River drainage. The additional open crossings are the result of
proposals to open closed road # 4104-A1/A2 in Ontario Creek; road #1856 in the Mike Renig
drainage; and roads 314-A1 and 314-E1 in Elliston Creek. East of the Divide two stream
crossings that would be opened to wheeled motorized vehicle use are associated with opening
road # 335-A in Sweeney Creek to wheeled motorized traffic.
The indirect effects of opening these closed crossings to wheeled motorized use relates to
increased risk for sediment production and delivery to streams including establishment of new
dispersed camps in the riparian area.

Effects of Alternative 2 Specific to Occupied Bull Trout Habitat and Westslope
Cutthroat Trout Habitat:
Seven fords are located on streams supporting westslope cutthroat trout and four of these
occur in habitat that also supports listed bull trout. A direct effect of alternative 2 would be the
closing of all four fords in bull trout occupied habitat to wheeled motorized traffic. One ford
(non-system road 123-013) would be permanently closed and three other fords (roads 4100,
227-D1, 4104-A1/A2) temporarily closed until a bridge or other bottomless aquatic organism
passage (AOP) compliant structure would be installed under a mitigation plan that protects
native aquatic species. This therefore helps reduce risk for direct mortality to the early life
history stages of bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout in Ontario Creek and the Little
Blackfoot River. In upper Ontario Creek the ford (road 4104-A1/A2) in bull trout habitat is
currently closed but would be opened seasonally (from May 16th to October 14th) under this
alternative. To protect instream habitat and early life stages of native trout, this ford would
remain closed until a bridge or other bottomless structure could be installed in its place. Risk for
direct mortality to bull trout in the Little Blackfoot River or Ontario Creek is considered to be
very low currently due to their extremely low numbers as observed and documented in the
latest electrofishing surveys between 2008 and 2012 by Forest Service and Montana Fish,
Wildlife and Parks fisheries crews.
The balance of open fords on fish-bearing streams occurs in westslope cutthroat trout habitat in
Skelly Gulch east of the Divide (road 1853-A1), Sawmill Gulch (road 4005) and an unnamed
tributary to Ontario Creek (road 495-D1). Because of its high importance to westslope cutthroat
trout conservation east of the Divide, the ford (and its associated high risk road) on Skelly Gulch
would be closed. The direct effect therefore would be the elimination of wheeled motorized
traffic in westslope cutthroat trout habitat in upper Skelly Gulch, which is documented as
spawning habitat for that population. The indirect effect would be the reduction of chronic
sediment delivery into westslope cutthroat trout habitat and the protection of incubating
westslope cutthroat trout embryo and fry from direct mortality due to wheeled motorized
traffic through the stream at ford crossing. In Sawmill Gulch and the unnamed Ontario
tributary, proposed mitigation to protect westslope cutthroat trout would be to close the
crossings until an approved aquatic organism passage compliant structure sized to pass 100-year
flood flows could be installed. This would have the indirect effect of protecting westslope
cutthroat trout from potential direct mortality from wheeled motorized traffic through the
creek bed.

FISHERIES - 223

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Four dispersed campsites accessed by non-system road 123-013 would be closed as a direct
effect of closing road 123-013 under this alternative. This would eliminate concentrated
recreation activity along 0.25 miles of the Little Blackfoot River associated with the dispersed
campsites and have the indirect effect of passive re-vegetation on disturbed ground along this
segment of the Little Blackfoot River.
Three sub-watersheds that have a net increase of both high risk roads and stream crossings
open in TES fish habitat are Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch and Little Blackfoot River-Elliston.
However, in the Little Blackfoot River-Larabee, road 227-E1, which extends about 0.9 mile
beyond Kading campground, would remain open to wheeled motorized vehicles seasonally from
May 15th to October 14th. Approximately 0.6 miles of high risk road, one ford crossing on a
fishless tributary and two high risk dispersed campsites associated with the road would be open.
Keeping this route open would have a direct effect for potential adverse effects on inland native
fish habitat.
In the Little Blackfoot-Elliston HUC, the direct effect of this alternative would be opening over
one mile of high risk road including two crossings on Elliston Creek and indirectly increasing the
risk for sediment delivery into westslope cutthroat trout habitat. In Telegraph Creek, opening
roads 1857-D1 and 1857-D2 to wheeled motorized use would have the direct effect of allowing
wheeled motorized use on currently closed segments of road having three stream crossings.
The indirect effect of this decision relates to increased risk for sediment delivery into westslope
cutthroat trout habitat in Booth Gulch.
With these exceptions, the overall direct effect on westslope cutthroat trout drainages in the
planning area would be the elimination of wheeled motorized traffic travel on 1.02 miles of high
risk road in westslope cutthroat trout habitat east of the Divide and approximately 5.23 miles of
high risk road in westslope cutthroat trout drainages west of the Divide. The westslope
cutthroat trout drainage east of the Divide that would benefit is Skelly Gulch where
approximately one mile of high risk road and an active ford would be closed as a direct effect of
this alternative. Greenhorn Creek is doubtful whether it still supports any westslope cutthroat
trout based on extensive surveys by Forest Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks
fisheries crews in 2009 to 2012. This drainage would experience the direct effect of having 2.8
miles of high risk road including seven more stream crossings closed to wheeled motorized
traffic. The indirect effect of these closures on fish habitat in the planning area is the long-term
trend of reduced sedimentation into the surface water system for ten sub-watersheds that
support fish populations; six of these support westslope cutthroat trout.

Effects of Alternative 2 Specific to Western Pearlshell Mussel Habitat
Western pearlshell mussels do not occur in the Little Blackfoot River or its tributaries in the
planning area. Additionally, with the exception of Tenmile Creek (east of the Divide) below the
confluence of Walker Creek, no stream reaches have been designated as predicted western
pearlshell habitat based on surveys by Stagliano (2010). The Divide Travel Plan area therefore is
not likely to impact western pearlshell mussels or habitat in or downstream of the project area
west of the Divide.
In the fisheries analysis, increased excess sedimentation was discussed as an environmental
stressor most probable to adversely affect salmonids from open roads and crossings. Increased
sedimentation is also one of the stressors of concern to western pearlshell mussels (Box and
Mossa 1999). Research has found that eliminating ongoing vehicular disturbance on existing
roads reduces the amount of sediment delivered to streams from those routes. Sediment yields
FISHERIES - 224

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

from the project area transportation system are unlikely to increase because there would be no
increases in the amount of high risk roads and crossings open to wheeled motorized vehicle use
in the Upper Tenmile 6th HUC. The single crossing in Middle Tenmile Creek opened under this
alternative is remotely located from predicted pearlshell mussel habitat in lower Tenmile Creek
and lacks connectivity to lower stream reaches of Tenmile Creek.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There would be no irreversible commitment or permanent loss of future options in regards to
the existing road system under alternative 2. There is always the possibility for any Forest
Service road, closed or open, that is adversely affecting water quality, stream function, TES fish
habitat or public safety, to be removed or relocated so that stream processes can be restored
that benefit water quality and fish habitat. This would occur on a separate NEPA analysis.
There would be an irretrievable (temporary) commitment of resources in the matter of ongoing
road sediment delivery to fish-bearing habitat due to some road locations resulting in a direct
surface flow path (hydrologic connection) to planning area streams. Approximately 17.4
percent of the entire transportation system consists of Forest Service high risk roads including
associated Forest Service stream/road intersections that can cause an irretrievable commitment
or temporary loss of fish habitat quality restorable by eliminating or relocating those particular
roads or applying some other adjustment measures on the roads. High risk roads when left
untreated would continue being an ongoing cumulative effect that decreases the overall fishproduction capabilities of fish habitat within the project area.
Under-designed culverts present an ongoing risk for releases of substantial stores of sediment in
the form of roadfills at culvert crossings and potential barriers to fish migration. Culverts at risk
that have not been removed or upgraded with aquatic organism passage -compliant ones
designed to pass 100-year floods impose an irretrievable commitment upon stream-riparian
dependent fisheries.

Cumulative Effects
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable future non-road actions applicable to the Divide Travel
Plan project area are addressed in appendix B. The transportation system was not included in
that list as it is addressed in detail in this report. Table 72 and Table 73 in the affected
environment section provide a quantitative overview of all stream/road intersections and miles
of high risk roads in each 6th field HUC as an ongoing effect from the transportation system in
the Divide Travel Plan area. Both tables further refine the two road measures by outlining the
amounts currently open versus closed for each sub-watershed.
There are approximately 719 miles of road in the planning area including National Forest System
(NFS) routes and routes under other ownership. About 165 miles are considered high risk roads
that pose a risk for chronic excessive sediment delivery to the surface water system, fragment
stream habitat and/or alter stream-floodplain functions. The Forest Service maintains
jurisdiction on about 125.2 miles of high risk roads and 95.96 miles are currently open (29.24
miles closed). Under alternative 2, about 90.07 miles of high risk Forest Service roads would
remain open and the other 35.13 miles (29.24 miles currently closed plus 5.89 proposed miles)
or 28 percent would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicle use. Non- Forest Service roads
account for 39.5 miles of high risk roads; these roads represent an ongoing cumulative effect to
the surface water system in the planning area outside of Forest Service management.
There are also currently 439 stream/road intersections (crossings) in the planning area. The
Forest Service has jurisdiction on 329 crossings and 217 crossings are currently open (112
FISHERIES - 225

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

closed). Alternative 2 would result in 211 crossings remaining open to motorized use and the
other 118 (112 currently closed plus 6 proposed) crossings or 35.9 percent would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicle use. Because stream crossings are principal access sites for road
sediment into the stream system and localized physical alteration of stream habitat, their
presence in the various planning area drainages would remain an ongoing cumulative impact on
fish habitat in the planning area. Closing six crossings under this alternative represents less than
2 percent of the total stream crossings in the planning area with potential for permanent
removal.
Additionally, nine Forest Service dispersed campsites are directly adjacent TES fish habitat, but
wheeled motorized access to four of these campsites would close under this alternative. The
other five dispersed campsites would remain open to public users with risk for ongoing adverse
effects to TES fish habitat without effective adjustment measures to meet riparian management
objectives in riparian habitat conservation areas. Six open fords on TES fish streams would
experience permanent or temporary closures to reduce exacerbating sediment delivery to fish
habitat and risk of direct mortality to westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. A seventh ford
currently closed in Ontario Creek would remain closed to wheeled motorized traffic until a
bridge or other bottomless structure replaces it under an implementation plan. The physical
presence of these fords would continue as a risk for chronic sediment delivery to TES fish habitat
until measures under an implementation plan could replace the fords or rehabilitate crossings
proposed for closure in this alternative.
In non-fish-bearing streams, the ford on an unnamed tributary to the Little Blackfoot River
above Kading campground remains open so would continue to be a source of chronic sediment
delivery into inland native fish habitat in nearby Little Blackfoot River. However, there would be
no risk for direct fish mortality from motorized vehicle traffic through this ford crossing.
An important project common amongst all alternatives is currently under consideration for
funding to help improve access needs prerequisite to the foreseeable Telegraph Creek Mountain
Pine Beetle Salvage project. This project would replace the large ford on the Little Blackfoot
River with a bridge associated with road # 4100 (Negro Mountain Road). Consequently, there
would be the permanent removal of 0.1 mile of high risk road and three other stream crossings
in TES fish habitat. There would also be foreseeable future direction under a biological opinion
for bull trout to determine which segments of roads are having adverse effects to inland native
fish habitat prerequisite to developing a plan to eliminate or minimize those impacts.

Forest Plan Consistency

Numerous roads and crossings that have risks to inland native fish and fish habitat were
quantified under Table 66 and Table 67, which would continue to remain open under
alternative 2. Alternative 2 would, however, result in closing a net 5.89 miles of Forest Service
high risk roads including six stream crossings that are having some adverse effects on native
fishes and fish habitat. Hence, this alternative would incrementally move the Forest forward in
helping meet the intent of the Forest Plan amendment compared to the no action alternative.
There is some tradeoff in that a few currently closed roads and crossings would be opened to
wheeled motorized use under this alternative potentially increasing risk for adverse effects to
native fishes and fish habitat. To maintain consistency with the Forest Plan, an element
common to all action alternatives is that opened fords on TES fish habitat would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicles until appropriate mitigation measures are in place that minimize or

eliminate ongoing adverse effects from high risk roads and wheeled motorized use through
fords.
Additionally, a reasonably foreseeable federal action under this alternative (and other
alternatives) is further review of roads to confirm which segments on both open and closed
motorized routes are having adverse effects to inland native fish habitat. This would be
required particularly west of the Divide in order to develop a plan to minimize or eliminate
those effects from roads. This future federal action helps meet the intent of INFISH
amendments by identifying specific roads and needed actions to avoid adverse effects to inland
native fish and fish habitat.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 3 would have the direct effect of closing an additional 21.17 miles (16.9 percent) of
Forest Service high risk roads currently open to motorized wheeled vehicle use in the planning
area. Table 74 summarizes the changes in the amount of open high risk roads for each 6th field
HUC. Fourteen sub-watersheds would experience reductions in miles of open high risk roads;
therefore, an indirect effect for these sub-watersheds would be the potential for long-term
reductions in sediment delivery to streams in these drainages with increased opportunities to
obliterate roadbeds to help restore natural drainage and stream habitat. Eight sub-watersheds
would experience no change in the miles of high risk roads currently open to motorized traffic
so the indirect effect for those drainages reflects the no action option in terms of sediment
delivery and opportunities for watershed restoration. The 0.05 mile of road in the Little
Blackfoot-Elliston 6th HUC is not likely a sediment risk based on its short length and upper
location in the INFISH zone and lack of crossings. This sub-watershed is therefore judged having
virtually no change in its open high risk roads.
Alternative 3 would also have the direct effect of closing 46 more Forest Service stream/road
intersections (crossings) to wheeled motorized vehicle use in the planning area from the current
status (alternative 1). Table 75 summarizes the changes in the amount of open crossings by
sub-watershed. Thirteen drainages would realize a reduction in open stream crossings to
wheeled motorized vehicle use with an indirect effect for potential long-term decreases in
sediment delivery and increased opportunities at removing culverts that restore natural
drainage and stream habitat. Nine sub-watersheds would experience no change in the current
open status of stream crossings; the indirect effect in these drainages reflects the no action
alternative in terms of sediment risk and opportunity at restoring drainage. Unlike the other
action alternatives, no drainages in the planning area would experience any increase in open
high risk roads or stream crossings.

In effect, Alternative 3 closes over 15 miles more high risk roads and 40 more crossings to
wheeled motorized vehicle traffic compared to alternative 2. Therefore, compared to
alternative 2 it has the potential to amplify reductions in sediment production and delivery to
streams in sub-watersheds showing net reductions in these indicators. There would also be
more opportunity to obliterate and restore drainage than alternative 2. Research has
demonstrated how minimizing or eliminating motorized use over roads and crossings
substantially reduces road sediment delivery to streams (Luce and Black 2001, pg 1; Burroughs
and King 1989, pg 1; Kennedy 1997; Foltz 1999). Waters (1995, pgs 86-109) provides an
overview of research on sediment that show most reductions in egg-embryo success result

Environmental Impact Statement

15 percent or higher and fry mortality increases as larger sediment particles (3 to 6 millimeters
in size) collect in the overlying strata. Alternative 3 would help minimize long-term sediment
delivery to fish habitat in the planning area because this option provides for the second highest
miles of high risk roads and stream crossings (after alternative 5) that could potentially be
obliterated or removed respectively to restore natural drainage and eliminate sources of chronic
sediment delivery in 14 sub-watersheds.

Effects of Alternative 3 Specific to Occupied Bull Trout Habitat and Westslope
Cutthroat Trout Habitat:
The overall direct effect on westslope cutthroat trout drainages in the planning area would be
the elimination of wheeled motorized traffic travel on about one mile of high risk road in one
westslope cutthroat trout drainage east of the Divide and approximately 12.95 miles of high risk
roads in eight westslope cutthroat trout drainages west of the Divide. Skelly Gulch is the
westslope cutthroat trout drainage on the east side that would benefit from closing
approximately 0.4 miles of hydrologically connected road and an active ford in westslope
cutthroat trout habitat. Another east-side drainage, Greenhorn Creek, is doubtful whether it
still supports any westslope cutthroat trout based on the latest findings by Forest Service and
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks fisheries crews in 2009 to 2012. This drainage would
experience approximately 2.8 miles of high risk roads and seven stream crossings being closed
to wheeled motorized traffic. The indirect effect on westslope cutthroat trout habitat in the
planning area translates to a long-term trend of reduced sedimentation into the surface water
system in 14 sub-watersheds that support fish populations; nine of these support westslope
cutthroat trout.
Other direct effects from alternative 3 relate to fords and dispersed campsites tied to existing
open high risk roads. Under this alternative four fords (roads 4100, 227-D1, 4104-A1/A2, 123013) in documented bull trout habitat would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicle use. This
would eliminate risk for direct mortality to the early life history stages of bull trout and
westslope cutthroat trout in Ontario Creek and the Little Blackfoot River from wheeled
motorized vehicle traffic through fords. In addition, a ford crossing (road 227-E1) on a fishless
tributary above Kading campground would be closed permanently. In upper Ontario Creek the
ford (road 4104-A2) in bull trout habitat is currently closed and would remain permanently
closed. Therefore, the risk for direct mortality to bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout in the
Little Blackfoot River and Ontario Creek as a function of wheeled motorized traffic through fords
would be discountable under this alternative. Due to extremely low numbers of bull trout
observed and documented in the latest Forest Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks
electrofishing surveys from 2008 to 2012, risk of mortality to bull trout from wheeled motorized
vehicle traffic in the Little Blackfoot River and Ontario Creek is considered to be very low.
Three other open fords occur in westslope cutthroat trout habitat and each are located in Skelly
Gulch east of the Divide (road 1853-A1) and in Sawmill Gulch (road 4005) and an unnamed
tributary to Ontario Creek (road 495-D1) west of the Divide. As discussed above, a ford (and its
associated high risk road) on Skelly Gulch would be permanently closed having the direct effect
of eliminating wheeled motorized traffic through westslope cutthroat trout habitat including a
hydrologically connected segment of road 1853-A1. The indirect effect would be the
minimization of chronic road sediment delivery into westslope cutthroat trout habitat and
protection of incubating westslope cutthroat trout embryos and fry at risk from wheeled
motorized traffic through the streambed. In Sawmill Gulch and the unnamed Ontario tributary,
proposed mitigation to protect westslope cutthroat trout would be the temporary closing of the
FISHERIES - 230

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

two fords until an approved aquatic organism passage compliant structure sized to pass 100year flood flows could be installed. This would have the indirect effect of preventing potential
direct mortality of westslope cutthroat trout fry and eggs and reduce sedimentation from direct
wheeled motorized traffic through the creek bed.
Four dispersed campsites all accessed by non-system road 123-013 and two other dispersed
campsites accessed by road 227-E1 (the extension beyond Kading campground) would be closed
as a direct effect of closing these roads. Alternative 3 would also close the Larabee ford and the
large ford on road 4100 including 1.4 miles of road 4100. The direct effect would be the
cessation of the concentrated recreation activity along the banks of the Little Blackfoot River
next to these six dispersed campsites and an indirect effect of passive re-vegetation on
disturbed ground adjacent the Little Blackfoot River. Projects to fully accomplish road and
crossing closures would follow in a separate implementation plan for this planning area.

Effects of Alternative 3 Specific to Western Pearlshell Mussel Habitat
Effects of alternative 3 on western pearlshell mussels or habitat match those under alternative 2
based on the rationale that discusses potential affects to western pearlshell mussels.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There would be no irreversible commitment or permanent loss of future options in regards to
the existing road system under alternative 3. There is always the possibility for any Forest
Service road, closed or open, that is adversely affecting water quality, stream function, TES fish
habitat or public safety, to be removed or relocated so that stream processes can be restored
benefiting water quality and fish habitat. This would occur under a separate NEPA analysis.
There would be an irretrievable (temporary) commitment of resources in the matter of ongoing
road sediment delivery to fish-bearing habitat due to some road locations resulting in a direct
surface flow path (hydrologic connection) to planning area streams. Approximately 17.4
percent of the entire transportation system consists of Forest Service high risk roads including
associated Forest Service stream/road intersections that can cause an irretrievable commitment
or temporary loss of fish habitat quality restorable by eliminating or relocating those particular
roads or applying some other adjustment measures on the roads that protect and restore
aquatic habitats. High risk roads where left untreated would continue being an ongoing
cumulative effect that decreases the overall fish-production capabilities of fish habitat within
the planning area.
Under-designed culverts present an ongoing risk for releases of substantial stores of sediment in
the form of roadfills at culvert crossings and they pose potential barriers to fish migration.
Culverts at risk that have not been removed or upgraded with aquatic organism passage
compliant ones designed to pass 100-year floods present an irretrievable commitment upon
stream-riparian dependent fisheries.

Cumulative Effects
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable future non-road actions applicable to the Divide Travel
Plan area are addressed in appendix B. The transportation system was not included in the list in
appendix B as it is addressed in detail within this report. Table 66 and Table 67 in the affected
environment section provide a quantitative overview of all stream/road intersections and miles
of high risk roads in each 6th field HUC as a measure of ongoing effects related to the
transportation system in the Divide Travel Plan area. Both tables refine the two road measures
by outlining the amounts currently open versus closed for each sub-watershed.
FISHERIES - 231

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

There are 719 miles of road in the planning area including NFS routes and routes under other
ownership. About 165 miles are considered high risk roads that present a risk for chronic excess
sediment delivery to the surface water system, fragment stream habitat and/or alter streamfloodplain functions. The Forest Service maintains jurisdiction over 125.2 miles of high risk
roads and 95.96 miles are currently open (29.24 miles closed). Under action alternative 3, about
74.79 miles of high risk Forest Service roads would remain open and the other 50.41 miles
(29.24 miles currently closed plus 21.17 proposed miles) or 40.2 percent would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicle use. Non- Forest Service roads account for 39.5 miles of high risk
roads in the planning area; these roads represent an ongoing cumulative effect to the surface
water system in the planning area.
There are in addition some 439 stream/road intersections (crossings) throughout the planning
area. The Forest Service has jurisdiction on 329 crossings and 217 crossings are currently open
(112 are closed). Alternative 3 would result in 171 crossings remaining open to motorized use
and the other 158 (112 currently closed plus 46 proposed closed) or 48 percent would be closed
to wheeled motorized vehicle use. Because stream crossings are principal access sites for road
sediment into the stream system with localized physical alteration of stream habitat, their
presence in the various planning area drainages would remain an ongoing cumulative impact on
fish habitat in the planning area. Closing 46 crossings under this alternative represents about
10.5 percent of the total stream crossings in the planning area with potential for permanent
removal. Permanent removal of closed crossings and mitigating open crossings would
substantially reduce ongoing adverse effects on fish habitat under an implementation plan that
would follow this decision.
Additionally, nine, Forest Service, dispersed campsites associated with high risk roads are
directly adjacent TES fish habitat and six of these would close under this alternative. These sites
are predicted to trend toward pre-disturbance conditions. The other three dispersed recreation
campsites would remain open to public users with likely adverse effects to TES fish habitat
without effective adjustment measures to meet riparian management objectives in riparian
habitat conservation areas.
Six currently open fords on TES fish streams would experience permanent or temporary closures
that reduce risk of direct mortality to early life stages of westslope cutthroat trout and bull
trout. A seventh ford located in Ontario Creek would remain closed as is to wheeled motorized
traffic. The physical presence of these fords would remain an ongoing risk for sediment delivery
to TES fish habitat until measures under an implementation plan would replace fords with
bottomless structures on roads planned to be open or rehabilitate those proposed for closure in
this alternative. In non-fish-bearing streams, a ford on an unnamed tributary to the Little
Blackfoot River above Kading campground would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicle traffic
favoring a long-term trend for eliminating or minimizing road sediment delivery into inland
native fish habitat downstream from the ford.
An important project common amongst all alternatives is currently under consideration for
funding to help improve access needs prerequisite to the foreseeable Telegraph Creek Mountain
Pine Beetle Salvage project. This project would replace the large ford on the Little Blackfoot
River with a bridge associated with road # 4100 (Negro Mountain Road). Consequently, there
would be the permanent removal of 0.1 mile of high risk road and three other stream crossings
in TES fish habitat. There would also be foreseeable future direction under a biological opinion
for bull trout to determine which segments of roads are having adverse effects to inland native
fish habitat prerequisite to developing a plan to eliminate or minimize those impacts.
FISHERIES - 232

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Forest Plan Consistency

Roads and crossings having risk to inland native fish and fish habitat were quantified under
Table 66 and Table 67. Under alternative 3, approximately 21.17 added miles Forest Service
high risk roads and 46 Forest Service stream crossings having risk upon native fish and habitat
would be closed. This alternative leaves the least amount of high risk roads and crossings open
that may have adverse effects to native fishes and fish habitat after alternative 5 and therefore,
moves the project area forward at the next most rapid pace for fully meeting the intent of the
INFISH amendments. To help maintain consistency with the Forest Plan, an element common
amongst action alternatives is that opened fords in TES fish habitat would be closed to wheeled
motorized vehicles until appropriate mitigation measures are in place to minimize or eliminate
ongoing adverse effects from high risk roads and wheeled motorized use through fords.
Additionally, a reasonably foreseeable federal action under this alternative (and other action
alternatives) is further review of roads to confirm what segments on both open and closed
motorized routes are having adverse effects on inland native fish habitat. This would be
required particularly west of the Divide to develop a plan to minimize or eliminate those road
effects. This future federal action helps to meet the intent of INFISH amendments by identifying
specific roads and needed actions to avoid adverse road effects to inland native fish and fish
habitat.

Alternative 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 4 would have the direct effect of closing an additional 17.82 miles (14.2 percent) of
Forest Service high risk roads currently open to motorized wheeled vehicle use in the planning
area. Table 76 summarizes changes in the miles of open high risk roads for each 6th field HUC.
Fifteen sub-watersheds would experience various reductions in miles of open high risk roads;
therefore an indirect effect for those sub-watersheds is the potential for long-term reductions in
road sediment delivery in these drainages with increased opportunities to obliterate roadbeds
to help restore natural drainage and stream habitat. Six sub-watersheds would experience no
change in the miles of high risk roads currently open to motorized traffic so the indirect effect in
these drainages reflects the no action option in terms of sediment delivery and opportunities for
watershed restoration. The 0.05 mile of road in the Little Blackfoot-Elliston 6th HUC is an
unlikely sediment risk based on its short length and upper location in the INFISH zone and lack
of any crossings. This sub-watershed is therefore considered having virtually no substantive
change from existing conditions.
Alternative 4 also has the direct effect of closing 37 more Forest Service stream crossings to
motorized wheeled motorized vehicle use in the planning area compared with alternative 1.
Table 77 summarizes the changes in amount of open stream crossings in each sub-watershed.
Thirteen drainages would realize a reduction in open stream crossings to wheeled motorized
vehicle traffic with an indirect effect for potential reductions in long-term sediment delivery and
increased opportunities at removing culverts to help restore natural drainage and stream
habitat. Eight sub-watersheds would experience no change in the current numbers of open
stream crossings to motorized vehicle traffic so the indirect effect in these drainages reflects the
no action alternative in terms of sediment risk and opportunity at restoring drainages.

In effect, alternative 4 closes about 11.9 miles more high risk roads and 31 more crossings to
wheeled motorized vehicle traffic compared to alternative 2. Therefore, this alternative has
potential to amplify reductions in sediment production and delivery to streams in subwatersheds showing net reductions in these indicators. However, it does not achieve the
potential reductions in sediment production as much as alternative 3. This is due to proposals
that would maintain more open high risk roads particularly in Ontario Creek, Little Blackfoot-Hat
Creek and Upper Dog Creek (south of Hwy 12).

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternative 4 Specific to Occupied Bull Trout Habitat and Westslope
Cutthroat Trout Habitat:
The overall direct effect on westslope cutthroat trout drainages in the planning area would be
elimination of wheeled motorized traffic on about one mile of high risk road in one westslope
cutthroat trout drainage east of the Divide and approximately 10.52 miles of high risk road in
nine westslope cutthroat trout drainages west of the Divide. Skelly Gulch is the westslope
cutthroat trout drainage on the east side that would benefit from closing 0.4 miles of
hydrologically connected road and an active ford in westslope cutthroat trout habitat. Another
east-side drainage, Greenhorn Creek, is unlikely to support westslope cutthroat trout any longer
based on the latest findings by Forest Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks fisheries
crews in 2009 to 2012. This drainage would experience the direct effect of having 2.8 miles of
high risk road and seven stream crossings closed to wheeled motorized traffic. The indirect
effect on westslope cutthroat trout habitat in the planning area translates to the long-term
trend of reduced sedimentation into the surface water system for 15 sub-watersheds that
support fish populations; ten of these support westslope cutthroat trout.
Other direct effects from alternative 4 relate to fords and dispersed campsites tied to current
open high risk roads. Under alternative 4, one ford (road 123-013) would be permanently
closed and three other fords (roads 4100, 227-D1, 4104-A1A2) temporary closed. All are located
in documented bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout habitat. Therefore, risks for direct
mortality upon the early life history stages of bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout in Ontario
Creek and the Little Blackfoot River from wheeled motorized vehicle traffic through fords is
minimized or eliminated. Due to extremely low numbers of bull trout observed and
documented in the latest Forest Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks electrofishing
surveys between 2008 and 2012, risk of mortality to bull trout from wheeled motorized vehicle
traffic in the Little Blackfoot River or Ontario Creek is considered very low.
Ontario Creek (west of the Divide) is the only drainage that would experience a net increase in
opening high risk roads and crossings from their current closed status under this alternative.
Approximately 0.8 miles of high risk road would be opened to wheeled motorized vehicle use as
a result of a proposal to open road # 4104-A1/A2 for a loop experience. Ontario Creek would, in
addition, experience an increase of five stream crossings as open to wheeled motorized vehicle
use from current levels (see Table 77). Opening these stream crossings includes a ford on
Ontario Creek as a result of the proposal to open closed roads 4104-A1/A2 and 495-A3. The
indirect effect of opening these closed crossings to wheeled motorized use would be an
increased risk of sediment delivery into Ontario Creek and direct mortality of bull trout and
westslope cutthroat trout early life stages at the ford crossing. To protect TES fish and habitat
from wheeled vehicle disturbance at ford crossings, those crossings would be temporarily closed
until a bridge or other aquatic organism passage compliant bottomless structure could be
installed under a mitigation plan to protect water quality and native fish species. This resource
protective measure greatly reduces risk of direct mortality to the early life history stages of bull
trout and westslope cutthroat trout in Ontario Creek.
Three other open fords occur in westslope cutthroat trout habitat and are located in Skelly
Gulch east of the Divide (road 1853-A1), in Sawmill Gulch (road 4005) and an unnamed tributary
to Ontario Creek (road 495-D1) west of the Divide. As discussed above, a ford (and its
associated high risk road) on Skelly Gulch would be closed having the direct effect of eliminating
wheeled motorized traffic through westslope cutthroat trout habitat including the hydrologically
connected segment of road 1853-A1. The indirect effect would be minimization of chronic road

sediment delivery into westslope cutthroat trout habitat and protection of incubating westslope
cutthroat trout embryos and fry at risk from wheeled motorized disturbance through the
streambed. In Sawmill Gulch and the unnamed Ontario tributary, proposed mitigation to
protect westslope cutthroat trout would be in the form of temporary closing both fords until an
approved aquatic organism passage compliant structure sized to pass 100-year flood flows could
replace each ford. This has the indirect effect of avoiding potential direct mortality of westslope
cutthroat trout eggs/fry and reducing sedimentation from wheeled motorized disturbance of
the creek bed.
Four dispersed campsites accessed by non-system road 123-013 and two other dispersed
campsites accessed by road 227-E1 would be closed as a direct effect from closing these roads.
The direct effect would be the cessation of concentrated recreation activity along the banks of
the Little Blackfoot River associated with these six dispersed campsites. An indirect effect would
be the passive re-vegetation and reduced sedimentation at each dispersed campsite along the
Little Blackfoot River.
Alternatives 3 and 4 differ from alternatives 1 and 2 with regard to the existing open road 227E1, which extends beyond Kading campground 0.9 miles. This extension road would be
permanently closed to wheeled motorized vehicles under alternatives 4 and 3. Consequently,
approximately 0.6 miles of high risk road including one ford crossing and two high risk dispersed
campsites associated with this road would all close. The indirect effect translates to reduced
risk for chronic sedimentation and streambank alteration on inland native fish habitat in the
Little Blackfoot River.

Effects of Alternative 4 Specific to Western Pearlshell Mussel Habitat
Effects of alternative 4 on western pearlshell mussels or habitat are match those under
alternative 2 based on the rationale that discusses potential affects to western pearlshell
mussels.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There would be no irreversible commitment (permanent loss) of future options in regards to the
existing road system under alternative 4. The possibility remains to remove or relocate any
Forest Service road, closed or open, that is adversely affecting water quality, stream function,
TES fish habitat or public safety. This would occur under a separate decision with the purpose of
restoring stream processes that benefit water quality and fish populations.
There would be an irretrievable (temporary) commitment of resources related to ongoing road
sediment delivery to fish-bearing habitat due to some road locations resulting in a direct surface
flow path (hydrologic connection) to planning area streams. Approximately 17.4 percent of the
entire transportation system consists of Forest Service high risk roads including associated
Forest Service stream/road intersections that can cause an irretrievable commitment or
temporary loss of fish habitat quality restorable by eliminating or relocating those particular
roads or by applying some other adjustment measures on the roads to protect and restore
aquatic habitats. High risk roads where left untreated represent an ongoing cumulative effect
that decreases the overall fish production capabilities of fish habitat within the planning area.
Under designed culverts present an ongoing risk for releases of substantial stores of sediment in
the form of roadfills at culvert crossings and they pose potential barriers to fish migration.
Culverts at risk that have not been removed or upgraded with aquatic organism passage
compliant ones designed to pass 100-year floods present an irretrievable commitment upon
stream-riparian dependent fisheries.

Divide Travel Plan

Cumulative Effects
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable future non-road actions applicable to the Divide Travel
Plan are addressed in appendix B. The transportation system was not included in the list in
appendix B as it is addressed in detail within this report. For roads, Table 66 and Table 67 in the
affected environment section provide a quantitative overview of all stream/road intersections
and miles of high risk roads in each 6th field HUC as a measure of ongoing effects related to the
transportation system in the Divide Travel Plan area. Both tables refine the two road measures
by outlining totals currently open versus closed by 6th field HUC.
There are 719 miles of roads in the planning area including NFS routes and routes under other
ownership. About 165 miles are considered high risk roads that present risks for chronic
excessive sediment delivery to the surface water system, fragment stream habitat and/or alter
stream-floodplain functions. The Forest Service maintains jurisdiction on about 125.2 miles of
high risk roads and 95.96 miles are currently open (29.24 miles are closed). Under alternative 4,
about 78.14 miles of high risk Forest Service roads would remain open and the other 47.06 miles
(29.24 miles currently closed plus 17.82 proposed miles) or 37.6 percent would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicle use. Non- Forest Service roads account for 39.5 miles of high risk
roads in the planning area; these roads represent ongoing cumulative effects to streams in the
planning area.
There are in addition some 439 stream/road intersections throughout the planning area. The
Forest Service has jurisdiction on 329 crossings and 217 of those are currently open (112 are
closed). Alternative 4 would result in 180 crossings remaining open to motorized use and the
other 149 (112 currently closed plus 37 proposed closed) or 45.3 percent would be closed to
wheeled motorized vehicle use. Because stream crossings are principal access sites for road
sediment with localized physical alteration of stream habitat, their presence in the various
planning area drainages would constitute an ongoing cumulative impact on fish habitat. Closing
37 crossings under this alternative represents 8.4 percent of the total stream crossings in the
planning area with potential for permanent removal. Permanent removal of closed crossings
and mitigating open crossings would substantially reduce adverse effects on fish habitat under
an implementation plan that removes closed crossings and mitigates open crossings; however,
this would be slightly less than under alternative 3.
Additionally, nine Forest Service dispersed campsites associated with high risk roads remain
directly adjacent TES fish habitat and six of these would be closed under this alternative. These
sites would trend toward pre-disturbance conditions. Three dispersed recreation campsites
would remain open to public users risking adversely affects to TES fish habitat without effective
adjustment measures to meet riparian management objectives in riparian habitat conservation
areas.
Six currently open fords on TES fish streams would experience permanent or temporary closures
to reduce risk of direct mortality to early life stages of westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout.
A seventh closed ford in Ontario Creek would remain closed to wheeled motorized traffic. The
physical presence of these fords would remain an ongoing risk for sediment delivery to TES fish
habitat until measures under an implementation plan would replace fords with bottomless
structures on roads planned to be open or rehabilitate those proposed for closure in this
alternative. In non-fish-bearing streams, a ford on an unnamed tributary to the Little Blackfoot
River above Kading campground would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicle traffic leading to
a long-term trend of eliminating or minimizing road sediment delivery downstream into native
fish habitat.

Divide Travel Plan

An important project common amongst all alternatives is under consideration for funding to
help improve access needs prerequisite to the foreseeable Telegraph Creek Mountain Pine
Beetle Salvage project. This project would replace the large ford on the Little Blackfoot River
with a bridge associated with road # 4100 (Negro Mountain Road). Consequently, there would
be the permanent removal of 0.1 mile of high risk road from the Little Blackfoot floodplain and
three other stream crossings in TES fish habitat. There would also be foreseeable future
direction under a biological opinion for bull trout to confirm what segments of roads are having
adverse effects to inland native fish habitat prerequisite to developing a plan to eliminate or
minimize those impacts.

Forest Plan Consistency

Table 66 and Table 67 quantify the amount of roads and crossings having risk to inland native
fish and fish habitat. Under alternative 4, approximately 17.82 miles of Forest Service high risk
roads and 37 stream crossings in the planning area having risk to native fish and fish habitat
would be closed. Therefore, this alternative is less aggressive than alternatives 3 and 5 at
moving the planning area toward consistency with INFISH amendments to the Forest Plan.
Alternative 4 would move the planning area forward to help meet the intent of the INFISH
amendments more aggressively than action alternative 2. To help maintain consistency with the
Forest Plan, an element common amongst action alternatives is that opened fords in TES fish
habitat would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles until appropriate mitigation measures
are in place to minimize or eliminate ongoing adverse effects from high risk roads and wheeled
motorized use through fords.
Additionally, a reasonably foreseeable federal action under this and other action alternatives
would be further review of roads to confirm what segments on both open and closed motorized
routes are having adverse effects to inland native fish habitat. This would be required
particularly west of the Divide to develop a plan to minimize or eliminate road effects on
streams. This future federal action helps to meet the intent of INFISH by identifying specific
roads and needed actions to avoid adverse road effects to inland native fish and fish habitat.

Alternative 5
Direct and Indirect Effects
Alternative 5 would have the direct effect of closing an additional 29.23 miles (23.3 percent) of
Forest Service high risk roads currently open to motorized wheeled vehicle use in the planning
area. Table 78 summarizes the changes in the miles of open high risk roads for each 6th field
HUC. Eighteen sub-watersheds would experience various reductions in miles of open high risk
roads; therefore, an indirect effect for these sub-watersheds would be the potential for
substantial reductions in long-term road sediment delivery to streams with maximum
opportunities to obliterate roadbeds to help restore natural drainage and stream habitat. Two
sub-watersheds would experience no change in the miles of high risk roads currently open to
motorized traffic so the indirect effect in these drainages reflects the no action option in terms
of road sediment delivery and opportunities for watershed restoration as it applies to road
obliteration.
Alternative 5 also has the direct effect of closing 67 more Forest Service stream crossings to
wheeled motorized vehicle use in the planning area from the current levels (alternative 1).
Table 79 summarizes these changes for each sub-watershed. Fifteen drainages undergo various
FISHERIES - 239

reductions in the number of open stream crossings with an indirect effect to minimize long-term
road sediment delivery with maximum opportunity to remove crossing structures compared to
all other alternatives. Removing the most crossings, especially culverts, under this alternative
would provide the highest level of restoration to stream habitat amongst alternatives. Six subwatersheds would experience no change in the current open status of stream crossings; the
indirect effect in these drainages reflects the no action alternative in terms of sediment risk and
opportunities for restoring drainage and stream habitat.

In effect, alternative 5 closes about 23.34 miles more high risk roads and 61 more stream
crossings to wheeled motorized vehicle traffic compared to initial proposed alternative 2.
Therefore, this alternative has potential to substantially amplify reductions in sediment
production and delivery to streams in sub-watersheds showing net reductions in these
indicators. This alternative in fact would achieve the potential to minimize sediment production
and maximize opportunities for watershed restoration as a function of road obliterations and
culvert removals amongst all the alternatives.

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternative 5 Specific to Occupied Bull Trout Habitat and Westslope
Cutthroat Trout Habitat:
The overall direct effect on westslope cutthroat trout drainages in the planning area would be
elimination of wheeled motorized traffic on at least one mile of high risk road in one westslope
cutthroat trout drainage east of the Divide (Skelly Gulch) and approximately 19.29 miles of high
risk road throughout twelve westslope cutthroat trout drainages west of the Divide. In Skelly
Gulch approximately 0.4 miles of hydrologically connected road and an open ford would be
closed as a direct effect of this alternative. Although Greenhorn Creek remains questionable in
terms of westslope cutthroat trout present based on the latest findings by Forest Service and
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks fisheries crews, this drainage would experience the direct
effect of closing 3.28 miles of high risk road including eight stream crossings to wheeled
motorized traffic. The indirect effect of all road closures on fish habitat relates to the long-term
trend of reduced sedimentation into the surface water system of 18 sub-watersheds that
support fish populations in the planning area; 13 of these support westslope cutthroat trout.
With few exceptions, alternative 5 surpasses alternative 3 overall regarding improving trends on
TES habitat from proposals that close high risk roads and crossings in the planning area.
Other direct effects under alternative 5 relate to fords and dispersed campsites associated with
current open high risk roads. This alternative would have the effect of closing four fords (roads
4100, 227-D1, 4104-A1/A2, 123-013) to wheeled motorized vehicle use in documented bull
trout habitat. The ford (road 4104-A2) in upper Ontario Creek is currently closed and would
remain so under this alternative. Additionally, a ford on a fishless tributary above Kading
campground would become permanently closed in conjunction with closing road 227-E1, which
includes a 0.6 mile segment of high risk road. The indirect effect is predicted reduction in
sediment delivery at this ford. Therefore, risk for direct mortality to bull trout and westslope
cutthroat trout in Ontario Creek and the Little Blackfoot River as a function of wheeled
motorized traffic through fords becomes discountable. Due to extremely low numbers of bull
trout observed and documented in the latest Forest Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and
Parks electrofishing surveys between 2008 and 2012, risk of mortality to bull trout from
wheeled motorized vehicle traffic in the Little Blackfoot River or Ontario Creek is considered to
be very low.
Three other open fords are in westslope cutthroat trout habitat. One is located in Skelly Gulch
east of the Divide (road 1853-A1) and two others are in Sawmill Gulch (road 4005) and an
unnamed tributary to Ontario Creek (road 495-D1) west of the Divide. As discussed above, a
ford including its associated high risk road on Skelly Gulch would be closed having the direct
effect of eliminating wheeled motorized traffic through westslope cutthroat trout habitat
including the hydrologically connected segment of road 1853-A1. The indirect effect would be
minimization of chronic road sediment delivery into westslope cutthroat trout habitat and
protection of incubating westslope cutthroat trout embryos and fry potentially at risk of direct
mortality related to wheeled motorized traffic through the streambed. Two fords west of the
Divide in Sawmill Gulch and the unnamed Ontario tributary would have proposed mitigation to
protect westslope cutthroat trout by temporarily closing the fords until an approved aquatic
organism passage compliant structure sized to pass 100-year flood flows could replace the
existing fords. That would have the indirect effect of preventing potential direct mortality of
westslope cutthroat trout fry and eggs and reducing sedimentation from wheeled motorized
traffic through the creek bed and crossing approaches.

FISHERIES - 242

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Four dispersed campsites accessed by non-system road 123-013 and two dispersed campsites
accessed by road 227-E1 would be closed as a direct effect of closing those roads. This has the
additional direct effect of eliminating concentrated recreation activity along the banks of the
Little Blackfoot River in association with these six dispersed campsites with the indirect effect of
passive re-vegetation and reduced sedimentation in the long-term at each of these dispersed
campsites next to the Little Blackfoot River.
Modifications proposed under alternative 5 serve as tradeoffs for maximizing the miles of high
risk roads and stream crossings proposed closed compared to all the other alternatives. West of
the Divide these changes indirectly affect Elliston Creek, Ontario Creek and Telegraph Creek
headwater tributaries. East of the Divide these changes indirectly affect streams only in the Iron
Horse sub-watershed.
A direct effect of this alternative would be the addition of 0.13 miles of high risk road including a
stream crossing opened to wheeled motorized vehicle use in Elliston Creek (see Table 78 and
Table 79) as a result of adding motorized trail #1871-001 to the system of designated routes
open for wheeled motorized vehicle use. The indirect effect of opening this road segment for
wheeled motorized use relate primarily to increasing the risk for road sediment production and
delivery into westslope cutthroat trout habitat in Elliston Creek including risk for direct mortality
to westslope cutthroat trout embryo and fry at the new stream crossing in Elliston Creek
without mitigation to replace the ford with a bottomless pipe structure.
For Ontario Creek, maintaining closure of roads 4104-A1 and A2 and instead adding route 123001 as a seasonal motorized trail results in a net reduction of only 0.05 miles of high risk road
and three less stream crossings open to wheeled motorized use. Other proposed road closures
in Ontario Creek increases the amount of high risk road that would be closed overall in this
drainage to 0.37 miles; therefore, there is potential to decrease road sediment delivery in the
long-term in westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout habitat. The closure of the ford associated
with road 4104-A2 is offset by opening a new ford associated with opening route 123-001 to
seasonal motorized trail use. To protect early life stages of TES fish at this ford, it would remain
closed until the proper aquatic organism passage compliant structure designed to pass 100-year
flood flows could be installed.
In Telegraph Creek the direct effect is a net total of 2.38 miles of high risk road being closed and
potentially a long-term reduction in road sediment delivery into westslope cutthroat trout
habitat as an indirect effect under this alternative. However, there would be no net reduction in
open stream crossings compared to alternatives 3 and 4 even with this amount of high risk
roads proposed for closure (see Table 79). This is primarily due to opening routes 1857 and
1859, including some ancillary routes, on the southwest side of the Telegraph drainage to
provide additional opportunity for seasonal motorized trail use. Four stream crossings closed
under the action alternatives 3 and 4 remain closed under this alternative; however, the
proposed seasonal motorized trail system under this alternative would bisect four other
headwater tributaries cancelling out crossing closures elsewhere in this drainage. These
crossings do not occur in fish-bearing streams and do not occur on fords so there would be no
risk of direct mortality to trout at these crossings.
On the east side of the Divide the Iron Horse Creek 6th HUC would likely experience increases in
sediment delivery as a function of opening an additional 0.49 miles of high risk road primarily in
Lost Horse Creek. However, no conservation populations of westslope cutthroat trout occur in
that creek and there would be no changes in amount of open stream crossings.

Effects of Alternative 5 Specific to Western Pearlshell Mussel Habitat
Effects of alternative 5 on western pearlshell mussels or habitat are the same as under
alternative 2 based on rationale that discusses potential affects to western pearlshell mussels.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments
There is no irreversible commitment (permanent loss) of future options in regards to the road
system under alternative 5. The possibility remains for any Forest Service road, closed or
opened, that is adversely affecting water quality, stream function, TES fish habitat or public
safety to be removed or relocated under a separate decision so that stream processes can be
restored that benefit water quality and fish populations.
There would be an irretrievable (temporary) commitment of resources related to ongoing road
sediment delivery to fish habitat under this alternative due to some road locations having a
direct surface flow path (hydrologic connection) to project area streams. Approximately 17.4
percent of the entire transportation system consists of Forest Service high risk roads including
associated Forest Service stream/road intersections that can cause an irretrievable commitment
or temporary loss of fish habitat quality restorable by eliminating, relocating, or applying some
other project design features on those roads to restore and protect aquatic habitat. High risk
roads where left untreated represent an ongoing cumulative effect that decreases the overall
fish production capabilities of fish habitat within the planning area.
Under-designed culverts present an ongoing risk for releases of substantial stores of sediment in
the form of roadfills at culvert crossings and they pose potential barriers to fish migration.
Culverts at risk that have not been removed or upgraded with aquatic organism passage
compliant ones designed to pass 100-year floods present an irretrievable commitment upon
stream-riparian dependent fisheries.

Cumulative Effects
Past, present and reasonably foreseeable future non-road actions applicable to the Divide Travel
Plan area are addressed in appendix B. The transportation system was not included in the list in
appendix B as it is addressed in detail within this report. Table 66 and Table 67 under the
affected environment section provide a quantitative overview of all stream/road intersections
and miles of high risk roads in each 6th field HUC as a measure of ongoing effects related to the
transportation system in the Divide Travel Plan area. Both the tables refine the two road
measures by outlining the totals currently open versus closed by 6th field HUC.
There are approximately 719 miles of roads in the planning area including NFS routes and routes
under other ownership. About 165 miles are considered high risk roads that risk chronic
excessive road sediment delivery to the surface water system, fragment stream habitat and/or
alter stream-floodplain functions. The Forest Service maintains jurisdiction over 125.2 miles of
high risk roads and about 95.96 miles are currently open to wheeled motorized vehicle use (the
other 29.24 miles are currently closed).
Under alternative 5, about 66.73 miles of high risk Forest Service roads would remain open and
58.47 miles (29.24 miles currently closed plus 29.23 proposed miles) or 46.7 percent would be
closed to wheeled motorized vehicle use. Non- Forest Service roads account for 39.5 miles of
the high risk roads in the planning area; these roads represent an ongoing cumulative effect to
the surface water system and fish habitat in the planning area.
There are also 439 stream/road intersections throughout the planning area and the Forest
Service has jurisdiction over 329 crossings. Currently 217 Forest Service crossings are currently

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

open (112 are closed). Alternative 5 would result in 150 crossings remaining open to wheeled
motorized use and the other 179 (112 currently closed plus 67 proposed closed) or 54.4 percent
would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicle use. Because stream crossings are principal
access sites for road sediment with localized physical alterations of stream habitat, their
presence in planning area drainages would constitute an ongoing cumulative impact on fish
habitat. Closing 67 crossings under this alternative represents 15.3 percent of the total stream
crossings in the planning area with potential for permanent removal. Alternative 5 provides the
highest measure to close crossings with the prospect to remove more than 50 percent of the
crossings in the planning area. In conjunction with mitigation applied to the remaining open
crossings, this alternative has the potential to reduce or minimize ongoing effects on fish habitat
the most amongst alternatives under an implementation plan that could follow this decision.
Additionally, nine Forest Service dispersed campsites associated with high risk roads are directly
adjacent TES fish habitat and six of these would close under this alternative. Therefore,
activities associated with concentrated recreation use next to TES fish habitat at six campsites
would cease. Subsequently, disturbance to riparian vegetation, streambank disturbance and
compacted soils at these sites are predicted to trend toward pre-disturbance conditions in the
long-term. Three other dispersed recreation campsites would remain open to public users
having some risk to adversely affect TES fish habitat without effective adjustment measures to
meet riparian management objectives in riparian habitat conservation areas.
Six fords currently open on TES fish streams would experience permanent or temporary closures
that would minimize or eliminate risk of direct mortality to early life stages of westslope
cutthroat trout and bull trout. A seventh ford located in Ontario Creek would remain closed to
wheeled motorized vehicle disturbance. The physical presence of these fords, however, remain
an ongoing risk for sediment delivery to TES fish habitat until measures under an
implementation plan would result in replacing temporarily closed fords with bottomless
structures or rehabilitate crossings proposed to be closed under this alternative. In non-fishbearing streams, the ford on the Little Blackfoot River unnamed tributary above Kading
campground would be permanently closed to wheeled motorized vehicle traffic subsequently
leading to a long-term trend of eliminating or minimizing road sediment delivery downstream
into native fish habitat from this site.
One potential project related to this project is under consideration which would improve access
needs prerequisite to the foreseeable Telegraph Creek Mountain Pine Beetle Salvage project.
This project would replace the large ford on the Little Blackfoot River with a bridge associated
with road # 4100 (Negro Mountain road) in conjunction with rerouting a portion of road # 123
(Ontario Cr road). Consequently, there would be the permanent removal of 0.1 mile of high risk
road from the Little Blackfoot floodplain and three other stream crossings in TES fish habitat.
There would also be foreseeable future direction under a biological opinion for bull trout to
determine which segments of roads are having adverse effects to inland native fish habitat
prerequisite to developing a plan to eliminate or minimize those impacts.

Forest Plan Consistency

Table 66 and Table 67 quantify the amount of roads and crossings having risk to inland native
fish and fish habitat. Alternative 5 would result in closing 29.23 miles of Forest Service high risk
roads and 67 stream crossings potentially at risk to native fish and fish habitat in the planning
area. This alternative leaves the least amount of roads and stream crossings open that pose risk
for adverse effects to native fishes and fish habitat. For instance, alternative 5 closes up to 54
FISHERIES - 245

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

percent of road/stream crossings and 46.7 percent of all high risk roads in the planning area.
Therefore, it moves the travel planning area toward consistency with INFISH amendments to the
Forest Plan most aggressively amongst all alternatives. To help maintain consistency with the
Forest Plan, an element common in all action alternatives is that opened fords in TES fish habitat
would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles until appropriate mitigation measures are in
place that minimize or eliminate ongoing adverse effects from high risk roads and wheeled
motorized use through fords.
Additionally, a reasonably foreseeable federal action under this and other alternatives would be
further review of roads to confirm what segments on both open and closed motorized routes
are having adverse effects to inland native fish habitat. This would be required particularly west
of the Divide to develop a plan to minimize or eliminate road impacts on streams. This future
federal action helps to meet the intent of INFISH amendments by identifying specific roads and
needed actions to avoid adverse road effects to inland native fish and fish habitat.

Conclusions

The transportation system in the Divide Travel Plan area consists of approximately 719 miles of
roads that extend throughout portions of 22 sub-watersheds on the Helena Ranger District. The
project area extends to both sides of the Continental Divide. The majority of planning area
roads is under Forest Service jurisdiction while the remaining roads are on lands of other
ownership. This report examines only the Forest Service roads as various segments are
proposed to be designated closed to wheeled motorized vehicle use while a few others would
be designated opened compared to baseline conditions (no action).

Another element of the Divide Travel Plan relates to over-snow travel typically for motorized
winter recreation. Motorized over-snow traffic would also realize some area and route changes
compared to baseline conditions in the planning area. Because ground conditions for this type
of recreation or travel activity are frozen and covered with snow, motorized over-snow travel is
assumed having minimal or no sediment risk to streams. Therefore, this component of travel
planning was essentially dismissed from consideration as a potential adverse effect or risk to
streams and fish habitat.
The planning area supports over 140 miles of fish-bearing streams throughout 21 of 22 subwatersheds. Not all sub-watersheds lie entirely within the planning area. The fish assemblage
consists of a mix of native and non-native species. Non-native brook trout and rainbow trout
account for 96 percent of the fishery in the upper Missouri River side of the planning area and
non-native brown trout and brook trout comprise about 65 percent of the fishery in the Upper
Clark Fork River basin side of the planning area. Native salmonids include westslope cutthroat
trout both sides of the Divide and bull trout occur only west of the Divide in the planning area.
Other native fish present in the planning area include mountain whitefish, longnose suckers and
sculpins. Westslope cutthroat trout are designated a Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species listed
and are the fish management indicator species on the Helena National Forest. Bull trout are
listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The western pearlshell
mussel was added to the aquatic sensitive species list in June 2011 and they are therefore
considered for potential effects from this project.
Evidence from all studies, reviews and bibliographies on effects of sedimentation constitutes a
strong indictment how anthropogenic sediment exceeding natural background levels is a
stressor to the biological integrity and productivity of clean freshwater streams. Roads have
FISHERIES - 246

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

been documented to produce the most sediment and stream alteration among all forest landuse activities. The major threat upon benthic invertebrates is the smothering of physical habitat
by sediment deposition on the streambed. To trout, the threat from chronic excess sediment is
to their reproductive success and loss of rearing habitat. Most roads in the planning area,
however, are located far enough away from the stream network so that they do not pose such
risks. Therefore, this report separates out only Forest Service roads that parallel and bisect
streams. The focus for this analysis is on roads within INFISH buffers (as they pertain west of the
Divide) but extended both sides of the Divide for consistency and referred in this report as high
risk roads. Two measures used in discerning and quantifying the road/stream relationship are
high risk roads (those within INFISH buffers) and road/stream intersections (crossings).
Currently there are approximately 125.2 miles of high risk roads and 329 stream crossings under
Forest Service jurisdiction throughout the planning area. Under existing conditions, there are
about 29.24 miles (23 percent) of the high risk roads and 112 (34 percent) stream crossings
currently closed to wheeled motorized vehicle travel. Closing high risk roads has the direct
effect of eliminating motorized vehicle traffic (and road maintenance) on the roadbed and
indirectly allows exposed road surfaces to passively re-vegetate and accumulate duff, thus,
reducing sedimentation. Closing roads additionally sets the stage for potential future road
obliteration or storage opportunities as a tool to help restore watersheds and fish habitat.
Four action alternatives, with few exceptions, would close additional high risk roads and
associated stream crossings in the planning area to wheeled motorized vehicle use. The
administrative action of closing open roads and stream crossings helps to reduce their impacts
on water quality and fish habitat by permanently discontinuing wheeled vehicle disturbance
over the roadbed. The five alternatives for the Divide Travel Plan each have different levels of
high risk road and crossing closures and those differences are quantified respectively in Figure 4
and Figure 5 below.

The general forestwide standard for fisheries is met in the action alternatives via close
coordination with fisheries staff throughout the entire planning process as specified in the
Forest Plan (pg II-22). No alternative involves road construction or reconstruction so standards
for instream activities or structures do not apply, except under cumulative effects activities
where all work in streams has been closely coordinated with fisheries staff and the state Fish,
Wildlife and Parks department to ensure spawning habitats remain accessible and are not
adversely affected by sediment and channel alteration. Road maintenance is covered in
accordance with direction provided in the Transportation System Maintenance Handbook and
special measures provided under the 1999 Programmatic Biological Assessment for Road
Maintenance (MT Bull Trout Level 1 Team).
The no action alternative (existing condition) would maintain the current level of 95.96 miles of
high risk roads and 217 stream crossings open for wheeled motorized vehicle travel while 29.24
miles and 112 crossings would remain closed. This meets general forestwide standards by
means of coordinating with forest fisheries staff throughout the planning process and there are
no proposals for road construction or reconstruction so standards for instream activities or
structures do not apply. No action, however, would fall short of INFISH standards RF-2c and RF3c because there would be no effort to move the transportation system forward to avoid the
ongoing impacts associated with the existing road network such as closing additional high risk
roads in inland native fish habitat.
Alternative 2 moves the planning area toward consistency with the INFISH amendment the least
amongst all action alternatives by closing 5.89 miles (4.7 percent) of high risk Forest Service
roads and six more stream crossings relative to existing conditions in the planning area. Only
1.21 miles of the proposed closures occur west of the Divide. The INFISH standards RF-2c and
RF-3c are met by development of this Travel Management Plan and distinguishing those roads
on the transportation system in need for closing, stabilizing or other future mitigation activities
that help to avoid adverse impacts to inland native fish. Two fords located directly in occupied
TES fish habitat would be closed permanently under this alternative and the five other fords
closed temporarily until those fords are replaced with aquatic organism passage compliant
structures sized for 100-year flood flows. Additionally, this alternative would close wheeled

motorized access to four (of nine) dispersed recreation campsites currently having ongoing
adverse impacts on native fish habitat, including documented bull trout habitat, adjacent to
those campsites. Recreation management standards RM-1 and RM-2 would be met for four
campsites having adverse effects on native fish habitat since they would be closed while the
other five high risk campsites are identified for future adjustments to avoid adverse effects on
fish habitat under a separate NEPA analysis. This alternative therefore helps eliminate risk of
direct mortality on TES fish and reduce habitat disturbance from fords and dispersed camping
activity.
Alternative 3 would move the planning area toward consistency with the INFISH amendment to
the Forest Plan aggressively because it would close 21.27 miles (16.9 percent) of high risk Forest
Service roads and 46 more stream crossings relative to existing conditions in the planning area.
This amounts to the most closures after alternative 5. INFISH standards RF-2c and RF-3c are
met by development of this Travel Management Plan and distinguishing which roads on the
transportation system are in need for closing, stabilizing or other future mitigation activities that
help to avoid adverse impacts to inland native fish. Five fords located directly in occupied TES
fish habitat would be permanently closed under this alternative and two others would be
temporarily closed till replaced with aquatic organism passage compliant structures sized for
100 year flood flows. Additionally, this alternative would close wheeled motorized access to six
(of nine) dispersed recreation campsites having adverse impacts on native fish habitat, including
documented bull trout habitat, adjacent to those campsites. Recreation management standards
RM-1 and RM-2 would be met for six campsites having ongoing impacts on native fish habitat
since they would be closed. The other three high risk campsites are identified under this
analysis for future adjustments to avoid adverse effects on fish habitat under a separate NEPA
analysis. Thus, this alternative would be highly effective at eliminating risk of direct mortality on
TES fish and reducing habitat disturbance from fords and dispersed camping activity in the
planning area.
Alternative 4 would also move the planning area toward consistency with the INFISH
amendment very aggressively because it results in the closure of 17.82 miles (14.2 percent) of
high risk Forest Service roads and 37 more stream crossings relative to existing conditions in the
planning area. This amounts to more closures than alternative 2, but fewer than alternatives 3
and 5. The INFISH standards RF-2c and RF-3c are met by development of this Travel
Management Plan and distinguishing which roads on the transportation system are in need for
closing, stabilizing or other future mitigation activities that help to avoid adverse impacts to
inland native fish. Two fords located directly in occupied TES fish habitat would be closed
permanently under this alternative and the five other fords closed temporarily till replaced with
aquatic organism passage compliant structures sized for 100-year flood flows. Additionally, this
alternative would close wheeled motorized access to six (of nine) dispersed recreation
campsites having adverse impacts on native fish habitat, including documented bull trout
habitat, adjacent to those campsites. Recreation management standards RM-1 and RM-2 would
be met for six campsites having ongoing impacts on native fish habitat since they would be
closed. The other three high risk campsites are identified under this analysis for future
adjustments to avoid adverse effects on fish habitat under a separate NEPA analysis. This
alternative would also be effective at eliminating risk of direct mortality on TES fish and reducing
habitat disturbance from fords and dispersed camping activity in the planning area. Compared
to alternative 3, this alternative would open a closed route (road 4104-A1/A2) in upper Ontario
Creek and result in replacing an existing ford with a bridge on Ontario Creek as opposed to
permanently closing the crossing under alternative 3.
FISHERIES - 249

Environmental Impact Statement

Alternative 5 would move the planning area toward consistency with the Inland Native Fish
Strategy (INFISH) amendment to the Forest Plan most aggressively of all the alternatives
because it would close 29.23 miles (23.3 percent) of high risk Forest Service roads and 67 more
stream crossings relative to existing conditions in the planning area. This amounts to the most
closures of high risk roads amongst all alternatives. INFISH standards RF-2c and RF-3c are met
by development of this Travel Management Plan and distinguishing which roads on the
transportation system are in need for closing, stabilizing, or other future mitigation activities
that help avoid adverse impacts to inland native fish. Five fords located directly in occupied TES
fish habitat would be permanently closed under this alternative and two others would be
temporarily closed until they could be replaced with aquatic organism passage compliant
structures sized for 100-year flood flows. Additionally, this alternative would close wheeled
motorized access to six (of nine) dispersed recreation campsites having adverse impacts on
native fish habitat, including documented bull trout habitat, adjacent to those campsites.
Recreation management standards RM-1 and RM-2 would be met for six campsites having
ongoing impacts on native fish habitat since they would be closed. The other three high risk
campsites are identified under this analysis for future adjustments to avoid adverse effects on
fish habitat under a separate NEPA analysis. This alternative and alternative 3 would be most
effective at eliminating risk of direct mortality on TES fish and reducing habitat disturbance from
fords and dispersed camping activity in the planning area.
As evidenced by the magnitude and extent of high risk roads and crossings in the planning area,
the Forest Service road system presents a high degree of risk for adverse effects on inland native
fish and fish habitat in the planning area without meaningful measures to minimize those risks.
Stream crossings and high risk road segments under other ownerships (see Table 66 and Table
67) represent road use activity considered an ongoing cumulative effect outside current Forest
Service control. A Biological Evaluation/Assessment is needed to satisfy requirements of the
Forest Service Manual (FSM) at FSM 2672.4 to review Forest Service actions for possible effects
to listed, proposed or sensitive species. To that end, projected effects to the federally listed bull
trout, the sensitive westslope cutthroat trout and sensitive western pearlshell mussel have been
summarized in Table 80 below. A biological evaluation for sensitive westslope cutthroat trout
and western pearlshell mussel will be completed for the preferred alternative. Because of
adverse baseline conditions to listed bull trout habitat, formal consultation via a bull trout
assessment will be prepared and submitted to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.

Summary of Determinations for Alternative 5

Alternative 5 (the preferred alternative) will have both beneficial and adverse effects on bull
trout. Background sedimentation will still occur under all the alternatives due to the remaining
high risk roads left open in the analysis area. This will continue to have adverse effects on bull
trout into the foreseeable future. However, bull trout will experience the immediate and longterm beneficial effects of closures to high risk roads, crossings and associated recreation sites
resulting in a reduction of sediment delivery to their habitat.
The actions in alternative 5 may impact individual westslope cutthroat trout by continuing to
have some sediment delivery into their habitat by the remaining open roads. However, this will
not likely cause an impact to the westslope cutthroat trout population in the analysis area and
therefore will not result in a trend for listing. Westslope cutthroat trout will also experience the
immediate and long-term beneficial effects of closures to high risk roads, crossings and
associated recreation sites resulting in a reduction of sediment delivery to their habitat.
Westslope cutthroat trout will not be affected because of the location of their occurrences and
predicted habitat will not be affected through the actions in alternative 5.

WILDLIFE
Introduction
The Divide landscape of the Helena National Forest (HNF) supports a diverse assemblage of
wildlife populations typical of most National Forests in the northern Rockies. While the
landscape encompasses numerous blocks of habitat in which human presence is fleeting and
slight, roads and trails have been a prevalent feature of this landscape since the mid-late 19th
century. Motorized routes concentrate human activity and harbor the potential to influence
wildlife species and their habitats in a variety of ways. Wildlife response to roads can be highly
variable depending on the inherent reaction of the species to human influences; the character,
severity and longevity of the road impacts; the habitat context; the time of year; and so on.
The Divide Travel Plan is proposing a number of changes to the current road and motor trail
system in the Divide landscape. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the
Travel Plan presents 4 alternative scenarios for travel management in addition to the existing
condition:
•

•
•

•

•

Alternative 1 would retain the existing condition, with 439 miles of Forest, County and
private roads; 35 miles of trails available to public use via wheeled motor vehicles during
all or part of the year (16 miles of which are currently unauthorized); and 418 miles of
snowmobile routes.
Alternative 2 would support approximately 433 miles of open Forest, County and
private access roads; 36 miles of motor trails; and 394 miles of snowmobile routes.
Alternative 3 would put more emphasis on non-motorized routes and would support
approximately 394 miles of open Forest, County and private access roads; no authorized
motor trails; and 416 miles of snowmobile routes.
Alternative 4 is a modified version of Alternative 3, with 403 miles of open Forest,
County and private access roads; 4 miles of authorized motor trails; and 404 miles of
snowmobile routes.
Alternative 5, while designed to provide a variety of motorized loop trails, eliminates
numerous parallel and dead-end roads and closes several other routes in an effort to

enhance big game security. It would provide 284 miles of open Forest, County and
private access roads; 64 miles of authorized motor trails; and 403 miles of snowmobile
routes
The above mileages include 118 miles of County and private access roads open to the public
within National Forest administrative boundaries. These roads are open under all alternatives.
The Travel Plan deals with Helena National Forest lands in the Divide landscape of the Helena
Ranger District. Not included are the Clancy-Unionville implementation area in the
southeastern part of the landscape and most of the Little Prickly Pear drainage in the northern
end, both of which have been covered by earlier travel planning efforts (Sound Wood Salvage
Project, 1998; Clancy-Unionville Vegetation Manipulation and Travel Management Project,
2003;). This report describes the current environment for terrestrial wildlife in the Divide
landscape with an emphasis on the influence of the existing road and motor trail network. It
then examines the expected response of wildlife communities to each of the 5 proposed
alternatives. The following components are addressed:
General Habitat—including Old-Growth Forest
•
Riparian Habitats
•
Connectivity – Habitat Fragmentation, Movement Corridors and Linkage Zones
•
Snags and Woody Debris
•
Migratory landbirds and Shorebirds
•
Big Game Species
•
Threatened, Endangered and Sensitive (TES) species
•
Forest Plan Management Indicator Species (MIS)
I have abbreviated analysis of species, groups of species and habitat components for which the
probability of a meaningful effect is very low. This includes some species and habitat elements
that figure prominently in assessments of timber harvest and prescribed burning projects, but
will suffer few, if any, direct effects from the kind of travel management proposed here. The
northern goshawk, for example, may suffer significant loss of nesting habitat from
unconstrained timber harvest, but is unlikely to be affected in any meaningful way by Divide
Travel Plan proposals. These species and components are addressed, but not at length.
Quantitative analysis is reserved for species and habitat elements that may be influenced in
measurable ways by implementation of any of the alternatives proposed by this travel planning
effort. In some cases, detailed discussion of indicator species (such as elk) serves as a surrogate
for other potentially affected species (such as mule deer and moose) that are addressed in less
detail.
•

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
National Forest Management Act

The Forest Service is charged with maintaining the viability of all existing native and desired nonnative vertebrate species in a planning area under the National Forest Management Act of 1976
(NFMA) (36 CFR 219.19). A forest plan must identify “management indicator species” (MIS) that
serve as proxies for fulfilling this NFMA viability requirement [see Helena Forest Plan (1986)
page II/17]. The regulations impose a standard by requiring development of habitat objectives
for maintaining viability of MIS throughout a planning area. In this report, an assessment of
Forest Plan management indicator species (MIS) can be found in the “Affected Environment”
WILDLIFE - 252

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

and “Environmental Consequences” sections. A further discussion of population viability of MIS
is provided in Appendix E.

Forest Service Manual

The Forest Service Manual (FSM) provides direction for the management of terrestrial resources.
FSM 2630 provides overall objectives for maintaining and improving wildlife habitat. Section
2670 establishes objectives and procedures for managing and protecting threatened,
endangered and sensitive species. This latter section directs that the Forest Sevice prepare a
biological evaluation for any of its activities that may affect threatened, endangered, proposed,
or sensitive species. In this report, the assessment of threatened and sensitive species in the
“Affected Environment” and “Environmental Consequences” sections serves as the Biological
Evaluation for species known to be present in the Travel Plan Area. A summary of the
evaluation for all species on the Helena NF can be found in Appendix F.

Helena Forest Plan
The Helena Forest Plan (HFP), developed in the early 1980s and released in 1986, sets the
framework for management of wildlife species. Forestwide standards and guidelines for wildlife
are identified on pages II/17 – II/21. In addition, the standards incorporate more detailed
direction for elk and grizzly bears in Appendices C, D and E. The standards and guidelines are
applied to all alternatives in the following analysis as appropriate.

Endangered Species Act

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 requires all Federal agencies to review all projects to
ensure that the action is not likely to jeopardize continued existence of any proposed,
threatened, or endangered species. This is documented in a biological assessment for those
listed or proposed species present in the project area. In cases where the assessment
determines that a proposed action may affect a listed or proposed species, the ESA requires
consultation with and concurrence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) before a
decision can be signed. A Biological Assessment for the 2 threatened terrestrial wildlife species
in the Divide Travel Plan Area will be prepared as a separate document, once the Record of
Decision for the project has been developed. [The Biological Evaluation of threatened,
endangered and sensitive (TES) species is a requirement of Forest Service policy and is included
within this report.]

National Environmental Policy Act

The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires that all environmental analyses consider
a full range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, alternatives that address the
significant issues and meet the purpose and need for the proposed action. As the Divide Travel
Plan has evolved over the past few years, the number of alternatives has expanded from three
to five. The Wildlife Specialist Report presents an in-depth review of the potential effects of
each of these alternatives on the wildlife environment. These findings are then presented in
much the same form and detail in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and will be used to
shape the final decision presented in the Record of Decision.

Migratory Bird Memorandum of Understanding

In December 2008, the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) signed a
“Memorandum of Understanding” to promote the conservation of migratory birds (USFS and
WILDLIFE - 253

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

USDI 2008). Section D(3) of the Memorandum obliges the Forest Service, within its NEPA
process, to “evaluate the effects of agency action on migratory birds, focusing first on species of
management concern along with their priority habitats and key risk factors”. A discussion of
migratory birds of conservation concern in the Travel Plan Area and an assessment as to the
potential effects of Travel Plan alternatives on these species is included in the “Affected
Environment” and “Environmental Consequences” sections of this report.

Table 81, on the following pages, summarizes the assumptions, methodologies and basic

information used in the analysis of different alternatives [40 CFR 1502.15]. More detailed
information as to the construction and application of habitat models for threatened,
endangered and sensitive species and for management indicator species (including elk) is
included in the Project File. More complete discussion of the resource issues introduced here
comes in following sections.

ASSUMPTIONS AND INFORMATION USED

METHODOLOGIES AND SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY

Information on wildlife and wildlife habitat in the Divide
Travel Plan Area has been extracted from 20 years of field
survey work throughout the Divide landscape (1992-2012).
Some of this information is summarized in the Divide
Landscape Analysis (HNF 1996) and in environmental
analyses conducted for a variety of projects across the
landscape since 1992 [HRD/ HNF files]. I have also employed
recent modeling and mapwork by HNF GIS specialists.
This section focuses on direct effects of roads on forest and
grassland/shrubland habitat (habitat loss, fragmentation,
edge effects). Effects on riparian and wetland sites are
addressed in the section on “Riparian Habitat”. Edge effects
are described for roads but not for trails. This derives from
the observation that most trails on the HNF are narrow
tracks that produce little, if any measurable edge. That is,
trails in forest habitat run under the canopy rather than
scouring out a contrasting corridor through the surrounding
habitat. As a result, edge effects associated with these
narrow travelways are assumed to be negligible.
Information used to model old-growth is described in the
documentation file created by HNF GIS specialists [Project
File]. Modeling is based on sampling for the timber stand
data layer (part of the Master Vegetation Layer). Effects
generated by roads in old growth forest are assumed to be
similar to those that occur in forested habitat in general.
Information used to assess effects on riparian habitat is
based on data summarized in the Fisheries and Watershed
Specialist Report and analyses conducted by HNF GIS
specialists. We assume that these assessments are sufficient
to indicate effects on these focal habitat sites that are
important not only to species of special concern (such as
western toads) but to a wide variety of wildlife.
The size and distribution of habitat patches away from the

Because wildlife species composition in any given area is
primarily a product of available habitats, most wildlife is
discussed at the “coarse filter” scale. That is, we assume that
broad groups of similar vegetation will support similar arrays of
wildlife species and levels of biodiversity (absent specific
limitingfactors generated by human interference or natural
factors). Likewise, we assume that roads in each of these broad
vegetation types will affect associated wildlife communities in
similar ways. In some cases, individual species and their specific
habitat needs are discussed, especially in the case of uncommon
species dependent on particular habitat components for which
data is available. This is a “fine filter” approach. Effects on
general habitat are discussed in terms of habitat loss,
fragmentation and edge effects.

WILDLIFE - 255

Direct effects of roads are discussed briefly with regard to
fragmentation, habitat loss (particularly with regard to snags)
and edge effects. These data are not quantified.

Methodologies for assessing effects of motorized use within the
300 foot riparian zone (Riparian habitat conservation Areas) are
described in the Fisheries and Watershed reports. This analysis
reports miles of open road expected in these riparian areas
under different alternatives.

influence of open roads is used as a general indicator for
comparing differences among alternatives. I made use of
previous modeling efforts for portions of the Divide
landscape (Walker and Craighead 1997; Olimb and
Williamson 2006) to assess the general status of habitat
connectivity in the Travel Plan Area and then looked at
changes in non-motorized patch size in specific areas where
alternatives differed from one another to come up with a
relative indicator. I assume that the fewer and larger the
unroaded patches, the better the connectivity (the less the
fragmentation). Better connectivity may be partially a
function of lower road density alone, but primarily it reflects
patterns of open road dispersion (regardless of density) that
allow ample blocks of wildlife habitat to function free from
road influences.

connectivity among alternatives are from (1) a model developed
by Walker and Craighead (1997) and expanded upon by Olimb
and Williamson (2006) and (2) the FS Region-1 Connectivity
Protocol. The 2 habitat models focus on the needs of animals
needing the largest corridors (grizzly bears, mountain lions, elk)
and employ habitat suitability, habitat complexity and
weighted road density as key parameters. The Region-1 Protocol
calculates the size and distribution of unroaded patches at least
½ mile from open roads, since research on several species
(including elk and grizzly bears) indicates that ½ mile provides an
adequate buffer.
This assessment focuses on size and distribution of areas free
from vehicle use. All unroaded and non-motorized patches
larger than 1,500 acres are tallied and changes between
alternatives calculated. This gives a general sense of relative
differences between alternatives and of the potential
effectiveness of the Continental Divide “linkage zone” or
“corridor” for larger wildland species. Effectiveness of the
linkage varies by species depending on their habitat needs,
behavioral traits and reaction to humans. Lynx and marten, for
example, prefer continuously forested environment, while
grizzly bears and elk are best served by a mosaic of forest and
non-forest.
Since no new roads will be constructed under any alternative, I
assume no direct effects from habitat loss. The methodology
used to analyze indirect effects on snags and logs is described in
“Analysis Methodology for Effects of Roads on Snags and Logs”
in Appendix A. Indirect effects on snags and logs related to
“edge” created by road prisms remaining on the landscape are
described in the General Habitat section.

Snags and Woody
Debris

Primary information sources and assumptions are
summarized in Bate and Wisdom (2002a, 2002b) and Hillis et
al. (2003). Additional information and assumptions are
described in the text files and analyses run by HNF GIS
specialists [project file]. In analyzing woody debris, I assume
that effects are qualitatively similar for all 3 alternatives since
the 300-ft rule for off-road camping applies in each case and
opportunities for firewood cutting are similar.

scenario. These effects are also analyzed under “Riparian
Habitat” and “Snags and Woody Debris”. Analyses by HNF
GIS specialists yielded road miles. Effects apply to all open
motorized routes regardless of habitat type. Effects on
riparian habitat are analyzed by Riparian Habitat
Conservation Areas (RHCA) which are buffers along stream
corridor areas that vary from 150 to 300 feet wide on either
side of streams.
Elk herd units (EHUs) were delineated by Helena National
Forest (HNF) and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP)
biologists in 2003 and modified in 2007 and 2011. Herd units
extend 1.5 mi beyond HNF boundaries, which we assume
accounts for the area used by most elk that regularly move
on and off the Forest in winter. Assessment of the impacts
of roads on elk are based on the road attribute layers for
each alternative.
With the exception of one herd unit(Greenhorn EHU),
Summer range is assumed to be synonymous with the entire
herd unit (though this is often an overestimation). Hiding
cover, which underlies the Forest Plan standard for elk
summer range quality, is based on modeling by HNF GIS
analysts (USFS 2009). We use the MT Fish, Wildlife and Parks
definition of hiding cover, which assumes that forest crown
closure of 40% or more is an indicator of hiding cover.
To delineate Forest Plan winter range, I used maps
developed for the HNF Oil and Gas Leasing EIS (1995). I
chose this delineation after comparing plots of several
thousand winter elk locations (from MFWP aerial surveys and
radio-telemetry) to 3 available winter range maps, ”Forest
Plan” (1981-86),“Oil and Gas” (1995) and MFWP (19992010). The “Oil and Gas” map covered 96% of winter elk
locations within herd units. I used the more broadly defined
MFWP winter ranges when discussing elk habitat use and
movement patterns beyond the HNF.

year is included as an open route. This does not include
snowmobile activity.

WILDLIFE - 257

Methodologies used to determine direct and indirect effects on
elk include the following:
Summer Habitat Effectiveness (Christensen et al. 1993) is based
on open road density within each elk herd unit (including
private roads) between May 16 and Sept. 30. Road locations and
vehicle use patterns have been verified on the ground to the
extent possible.
Modeling of hiding cover (for Forest Plan compliance) provides a
reasonably accurate estimate of percent cover over broad areas,
but it is not useful for drawing local, site-specific conclusions as
to elk habitat use. Crown closure, estimated from satellite
imagery, served as a surogate for measuring hiding cover
directly on the ground (as per HFP, p. II/18).
Effects of travel management on winter range are based on
open road and snowmobile trail patterns on “HNF Oil and Gas
EIS winter range” within HNF boundaries and on “MFWP winter
range” in the 1.5 mile herd unit extension beyond those
boundaries. Assessment of snowmobile use comes from the
most recent Forest snowmobile trail maps and verification from
discussion with local snowmobile groups that regularly use the
trail system.
Elk vulnerability during the hunting season is based on the
percentage of fall home range occupied by effective elk security
areas. Security areas are delineated via methodology developed
by Hillis et al. (1991) and modified for “eastside” environments.
Security areas are blocks of predominantly forested country at

A Forest Plan amendment associated with this project
substitutes elk security areas for the current hiding

measure of elk security in the fall. Field research suggests
that the security area methodology is the more accurate and
sensitive of the two measures. Information on elk
populations and seasonal distribution is based primarily on
annual survey work by MFWP (including aerial cenuses and
check-station data), but also from past MFWP radio
telemetry studies.

least 1,000 acres in size with boundaries ≥ ½ mi from routes
open to motor vehicles during the big hunting season
(September 1 – December 1). Security area boundaries are also
pulled back ½ mile from private land holdings with road access.
Security is calculated for the portion of an elk herd unit within
HNF administrative boundaries. The goal is for 50% of each herd
unit to be maintained as elk security areas. Herd units below
50% security are considered to be in compliance with the Forest
Plan security standard as long as % security does not decline (as
a result of management activity). The assumption is that
security is adequate as long as MFWP population objectives for
elk are being met in local hunting districts, or in those portions
of the distict subject to influence by the herd unit. Smaller nonmotorized areas (250-999 acres) recognized as security areas in

Canada Lynx

The Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD)
(USFS 2007b) provides the background information,
standards, guidelines and general management underpinning
for dealing with lynx. While this direction addresses all
National Forest lands in the northern Rockies, I assume that
our local survey work and habitat modeling are sufficient to
allow us to tweak aspects of it to provide a better fit for the
Divide landscape. Potential lynx habitat and suitable
snowshoe hare habitat have been modeled by HNF GIS
personnel using a combination of data from the timber stand
management record system (TSMRS) (field-based stand data)
and V-Map satellite imagery (USFS 2009). Road and
snowmobile use are derived from GIS processes that tally
miles of these routes in suitable lynx habitat in LAUs

WILDLIFE - 258

Area-wide distribution of potential lynx and snowshoe hare
habitat has been modeled and mapped by HNF GIS personnel,
using criterea from the NRLMD. Field-based information for
validating habitat modeling efforts has come from a variety of
sources, including general wildlife surveys that have made note
of habitat components useful to lynx throughout the landscape
since the 1990s, lynx denning and foraging habitat surveys in
the Tenmile drainage in 2003 and on-going Forestwide field
surveys of potential snowshoe hare habitat conducted according
to Regional protocols. The relative effects of snowmobiles are
inferred from the miles of snowmobile trail in lynx habitat in
different alternatives.

I assume, based on NRLMD guidance, that the effects of open
roads and snowmobile routes in lynx habitat are imposed
more by the access they provide competing carnivores and
trappers than by the general presence of humans on these
routes. Much of the background information for interpreting
results of field surveys and modeled habitat data has come
from the Lynx Science Report (USFS 1999), the Lynx
Conservation Assessment and Strategy (Ruediger et al. 2000),
The Scientific Basis for Conserving Forest Carnivores (USFS
1994) and recent fieldwork conducted in western Montana
by several research workers.
Basic guidance for grizzly bear management comes from the
Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan (1993) and the Interagency Grizzly
Bear Committee (IGBC) Guidelines (1986) and the Grizzly Bear
Management Plan for Western Montana (MFWP 2006).
Application of this direction is modified by ongoing research,
the slow expansion of occupied grizzly range southward
across the HNF and the development of updated
management documents.
The entire Travel Plan Area lies within the Grizzly Bear
“Distribution Zone”, the area south of Northern Continental
Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone in
which grizzlies are known to be present. The original
Distribution Zone designated in 2005 was based on the
pattern of grizzly sightings to that point and was limited to
the area north of Mullan Pass. In 2013, however, based on
field observation accumulated from a variety of sources, the
Distribution Zone was expanded to cover the rest of the
landscape down to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF boundary.
Grizzly bear numbers throughout the landscape are assumed
to be very low and as a result, environmental assessments in
recent years have applied management guidelines for IGBC
Management Situation #5, which I assume is appropriate in

the MacDonald Pass area and parts of the Little Blackfoot and
Tenmile drainages (Gehman et al. 2007-2010). DNA from hair
and scat samples have been analyzed by the USFS Rocky Mtn
Research Station (Missoula) to identify species and individuals
(Pilgrim 2007-2010). We have made use also of track survey
transects run regularly by MFWP along the Divide for several
years, as well as fortuitous observations by a number of
individuals.

No specific methodologies were used other than estimates, for
each alternative, of (1) open road densities and of (2) large nonmotorized habitat patches (>2,500 ac) more than 0.3 mi from
open roads. These patterns are shown separately for the
original Distribution Zone north of Mullan Pass and the newly
expanded Zone south of there. .
Information on distribution of grizzly bears and suitable habitat
components across the Divide landscape has been derived from
wildlife surveys by HNF biologists since the early 1990s, data
from MFWP and observations by field-going personnel and
Forest-users. Observations of bears have been ranked as to
credibilty and the information applied accordingly. Criteria
outlined in the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan and the IGBC
Guidelines were served as the basis for analysis. We do not
have enough systematic observations by trained personnel to
allow us to estimate population numbers for the Divide
landscape or to determine if individuals are resident or
transient.

Sensitive Species
Northern Rocky
Mountain Gray Wolf

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and MFWP biologists
have provided information on the status of wolves in the
Divide landscape regularly since the early 1990s. Much of
this data has been documented in Montana Wolf Program
Weekly Reports and Rocky Mtn Wolf Recovery Annual
Reports (USFWS, MFWP 1995-2011). Other information has
come from field observations by HNF biologists, HNF field
crews, local residents and other Forest users. More recently,
we have garnered data from tracking surveys by Wild Things
Unlimited (Bozeman, MT). Because of the small number of
wolves in the Divide landscape at any one time, their
relatively high profile and the intense scrutiny given them by
monitoring agencies, I assume that we have a more complete
picture of local wolf populations than of any other wildlife
group in the landscape.

Wolverine

Information and assumptions used to analyze effects on
wolverine are documented in Hillis and Kennedy (2003) and
center around natal denning habitat. Since wolverines are
most vulnerable to disturbance at these sites in late winter
and early spring, I assume that the primary source of human
disturbance will come from snowmobiles.
Wolverines are often associated with large blocks of
unroaded country with minimal human presence and I
assume that these habitat zones are important to wolverine
population viability. Assessment of unroaded habitat has
employed information from elk security area analysis, grizzly
bear habitat analysis and corridor/linkage zone analysis,
each of which measures the size and arrangement of
unroaded habitat blocks in a different way. The rationale for

WILDLIFE - 260

The HNF used no specific methodology, only general field
surveys. Wild Things Unlimited has located wolves using specific
tracking and sample gathering protocols, although their efforts
are focused on forest carnivores rather than wolves.
Information on the whereabouts of wolves, wolf dens and
rendezvous sites has come mostly from fieldwork by the USFWS
and more recently, by MFWP. These efforts have included aerial
and ground-based radio telemetry. In determining effects, we
made use of local information from USFWS, MFWP and research
as identified in “References Cited”. Constant monitoring of the
small local wolf population (by MFWP) results in periodic
population estimates that are precise and accurate. Statewide
wolf counts, however, tend to underestimate the total
population, given its size and distribution: Recent Gray Wolf
Annual Reports by MFWP (2010-2012) discuss methodologies
employed to get at the actual size and configuration of the wolf
population.
Impacts to wolverine natal denning habitat typically come from
snowmobile activity (Hillis and Kennedy 2003). As the current
Regional habitat model has not identified any wolverine denning
habitat in the Divide landscape, I’ve approached this parameter
qualitatively. Fieldwork suggested areas that might provide
viable denning sites and the potential for snowmobile presence
was then inferred from Travel Plan alternative maps and the
Helena RD Snowmobile Trail map (2003). The most robust field
data on wolverines in the landscape comes from winter tracking
surveys by Wild Things Unlimited coupled with DNA analysis by
the USFS Rocky Mtn Research Station. Other field observations
come from MFWP biologists, HNF field workers, local residents,
recreationists and trappers. Since the needs of wolverines with
regard to unroaded habitat are murky, such habitat blocks were

and parameters associated with these analyses are provided
in the appropriate sections that follow.
Rigorous fieldwork by Wild Things Unlimited has revealed the
presence of 2 resident wolverines, but the data is insufficient
to estimate population size.
Analysis of the fisher is based primarily on literature review.
Habitat has been modeled by the HNF GIS shop (USFS 2009)
and intermittantly field-checked during general wildlife
surveys. Observations of fishers in this landscape have been
so rare that little is known of their local distribution,
numbers, or status as residents/transients. Although we
have been able to identify potential pockets of suitable
habitat, we have been unable to make useful estimates of
local population size. Since research indicates that fishers do
not shy away from Forest roads, I assume that road impacts
are indirect, from access provided to trappers and to
firewood cutters who remove large snags of use to fishers.
I assume that impacts of travel management on black-backed
woodpeckers are indirect, related to firewood cutting and
roadside hazard tree removal. Data used to analyze effects
on habitat are derived from Hillis et al. (2002): U.S. Forest
Service Region One Black-Backed Woodpecker Assessment.
Other information and assumptions are described in Blackbacked Woodpecker Habitat Modeling Process and in the text
files and analyses run by the HNF GIS shop.
With few recent fires in the Divide landscape, no blackbacked woodpecker surveys have been conducted. I assume,
however, that the woodpeckers are present in very low
numbers, in pockets of old-growth, in small local burns (such
as MacDonald Pass) and here and there in the extensive
array of beetle-killed pine trees across the landscape. I also
assume that in spite of the massive beetle-kill, black-backed
woodpecker numbers will only escalate if parts of the
landscape burn in the future.

linkage zone analyses) and results compared among
alternatives. The result, while imprecise, provides a basis for
relative comparison.

WILDLIFE - 261

The only methodology employed was to compute open road
miles in modeled fisher habitat (via GIS) and then calculate
acres within the 600 ft wide road corridor from which firewood
cutters could remove large snags and logs potentially useful to
fishers. The results are useful primarily as a relative measure to
compare alternatives. Systematic winter tracking surveys (Wild
Things Unlimited, 2006-2012) have regularly detected lynx and
wolverines in the central part of the Divide landscape, but have
found no sign of fishers. Likewise, a grid of hair-snag survey
stations in 2008 detected no fishers in the landscape. Reports of
fishers in this area have been fortuitous and rare and have not
been sufficient to allow an estimation of population numbers.
Effects of travel management on dead and dying trees in road
corridors have implications for black-backed woodpeckers, low
though their numbers may be. The methodology used to
determine these effects is described in the section on Snags and
Woody Debris.
While the survey and analysis methods used to characterize the
dead tree resource in well-defined, accessible road corridors
have generated estimates with a high degree of precision and
accuracy, the ongoing bark-beetle outbreak has produced a
moving target in terms of snag density and dispersion at any
given time. We can say, however, that numbers of large dead
trees are increasing significantly thoughout Divide road corridors
and the Travel Plan area as a whole.
No field surveys targeting black-backed woodpeckers have been
conducted in the Divide landscape, but they have been reported
in the MacDonald Pass burn (from 2009).

Information as to distribution, relative population density
and habitat use by pileated woodpeckers in the Divide

fortuitous observations since 1992 [HNF wildlife files]. Based

occur in non-old-growth habitats in this landscape, focusing
on large trees as key habitat components.

The key components needed to characterize pileated
woodpecker habitat in the Divide landscape are large dead and
dying trees (generally >24 inches dbh). The methodology for
determining effects of travel management on snags is described
above in the “Snags and Woody Debris” section.
Given the high mortality of mature pine trees in the current bark
beetle epidemic, all stands of large trees in general (esp.
ponderosa pine) are of interest since (1) all large pine are now
at risk of mortality in the short term and (2) pileated
woodpeckers are capable of foraging and excavating cavities in
live trees if needed. As a result, HNF habitat models of pileated
woodpecker habitat, which focus on stands with large mature
and old-growth trees, now probably reflect more accurately the
suitability of these sites to support the woodpeckers than they
have in the past. A tally of open road miles (and associated road
corridor acreage) in pileated woodpecker habitat serves to
indicate the relative impact of potential firewood cutting under
different alternatives.
Goshawks have been monitored throughout the Divide
landscape since 1992. In recent years, protocols developed by
Region 1 and adapted by the HNF have been applied. In 2005,
large grids were sampled across the HNF as part of a Regional

addition to these standard sampling programs, most reported

(Snag Indicator)

Divide Travel Plan

ASSUMPTIONS AND INFORMATION USED

METHODOLOGIES AND SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY

Divide landscape and data on goshawk habitat and home
range size in Reynolds et al. (1992) [as well as in other
research (see references)], we assume that goshawks will
occupy, over the course of a decade, all habitats dominated
by mature green forest in the landscape, spaced out so as to
allow home range size of roughly 4,000-7,000 acres (based
on local field observation). An additional assumption
underlying this assessment is that the existing Forest road
system has relatively little direct effect on goshawks and that
changes proposed under action alternatives have little
impact on the ability of goshawks to effectively occupy the
landscape. I assume that high mortality in mature pine
forests from ongoing bark beetle infestation will cause
significant shifts in distribution of goshawk nesting sites in
the near future.
Hairy woodpecker habitat modeling is based on Region-1
protocols. A summary of how these protocols were applied
to HNF habitats can be found “Criteria for Wildlife Models
HNF” (USFS 2009). See also “Snags and Woody Debris”,
above.
Information as to distribution, population density and habitat
use by hairy woodpeckers in the Divide landscape comes
from wildlfe field surveys and fortuitous observations since
1992 [HNF wildlife files]. Northern Region Landbird Surveys
have also provided data.
Based on this information, I assume that hairy woodpeckers
are very versatile as to the kinds of habitats they use and
that the Region-1 model, while delineating optimal
habitat,substantially underestimates total suitable habitat.
So, I have presented results both for (1) R-1 modeled habitat
(which is based, at least in part, on Hutto 1995) and for (2) an
expanded complex of mature forest habitat regardless of
stand density and evidence of dead trees. I base this latter
delineation on the assumption that all mature forest stands

designed to locate active nests. Nest sites are then mapped and
monitored. Once clusters of nests indicating the centers of
goshawk home ranges have been identified, it is possible to
identify additional potential goshawk ranges throughout the
landscape and survey in those areas. Field monitoring is
continuing, in particular, to document changes in goshawk home
range use patterns resulting from the mountain pine beetle
epidemic.
A tally of open road miles in goshawk nesting and foraging
habitat (and associated road corridor acreage) provides as a
mechanism for comparing potential indirect effects of snag
removal by firewood cutters under different alternatives.
Potential disturbance of existing nest stands from opening up of
currently closed roads under some alternatives provides an
additional means of comparison.
Given the high mortality of mature pine trees in the current bark
beetle epidemic, all mature stands with a ponderosa or
lodgepole pine component now support significantly more snags
than when HNF habitat models were last run. These
developments, combined with a habitat model that presents a
relatively narrow definition of hairy woodpecker habitat (which I
refer to as “optimal” nesting habitat), result in an underestimate
of habitat useful to these birds in the Travel Plan Area.
The key components that characterize optimal nesting habitat
are snag-rich mature forest stands (overstory trees >10 inches
dbh) of sparse-to-intermediate density (<50% canopy closure).
In the Divide landscape, this results in the delineation of
considerably less habitat than hairy woodpeckers have been
observed to use. So, I have also looked at mature forest habitat
in general as a suitable environment for hairy woodpeckers
(though not all of it may be nesting habitat). This includes all
stands classified as mature forest (dbh >7 inches) regardless of
density or evidence of dead trees.

resulting from road-facilitated snag removal by firewood
cutters.
Marten habitat modeling is based on Region-1 protocols. A

Information on distribution and habitat use by marten in the
Divide landscape comes from general wildlfe field surveys,
reports from trappers and winter tracking surveys run for
many years by MFWP and more recently by Wild Things
Unlimited (Gehman et al. 2007-2012).
Additional information concerning marten habitat and
response to roads has come from a review of the literature
[see References]. Based on these sources, I assume that the
effects of travel management are indirect, resulting from (1)
access provided trappers on snowmobiles and (2) removal of

and HNF personnel (for safety purposes).

cutters and susceptible to snag removal by HNF roadside hazard
tree projects (the 600 ft corridor along open roads) is used to
compare relative effects of different alternatives.
Field surveys, while useful in indicating the habitat versatility
and relative abundance of hairy woodpeckers in the Divide
landscape, have not provided systematic enough data to
generate actual population estimates.
The key components needed to characterize marten habitat are
relatively dense mature forest habitat with a suitable supply of
medium to large dead trees and logs. In addition, marten are
much more likely to be found in subalpine fir, lodgepole pine,
Engelmann spruce and moist Douglas-fir forests than in dry
Ponderosa pine/ Douglas-fir stands.
The methodology for determining effects of travel management
on snags is described above in the “Snags and Woody Debris”
section.
As with the woodpeckers, the ongoing bark beetle outbreak
means that all mature stands with lodgepole pine component
now support significantly more snags than when HNF habitat
models were last run. In the short-term, these models of
potential marten habitat may now more accurately reflect the
suitability of these sites to support marten. Over the long long
term, their suitability is likely to vary depending on the degree of
remaining canopy closure and the vigor of forest regeneration.
A tally of open road miles in potential marten habitat (and
associated road corridor acreage) provides a mechanism for
comparing potential indirect effects of snag removal by
firewood cutters and routes available to trappers under
different alternatives.
Field surveys, while useful in indicating the presence and
distribution of marten in the Divide landscape, have not

The boundaries of local areas (for purposes of calculating road

features and the reach of the local road system at issue. In a

miles were measured with an engineers’ compass and areas
determinied via dot grid: No GIS technology was applied, but
the precision and accuracy of the more primitive methodology
employed here can be assumed to be in the same range as
standard GIS estimates for areas of this magnitude.
Aside from these measurements, the bulk of the assessment is
based on more qualitative information dealing with local wildlife
associations, habitat configurations and expected responses to
the proposed scanarios presented by different alternatives.

The Divide Travel Plan Area covers all but the southeastern corner (the Clancy-Unionville unit)
and the northern tip (Little Prickly Pear drainage) of the Divide landscape and encompasses a
wide range of wildlife habitats and wildlife species associations. Not all of these habitats and
species groups are affected by Forest travel management in ways that are measurable or
meaningful (in terms of individual species behavior, survivorship, or productivity). As a result,
not all of the wildlife parameters (species, habitats, habitat components) tallied in the following
table are analyzed and discussed in the body of the report that follows, though they may receive
some mention.
Parameters not carried forward in the report are those for which there are either no anticipated
impacts associated with alternatives or for which the impacts are addressed via analysis of a
surrogate species [the elk analysis, for example, provides a basis for inferring primary impacts
on white-tailed deer and moose]. As summarized in the previous section, the information
presented in this analysis comes from survey and observation in the field, accumulated
professional experience, discussion with other professionals and field-going personnel,
examination of scientific literature, GIS modeling analyses and conservation strategies and
recovery plans.

In 2013, the USFWS proposed the wolverine for listing
under the Endangered Species Act because of the loss
of natal denning habitat as a result of climate change.
By 2014, this risk was deemed to be not so immediate
as to require listing and so the wolverine has reverted
to “sensitive species” status. The focus of this analysis

Effects on marten are expected to be relatively minor

forest. Declining snowmobile access for trappers

Effects of disruption/displacement associated with
roads vary widely among species.
Effects of direct mortality associated with roads and
trails vary widely among species.

Wildlife Habitat in the Travel Plan Area
Habitats in the Divide landscape range from high alpine meadows and subalpine fir/whitebark
pine forests to low- and mid-elevation Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests interspersed with
dry grassland and shrubland. Cool moist forests comprise a majority of habitats, followed by
warm dry forests, grasslands/shrublands, riparian habitats and aspen (Divide Landscape Analysis
1996b).
This analysis looks at 3 major habitat categories that may be affected measurably by travel
management: (1) general wildlife habitat (primarily conifer forest and grassland/shrubland
habitat), (2) riparian/wetland habitat and (3) snags and woody debris. We refer to analysis at
this broad scale as “coarse filter” analysis. A coarse filter assessment focuses on maintaining a
diversity of habitats and habitat functions for a full range of species (USFS 1996c). Landscapewide habitat functions that are included in the coarse filter analysis are wildlife travel corridors,
linkage zones and habitat fragmentation.
Species-specific analyses are characterized as “fine filter” analyses and they focus on
maintaining habitat for particular species, in particular, threatened, endangered, sensitive and
Helena Forest Plan indicator species. Table 82 above lists those species addressed in a fine
filter format.

General Upland Wildlife Habitats
Forest Habitats
Forest habitat in the Travel Plan area can be divided into a variety of categories: (1) warm, dry
Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine at lower elevation; (2) mixed lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir forest,
mostly at mid elevation; (3) lodgepole pine forest at mid to high elevation; (4) moist subalpine
fir-dominated forest at high elevation; (5) Engelmann spruce-dominated forests, mostly in
drainage bottoms and across cool benches and basins; (6) forests with a notable whitebark pine
component at high elevation; and (7) aspen forest, both riparian and upland, over a wide
elevational range, usually in small fragmented stands. Mature closed-canopy stands in the 80120 year age range currently dominate the landscape. But, over the past 6-7 years a mountain
pine beetle infestation has been killing hundreds of thousands of mature lodgepole and
ponderosa pine trees (and lesser amounts of whitebark pine and limber pine), a process that is
transforming forest structure across the landscape.

Habitat for post-fire dependent wildlife remains limited in the Divide landscape. Until 2009,
only two stand-replacing fires in excess of 100 acres had occurred in recent decades: (1) the
Beartrap Gulch fire (1960s) in the upper Little Prickly Pear drainage and (2) the lower Sweeney
Creek fire (1950s) on the northeast side of that drainage. The Beartrap burn is located in
unroaded country below the Continental Divide and supports a rich array of early seral conifers
(mostly lodgepole pine), shrubs and ground vegetation and as a result, is an attractant for
wildlife species. In Sweeney Creek, the ponderosa pine seed source was eliminated and the
area now supports a mosaic of grass-shrub and aspen communities with little conifer
regeneration. Few snags remain in these burns. More recently, the MacDonald Pass fire burned
a 170-acre swath through the Walker Creek drainage in the early fall of 2009. It is the only burn
with an abundance of recent fire-killed snags in the Divide Travel Plan Area.
Other than these three areas, early-seral conifer habitats have been created mostly by timber
harvest, which has not produced the dead tree habitat that attracts many post-fire wildlife
species. Concentrations of winter-killed trees in the upper Snowshoe and Dog Creek drainages
in the late 1980s and around Jericho Mountain in the early 1990s produced some local habitat
opportunities for these species. But now, the mountain pine beetle outbreak has created
landscape-wide dead tree habitats in a variety of configurations, ranging from snags dispersed
through predominantly green canopy to broad swaths of almost entirely dead forest across
whole drainages.
For purposes of this discussion, I have condensed the variety of forest types listed above into
two primary categories: Cool moist forests and warm dry forests.

Cool Moist Forests
Cool, moist forests at middle and higher elevation are the predominant habitat formation across
the Divide landscape. These forests are most often dominated by lodgepole pine [Figure 6; see
also Figure 46, Figure 47, Figure 56, Figure 57]. Engelmann spruce occurs in riparian sites
[Figure 8], across cool basins and benches and on certain north and east slopes. Subalpine fir is
also present in these situations across much of the landscape at high elevation [see Figure 6,
Figure 8, Figure 58, Figure 59]. Whitebark pine is confined to high elevation sites, often
growing on dry, rocky substrates (making these stands a marginal fit as “moist” forests).
Whitebark is most common at the north and south ends of the landscape, along the Continental
Divide around Black Mountain in the north and Thunderbolt Mountain in the south. These pines
have been heavily impacted by the mountain pine beetle outbreak.
At middle elevations, Douglas-fir is a dominant presence on many “moist” sites, often in
combination with lodgepole pine. Douglas-fir stands are coming to represent the primary
mature forest component over much of the Divide landscape as lodgepole pine succumbs to
mountain pine beetle.
In some lodgepole pine stands, canopy trees are old and decadent and are being succeeded by
climax subalpine fir at higher elevation [Figure 6] and by Douglas-fir at mid-lower elevation.
But over much of the Travel Plan area, especially in the upper Little Blackfoot drainage south of
Highway 12 and along the Continental Divide in the northern reaches of the planning landscape,
lodgepole pine maintains relatively pure stands of 80 to 120 year old trees, a product of fires
and widespread logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The mountain pine beetle
infestation has opened up the canopy in many of these stands as mature trees die [Figure 18,
Figure 19, Figure 46, Figure 47]. This will eventually increase the vegetative and structural
diversity of the understory, which for the most part has been lacking in complexity. On the
WILDLIFE - 270

Environmental Impact Statement

other hand, once the dead trees have fallen, fuel loading in the understories of the new stands
will be substantially greater than that of preceeding stands. This will elevate the probability of
these stands being completely transformed by wildfire.

Figure 6 - Photo 1. Cool Moist Forests
Lodgepole pine forest with young subalpine fir/ Engelmann spruce and dense ground cover dominated by
grouse whortleberry in the understory. Lodgepole pine stands of this general age and density represent
the most widespread cool, moist forest formation in the Divide landscape. This particular stand sits atop
the Continental Divide southwest of Bison Mountain at about 7,500 ft elevation. Virtually all overstory
trees larger than five inches diameter-at-breast-height are now dead as a result of mountain pine beetle
infestation.

Warm Dry Forests
On the warmer, drier sites, mostly at middle and lower elevations, forests are dominated by a
mixture of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine. Absence of regular fire in these stands, abetted by
historic logging, has transformed many of these once mostly open grown mature stands into
dense, multi-storied forests no longer able to survive a fire of any intensity (Figure 7). In terms
of habitat for native herbivores, this represents a shift from a forest environment with minimal
horizontal cover and productive ground vegetation (forage) to one with decent hiding/screening
cover but scant understory forage. Under current conditions, the contribution of early seral
forest habitat to this part of the landscape is more meager than under historic conditions, most
young forests having been generated by timber harvest on both public and private land rather
than by fire. Seral species in these forests are Douglas-fir at middle and higher elevations and a
mixture of Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine at lower elevations, with some limber pine and
juniper.

Relatively dense ponderosa pine forest with Douglas-fir regenerating in the understory,
producing multi-storied stand structure. This density and layering would have been
uncharacteristic of the more open-grown, fire-maintained stands that historically occupied dry
sites such as this on the Mount Helena ridge in the southeast quadrant of the Divide landscape.

Old-Growth Forest
Old-growth forests are unique for their diversity and for the variety of niches that they offer.
While no local wildlife species are absolutely dependent on old-growth for their survival, a
number of them find optimal conditions in these old forest environments.
The Divide landscape supports two general types of structural old growth: (1) cool-moist types
(classic Pacific Northwest old-growth) and (2) warm-dry open-grown forest types.
Cool, moist structural old growth stands occur primarily at upper elevations, on north slopes and
in drainage bottoms. Most often, this type of old growth occurs in blocks or patches of limited
size. These patches, however, are usually surrounded by younger closed-canopied conifer
stands, which creates a wider interior forest condition. Cool, moist old growth habitats have
multi-layered canopies, abundant woody debris and varying age classes of snags. They support
varied understory vegetation and maintain light and climatic variables that offer a diversity of
wildlife niches (Franklin et al. 1981). Large snags, along with dead and down material, supply
food and nesting for cavity dependent birds as well as a variety of insects. The dark, mesic
environment is a microsite that provides for a variety of fungi and insects, which in turn become
food for small mammals and birds, adding to the species richness and diversity. Resident
species include pileated woodpeckers, brown creepers, hermit thrushes, northern goshawks,
western tanagers, hairy woodpeckers, white-breasted nuthatches, Stellar’s jays, spruce grouse,
red-backed voles, marten and northern flying squirrels, among others. Native ungulates use
these areas in summer for thermal cover to reduce heat stress. In winter these areas are

WILDLIFE - 272

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

important foraging and denning habitat for marten and also provide opportunities for
wolverine, fisher and lynx.
Historically, warm, dry old-growth was characterized by large open-grown Douglas-fir or
ponderosa pine stands with abundant grasses, forbs and small shrubs in the understory (Braun
et al. 1966). Large snags were scattered throughout, but logs, as well as young conifers, were
kept to a minimum by frequent ground fires (Knight 1989; Barret and Arno 1999). Species
favored by these habitats include flammulated owls, pygmy nuthatches, violet-green swallows,
mourning doves, western bluebirds, pine siskins, flickers, Cassins finches, Clarks nutcrackers, red
squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks and pocket gophers among others. Foraging
opportunities for deer and elk were excellent. A majority of these old-growth formations were
logged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and most of those that have survived are
now changed due to fire suppression, full of dense multi-layered understory, no longer capable
of surviving periodic fire and inhabited by a different array of wildlife.

Grassland and Shrubland
Natural grassland and shrubland occurs throughout the Divide landscape as diminutive openings
amidst mature forest, as small upland parks, as dry-mesic regions around central riparian sites,
as foothills extensions of open valley habitats and as expansive montane grassland covering
hundreds, sometimes thousands, of acres [see Figure 10, Figure 14, Figure 39, Figure 42,
Figure 43]. Altogether, they occupy about 10 percent of the landscape. Most are dominated
by grasses and herbaceous forbs. Shrubs cover a much smaller proportion of unforested
habitat, often in rough, rocky terrain or other sites with harsh substrate. Among larger upland
shrubs, big sagebrush is the most widespread and the most likely to occur in extensive stands.
Others, such as bitterbrush, chokecherry, mountain mahogany, juniper and rabbitbrush may be
locally common [see Figure 41, Figure 56, Figure 57].
The Divide Landscape Analysis (USFS 1996b) estimates that grassland and shrubland habitat has
been reduced by roughly 15 to 30 percent since the early 20th century. This is a function of fire
suppression that has allowed conifer forests to methodically colonize open habitat, eliminating
smaller openings, diminishing the size of larger parks and fragmenting many of them into an
array of smaller grassland patches. Ecotone edge is often deep and varied. This has reduced
habitat for grassland wildlife species and intensified competition between native herbivores and
domestic livestock that graze the National Forest allotments from late spring through early fall.

Riparian Habitats
Characteristics of Wetlands and Riparian Zones
Riparian and wetland habitats, while widely distributed across the Divide landscape, are usually
highly localized and occupy a relatively small share of the total landscape (less than three
percent). The presence of surface or near-surface water produces local microclimates that
differ from those of surrounding upland areas and allows for more productive and biologically
diverse habitats. Wetland and riparian areas host unique vegetation assemblages and may be
the only herbaceous communities in forested ecosystems or the only tree-dominated
community in grasslands. As a consequence, they provide habitat for a disproportionate
number of wildlife species (Thomas 1979).
A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either at the surface or in the root zone
and as a result, supports hydric soil and vegetation adapted to flooding (Mitsch and Gosselink
2007, p. 27-31). Wetlands in the Divide landscape vary widely in size and in the degree to which

WILDLIFE - 273

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

they support water through the season. They include marshes (with surface water), swamps
(forested wetlands), bogs (with sphagnum moss mats), wet meadows (subirrigated grasslands),
sedge meadows and seeps (wet areas around springs). These sites vary in size, but most are
localized and frequently isolated from other such habitats. Wetlands often lie within riparian
zones adjacent to open water, but some, such as wet meadows and springs, occur as
independent entities in upland landscapes and are referred to as isolated wetlands (Mitsch and
Gosselink 2007, p.26). As noted, wetlands are productive, ecologically diverse and support
characteristic vegetation that contrasts with that of surrounding areas. As a result, many
wildlife species are drawn to these sites.
A riparian zone is an area with distinctive soil and vegetation between a stream, pond, or other
body of open water and the adjacent upland. Most riparian zones include a certain amount
wetland habitat and in some cases, the entire zone is wetland. Many riparian zones, however,
are a mix of wetland vegetation (dominated by aquatic plants adapted to saturated soil) and
vegetation adapted to more mesic conditions (including trees and shrubs). Regardless of the
relative proportion of hydric and mesic substrate, riparian zones are typically more productive
and diverse than the adjacent upland habitat (Thomas 1979, p. 40-47). Wetland and riparian
habitats are essentially ecotones that occur at the interface of aquatic and truly terrestrial
ecosystems (Mitsch and Gosselink 2000).
In this report, the term “wetland” refers to the distinctive habitat associated with watersaturated soils; the term “riparian” refers to the ecotonal area adjacent to an open body of
water, regardless of whether or not wetland habitat is present (though it often is).

Riparian and Wetland Associated Wildlife
Wetland habitats and riparian zones provide more breeding habitat for birds than any other
kind of habitat association in North America (Kauffman et al. 2000). In the Rocky Mountain
region, they contain more vulnerable bird species than any other community type. Numerous
landbird species (ruffed grouse, willow flycatcher, yellow warbler, song sparrow) are tied to the
shrubs or deciduous trees associated with riparian environments (Hutto and Young 1999).
Studies of birds associated with riparian willow habitat conducted by the Northern Region
landbird monitoring program in 2001 found 13 bird species that were “riparian-dependent” and
10 others that were “riparian-associated” (Young et al. 2003). Riparian dependent species were
Wilson’s warbler, spotted sandpiper, fox sparrow, American redstart, willow flycatcher,
common yellowthroat, veery, cedar waxwing, northern waterthrush, common snipe, song
sparrow, yellow warbler and Lincoln’s sparrow. Riparian-associated species were MacGillivray’s
warbler, spotted towhee, gray catbird, red-winged blackbird, white-crowned sparrow, dusky
flycatcher, lazuli bunting, warbling vireo, red-naped sapsucker and black-headed grosbeak. The
study included four sites in the Divide Travel Plan Area and results for these areas reflected
those of the region as a whole.
Amphibians require riparian/wetland areas for part, if not all, of their life cycle. Because of
limited mobility, their survival is favored by areas with abundant wetland habitat, either in
extensive contiguous formations or as an array of smaller sites in close poximity, so as to allow
effective dispersal and migration to other unoccupied habitat. Amphibians resident in the
Divide landscape are spotted frogs, western toads and long-toed salamanders. Leopard frogs,
once common, are now probably extinct in this landscape.
Mammals are also drawn to wetland and riparian areas because of their productivity, vegetative
diversity, proximity to water and favorable microclimates, which combine to provide a varied

Environmental Impact Statement

and abundant forage supply. Some species, such as mink, beaver, muskrats and water voles, are
tightly tied to aquatic and wetland environments. Most wide-ranging mammals, such as deer,
elk, moose, foxes, bears and mountain lions, though they spend the bulk of their time in upland
habitats, are sooner or later drawn to wetland and riparian areas, for water, forage, prey, cover,
or thermal relief. These localized sites are thus focal habitats that concentrate mammalian
activity.
Recent wildlife field surveys indicate that with the demise of thousands of acres of mature pine
forest in the wake of the mountain pine beetle outbreak, a number of species that were
formerly widely distributed through those habitats are now concentrating to a greater degree in
forested wetland and riparian areas. Most of these sites support patches or strips of green
Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, Douglas-fir and aspen and in many cases, provide the only
viable mature forest environments in the area (Figure 8). Species that have been noted
concentrating in wetland/riparian forest to a greater degree than in the past include red
squirrels, red-breasted nuthatches, white-breasted nuthatches, mountain chickadees,
Townsend’s solitaires and ruby-crowned kinglets. Traditional wetland and riparian associated
species continue to occupy these habitats as well, although whether or not the new press of
upland species is affecting their abundances and behavior patterns is unknown.

Figure 8 - Photo 3: Riparian and Wetlands
A wet meadow near the Contiental Divide in the Tenmile Creek drainage. This is typical of
wetland formations near the headwaters of numerous drainages across the Divide landscape. In
late summer, the meadow continues to maintain water at and just below the surface, making for
a very wet and productive environment. Most of the mature lodgepole pine forest in and around
these sites is now dead from mountain pine beetle infestation, but the associated stands of
Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, as seen here, are now supporting concentrated wildlife
activity that was formerly spread throughout the upland lodgepole forest.

Human Influences
Riparian areas tend to attract a disproportionate amount of human activity, recreation, home
building, livestock grazing and roads. Partly as an aid to quantifying human impact on riparian
zones, streamside riparian habitats have been designated as riparian habitat conservation areas,
corridors that vary from 150 to 300 feet on either side of the stream channel.
Currently, 83 miles of open road and motor trails pass through riparian habitat conservation
areas in the Divide Travel Plan area, in addition to numerous routes (motorized and nonmotorized) crossing wet soil types not directly associated with streams. Helena National Forest
fisheries biologists and hydrologists have classified roads and motor trails within riparian habitat
conservation areas as “high risk roads”. This includes the 83 miles open to motorized use and
another 10 miles of closed roadway that continue to deposit sediment in the streams. They
consider the zone of influence of these routes to extend out 300 feet on either side along fishbearing streams and 200 feet along non-fish-bearing streams [see the fisheries and hydrology
specialist reports ].
Since the 19th century, human enterprises, including roads, have substantially reduced the
effective size of riparian habitats. Elimination of much of the beaver population, initially a
consequence of the 19th century fur trade and since then, a means of providing dry ground for
livestock grazing, agriculture, settlement and roadways, has been a major contributing factor.
Channelization of streams, diversion of water for irrigation and draining of wetlands are other
means by which riparian habitats have been modified to serve these ends. Roads in riparian
zones influence the quality of wildlife habitat by slowly pushing sediment into local water
bodies. While some roads actually cross stream channels (Figure 9), most generate
sedimentation merely by running nearby in the riparian habitat conservation areas. Vehicle
traffic and other human activity associated with roads also serves to interfere with normal
wildlife activity in these key habitats.

Areas in the Telegraph Creek drainage in the southern half of the Travel Plan Area. The road not
only increases the sediment load in the stream, but also leads to periodic disturbance of wildlife
species that are resident in or are drawn to this productive and complex habitat zone.

Connectivity and Fragmentation
Connectivity Basics
Connectivity, as coined in 1984 by G. Merriam (cited in USFS 1997), refers both to the
abundance and spatial patterning of habitat and to the ability of animals to move from patch to
patch of similar habitat. Corridors are a means by which connectivity is provided and are
defined as strips or stepping stones of “hospitable territory traversing inhospitable territory
providing access from one area to another” (Dendy 1987 as cited in USFS 1997). Broad corridors
with potential to provide for species welfare over longer periods of time are sometimes referred
to as linkage zones [see the following section].
Some corridors, particularly local connections between forest or riparian patches, can be readily
recognized by their vegetation structure and composition, which contrasts with the dominant
surrounding environment (Harris 1984, pp. 141-144). Most corridors, however, are not obvious,
well-defined features of the landscape that can be precisely defined by topography or
vegetation. Rather, they can only be defined by following the movements of animals that make
use of them over time and their effectiveness varies for different species (Servheen 2006). The
combination of habitat parameters that makes a corridor suitable for an elk will be different for
a lynx and different still for a mink. Most animals need a certain degree of habitat connectivity,
at one scale or another, to forage within a home range, for dispersal to new home ranges and
for migration between locations.

WILDLIFE - 277

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Fragmentation is the converse of connectivity. Fragmentation occurs when a habitat, be it
riparian, forest, or grassland, becomes partitioned into smaller patches either by natural means
(such as conifer colonization in grasslands or fire in forests) or by human enterprises (such as
logging, settlement or road building). Corridors are particularly susceptible to fragmentation
because of their relatively narrow, linear configurations.
The Northern Region Connectivity Protocol (USFS 1997) provides a framework for describing
corridors and the effects of Forest projects and other human activities. Of the five types of
corridors outlined in the Protocol, four apply to the Divide Travel Plan Area: season migration
corridors, dispersal/emigration corridors, travel corridors and invasive corridors.
Season migration or cyclic corridors may be transcontinental in scope or they may lie entirely
within local home ranges. Transcontinental/continental migrations are relevant to the Divide
landscape in that well-defined seasonal flyways used by waterfowl and raptors pass over the
area. Locally, the most obvious examples of seasonal migrations are spring and fall movements
by native ungulates between winter and summer ranges, inevitably along relatively well-defined
routes. Historically, these routes were dictated by topography, snow conditions and the
availability of resources (particularly, forage, water and cover). Over the past 150 years, these
routes have shifted in response to human development: In part, they follow the old
resource/topography-driven routes but divert as necessary to avoid roads and other centers of
human activity and to take advantage of cover.
Travel corridors are local routes along which individual animals or groups of animals move
within home ranges between foraging habitat, cover, breeding sites and so on. As with seasonal
migration, these routes may shift in response to human enterprises and for any particular
species, they may be difficult to define in terms of features on the landscape, their delineation
requiring long-term field observation.
Dispersal and emigration corridors promote movement into unoccupied habitats. Dispersal
behavior is most common when population density becomes too high for habitat within a given
area to continue to support the population, resulting in natural colonization of suitable but
unoccupied or lightly occupied habitat elsewhere. This has been occurring locally with the
gradual influx of wolves and grizzly bears into and through the Divide landscape from growing
populations to the north.
As with seasonal migration corridors, invasive corridors may be continental (Eastern blue jays
moving across the Great Plains via wooded river corridors) or local (cowbirds following cattle
trailing up onto the National Forest). These corridors may serve to sabotage biodiversity in
local ecosystems with inadequate resistance to invaders. This is particularly true in the case of
exotic weeds such as knapweed, leafy spurge and Dalmatian toadflax.

Regional Connectivity through the Divide Landscape
The Divide Travel Plan Area is part of what has been characterized as the Continental Divide
linkage zone. A linkage zone is a region of habitat in which dispersing animals (grizzly bears,
wolves, wolverines, moose, elk) can live as they slowly make their way between larger blocks of
more suitable habitat [see USFS 1997 (Region 1 Connectivity Protocol); also, Servheen et al.
2003].
The area along the Divide has also been called a “dispersal corridor” or a “travel corridor”. But,
as Servheen and others (2003) point out, the term “corridor” implies a linear strip of habitat
defined by physical features or use patternsthat is used just for travel. In the Divide landscape,

WILDLIFE - 278

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

the movement zone encompasses the entire breadth of National Forest lands centered on the
Continental Divide (and for some animals, includes blocks of adjacent non-Forest land). While
the linkage zone is up to 25 miles wide across the Helena Ranger District, most dispersing
species tend to concentrate in areas of productive habitat such as the array of drainage-head
basins near the Divide or some of the primary drainage bottoms.
Prior to development by settlers from the East, areas surrounding the Divide landscape provided
more of a linkage zone for many animals than the mountains themselves. As indicated in the
Journals of Lewis and Clark and documented archeologically (Knight 1989), numerous bison, elk,
deer and pronghorns, accompanied by the large carnivores that preyed upon them, regularly
moved through the valleys of the Missouri and Clark Fork Rivers and their tributaries. Today,
options for movement in the valleys have been significantly reduced and often eliminated, by
human development. This has placed an emphasis on National Forest lands along the Divide
mountain ranges to provide connectivity. Although some animals need specific habitat
formations while dispersing (fishers require mature forest, for example), most species of
concern are attracted to the Helena NF region of the Continental Divide simply because it
contains less human development than the foothills and valley environments on either side.
The Divide has some limitations in its ability to provide connectivity. The landscape, while
dominated by mature forest, is interrupted by large openings, natural and human-created
[Figure 10 and Figure 11]. This pattern is favorable for some species, unfavorable for others.
In addition, riparian areas that historically served as primary movement corridors have been
disrupted since the 19th century by mining, settlement, water diversion, logging, grazing and
roading. Roads continue to be a potentially disruptive (if not a truly “fragmenting”) influence:
Aside from Highway 12 [Figure 16] and some sections of County roads [Figure 17], which may
serve as real barriers to some species because of their width and traffic volume, roads in the
Travel Plan Area are troublesome primarily because of the way they funnel human activity into
the heart of the Divide linkage zone. But, they seldom block movement [seeFigure 11, Figure
13, Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 39, Figure 41, Figure 42 ,Figure 43, Figure 44, Figure 47,
Figure 48, Figure 57, Figure 59, Figure 60].

Greenhorn Mountain (center of photo) astride the Continental Divide in the northern half of the
Plan Area. The mosaic of forest and grassland seen here is characteristic of many parts of the
Divide linkage zone, especially the area north of U.S. Highway 12. Greenhorn Mountain itself is
unroaded, but the surrounding area has a weighted open road density of around 1.8 mi/mi².

Be that as it may, Walker and Craighead (1997) concluded that the Big Belt Mountain Range to
the northeast, in spite of a number of geographic and human-generated problems, was the
more viable dispersal route for large wildland animals (elk, mountain lions, grizzly bears) moving
southward through this part of Montana, primarily because of high road density in the Divide
landscape (both on the Helena NF and adjacent non-Forest lands). Total road density in the
Divide landscape averages 2.07 mi/mi²; open road density is 1.69 mi/mi²; weighted open road
density (calculating arterial and collector routes at 100 percent of length; local roads at 25
percent of length) is 0.90 mi/mi². Compare this with weighted open road densities in the Big
Belt Range which are generally on the order of 0.2 to 0.5 mi/mi².
Characteristics favorable for corridor/linkage zone function for most species (especially the large
carnivores and ungulates) include low open road density, low concentrations of human
occupancy (as represented by occupied buildings, developed recreation facilities, mining
operations), an abundance of productive foraging habitat, a robust mix of forested and nonforested habitats (abundant edge) and gentle-moderate terrain (Craighead et al. 2001; Walker
and Craighead 1997; Servheen et al. 2003; Olimb and Williamson 2006). These features are
distributed unevenly across this part of the National Forest, allowing for regional linkage that,
while not ideal, is functional.

Roads and clearcuts atop the Continental Divide west of Roundtop Mountain toward the north
end of the Travel Plan Area. Low-grade roads and large regenerating clearcuts, such as those
seen here, are common features of this part of the Continental Divide linkage zone. Nonetheless,
a number of uncommon, wide-ranging species (grizzly bears, wolves, wolverines) move through
the area each year. The roads, while not serving as barriers to movement, elevate the potential
for negative encounters with humans in the linkage zone.

So far, our understanding of how the Divide landscape functions as a linkage zone (connecting
the Northern Continental Divide and Greater Yellowstone ecosystems) is based mostly on
circumstantial and anecdotal evidence: (1) the area is strategically located between these two
large wildland ecosystems, (2) it contains suitable habitat and (3) a number of species
characteristic of the two wildland areas (wolves, grizzly bears, lynx, wolverines) have been
observed in the Divide landscape in between. This has been supplemented for some species
(primarily lynx and wolverines) by winter tracking surveys combined with DNA analysis of scat
and hair samples. More rigorous research, however, including long-term tracking of marked
animals, is needed to reveal more precisely how different species are moving through tea area
and how the landscape may be functioning as a linkage zone.

roads, dwellings, or other human developments.

In this assessment, the minimum non-motorized patch size of 1,500 acres (nearly 2½ mi²) puts
the focus on the availability of habitat blocks large enough to allow wildland species moving
through a linkage zone to carry on with normal activities relatively free from human
interference epitomized by motorized activity. Table 84 (following) summarizes the overall
status of these large habitat patches in summer and winter based on the acreages of individual
areas listed in Table 83.
On average, non-motorized habitat blocks are larger in the southern half of the Planning Area.
This is primarily a function of the 3 inventoried Roadless Areas south of Highway 12 (Lazyman
Gulch, Jericho Mountain and Electric Peak), which support regions of non-motorized habitat
ranging from 8,935 to 29,730 acres. Non-motorized patches are often smaller in winter, due to
the presence of some roads within the patches that, while closed yearlong to wheeled vehicles,
are open to snowmobile use during the winter.

The fact that a relatively large proportion of the Plan Area (63 percent in spring, summer and
fall; 56 percent in winter) is occupied by blocks of habitat ranging from 1,575 to 29,730 acres in
which wheeled motor vehicles and human presence in general, are usually not disruptive
factors, suggests that the Divide landscape may be more robust as a linkage zone than straight

lands is 0.84 mi/mi² [Table 85, Table 101]; unweighted road density is more than 2 mi/mi²,
which is quite high [Table 85]. Although previous modeling efforts have pointed to the Divide
landscape as a problem area (potentially a “bottleneck”) in north-south movement for large
wildland species (Walker and Craighead 1997), the fact remains that these species (wolves,
wolverines, grizzly bears, black bears, lynx, bobcats, mountain lions, elk, moose) continue to
move through and occupy this part of the landscape (albeit, sometimes in low numbers).
The problem with most Forest roads is not so much that they physically “fragment” wildlife
habitat in a way that blocks movement between habitat patches, but rather that they facilitate
human access throughout the landscape. Most roads are local dirt and gravel routes that carry
little vehicle traffic most of the year [Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15]. Exceptions are U.S.
Highway 12 through MacDonald Pass, the Rimini road (Powell County Road #495) along Tenmile
Creek, the Little Blackfoot River road (Forest Road #227), the Mullan Pass–Austin Creek road
(Forest Road #1805), the Sweeney Creek–Priest Pass road (Forest Road #335), the Orofino Gulch
road (Lewis & Clark County Road #454) and the Grizzly Gulch road (County Road #753) [see
Figure 17].

Such roads usually carry more vehicle traffic than the more primitive routes shown in the previous photos
and may prove more of a deterrent to some wildlife moving through the area. But, because human activity
is sporadic and infrequent, some species use the route as a travelway and cross it frequently.

Of the higher traffic roads passing through the Forest (most of them State and County routes),
U.S. Highway 12, which bisects the Plan Area through MacDonald Pass, is currently the only
wide, paved thoroughfare. With four lanes and often high volume of fast-moving traffic, it has
proven to be a real barrier to many animals in terms of their ability to get across alive. Bobcats,
lynx, wolves, badgers, foxes, coyotes, deer, elk, owls, hawks, grouse, rabbits, squirrels and
others have been struck and killed on the relatively narrow Helena NF portion of the highway in
the last decade.

Figure 16 - Photo 11: High Risk Wildlife Zone

U.S. Highway 12 just east of MacDonald Pass. Although the highway crosses National Forest
land for only about 4 miles (in the MacDonald Pass area), it serves as a high-risk zone for many
wildlife species moving between the northern and southern segments of the Divide landscape
across private and State land for about 20 miles. Numerous wildlife species, including lynx,
wolves, bobcats, deer, elk, goshawks and great horned owls, have been killed attempting to
cross the highway in this area.
The Orofino Gulch road (County Road #454) immediately south of Helena and just east of the
Travel Plan Area is also paved and while much narrower than Highway 12, does allow higher
speed and greater traffic volume than other Forest roads. In addition, an eight -mile segment of
the Rimini Road (County Road #695) along upper Tenmile Creek is slated for paving in the next
year or two. The new surface plus the designation of the road as a “Forest Byway” will
undoubtedly increase traffic speed and volume, making it a more precarious crossing for wildlife
of all sizes.
Currently, the Rimini road is one of five primary unpaved Forest roads in or adjacent to the Plan
Area. These routes (listed previously) are graded gravel roadways that allow speeds of 30 to 50
mph in many areas and support fairly regular traffic flow (though much less than Highway 12).
As such, they displace animals from the vicinity and interfere with movement, though they
seldom block it entirely.

the Forest are relatively narrow and winding, much of the route, as seen here, is broad, hardpacked, well-drained and supports a regular flow of traffic that sometimes moves at a brisk clip.
A thoroughfare such as this is problematic for many wildlife species, both because of its physical
structure and the level of human presence.

Table 85 shows current open road density in the Plan Area measured in four ways. Unweighted
open road density across all ownerships, public and private, is high and suggests that the Divide
landscape is an inhospitable environment for wildland species attempting to move through the
linkage zone. Density is substantially higher if closed roads are included (as has been done in
some past modeling efforts). Road densities on this order are a good part of the reason that
Walker and Craighead (1997) concluded that the Divide landscape on the Helena NF was a risky
connection between wildland ecosystems to the north and south. On the other hand, weighted
open road densities 1, which factor in the level of vehicle use that various parts of the road

system typically receive, suggest a more benign scenario. [See also Table 101, Table 107, Table
108 and Table 114 for additional summaries of road densities in the Plan Area].
Overall, road density and dispersion in the Travel Plan Area do not preclude any wildland species
from occupying the landscape at current levels of motorized use. The presence of grizzly bears,
wolverines, lynx and robust elk populations attest to this conclusion. The road system,
however, is a complication that these species would not have to deal with in a wildland
environment: It raises the level of risk from human encounters and it substantially reduces
habitat options compared with those that were available prior to development of the
transportation system. Problems with roads in the Divide landscape are due as much to the
location of certain roads in sensitive wildlife habitat sites [see Figure 9, Figure 43, Figure 49,
Figure 56] as it is to overall weighted road density [see the discussion in Riparian Habitats
above and in Local Effects in Key Areas toward the end of this report].

Snags and Woody Debris
Dead Tree Environments
Tree decay is an ecological function that creates key habitat elements, snags and logs, for
wildlife (Rose et al. 2001). Living trees with decay, hollow trees and dead trees are expressions
of mortality agents (e.g. fire, disease and insects) that create a range of snag species and sizes
(Bull et al. 1997) utilized in different ways by different wildlife species. While snags and logs
have long been seen as essential wildlife habitat components, research increasingly
underscores the need to understand them as part of a larger interacting ecosystem (Bull et al.
1997, Duncan 1999, Duncan 2002, Rose et al. 2001).
Snags provide the primary substrate for the cavities that many birds and arboreal mammals
require for an array of basic life functions (Thomas 1979). Woodpeckers are the most
prominent excavators of cavities in the Divide landscape. Some species, such as pileated and
black-backed woodpeckers are able to excavate trees with hard exterior sapwood shells and
decaying heartwood. Weaker excavators, such as hairy and downy woodpeckers, as well as
diminutive non-woodpecker species such as chickadees and red-breasted nuthatches, select
trees with softer exterior wood created by armillaria root rot and other saprophytic fungi (Rose
et al. 2001).
Most woodpeckers excavate a new cavity each year (Bull et al. 1997), thereby generating a
continuous resource for secondary cavity users, species unable to produce their own cavities.
These include several species of owls, myotis bats, kestrels, wrens, tree swallows, bluebirds,
marten, red squirrels and flying squirrels, among others. The variability among secondary cavity
users in their use of snags is broad. Saw whet owls, for example, use cavities with a minimum
tree diameter (at breast height) (dbh) of 12 inches (Thomas 1979; Bull et al. 1997). Larger owls
such as great gray, great horned and barred owls use platforms created when snags break (Bull
and Duncan 1993; Bull et al. 1997). Brown creepers nest between partially detached pieces of
bark and the trunks of dead trees (McClelland 1977. Bats roost under the loose bark of snags
but also in cavities (Bull et al. 1997). Marten use hollow trees for denning and shelter. Black
bears will den in and under larger hollow trees (averaging 43 inches dbh) (Thomas 1979; Bull et
al. 1997).
In addition to their role as nesting and foraging habitat, snags also support other activities,
including singing, viewing, perching, estivating, communicating, escaping, hibernating, resting
and observing (Davis 1983).

WILDLIFE - 288

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Snags continue to be important to wildlife once they fall and become logs. Logs provide
foraging sites, hiding and thermal cover, denning sites, nesting sites and travel conduits for small
animals, such as chipmunks, pack rats, deer mice, weasels, marten, grouse, toads and
salamanders (Rose et al. 2001). Larger animals, such as bears, forage for invertebrates in logs.
Fishers use large logs as den sites; lynx typically select dense patches of downed trees for
denning. As logs continue to decay and lose structure, they play an important role in nutrient
cycling, soil fertility and erosion control, among other functions (Maser et al. 1988).
Snag and log occurrence is variable and hard to predict under natural disturbance regimes.
Most dead tree concentrations are produced by fire and while it is possible to estimate the
relative probability of fire occurrence and expected fire behavior in a particular vegetation/fuel
environment, actual predictions as to when and how such events might play out not have
proven useful for planning and management purposes. In dry ponderosa pine/ Douglas-fir
forests, frequent non-lethal fires result in low snag variation over time (Ritter et al. 2000).
Mixed coniferous forests (most commonly Douglas-fir/ lodgepole pine in the Divide landscape)
often experience a mixed severity fire regime, which results in considerable variability in snag
density. Cool lodgepole pine and spruce/fir forests generally experience infrequent standreplacing fires, which generate periodic snag pulses (Lyon 1977).

Snag Status in the Divide Landscape
Currently on much of the Helena NF, pine forests at all elevations and over all moisture regimes
are under attack from mountain pine beetles, resulting in landscape-wide snag densities on a
scale usually produced only by large fires. The Divide landscape has been devoid of large-scale
fire since the early 20th century and the rapidly spreading snag-rich environment represents a
transformative phenomenon for wildlife habitat and associated wildlife species in this area.
Snag abundance at current levels will be short-lived. Most ponderosa and lodgepole pine trees
will have fallen within 5 to 10 years of their demise. The resulting accumulation of large woody
debris will provide an environment for a different assemblage of wildlife species. Because
ponderosa pine decays relatively quickly, these sites will be characterized by low-lying debris,
punky broken logs, soft stumps and a few standing trunks broken off partway up. Lodgepole
pine snags are generally more solid and they often stack up as they come down. Mixed with
regenerating saplings, these debris mazes provide hiding and resting enclaves for elk, deer,
bears, lynx, hares, grouse and numerous other animals [Figure 19].
Travel management on the Forest affects dead tree habitat in that most large snags within sight
of Forest roads are taken by firewood cutters. Each year, the Helena NF issues hundreds of
firewood permits that allow removal of several cords of wood in the form of dead or dying trees.
Almost all firewood cutting occurs within 300 ft of open roadways, which makes any decision to
close or open a road a key to the fate of local snags. Retaining snags as wildlife trees is rarely a
primary objective for closing a road, but it may figure in as a secondary issue in some cases.
Even with the rapidly developing abundance of snags in road corridors [Figure 18, Figure 31,
Figure 32], it is likely that most of them will be taken for firewood in the next few years. Others
will be taken by Forest Service crews to keep roads and trails open and provide for public safety.
Standing snags and woody debris in the road corridors will disappear much more quickly than
will be the case in other areas where only natural forces are at work.

Migratory Landbirds and Shorebirds
Management Direction
In 1988, an amendment to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act mandated that the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (USFWS) “identify species, subspecies and populations of all migratory nongame birds that, without additional conservation actions, are likely to become candidates for
listing under the ESA of 1973”. A subsequent report, Birds of Conservation Concern 2002,
identified migratory and non-migratory bird species (in addition to those already designated as
federally threatened or endangered) that represented the highest conservation priority. In that
report (and in a 2008 update), North America is broken down into 66 Bird Conservation Regions
(BCRs), with “bird species of concern” identified for each region. The Helena NF is situated at
the boundary of BCR 10 (northern Rockies) and BCR 17 (badlands and prairies) but supports bird
populations more characteristic of BCR 10. The migratory bird list for that BCR and the
accounting in MFWP’s Montana Field Guide (http://fieldguide.mt.gov/) have been used to
determine which birds may be of particular management concern in the Divide landscape. This
grouping takes in all migratory and yearlong resident landbirds and shorebirds identified as
“species of concern”. It does not include waterfowl or upland gamebirds.
More specific management direction for dealing with landbirds and shorebirds in project
planning (including NEPA documents) comes from the Forest Service’s Landbird Conservation
Strategic Plan (2000) and Executive Order 13186 (2001) [Fed Reg. Vol 66, No. 11, p. 3853-3856].
More recently (2008), the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) signed a
memmorandum of understanding (MOU) that directs the Forest Service to approach
management of migratory birds in the following way: (1) focus on bird populations; (2) focus on
habitat restoration and enhancement where actions can benefit specific ecosystems and
migratory birds dependent on them; (3) recognize that actions taken to benefit some migratory
bird populations may adversely affect other migratory bird populations; and (4) recognize that
actions that may provide long-term benefits to migratory birds may have short-term impacts on
individual birds. The parties agreed that through the NEPA process, the Forest Service would
evaluate the effects of agency actions on migratory birds, focusing first on species of
management concern along with their priority habitats and key risk factors. The MOU expired in
December 2013, but discussions are underway to issue a new Memorandum in the near future.
This this report deals with priority bird species as if the Memorandum were in effect.

Population Status and Habitat in the Project Area
Over a period of 14 years (1994 to 2008), the Helena NF participated in the USFS Northern
Region Landbird Monitoring Program (LBMP) in partnership with the Avian Science Center (ASC)
at the University of Montana (Hutto and Young 2002). Each year, from late spring through midsummer, the ASC conducted standardized surveys along a series of pre-determined transects
across the Forest (with two years, 2001 to 2002, focused on bird populations in riparian willow
communities). The program has provided data on population trends, habitat relationships and
effects from past management activities for birds breeding throughout western Montana and
northern Idaho. According to Hutto, “There are not nearly enough years of data to make
meaningful use of our population trend data yet, but the preliminary data suggest that most
populations have remained fairly stable during the 12-year period from 1994 to 2006”
(http://avianscience.dbs.umt.edu/projects.php).
The Divide landscape includes 19 point-count transects (15 of them in the Travel Plan Area) that
were monitored in different combinations from 1994 to 2006. In monitoring a transect,

WILDLIFE - 291

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

surveyors identified and counted birds for 10 minutes at each of 10 points, with tansects being
worked once a year in late sprng or early summer. Surveyors identified birds primarily by songs
and calls and to a lesser extent, by sight. So, they did not always pick up birds that were
particularly secretive (American bitterns), uncommon (Brewer’s sparrows), or attached to
habitat that lacked transects (bobolinks) during their relatively short sessions at each transect
point. Some of these species, however, have been identified fortuitously over the past two
decades during general wildlife fieldwork or by special survey efforts that targeted particular
species (goshawks, flammulated owls, boreals owls and black-backed woodpeckers, for
example).
Over the 12 year period, 60 bird species were identified along the LBMP survey transects and an
additional 36 species were picked up during general and targeted wildlife survey work. These
tallies do not include waterfowl, upland gamebirds, or obvious transients (Baird’s sparrows,
peregrine falcons, ferruginous hawks, among others). Of the 96 species, nineteen are classified
as “species of concern” and/or “birds of conservation concern” in the Montana portion of BCR
10 and are displayed in Table 86 as species whose populations could be compromised by certain
land management activities.
The Divide Travel Plan Area provides habitat opportunity for all of these species, some more
than others. Some species are affected negatively by certain land management practices,
others positively and some little at all. Hejl and others (1995) recommend a bird conservation
strategy composed of three parts: (1) maintain, mimic and restore natural vegetation patterns
and processes; (2) ensure that the specific habitat components required by focus species are
created and/or maintained; and (3) monitor the habitats and individual species.

Habitat Preferences and Limiting Factors
Swainson’s hawks are similar in behavior and habitat use
to red-tailed hawks, but their populations are less robust,
primarily because of problems on winter range in South
America. They occur mostly on the fringes of the Plan area
in grassland and agricultural fields, nesting in isolated trees
and hunting for small mammals, reptiles and large insects.
Golden eagles nest on cliffs and in large trees. They forage
most often over grassland and open woodland, where prey
is visible. Numbers are limited by territorial competition
with other eagles (and other raptors) and by mortality
from shooting, poisoning and electrocution on powerlines.
Prairie falcons establish eyries on high cliffs, preying on
birds that can be knocked out of the air. They are less
dependent on aquatic habitat than peregrine falcons and
appear more versatile in their choice of nest sites.
Nonetheless, numbers are limited by the availability of
nesting cliffs, as well as by the logistics of ongoing recovery
from decimated populations in the 20th century.

Habitat Preferences and Limiting Factors
Goshawks nest and fledge young in mature closedcanopied forest stands but hunt in a variety of forest
formations, as well as in open habitats near forest edges.
Availability of nesting/ post-fledging habitat and the
density of prey are primary limiting factors. Low population
density is driven by the need for large home ranges.
Great gray owls nest in the upper reaches of large brokentopped trees in mature/ old-growth forest (usually fairly
dense). They forage in a variety of habitats, including wet
meadows, fields and bogs, as well as coniferous forest. In
some areas, great gray owl populations are limited by
periodic shortages of prey; in others, sparsity of suitable
nest trees is the primary factor.
Boreal owls nest in tree cavities and hunt at night in higher
elevation conifer forests, usually Engelmann spruce,
subalpine fir and lodgepole pine. These diminutive owls
are more common than once thought, but they are
secretive and difficult to census. Numbers are limited by
territoriality and the availability of suitable habitat.
The flammulated owl is a small cavity nesting raptor,
preferring open-grown mature or old-growth ponderosa
pine forest for nesting and foraging. Inclusions of denser
conifers provide roosting enclaves. They are sometimes
found in Douglas-fir or aspen when suitable ponderosa
pine stands are unavailable. The scarcity of open-grown
stands of large ponderosa pine is the main limiting factor.
Great blue herons usually feed in shallow wetlands
wherever they occur, including many near human
development. Less often they forage for amphibians and
small mammals in wet meadows or fields. They establish
nesting colonies in the canopies of deciduous trees
(typically cottonwoods) not far from wetland feeding
areas. Populations are limited by the fragmented
distribution of suitable nesting and foraging sites.
Lewis’s woodpeckers are cavity nesters most strongly
associated with burned or open gown ponderosa pine
forest with a sufficient supply of snags. They usually move
into burned forests several years after fire has occurred.
Pine forests decimated by insect and disease may also
provide suitable habitat. Lewis’s woodpecker populations
are limited primarily by a shortage of older, dead trees in a
given area.

Habitat Preferences and Limiting Factors
Black-backed woodpeckers are tightly tied to large
concentrations of dead trees created by stand replacing
fires. Post-fire insect populations can sustain woodpecker
populations for only 3-5 years. The proliferation of dead
trees created by mountain pine beetle infestation in the
Divide landscape does not appear to be drawing in blackbacked woodpeckers. The primary limiting factor is the
erratic availability of suitable post-fire environments for
these highly specialized birds.
Willow flycatchers are highly restricted to riparian shrub
communities. Landscape-wide populations are suppressed
by the fragmented and limited distribution of the key
habitat association and by processes that reduce the
quality of that habitat, stream channelization, livestock
grazing, etc.
These birds generally nest and perch in dead trees in open
habitats, historically, those created by fire, but also in postinsect infestation areas, logged sites with residual snags, or
other open areas with tall dead trees. They are most
common in spruce, lodgepole pine and aspen habitat
types. Populations are limited by the availability of snags
in suitable configurations.
Clark’s nutcrackers are conspicuous residents of higher
elevation whitebark pine-dominated forests in summer
and lower elevation ponderosa pine and limber pine
forests in winter. They are highly dependent on the large
seeds of these trees. Populations are limited primarily by
the abundance and distribution of whitebark pine, which
has decreased substantially with ongoing insect and
disease infestation.
Rufous hummingbirds are most common west of the
Continental Divide in open habitats with abundant shrubs:
burns, riparian shrub arrays, open-grown forest and timber
harvest units. Proliferation of cutting units that provide
shrubs but lack other key resources may be depressing
populations. East of the Divide, populations are limited by
fragmentation and overall scarcity of suitable habitat.
Brown creepers are small insectivorous birds than nest
under the loose bark of large dead or dying trees. They are
most common in mature and old-growth conifer stands
with relatively dense canopy closure and a good supply of
large trees and snags. The primary limiting factor for
brown creepers is the decline in abundance of these dense
older forest habitats.
Veerys are small birds strongly associated with riparian
willow communities, particularly those with open forest
overstory and with cottonwoods. Their population
distribution is limited by the fragmented dispersion of the
riparian communities on which they depend.

Habitat Preferences and Limiting Factors
Towhees are most often observed on or near the ground in
drier shrub communities, especially those with a diversity
of shrubs. They are most common in sagebrush but they
also do well in some riparian shrub habitats. Primary
limiting factors are those that threaten the health of shrubdominated habitats, often livestock grazing in this case.
Evening grosbeaks are often observed in small flocks in
mixed conifer and spruce/fir forests; but they also make
use of aspen, cottonwoods and ponderosa pine. Their
populations generally increase in years of insect irruptions,
particularly, spruce budworm. Limiting factors include the
unpredictable presence of preferred insect prey and the
distribution of mature forest.
Cassin’s finches are most often found in open-grown
coniferous forest, typically, ponderosa pine; but they occur
across a broad array of forest types, including post-fire
stands and riparian habitats. Variable conifer seed
production (particularly in ponderosa pine) may be a
destabilizing factor for populations.

Big Game Species
A variety of big game species inhabit the project area: elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, moose,
black bears, mountain lions and in very low numbers, grizzly bears and wolves. This analysis
focuses on elk and their role as management indicators that indirectly show the effects of land
management on other species. We assume that the effects of human actions on elk more or
less pertain to other big game species as well, although there will be species-specific differences
that are not reflected in the elk analyses that follow. Some of these differences are described in
sections on individual species below (Mule Deer, Moose) and the rest in the Wildlife Analysis
Approach Table (appendix A of the wildlife specialist report).

North American Elk
Management and Analysis Strategies
The American elk (Cervus elaphus) serves as a management indicator for hunted species on the
Helena NF (as it does on most National Forests in Region 1). Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks,
the Forest Service and other agencies manage elk to provide a surplus for hunters while holding
populations well above levels required for viability. Population viability of elk in the northern
Rockies has not been at risk since the early 20th century. Elk are one of the more manageable
wildlife species: their habitat requirements are well studied and they respond readily to habitat
change and population manipulation (Cooperrider 2002). Elk are adaptable and occur in a
variety of habitats including high mountain forests and meadows, grasslands, shrublands, cold
deserts and highly managed forests (Skovlin et al. 2002). Prior to European settlement, elk in
Montana were commonly observed in the grasslands and river bottoms of the Great Plains yearround. However, due to habitat alteration in the valleys and on the prairies (most often from
livestock and crop raising) and the extirpation of elk from areas of human settlement, most elk
now find summer range in mountain grasslands, meadows and coniferous forests, descending to
ranges in the foothills and adjacent valleys only in winter (Skovlin et al. 2002).

Managing for elk has become increasingly complex as human activities have affected habitat
quality and access. Management requires meeting basic habitat needs and understanding the
socioeconomic value of elk. Primary considerations in elk management (Lonner 1991) include:
Maintaining habitat security to protect elk during the hunting season;
•
Preserving/recovering desired elk population characteristics as determined by elk
managers and distributions relative to land management;
•
Satisfying the growing demand for quality hunting and non-hunting experiences.
Methodologies have evolved over the years to measure the status of elk populations and their
vulnerability to land management practices, hunting, wildlife viewing and the ever-increasing
presence of people throughout elk habitat. These approaches are generally organized around
seasonal habitat needs: Summer range, winter range and hunting season security habitat.
•

Summer Range

Basic Elk Summer Range

From late spring through late summer, elk need secluded calving areas and summer habitat rich
in nutritional forage. Elk move upslope following spring green-up and calving occurs along a
rough elevational gradient. While bulls often seek out the patchy interface between emerging
green-up and the snowline, cows remain lower where forage is more robust. Productivity of elk
is therefore based partly on the quality of transitional range as well as that of summer range.

Research suggests that the quality of summer range, via its ability to contribute to late summer
nutrition, may be the most important variable in determining annual variation of herd growth
(Stewart et al. 2005; Cook 2002, p. 305; Cook et al. 1996). Habitat Effectiveness (Christensen et
al. 1993) is one widely used means of summarizing how well summer and transitional ranges
meet the needs of elk for growth and welfare in non-hunting seasons. Habitat effectiveness
derives from the abundance and distribution of cover, forage, water and special habitat
features. Since the availability of these components tends to be satisfactory on most summer
ranges, variations in habitat effectiveness are related most often to an additional factor: the
opportunity to avoid human activity. Opportunity for seclusion, or the lack thereof, on the
National Forest is primarily a function of open roads, which, if abundant enough, can shunt elk
away from habitat sites that they would prefer to use. Open road density is translated to
habitat effectiveness via a curve derived from the Montana Elk-Logging Study (Lyon 1979),
which recommends minimum habitat effectiveness of 50 percent on elk summer range (or an
open road density less than about 1.85 mi/mi²).
A problem with “habitat effectiveness” as an index of habitat functionality is that it measures
open road density over broad areas (typically, elk herd units) without considering how roads are
distributed. Roads that pass through key habitats (wet meadows, riparian areas, nursery areas,
aspen stands) degrade the capability of elk summer range to a greater extent than those that
traverse areas of less importance.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Figure 20 - Photo 15: Elk Summer Range

“Important elk summer range” along the Continental Divide in the south half of the Travel Plan
Area. This area supports stands of mature timber interspersed with wet meadows, providing elk
with high quality forage and summer thermal cover. When roads are pushed into areas such as
this, elk use and habitat effectiveness can decline appreciably. This particular area at Sure thing
Swamps is currently unroaded.
This impact on localized and sometimes poorly mapped habitat features is difficult to quantify
over an area as large as the Divide landscape. So, I have focused on impacts in local areas that
are particularly important to elk and for which we have reliable field information [see “Local
Effects in Key Areas”].
Helena Forest Plan standards for summer range are concerned with maintaining adequate
hiding cover (big game Standards 3 and 5), protecting active elk calving and nursery sites from
motorized uses (Standard 4b) and inventorying and mapping important summer range areas
(Standard 7). Also incorporated into the Forest Plan are recommendations of the Montana
Cooperative Elk-Logging Study (Lyon et al. 1985) (Standard 6), some of which apply to summer
range: Applicable recommendations are to protect the integrity of wet sites, preserve key
blocks of cover, minimize open road density, eliminate open roads passing through key summer
habitat and discourage project designs that introduce cattle into new areas of elk summer
range. Of primary interest to the Divide Travel Plan are those standards that address the
influence of roads on elk summer habitat. While the relationship between roads and forest
cover on summer range is of interest, the Travel Plan would have no effect on cover.

Helena NF and MFWP Interpretations of Summer Range

The Forest Plan Glossary defines big game summer range simply as “a range, usually at higher
elevation, used by deer and elk during the summer…” (HFP, p. VI/16). Working maps of big
game range in the Divide landscape prepared for the Forest Plan (1981) show local pockets of

WILDLIFE - 297

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

“key summer range” [Figure 20] in detail, but they do not delineate summer range as a whole.
Given this deficiency, most Forest Plan big game analyses since the early 1980s have interpreted
summer range as (1) all land inside Helena NF boundaries, regardless of elevation, or (2) all
Helena NF lands not shown as winter range on the 1981 maps. Summer range under either of
these interpretations is extensive, covering true higher elevation “summer ranges” as well as
lower elevation “transitional ranges” used mostly in spring and fall.
So, I have proceeded as follows:
•

•

In discussing the ecology of elk summer range in the Travel Plan Area, I have adhered to
the more traditional view of summer range as higher elevation habitat where most of
the elk are found during the “summer”, between the time calves are born (late May to
early June) and the first big frosts begin to push elk out of many key summer habitats
(generally in mid-late September). It should be noted that this is a considerably larger
area than the sum of local sites that are mapped as “key summer range” or “important
summer range”.
In determining compliance with Forest Plan big game standard 3, which requires
maintaining 35 percent of summer range as hiding cover (HFP, p. II/17), I have used the
more expansive delineation of “summer range”, that is, all lands within Helena NF
administrative boundaries. This interpretation loops in a lot of ground that serves
primarily as transitional and winter range and that is used only incidentally or
occasionally in summer. But it is consistent with much of what has been done in other
HFP analyses since 1981 and so, I have applied it here as well.

Winter Range
Traditionally, the availability of suitable winter range has been seen as the key limiting factor for
most elk populations (see Polfus 2011, p. 20-23; Lyon and Christensen 2002, p. 559). Winter
ranges are usually smaller than summer ranges, supply less forage and provide less forest cover.
They often lie closer to sources of human disturbance than summer ranges, typically on or near
private ranchland and they are often grazed over by domestic livestock. In addition, winter
ranges are occupied by elk when temperatures are low and snow may limit access to forage.
Under these conditions, elk catabolize fat and muscle, so that they may lose 10 percent of their
body weight in moderate to normal winters and 25 percent or more in severe winters (Cook
2002, pp. 305-310). Managing for wintering areas with minimal human activity and adequate
forage can help reduce energy costs associated with over-winter survival (Skovlin et al. 2002).
On the other hand, recent studies, suggest that while natural mortality is generally higher on
winter ranges, the probability of elk surviving a given winter is directly linked to the quality of
nutrition on spring, summer and fall ranges (Cook 2002, p. 305). Elk that enter the wintering
period with high fat reserves are better able deal with the often harsh conditions associated
with winter range.
In the Divide landscape, as well as across much of the Helena NF, a large proportion of elk
winter range lies on private land, or other non-Forest lands, in lower elevation foothills and
valleys [Figure 21]. Big game habitat on these lands is outside the jurisdiction and control of
the National Forest. It has been delineated on broadscale maps by MFWP (and the Rocky
Mountain Elk Foundation) [MFWP 2011a]; but for purposes of assessing the impacts of Helena
NF travel management, I have turned to winter range maps developed for the Helena NF Oil and
Gas Leasing EIS in 1995 (USFS, USDI 1995). The rationale for using this version of winter range

WILDLIFE - 298

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

as opposed to that delineated by the MFWP maps is discussed in some detail in the
“Environmental Consequences” sections that deal with elk winter range.

Figure 21 - Photo 16: Elk Winter Range

Primary elk winter range on private land north of Elliston in the foothills above the Little
Blackfoot River Valley (late February). Elk remain on these lower elevation grasslands for the
duration of the winter and do not move back up onto the National Forest until after mid-April.
In this analysis, I discuss the status of winter range as a whole, including the large private land
component. However, because the Helena NF is unable to manage much of this resource
directly, I use only winter range within Elk Herd Unit boundaries (an area reaching 1.5 mile
beyond the Forest boundary) to calculate Forest Plan standards. This accounts for most elk that
remain linked to National Forest lands in winter (potentially moving back and forth between
public and private land) and that might be influenced by Helena NF land management during
this period [see appendix D of the wildlife specialist report].
Helena Forest Plan standards for elk winter range focus on two things: (1) providing adequate
thermal cover (stands of trees greater than or equal to 40 feet high with at least 70 percent
canopy closure) and (2) restricting disturbance from motor vehicles. Thermal cover in stands
larger than 15 acres needs to account for at least 25 percent of winter range in each elk herd
unit and vehicle traffic through elk wintering areas is to be restricted to those few primary roads
and snowmobile trails needed to access other parts of the Forest. Interestingly, the Plan does
not address forage on winter range.
For several decades, thermal cover has been one of two pivotal habitat elements at issue on big
game winter ranges (forage being the other). In winter, thermal cover stands curtail snow
accumulation, block wind and under the right conditions, moderate temperature under the
canopy. However, the value of thermal cover, widely accepted as a key component of elk winter
range in the 1970s and 1980s (Thomas 1979; Beall 1976), has been called into question by more
recent research (Skovlin et al. 2002). Cook et al. (1998) found no positive effect of thermal
WILDLIFE - 299

Environmental Impact Statement

cover on the condition of elk in a series of experiments in northeast Oregon and concluded that
providing thermal cover was not a suitable solution for inadequate forage on winter range. A
review of experimental tests aimed at probing the value of thermal cover to big game animals
(Cook et al. 2005) concluded that the thermal cover benefit attributed to dense forest structure
was probably not operative across a considerable range of climate, including most elk winter
ranges in Montana.
Recently, however, Thompson and others (2005) have made a case for the importance of forest
cover on Montana elk winter ranges. They argue that elk benefit from solar radiation in open
habitats only as long as forage is adequate and accessible, as is the norm in most winters. But
when forage is scant or access to it is impeded by deep or crusty snow, elk use up stored energy
reserves at a higher rate and the metabolic cost of remaining in open grassland or shrubland
becomes too high. In those cases, elk switch to an energy conservation strategy, moving to
forest cover, becoming less active and subsisting on low quality forest forage.
The forest formation advocated by Thompson et al. is not the classic continuum of greater than
or equal to 70 percent canopy closure, but rather, a cover/forage mosaic where patches of
dense cover are intertwined with more open-canopied forest and small openings. This provides
an environment where manageable snow conditions and useful forage [deciduous shrubs, elk
sedge, young conifers (esp. Douglas-fir) and arboreal lichens, species that thrive in more open
forest conditions] are in close proximity. Thompson et al. (2005) provide no shorthand
descriptive term for this habitat formation; but it is not “thermal cover”.
Field monitoring by MFWP biologists has shown that even when elk spend daylight hours
foraging in open grasslands, they most often retreat to these kinds of mature forest stands to
bed down at night. Bulls in particular spend a considerable amount of time in forested habitats
adjacent to open foraging areas. The stands need not be large, often riparian stringers and
small isolated forest patches serve the purpose. But, the dominant trees are almost always
mature (T. Carlsen, A. Grove: personal communication 2012). Again, these stands need not meet
the definition of “thermal cover” and many of them are relatively open. Some of the Douglas-fir
stands visible in Figure 21 are representative of the kinds of forest cover that elk make use of
on winter range.
More to the point for travel planning, the need to limit human disturbance on elk winter range
has been validated by research (see Polfus 2011; Canfield et al., p. 6.3-6.9; Lyon 1979). While
elk can tolerate a certain amount of vehicle traffic along predictable, well-defined routes, by
habituation or avoidance of the road/trail corridor, random off-route travel will haze elk from
normal wintering sites, leading them to draw down limited energy reserves. In this regard,
Forest Plan standards remain valid.

Fall Elk Security

Introduction
Elk management during the hunting season focuses on maintaining population numbers well
above viability thresholds, protecting certain sex and age classes from over-harvest, providing
public hunting opportunity and attempting to balance elk distribution across public and private
lands. While these functions are a responsibility of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP),
the Helena NF strives to compliment their efforts by managing elk habitat on the National
Forest. The goal has been to provide security habitat that allows a reasonable number of elk to
escape hunters so that MFWP does not have to reduce the allowable harvest or shorten the

hunting season (USFS 1986). The current five -week rifle season (mid October to late
November) is much longer than in most states and provinces. When the six -week archery
season (early September to mid October) is added, the total hunting period for elk encompasses
most of the fall. This “permits a diversity of choice [for hunters] with regard to time, weather
conditions, hunter density and area” (Lonner and Cada 1982 cited in Hillis et al. 1991).

Helena Forest Plan Approach (1986)

The current Helena Forest Plan standard for measuring elk security/vulnerability in the hunting
season [Big Game Standard 4a (HFP, p. II/17 – II/18)] uses an index that combines open road
density and hiding cover [see Table 87 and Figure 22 below].

In computing the standard, road miles are “weighted”: Open roads on public lands are
calculated at 100 percent of length, regardless of condition or use level and private roads not
open to the general public are calculated at 25 percent of length. Forest roads closed to
vehicles during the hunting season are not counted (USFS 2007e). The Forest Plan requires that
in order to be tallied for standard 4a, hiding cover must occur in blocks of 40 acres or more
(“Forest Plan hiding cover”) (see standard 5, HFP p. II/19). Hiding cover is defined as vegetation
capable of concealing 90 percent of a standing elk at 200 feet (the “Forest Service definition”).
Obtaining this measurement over large areas (such as elk herd units) is an arduous and timeconsuming process. So, for the sake of practicality, we use canopy closure (“crown closure”) as
derived from satellite imagery as a surrogate for hiding cover, based on the assumption that
stands with canopy closure of 40 percent or more will also provide hiding cover. Standard 4a
allows for the application of this alternate methodology, which comes from MFWP [also
referred to as “MDFWP”] and sets open road density limits for given hiding cover percentages as
shown in Table 87 (HFP, p. II/18).

Only three of the six herd units currently comply with the standard for big game security (having
plotted out below the curve shown in Figure 22). Two of these (Jericho and Spotted Dog-Little
Blackfoot) support notably more hiding cover than the other 4 units. The third herd unit in
compliance (Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge) has moderate hiding cover, but it has the lowest
open road density of any herd unit in the landscape (with the Lazyman Inventoried Roadless
Area occupying more than half the unit). Failure of a herd unit to comply with the standard is
associated with vaious combinations of insufficient hiding cover (Quartz), high open road
density (Little Prickly Pear-Ophir), or both (Greenhorn). While open road density can be quickly
reduced by closing roads, an increase in hiding cover is the product of long, slow natural
processes that cannot be manipulated in the short term. In the meantime, hiding cover across
WILDLIFE - 302

Environmental Impact Statement

the landscape is decreasing further as trees killed in the mountain pine beetle outbreak
continue to fall across much of the Travel Plan Area.
While the relationship between open road density and hiding cover can be informative, it does
not account for the spatial arrangement and size of unroaded patches, topography as a
mediator of hunter access, the distribution of forage and other factors that influence the ability
of elk to survive the hunting season. Forest stands that do not meet the definition of hiding
cover may prove to be secure areas for elk where local conditions of topography, remoteness
and environmental barriers impede hunter access. Conversely, blocks of hiding cover situated in
roaded country may be highly insecure. Hiding cover has a role to play but it is not synonymous
with security (Lyon and Canfield 1991; Unsworth and Kuck 1991; Lyon and Christensen 1992;
Christensen et al. 1993).
When the Helena Forest Plan was fashioned in the early 1980’s, the total elk population on the
Forest was estimated to be around 5,000 (4,900 elk in 1981) (HFP, p. V/5). Goals, objectives and
standards for big game in the Plan were designed, among other things, to provide enough
habitat on the National Forest to support 6,400 elk by 2000, in support of MFWP goals for
harvestable elk (HFP, p. V/5). Recent MFWP aerial survey data (2014) indicate that at least
11,350 elk inhabit the nine hunting districts that have major overlap with the Helena NF. This
total does not include elk on seven other hunting districts with relatively small overlap of Helena
NF lands. While some of the elk in the overlapping hunting districts spend all or part of their
time on non Forest land or on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge and Lewis and Clark NFs, a significant
number of them, well in excess of 6,400, are part of the Helena NF population.
Although elk populations in the Divide landscape have increased substantially since the 1980’s
and have been at or above MFWP population goals for several years, as well as exceeding
Helena NF population goals, big game standard 4a continues to indicate that elk security is substandard in half of the local herd units and barely above standard in the others. As such, the
index has been an imprecise and often uninformative guide to the state of elk security over the
past 25 plus years [see discussion in “Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment for Big Game
Security for the Divide Travel Plan”].

The Concept of Elk Security Areas

Since the release of the Helena Forest Plan in 1986, field research in the northern Rockies and
Pacific Northwest has led to the concept of “elk security areas” as a basis for assessing elk
vulnerability to hunting. The degree to which elk are able to survive the fall hunt is seen, in
large part, as a function of the size and pattern of habitat blocks, amply forested in most cases,
to which hunter access is limited and in which elk have consistent, unencumbered access to
basic resources. Hillis and others (1991) developed an analysis procedure (generally referred to
as the “Hillis method”) based on the availability of large non-linear blocks of habitat (greater
than or equal to 250 acres) ½ mile from open roads. The intent was that at least 30 percent of
the “hunting season home range” within a “standardized habitat analysis unit” be held in
security areas (Hillis et al., p. 39). This particular set of parameters was designed for denselyforested western Montana elk habitat and the Hillis team recommended that, particularly for
areas further east where forest cover was more limited, security requirements be evaluated on
a site-specific basis and the guidelines adjusted so that results made biological sense in a local
setting (Hillis et al. 1991, p. 40; Christensen et al. 1993, p. 5).

Forest Plan Amendment for Big Game Security

Under a Forest Plan amendment proposed for the Divide Travel Plan and applicable to future
projects in the Divide landscape, a “security area” approach would replace the current “hiding
cover/open road density index” as the Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability of elk
to hunting [see “Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment for Big Game Security for the Divide
Travel Plan”]. The amendment derives from the Hillis methodology (1991), but it includes
modifications designed for “eastside” Forest environments in general and the Divide landscape
in particular. The specifics of the amendment come in part from guidelines worked out by
biologists from the Forest Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP) and
summarized in “U.S. Forest Service and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks
Collaborative Overview and Recommendations for Elk Habitat Management on the Custer,
Gallatin, Helena and Lewis and Clark National Forests” (USFS and MFWP 2013). Other details
emerged from a series of meetings focused on big game management for the Divide Travel Plan:
Participants included Helena NF and MFWP biologists, as well as local interest groups (2013 to
2014).

The new standard [Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment] is based on three basic statements,
clarified by a series of definitionss, guidelines, goal statements and site-specific data for Divide
elk herd units. The standard reads as follows:
Road management will be implemented to maintain or improve big game security and
hunting opportunity.
•
Road management will also be implemented to maintain or improve big game
intermittent refuge areas [discussed below].
•
The standard applies only to the National Forest System lands within those portions of
an elk herd unit that are within the Helena Ranger District, Helena National Forest
administrative boundary.
Public motorized use will be managed during the hunting season (September 1 to December 1)
to maintain elk security at levels specified for each of the six Divide elk herd units under each
alternative proposed for the Divide Travel Plan. These baseline security levels are shown in
Table 109 and Table 110 in the “Environmental Consequences” section of this report. Security is
defined in terms of the percentage of an elk herd unit occupied by non-motorized security areas
[Table 109].
•

The goal of the standard is to maintain or improve elk security in herd units where
security/refuge areas occupy less than 50 percent of the unit and to keep it above 50 percent in
herd units that have achieved that level. Any decrease in percent security in herd units that are
under 50 percent, would represent non-compliance with the standard. Herd units would remain
in compliance as long as their security percentages hold steady or increase. The 50 percent
security area level (considerably higher than the 30 percent recommended by the Hillis group) is
based on what has been deemed desireable and achievable in the Blackfoot landscape just to
the north [Blackfoot Non-Winter Travel Plan FEIS, 2014]. For the sake of consistency, the 50
percent goal has been applied to the Divide landscape as well, although we recognize that, given
the entrenched nature of the State, County and Forest road system in the landscape west of
Helena, this percentage is unachievable on all but perhaps two of the six Divide herd units. The
fact that herd units are below 50 percent security does not mean that they are out of
compliance with the standard.

WILDLIFE - 304

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The figures in Table 109 represent the baseline security levels that need to be maintained or
improved in order for herd units to continue complying with the standard under any given
alternative. Currently, percentages in a majority of herd units are low [Table 89; Table 109,
Alternative 1]: But they represent security levels that have been allowing MFWP to meet its elk
population objectives in local hunting districts, or in those portions of the districts associated
with Divide landscape herd units [Table 92 and Table 93]. The inference is that, although
percentages are well below 50 percent, the current arrangement of security and refuge areas is,
for the time being, operating effectively.

Delineating Elk Security in the Divide Landscape

In delineating elk security areas, we have relied on guidelines recently developed by MFWP and
Helena NF biologists (USFS and MFWP 2013) with additional input from interested local groups
and individuals. These criteria and the elk security areas that arise from them in the Divide
landscape are summarized in the proposed Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment for Big Game
Security [following report].
While distance from open motor routes is the essential parameter used to define the
boundaries of elk security areas, a number of other components come into play in determining
what that distance should be and how large the area needs to be in order to provide effective
security. Hillis et al. (1991) identified deficient forest cover as a potential problem for “eastside”
Forests in Montana. Other factors that can diminish the integrity of a security area include:

small size (in the 250 acre range),
•
narrow or irregular shape (excessive edge and access opportunity),
•
gentle terrain (which encourages hunters to probe further into the area),
•
scarcity of physical barriers (such as cliffs, talus, broad streams, bogs, deadfall)
•
limited elevational range (which limits elk use to only part of the hunting season),
•
forest structure that is open or highly fragmented,
•
few interior foraging areas (which forces elk to leave the security area to find food),
•
isolation from other security areas (no credible travel corridors between areas),
•
an interior network of closed roads and trails (providing walking lanes for hunters),
•
proximity to local population centers (which generally leads to high hunting pressure),
•
multiple entry points (trailheads, roadside pullouts, parking areas).
Factors that increase the effectiveness of security areas are the converse of those listed above:
large size, plentiful forest cover, minimal trails and old roadways, rugged terrain, heavy deadfall
and so on.
•

In developing the guidelines, we recognized that all of these factors may influence the ability of
an area to hold elk through the hunting season; but we felt that the key component was size.
Accordingly, rather than adjust individual security area boundaries to account for a multiplicity
of factors, we simply set the minimum size of a bona fide “elk security area” at 1,000 acres,
considerably larger than the 250 acre minimum recommended by Hillis et al. for “westside”
Forests. This is an adjustment for “eastside” cover conditions and it also conforms to the 1,000acre security area minimum recently established for the Blackfoot Non-Winter Travel Plan Area
on the Lincoln Ranger District just to the north (USFS 2014).
A number of smaller habitat blocks (between 250 and 1,000 acres) that have been classified as
security areas in past analyses are now designated as “intermittent refuge areas”. While most
WILDLIFE - 305

Environmental Impact Statement

of these areas are probably too small to hold elk securely throughout the hunting season, they
serve as temporary refuges for hunted animals and in parts of the Divide landscape, they
represent the only escape areas available [see Figure 23]. While their acreages are not added
into the security area total for a given elk herd unit, they have been mapped and noted as areas
that need to be managed for elk security.
We calculate elk security on a herd unit basis [see “Elk Herd Units” in the following section].
Herd units along the Helena NF boundary have been drawn to extend 1.5 mile out onto nonForest land. But, in delineating security areas, we do so only for the area within Helena NF
administrative boundaries (see USFS and MFWP 2013). This is where MFWP and the Helena NF
would like to retain elk in the hunting season: public land open to all hunters (where the Forest
Service has management control and the ability to close roads). By excluding from the security
calculation those portions of the herd units that lie outside the Forest boundary, we have
omitted security provided by private lands on which public hunting is barred and on which elk
have been learning to seek refuge with increasing frequency. MFWP and the Helena NF feel
that relying on these sanctuaries for security is undesirable since it decreases public hunting
opportunity. In addition, the status of private lands can be in flux over the long-term,
depending on landowner decisions that may have little consideration for the welfare of elk. So,
while I have accounted for the role that these lands play in influencing elk security on the
National Forest as a cumulative effect, I have not analyzed it as a direct effect on Helena NF
land.
Elk security areas are now delineated as habitat blocks of at least 1,000 acres [250 acres for
intermittent refuge areas] with borders ½ mile from roads and motor trails open during the big
game hunting season. Security area boundaries have also been pulled back ½ mile from private
land holdings that support active roads somewhere on the property. This has eliminated some
areas that had previously been delineated as security areas and it has reduced the size of others.
At the recommendation of MFWP, the hunting season was defined to include both the general
rifle and archery seasons, thus occupying most of the period between September 1 and
December 1 [USFS and MFWP 2013, p. 13]. Open routes in this period were determined via the
road and trail attribute layers in the Helena NF GIS data base and security area boundaries
drawn accordingly. Resulting areas are shown in Figure 23.

The Role of Forest Cover

While the new Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment does not require that elk security areas
provide a particular level of hiding cover, it does recognize forest cover as an important
component of security and includes a set of guidelines for managing cover on fall elk ranges
[following report]. The guidelines focus on maintaining cover where it exists within security
areas and in travel lanes between them. Where cover is not available, the guidelines emphasize
managing for its recruitment. Abundant cover is most valuable in areas known to be frequented
by elk: saddles, low divides, drainage-heads, riparian/ wetland sites and the upper third of
slopes in large drainages. These objectives do not apply to areas where hiding cover has not
been abundant historically because of intrinsic environmental conditions (primarily in dry
grasslands and shrublands and in dry Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests).

The guidelines also recognize that forest cover that is not dense enough or tall enough to
provide classic hiding cover may still provide concealment in certain circumstances or otherwise
allow animals to elude hunters. In this analysis, I refer to three levels of forest cover:

WILDLIFE - 306

Environmental Impact Statement

•
•

•

Divide Travel Plan

“hiding cover” provided by conifers capable of hiding 90 percent of a standing elk or
deer at 200 feet, the standard definition from the Forest Plan;
“screening cover” provided by conifers and other vegetation that afford longer sight
distances than hiding cover but that can obstruct a clear view toward standing or
moving animals;
“concealment cover” provided by small conifers, shrubs, boulders, or coarse woody
debris that can hide calves/fawns and bedded adults (and may serve to impede hunter
movement).

The Role of Off-Forest Lands in Providing Elk Security

Another factor contributing to elk security is land ownership pattern. In recent years, more elk
have been finding fall refuge on large blocks of private land off the National Forest. This occurs
when ranchers or other owners of large parcels near the Forest prohibit or restrict public
hunting. In parts of the Divide landscape, elk have been quick to identify the security value of
these private lands. A recent study by MFWP concluded that, given the choice, elk prefer
unhunted sanctuaries on private lands to traditional security areas on public land (MFWP 2011c;
Proffitt et al. 2010, 2013) (see also Burcham et al. 1999). The immediate impetus to move to
private land prior to or early in the hunting season may be driven by inadequate security and an
overabundance of hunters and motorized recreationists on public lands. Later in the season,
because most private refuges are located at lower elevation, it may be generated by
accumulating snow and declining forage availability in the mountains. It may also be a function
of elk instinctively returning to historic valley ranges as lands become available for them to do
so.
Regardless of the reasons, these private sanctuaries are acting as valley and foothills “security
areas” that augment security (as defined by Hillis et al.) on public land. With private land,
however, hunter access is often completely precluded rather than simply made more difficult by
walking distance and terrain as with National Forest security areas [see discussion of the
Deerlodge and Granite Butte EMUs in the Montana Elk Management Plan (MFWP 2004, p. 187203)]. Hunting opportunity is thus diminished. On the other hand, given the checkerboard
pattern of public and private land ownership in the valleys, groups of elk sometimes drift into
unprotected areas where they are vulnerable to being surrounded and indiscriminantly shot by
opportunistic hunters in vehicles. For these reasons, wildlife managers see the accumulation of
elk in the valleys during the hunting season as problematic.

Current Security in the Divide Landscape

As seen in Table 89, only one herd unit, Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot, approaches the 30 percent
security acreage threshold proposed by Hillis et al. (1991). Even when intermittent refuge areas
are added in, percentages of all herd units remain well below the idealized 50 percent goal set
for the Blackfoot and Divide landscapes. Strategic road closures can bring some percentages up
appreciably, but this is not feasible in some herd units. These percentages represent the
baseline condition that allow each of these herd units to comply with the amended elk security
standard at the present time (alternative 1). As long as the acreages and perc entages do not
decline, the herd units remain in compliance.
It should be noted that although some of the herd units have very low on-Forest security levels,
elk are able to compensate in most cases by taking advantage of private lands where public
hunting is not allowed or where access is difficult. The relationship between these security area
percentages and the status of local elk populations will be discussed in following sections.

Figure 23 shows the current configuration and distribution of elk security areas and

intermittent refuge areas across the six elk herd units of the Divide landscape. Some of the

been heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle and cover conditions will be changing.

Elk Herd Units
To analyze the effects of Helena NF actions on elk, we have partitioned the Divide landscape
into six elk herd units (EHUs) [Figure 23 and Figure 27]. Elk herd units include all lands within
Helena NF boundaries, public and private and adjacent land out to 1.5 miles beyond the
boundary (mostly private holdings, but some BLM and State land) [see Figure 27, following].
This extension delineates an off-Forest area used by elk that remain dependent on the National
Forest throughout the winter (often returning to the Forest to bed after foraging in off-Forest
grasslands) [see appendix D of the wildlife specialist report]. The delineation eliminates areas
occupied by elk that move well away from the Forest for the duration of the winter. The only
area excluded from 1.5 mile extension occurs along the northeast edge of the Black Mountain–
Brooklyn Bridge EHU where the off-Forest zone extends into the City of Helena, an area
inhabited by deer, but not elk. EHUs are used to calculate compliance with Forest Plan big game
standards 2, 3 and 4a (HFP, pp. II/17-18).
Current EHUs in the Divide landscape were delineated in 2003 by Helena NF and MFWP
biologists and modified in 2007, 2008 and 2011. Three modifications were made: (1) the
addition of the 1.5 mile zone beyond the Forest boundary to better represent the influence of
Forest management on wintering elk; (2) extension of the Greenhorn EHU boundary well
beyond the 1.5 mile limit to reflect known movements of MFWP radio-collared elk and (3) the
merging of the Spotted Dog and Little Blackfoot herd units into a single unit to better reflect
how elk groups intermingle in that area in summer and fall.

WILDLIFE - 311

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Herd units are designed to encompass areas occupied by relatively cohesive groups of elk on the
National Forest. The delineations are imperfect, however, for a number of reasons: (1) herd
units are mapped as discrete areas, whereas elk herd home ranges often overlap; (2) mapped
herd unit boundaries are fixed, whereas elk ranges on the ground may be fluid from one year to
another; (3) some groups of elk within a herd may occupy one mapped herd unit in summer and
another in winter; (4) the delineation of what constitutes a unified “elk herd”, “herd unit” or
“herd group” is often difficult to pin down and mapped herd units may differ in size and pattern
depending on the idiosyncrasies of the mapper and the quality of the field data; (5) yearlong elk
ranges often run well beyond National Forest boundaries and for purposes of analyzing the
impacts of Forest management, herd unit boundaries need to be cut off at some point near the
Forest boundary, often well short of where elk may actually go in some winters.
Given these circumstances, a case can be made for using terms such as “elk analysis unit” or “elk
analysis area” to identify the fixed, discrete areas that the Helena NF has mapped out for
purposes of assessing elk habitat and reserving the term “elk herd unit” to describe the dynamic
groupings of elk that management agency biologists have identified through long-term field
observation. For the time being, however, in order to maintain a certain consistency, I will
continue to apply the term “elk herd units” to these Helena NF elk assessment areas.
In the Divide landscape, most EHU boundaries have been drawn along primary drainage
bottoms so that the EHUs encompass cohesive summer ranges at higher elevation. Before
2003, most herd unit boundaries had followed major ridgelines, thus splitting the areas used by
elk herd groups in summer. In winter, elk that have spent the summer in a given herd unit on
the National Forest may diverge onto two or more non-Forest winter ranges, where they mingle
with elk that have summered on other herd units (G. Joslin, pers. comm. 2003). Summer range
centered units thus seemed a more accurate characterization of elk activity on Helena NF
ground.
Current herd units in the Divide landscape are quite large compared to those used prior to 2003
and those in use on several other Forests in Region 1. Pre-2003 Divide herd units were the size
of timber compartments, roughly 4,000 to 12,000 acres, whereas present-day Divide units range
from around 35,000 acres to 87,000 acres (Table 88). This brings them into line with herd units
in the Elkhorn and Big Belt landscapes. These units may encompass the ranges of two or more
smaller elk “herd groups”. Because the movements of these smaller groups on summer and
transitional ranges may be difficult to map with any consistency from year to year (without radio
telemetry data), the larger, stable units make more sense for habitat analysis.
The Travel Plan Area takes in parts of six elk herd units in the Divide landscape: The Plan Area
does not include the 1.5 mile extension beyond Helena NF boundaries or National Forest land
covered by previous travel planning efforts. These include the Clancy-Unionville area (much of
the Quartz and Black Mountain – Brooklyn Bridge EHUs) and most of the upper Little Prickly
Pear drainage (half of the Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU). Forest Plan compliance, however, is
calculated for entire elk herd units, not just on the portions that fall within the Travel Plan Area.
In Table 90, “Total Acres in EHU” includes all public and private land within administrative
boundaries of the Helena NF plus the 1.5 mile extension onto non-Forest land. The category
“EHU Acres within Helena NF Administrative Boundaries” is larger than “Total Acres of Helena
NF land within EHU” due to non-Forest inholdings inside the administrative boundary. The
arrangement of elk herd units in the Divide landscape is shown on the map in Figure 23, which

shows the on-Forest portion of the six units but not the 1.5 mile extension beyond the Forest
boundary. The herd units are shown in their entirety in Figure 27.

LITTLE PRICKLY PEAR–OPHIR Elk Herd Unit
The Little Prickly Pear–Ophir Creek EHU straddles the Continental Divide south of the Helena/
Lincoln RD boundary. It covers the upper reaches of the Little Prickly Pear Creek watershed east
of the Divide and the headwaters of the greater Dog Creek and Ophir Creek drainages west of
the Divide. Prior to 2003, the Helena NF recognized two herd units in this area (“Ophir” west of
the Divide and “Little Prickly Pear” east of it). Regular movement of elk across the Divide in
summer and fall, led MFWP to suggest merging the two units in 2003. The resulting Ophir–Little
Prickly Pear EHU is now the largest in the Divide landscape at 87,022 acres. About 37,300 acres
(43 percent) of the EHU are in private or other non-Forest ownership.
Much of the northern half of the unit (mostly east of the Divide) is in unroaded country that
abuts the Nevada Creek Roadless area on the Lincoln District to the northwest. As a result, elk
security in this half of the unit is good. Hunters are aware of the high fall elk density in this
roadless country and a substantial number of them push into the area on foot or horseback
during both the bow and rifle seasons and with a certain degree of success. This is the kind of
area that MFWP feels is producing a “high-quality hunting experience”. Security west of the
Divide (the southern half of the herd unit), however, is impaired. Open roads are ubiquitous,
particularly in the Dog Creek drainage and there are no unroaded habitat patches large enough
to qualify even as intermittent refuge areas. Shortly after the start of the rifle season, elk in this
area retreat to a limited number of small enclaves, the largest being in unroaded country south
and west of Black Mountain. Overall, 23 percent of the area within Helena NF boundaries in the
Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU is occupied by effective elk security areas (Table 89, Table 91). Elk
do make use of a number of smaller unroaded enclaves for temporary refuge, in particular, in
forested sites around Esmeralda Hill, LaSalle Gulch, Cellar and Ogilve Gulches and Spring Gulch.
Summer habitat effectiveness (based on open road/ motor trail density) shows a similar pattern:
very high in the Little Prickly Pear watershed east of the Divide, considerably lower west of the
Divide. Overall habitat effectiveness for the entire EHU (including the 1.5 mile off-Forest
extension) is 54 percent, above the recommended minimum of 50 percent. The non-motorized
portion of the Little Prickly Pear watershed is particularly effective as summer habitat. One of
the only “large” burns to have occurred in the Divide landscape in the past few decades is
located here in Beartrap Gulch and the South Fork of Little Prickly Pear Creek. It dates from the
1960s and while it retains few snags, it provides excellent summer foraging opportunities for
WILDLIFE - 313

Environmental Impact Statement

elk. Mule Deer, black bears and grizzly bears also make use of the burn in summer. GIS
modeling estimates that 60 percent of the EHU provides hiding cover (Table 91).
Bona-fide winter range [see the Helena NF Oil and Gas Leasing EIS (USFS, USFWS 1995)] is
limited to the northern end of the EHU around Cayuse Ridge and Ogilve Gulch and to private
ranchlands in the broad valleys of Little Prickly Pear Creek and its tributaries to the east. Elk
utilize the Helena NF portion of the “winter range” primarily as transitional range in spring and
fall but may remain through part of the winter if snow conditions allow.

GREENHORN Elk Herd Unit
The Greenhorn EHU lies astride the Continental Divide. Roughly 80 percent of it is on the east
side of the Divide in the upper Tenmile and Silver Creek drainages. The west side is drained by
tributaries of Dog Creek. The EHU encompasses MacDonald, Priest and Mullan Passes, all
primary cross-over corridors for big game animals and humans. Although the EHU occupies
56,314 acres, approximately 36,400 acres (65 percent) are in private or other non-Forest
ownership. The acreage of National Forest land in this EHU is the smallest in the Divide
landscape. The extensive off-Forest acreage is a function of the eastern EHU boundary being
extended well beyond the normal 1.5 mile limit, based on MFWP radio-telemetry data from the
1990s [see Figure 27]. This data is not available for other herd units.
Most of the National Forest portion of the unit is at high elevation along the Divide and serves
as elk transitional range (mostly spring) and to a lesser extent as summer range. Although
summer habitat effectiveness, as indicated by open road density, is acceptable (55 percent),
elevated levels of human activity associated with the three passes (each with a primary road
running through) and widespread livestock grazing dilute summer use potential in some areas.
The unit supports broad grasslands along the Divide and down the west slope [Figure 10] and
elk graze through these areas conspicuously in spring before human use begin to escalate and
cattle arrive. GIS modeling estimates that hiding cover occupies about 56 percent of EHU
summer range. Summer range in this herd unit covers only about 54 percent of the unit,
another derivative of MFWP radio-telemetry data. Hiding cover on the unit as a whole is only 41
percent (Table 88, Table 91).
Effective elk security areas (greater than or equal to 1,000 acres) occupy only about seven
percent of the area within Helena NF boundaries, with the unroaded areas concentrated
between Greenhorn and Sweeney Creeks, around Greenhorn Mountain and in the upper Little
Porcupine drainage. Smaller, less effective security enclaves are situated in upper Greenhorn
Creek, upper Blue Cloud Creek, Rich Spur Gulch and around Priest Pass, among other sites. The
lower elevation segments of the herd unit east of the Divide between Sweeney and Greenhorn
Creeks provide some winter range, but most winter use occurs off the Forest on both sides of
the Divide.

SPOTTED DOG–LITTLE BLACKFOOT Elk Herd Unit
The Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot EHU is a complex unit. It is situated west of the Continental
Divide in the upper Little Blackfoot watershed and occupies a large area between Telegraph
Creek to the east and the Helena NF boundary area to the west. It includes the headwaters of
the Little Blackfoot River (the Electric Peak Roadless Area), which covers about 28,000 acres in
the southern part of the unit [Figure 12]. The herd unit was formed in 2011 by merging two
smaller units (the Spotted Dog and Little Blackfoot EHUs) because of the tendency of elk herd

WILDLIFE - 314

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

groups to move between the two areas in summer and fall. It is now the second largest herd
unit in the Divide landscape with 82,314 acres of public and private land.
Currently, 31 percent of the herd unit is in non-Forest ownership. About 5,750 acres are in
private inholdings on the National Forest and another 20,075 acres in private and State
ownership in the 1.5 mile extension beyond the Forest boundary (most of it private). The
western part of the herd unit extends into the 38,000 acre Spotted Dog Wildlife Management
Area (WMA) established by the State of Montana in 2010 following the purchase of a large
private holding. In addition to the 1.5 mile herd unit extension into the WMA, another 3,700
acres of newly acquired State land within the Helena NF boundary is also part of the
management area. Most of the old road system in the WMA is off-limits to public vehicle traffic
yearlong and this contributes to the quality of big game security and habitat effectiveness in the
herd unit.
MFWP seasonal range maps identify the eastern quarter of the EHU, the broad grasslands atop
Baldy Ridge and the ridges south of Elliston, as potential winter range [Figure 39]. However,
MFWP aerial surveys (late winter or early spring) over the last 15 years, Helena NF field
observations and relocations of radio collared elk (1983 to 1997) demonstrate that these sites
are being used as spring/fall transitional range and as summer range, but not as wintering areas.
Aside from the presence of a few isolated individuals early and late in the season, there is no
evidence of winter use. Virtually all true winter range associated with this herd unit occurs off
the National Forest on private and State land to the west and north [Figure 21] where winter
foraging habitat is extensive and not limiting (at least under current circumstances) [see the
discussion of elk winter range in the “Environmental Consequences” section].
Most of the Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot herd unit functions as elk summer range. In the west
half of the unit, the best habitat is concentrated around the heads of stream tributaries, which
drain the area in all directions. The east half of the EHU includes much of the headwaters of the
Little Blackfoot River and greater Telegraph Creek, virtually all of it summer range for elk, mule
deer, moose, black bears, lynx, coyotes, mountain lions and others. It is amply forested, most
typically by mature lodgepole pine that originated with stand replacing fires around 1900. Much
of the forest canopy in these stands is now dead from bark beetle infestation, although stands
dominated by smaller diameter trees often manage to resist the beetle [Figure 24]. Productive
wet habitat occupies the headwaters of the unit’s multifarious streams, but large wet meadows
are limited, some of the most conspicuous being located in upper Bison and Ontario Creeks
[Figure 20], around Slate Lake [Figure 54] and at Blackfoot Meadows near the origin of the
Little Blackfoot.
There has been considerable timber harvest around Treasure Mountain and along Ontario and
Telegraph Creeks, as well as in the upper Spotted Dog drainage to the west, all with attendant
road systems. But, because of the extent of the Roadless Area, overall habitat effectiveness is
sufficient (56 percent). Habitat effectiveness in the Roadless Area (including that in the
extensive unroaded country to the immediate south on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF) is 100
percent. GIS modeling estimates that 65 percent of the EHU provides hiding cover (Table 89,
Table 91), although this percentage is beginning to decline as beetle-killed lodgepole pine comes
down over thousands of acres. This lost cover will be replaced eventually by natural
regeneration of the pine forests, but it is a process that will take 20 to 30 years to run its course.
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks biologists recognize the Spotted Dog and upper Little Blackfoot
country on the Helena NF, along with adjacent private and State land to the west (much of it in

WILDLIFE - 315

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

the Spotted Dog Wildlife Management Area), as a fertile area for elk [the northern part of
Hunting District 215]. Winter surveys in the last decade have typically 400 to 500 elk west of the
National Forest in this region (R. Vinkey, personal communication, 2005 to 2008). Surveys from
2010 to 2014 have counted over 1,000 elk in this area (MFWP Elk Surveys in HD 215, 2010 to
2014).
The Spotted Dog – Little Blackfoot EHU affords excellent security for elk through as much of the
hunting season as snow conditions allow. Currently, effective elk security areas occupy 29
percent of fall elk range, the most of any herd unit in the Divide landscape. The combination of
security and intermittent refuge areas comes to 33 percent. The largest block of security is
associated with the Electric Peak Roadless Area in the southern half of the unit [Figure 24].
Most problems with elk security involve lower elevation security habitat that comes into play
after elk have been forced out of higher elevation roadless areas by snow and deteriorating
forage later in the hunting season. Cover and road density is at issue in the Negro Mountain,
Treasure Mountain, lower Telegraph Creek and Spotted Dog Creek areas [see local area
assessments in “Local Effects in Key Areas” toward the end of this report].
In addition to taking advantage of security habitat on the National Forest, many elk, beginning in
September, drop down into the Wildlife Management Area immediately west of the Forest.
Until recently, most of this land (about 27,000 acres) was owned by the Rock Creek Ranch
Corporation and MFWP had identified it as a problem area because of the refuge it provided for
substantial numbers of elk on ground where public hunting was highly restricted [Montana Elk
Management Plan (2004), Deerlodge EMU]. In September 2010, the State was able to purchase
a large portion of the private holdings and establish the Wildlife Management Area. The area is
open to public hunting, but with limitations (the main restraint being that most of the area is
closed to motor vehicles) [see summary in the Helena Independent Record, Oct. 21, 2010; MFWP
website http://fwp.mt.gov/news/article].
I have no harvest data specific to the Wildlife Management Area for the 2010 to 2014 seasons,
but it seems likely that from now on, hunting-generated mortality in this elk herd will be a bit
higher than in the past. Still, the fact that the Wildlife Management Area is mostly nonmotorized allows it to function much like an elk security area on the National Forest.

JERICHO Elk Herd Unit
The Jericho Mountain EHU lies south of U.S. Highway 12, extending westward from Tenmile
Creek over the Continental Divide to Telegraph Creek. It includes private land in the valleys off
its northern edge and encompasses a total of 35,345 acres, 29,364 acres within Helena NF
administrative boundaries. Aside from the valleylands to the north, most private land in the
EHU is on old mining claims, including part of the town of Rimini. Approximately 33 percent of
the EHU is in private ownership. Much of the northern half of the herd unit is occupied by the
9,440-acre Jericho Mountain inventoried Roadless Area, located primarily on the east side of the
Divide in the Tenmile Creek watershed, but lapping westward into the Telegraph Creek drainage
in the vicinity of Mike Renig Gulch in the north and Jericho Mountain in the south. This largely
unroaded habitat block provides most of the fall elk security in the Jericho EHU.
Some of the montane grasslands in the northern end of the unit above Lazyman and Mike Renig
Gulches provide winter habitat for elk in most years. These areas are identified as such on both
the MFWP seasonal range map and the Helena NF “Oil and Gas” winter range map. The rest of
the unit is transitional and summer range, with viable summer habitat concentrated in the
southern half toward the headwaters of Tenmile and Telegraph Creeks and their tributaries.

Divide Travel Plan

Most of the herd unit is covered with mature forest (much of it deteriorating from mountain
pine beetle infestation). Upland grasslands occur in the northern end of the unit and at a few
locations along the Divide (as at Bullion Parks). Wet meadows also break the forest continuum
in some areas: those in Flume Gulch, Sure Thing Swamps and Sally Ann Creek are particularly
productive as summer wildlife habitat [Figure 8, Figure 20, Figure 49].
Extensive clearcutting (mostly in the 1970s and 1980s) in the greater Hahn Creek and upper
Telegraph Creek drainages west of the Divide also serves to disrupt the contiguity of the mature
forest. Cutting units are now dominated by regenerating conifer saplings (mostly lodgepole pine
and Douglas-fir), many of which provide hiding cover for big game animals and habitat for
snowshoe hares and the lynx that prey upon them [Figure 51, Figure 52]. Lynx are resident in
this area year-round, as are wolverines. The Tenmile drainage, east of the Divide, serves as part
of the water supply for the City of Helena and as a result, has seen very limited timber harvest
on public land over the past several decades. Forest cover is ubiquitous, but as with other areas
in the Divide landscape that are dominated by pine forests, mountain pine beetle infestation is
taking out a majority of the overstory trees.
Historic logging (dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries) and mining have generated
far-flung road systems, some still open to vehicle use, others closed. Habitat effectiveness in
summer is now at 70 percent, which is quite good (Table 91). GIS modeling estimates that 73
percent of the EHU provides hiding cover, a percentage that is beginning to decline as pine
beetle mortality escalates. About 12 percent of Helena NF hunting season elk range is currently
in security areas, much of it associated with the Jericho Mountain Roadless Area. When
intermittent refuge areas areas are added in, security rises to around 15 percent. Because the
herd unit is relatively close to the city of Helena and other local population centers, fall hunting
pressure is fairly high.

BLACK MOUNTAIN – BROOKLYN BRIDGE Elk Herd Unit
Less than half of the Black Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge EHU lies within the Divide Travel Plan
Area: The rest is in the Clancy-Unionville Travel Plan Area to the east [Figure 27]. The EHU as a
whole covers 53,840 acres. Roughly 40 percent is in private ownership, much of it along Forest
boundaries in the Little Prickly Pear and Tenmilevalleys to the north and east. There are, in
addition, a couple arrays of interconnected private inholdings in the major gulches running
northward into Helena and in the greater Buffalo Creek drainage further south.
This herd unit supports a variety of summer, winter and transitional ranges. About 85 percent
of the unit is mapped as potential winter range (by both MFWP and the Helena NF), more than
any other EHU in the Divide landscape, but most elk winter use is confined to the northern half
of the unit toward Helena and the Tenmile Valley [and outside the Divide Travel Plan Area]. The
rest of the unit to the south sees most of its elk use from May through November. Most of the
northwest half of the EHU lies within the Lazyman Inventoried Roadless Area, which provides
excellent habitat for elk in spring, summer and fall [see Figure 26]. By contrast, the eastern half
of the unit sits adjacent to the City of Helena and to burgeoning rural settlement in the lower
Tenmile and Prickly Pear valleys. As a consequence, the road and trail systems in this area are
the most heavily used of any in the National Forest. The eastern and western halves of the unit
thus stand in stark contrast to one another in terms of human activity levels.
Given the influence of the Roadless Area, which occupies more than half the National Forest
land in the herd unit, summer range habitat effectiveness in the Black Mountain–Brooklyn
Bridge EHU is the highest in the Divide landscape at 65 percent (Table 91). This has been
WILDLIFE - 317

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

augmented in the east half of the unit by new road/motor trail closures under the ClancyUnionville Travel Management Plan (Helena NF 2003). The area centered on Black Hall
Meadows in the Roadless Area is particularly important as summer habitat. The proportion of
fall range in effective elk security areas is 16 percent in the EHU as a whole (Table 89 and Table
91). The combined contribution of security and intermittent refuge areas is 18 percent. All
security and refuge areas (greather than or equal to 250 acres) are situated in the western half
of the herd unit (within the Divide Travel Plan Area), accounting for nearly 50 percent of that
area. This is important because the area’s proximity to Helena consistently translates to high
hunting pressure each fall. GIS modeling estimates that 57 percent of the EHU provides hiding
cover, although cover levels are on the verge of declining as beetle-killed pine trees continue to
come down.

QUARTZ Elk Herd Unit
The Quartz Creek EHU lies mostly within the Clancy-Unionville Travel Plan Area, but its western
extremities around Red Mountain fall into the Divide Travel Plan Area [Figure 27]. The unit
encompasses the headwaters of several drainages flowing eastward into Prickly Pear Creek:
Corral Gulch, Lump Gulch, the North and South Forks of Quartz Creek, Clancy Creek, Kady Gulch,
Wood Chute Creek and Spring Gulch. The diminutive western segment of the herd unit in the
Divide Plan Area takes in the westward slope down to Tenmile and Banner Creeks, including the
country around Chessman Reservoir and Red Mountain. The EHU includes much private and
BLM land in the Prickly Pear valley to the east: Just over 50 percent of the herd unit is in nonForest ownership. The unit covers 36,733 acres, with 23,036 acres inside Helena NF boundaries,
making it one of the two smallest herd units in the Divide landscape.
Most of the Quartz Creek EHU serves as transitional and summer range for elk. Typically, the
drainage-head basins in the western half of the unit provide the basic summering areas. Some
of this habitat has been disrupted by timber harvest and roading and more significantly, by old
mining operations that have polluted wet meadows and other key summer habitats. These
contaminated sites are gradually being reclaimed, one by one, with mine wastes hauled to offsite repositories and the local habitats returning to a semblance of normalcy. Recent closures of
a number of roads and motor trails under the Clancy-Unionville Travel Management Plan have
improved habitat effectiveness in this area as well. Current summer habitat effectiveness is 75
percent, comfortably above the recommended level of 50 percent. The main contribution of the
Clancy-Unionville restrictions has been the elimination of motor routes into a number of key
wet sites important to elk and other wildlife species.
Because of the fairly even distribution of roads throughout the herd unit, Clancy-Unionville
travel restrictions have been less effective at producing viable elk security areas. Currently,
there are no unroaded blocks large enough to qualify as elk security areas (greater than or equal
to 1,000 acres), but there are two intermittent refuge areas (Little Corral Gulch and Roe Gulch).
Elk survive the hunting season by moving between numerous smaller unroaded habitat enclaves
and taking advantage of private lands east of the EHU where public hunting is barred or limited.
Public lands in this herd unit are readily accessible to nearby population centers in the Helena
and Prickly Pear Valleys and hunting pressure is substantial. GIS modeling estimates that 57
percent of the EHU currently provides hiding cover, although pine beetle-generated mortality
will reduce cover dramatically in the next 10 to 15 years.
MFWP has mapped over 80 percent of the herd unit as potential winter range. The Helena NF
“Oil and Gas” seasonal range maps, on the other hand, show only the northeastern 20 percent

WILDLIFE - 318

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

of Helena NF land within the unit as winter range, which, as it turns out, is where more than 95
percent of the on Forest winter elk use in this herd unit has been observed over the last 25
years. This is the area between Corral Gulch to the north and Quartz Creek to the south. The
majority of the winter elk use occurs in the foothills and valleylands east of the Helena NF
boundary.

Summary of EHU Habitat Parameters

Table 91 summarizes the current status of several key parameters used to assess elk habitat in
elk herd units. Three parameters, percent hiding cover on summer range, percent thermal
cover on winter range and percent of fall range in security areas, are Helena Forest Plan big
game standards. The remaining parameters, hunting season open route density and percent
habitat effectiveness on summer range, are not Forest Plan standards, but they are recognized
as useful indictors of elk habitat status. The measurements in Table 91 are for entire Elk Herd
Units, not just the portions of the units that fall within the Divide Travel Plan Area.

Currently, only one herd unit (Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot) is close to the Hillis
recommendation of 30 percent security for “westside” fall ranges and none approaches the
Blackfoot/Divide goal of 50 percent. All of these EHUs will comply with the new Programmatic
Amendment for big game as long as security is maintained at current levels or increases. Under
current circumstances, these security levels are allowing MFWP to meet its elk population
objectives in areas influenced by Divide elk herd units [see following discussion, “Local Elk
Populations” ]. All five of the EHUs that include winter range are out of compliance with the
HFP thermal cover standard (greater than or equal to 25 percent cover on winter range). All six
herd units comply with the summer range hiding cover standard (greater than or equal to 50
percent cover on summer range), but within the next 10 to 15 years as large numbers of
lodgepole, ponderosa and whitebark pine trees killed in the bark beetle outbreak begin to fall,
all of these units will eventually fail to comply with this standard. Although many standing trees
are now dead, they continue to provide essentially the same level of hiding cover as when they
were alive. Eventually (greater than 25 years), new hiding cover will be provided by
regenerating pine saplings in most beetle-impacted areas. But for now, the situation is in flux.

Divide Travel Plan

Local Elk Populations
Elk Management Units

The Divide Travel Plan Area falls within two of the Elk Management Units (EMUs) described in
the Montana Elk Management Plan (2004): the northern half of the Plan Area lies within the
Granite Butte EMU and the southern half within the Deerlodge EMU. Both EMUs straddle the
Continental Divide. The Granite Butte EMU takes in Hunting Districts 293 and 343 north of U.S.
Highway 12 (in addition to others further north); the Deerlodge EMU takes in Hunting Districts
215 and 335 south of Highway 12 (in addition to others southward toward Butte).
The population objective for the Granite Butte EMU is 2,100 elk. In 2004 when the Montana Elk
Management Plan was released, MFWP estimated the population to be just below the objective
(based on aerial winter range surveys). Today, aerial surveys indicate that it is somewhat above
the objective. Bull/cow ratios in the southern part of the EMU that take in the Divide Travel
Plan Area are close to the objective of 10 bulls/100 cows (a bit below the objective in HD 293,
somewhat above it in HD 343).

The population objective for the Deerlodge EMU is 2,100 elk. In 2004, MFWP estimated that
numbers were a bit below this level (at around 1,875 elk). The numbers have risen in the last
seven years. Elk populations are now near or above objectives in the northern half of the EMU
(which includes the Divide Travel Plan Area), but they are still below objectives in the southern
portion of the EMU toward Butte. As well, bull/cow ratios in the northern half of the EMU have
been holding at around 12 to 13 bulls/100 cows in recent years, above the 10 bulls/100 cows
objective.

Coordinating Helena NF and MFWP Elk Management

Helena Forest Plan standards and guidelines for big game are designed to maintain habitat
conditions on the National Forest that help MFWP meet its goals for local elk populations.
MFWP’s primary tool in managing elk is the manipulation of hunting regulations (setting harvest
quotas for different sex/age classes, defining hunting areas, setting seasons, arranging for block
management on private lands and so on). The Forest Service is able to influence the equation
by managing vegetation (cover and forage) and controlling hunter vehicle access on different
parts of the Forest. In spite of this reasonably well-defined division of responsibility, there
remain some knotty problems in coordinating management between agencies.
For one, the quality of aerial survey data on which MFWP bases much of its annual population
estimates can vary widely from year to year and from one hunting district to another. This is a
function of weather conditions, snow cover, variable elk movement patterns and inherent
viewing difficulty imposed by local topography, forest vegetation and artificial obstructions
(most often, powerlines). The survey data (along with harvest statistics) are central to
determining what adjustments the Fish and Game Commission needs to make to hunting
regulations each year. Trends in this data over time also suggest what the Helena NF needs to
consider in terms of cover distribution and vehicle restrictions on its road and trail system.
Changes to these components, particularly forest cover, are difficult, if not impossible to make
on a year-to-year basis in an attempt to follow abrupt yearly shifts in MFWP survey results; but
they certain management changes can adapt to obvious long-term trends .
Another problem stems from the disconnect between the scale of analysis units. MFWP sets its
elk population objectives for elk management units (EMUs) and hunting districts (HDs). In this

WILDLIFE - 320

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

area, EMUs are roughly 700,000 acres in size [Deerlodge EMU ≈ 695,000 acres; Granite Butte
EMU ≈ 712,600 acres]. Both EMUs cover three standard hunting districts, which vary
considerably in size, but average about 235,000 acres. MFWP centers its annual population
estimates and consequent tweaking of hunting regulations on hunting districts.
The Helena NF, on the other hand, focuses its habitat management on elk herd units (EHUs),
which in the Divide landscape may be as small as 35,000 acres, but average a bit less than
60,000 acres [Table 89]. The problem, then, is one of determining how conditions in a given elk
herd unit contribute to the population status of elk on a hunting district three to eight times its
size and to the population objectives for an elk management unit eight to 20 times its size, given
the multifarious conditions in other herd units and private land operations that feed into the
scenario.
In many cases, it is possible to scrutinize the MFWP flight data and divide hunting districts into
distinct segments in terms of how local elk populations fare in each area. In HD 293, for
example, elk herds in the northern half of the district, which is centered on the Big Blackfoot
River Valley, are beset by high rates of natural predation and consequent shifts in population
structure that are not characteristic of elk groups in the southern half of the district. Wherever
it has been possible to partition hunting districts into smaller sub-areas based on elk population
properties, I have done so, in order to provide a better match between MFWP and Helena NF
management units and to potentially tease out some correlations between population dynamics
and habitat status of elk herd units.

Hunting Districts
This section summarizes the status of the four hunting districts in the Granite Butte and
Deerlodge EMUs that cover the Divide Travel Plan area. A map illustrating how these districts
overlap the Divide Travel Plan Area are shown in Figure 27. Key elk population parameters for
each district are summarized in Table 92 and Table 93 following the hunting district narratives.

units account forjust over 15 percent of the hunting district, which extends westward across

Divide Travel Plan

In the early 1990s, aerial surveys often revealed more than 1,000 elk on HD 293 winter ranges.
MFWP responded in 1994 by increasing antlerless elk hunting permits from 250 to 450. The
antlerless elk harvest spiked dramatically in that year (to about 500) but then began falling: It
averaged 121 antlerless elk between 2000 and 2009 [see Elk Survey and Harvest Data for
Blackfoot Hunting Districts, 1986 to 2010]. After 1996, there was a dramatic drop-off in the
annual winter range population count (from 1,087 elk in 1996 to 387 elk in 1997). And since
then, trends in the elk population have been somewhat difficult to decipher, primarily because
aerial surveys have been erratic, sometimes done in spring, often when visibility was limited by
unfavorable weather or ground conditions, sometimes on only part of the district and
sometimes not at all [see MFWP Elk Surveys, HD 293, 1998-2010; Elk Survey and Harvest Data
for Blackfoot Hunting Districts, 1986-2010]. The average count for HD 293 from 1999 through
2010 (on years when the entire district was surveyed) is 554 elk. The most recent available
count for the district (2013) is 609 elk.
The population objective for HD 293 in the 2004 Elk Management Plan is 750 elk, but the
northwest segment of the district was transferred to HD 298 (a new district) in 2008, so that
now there is a bit of a disconnect between the original population objective and what is possible
under the new configuration. Average ratios of 14 bulls/100 cows from 1999 through 2009
were above hunting district objectives of 10/100. During the same period, calf/cow ratios were
typical of hunting districts in this area, averaging 38 calves/100 cows, comfortably above the
expected norm of around 30 to 35 calves/100 cows.
In the last five years, the number of elk counted during aerial surveys for the hunting district as
a whole (495 to 609 elk) has remained in the same general range as in previous years (back to
1997). But, in the northern half of Hunting District 293 (the Blackfoot River Valley) the number
of animals observed by MFWP biologists on the ground and by local hunters and landowners has
declined noticeably. Likewise, while calf/cow ratios during this same period have remained
relatively stable for the district as a whole (averaging 31 calves/100 cows), calf survival in the
Blackfoot Valley has plummeted. Much of the decline has been attributed to rising predation
from mountain lions, wolves, black bears and grizzly bears, whose populations have all
burgeoned at the same time, due to a variety of circumstances [J. Kolbe, quoted in the Helena
Independent Record, Feb. 26, 2012]. Other factors, including several years of drought, changes
in vegetation patterns from large fires and hunting quotas over the last decade, may be
contributing to the observed shifts in elk (and deer) population size and structure. But
predation appears to be the primary limiting factor in the northern half of HD 293.
Meanwhile, in the south half of the district (the Avon Valley south of the Ogden Mtn–Dalton
Mtn ridge), predation has not been an obvious problem for big game populations. Population
estimates for this part of the district were in the range of 300 to 450 elk from 1998 through
2003. Some recent counts (2004, 2005) have been in the 180 to 190 range. These numbers may
reflect temporary population decline due to over-harvest or the fact that surveys were
conducted after many elk had already migrated off winter ranges (late April). More likely, they
reflect a seasonal shift in elk distribution [see HD 293 Elk Surveys, 2004, 2005]. Biologists have
noted that in some years, elk from HD 293 have moved eastward into HD 343 to escape lateseason hunting pressure (extending into January) and occasionally to move to less severe snow
conditions [see comments accompanying MFWP Elk Surveys, HD 343, 2007]. By 2006, counts for
the southern half of HD 293 were once again over 300 elk. In 2010, 311 elk were counted.
In the end, MFWP objectives for elk populations (herd numbers, bull/cow ratios, calf survival)
continue to be met in the southern half of the HD 293, the area influenced by the Helena NF

WILDLIFE - 323

Environmental Impact Statement

road and trail network in the Divide landscape. Problems in the Blackfoot Valley in the north
half of the district appear to be primarily a consequence of abnormally high rates of predation
and not a result of habitat dysfunction on that part of the National Forest (the Blackfoot
landscape).

Hunting District 215
Hunting District 215 covers a large area west of the Continental Divide and south of U.S.
Highway 12. A majority of the district lies south of the Helena NF on the BeaverheadDeeerlodge NF toward Butte. The northern 45 percent of the district covers the southwest
quadrant of the Divide Travel Plan Area (118 mi²), including the entire Spotted Dog-Little
Blackfoot EHU and the western half of the Jericho Mountain EHU [Figure 27]. It also takes in a
broad region of the private and state lands northeast of Deerlodge (142 mi²). This region of
rolling hills and valley lands provides virtually all of the winter range for elk in this area. MFWP
considers the northern part of HD 215 to be a key area for elk. An average of 67 percent of the
elk in the hunting district have been counted on these northern winter ranges since 2000 and
the population has been increasing steadily since around 2005.
Table 92 and Table 93 summarize some of the data from MFWP aerial surveys of elk winter
range in HD 215 since 1999. Winter range counts are usually conducted sometime between late
January and mid-March (depending on weather conditions and plane availability). Occasionally,
spring surveys have been conducted instead of or in addition to the winter counts. Spring
surveys are typically run in late April and early May and find most of the elk in the open
mountain grasslands on the western and northern edges of the southern Divide landscape on or
near Helena NF ground.
Prior to 2007, MFWP had been counting roughly 800 to 950 elk on HD 215 winter ranges in most
years. This number jumped to 1,365 animals in 2008, to over 1,700 in 2009 and to over 2,000 by
2011. In 2013, nearly 2,500 elk were counted on HD 215 winter ranges. Approximately 67
percent of elk observations have been in the northern half of the district (the portion
encompassed by the Divide Travel Plan Area). These numbers are well above the population
objective of 1,400 elk in this district (the original Elk Plan objective of 1,000 elk having been
raised to 1,400 in 2010).
Observed bull/cow ratios, on the other hand, have been erratic and often low. The average
ratio over the last 15 years has been just over 12 bulls/100 cows (the objective being a minimum
of 10 bulls/100 cows), but in some years the counts have been as low as five or six bulls/100
cows. The 2013 count was right on the 15 year average [Table 92]. The percentage of mature
bulls in the population, however, has decreased in recent years, with bulls older than 1.5 years
accounting for only about two percent of the population in 2012 and 2013. This is an indication
of hunting pressure too heavy for the available security on fall range. Overall bull numbers have
remained adequate only because of a profusion of raghorns and spike bulls [2012, 2013 Elk
Surveys in HD 215; R. Vinkey, personal communication 2014].
Table 92 also shows that calf numbers are down in the last two years, usually an indication of
disruptive weather, poor adult nutrition, or heavy predation. Currently the reason for the dropoff in calf production/survival is unknown, but there has been no sign of an increase in
predation pressure in this area. A number of wolf packs have centered their activity along the
western edge of the Helena NF and in the adjacent ranchlands since 1995, but until 2012,
calf/cow ratios remained in the range of 30 to 40 calves/100 cows year after year (and the
overall population continued to increase). With the removal of wolves from the Endangered

WILDLIFE - 324

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Species List and the advent of the State wolf hunting season in 2010, the ability of wolves to
impact livestock and big game populations in this area has been minimal. Wolves attacking
livestock have been dispatched quickly and there has been no evidence of their having built up
sufficient strength to measurably affect the local elk population. So, something else is at work
here.
Security areas available to elk in the northern part of HD 215 cover a substantial amount of
ground (accounting for 30 percent of the Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot EHU). The largest block of
security (nearly 19,000 acres) is associated with the Electric Peak Roadless Area in the southwest
corner of the Divide landscape. The problem for local elk is that, because of its elevation and
topographic position, much of this area becomes unavailable to them during part of the hunting
season as snow builds up and the forage base shrinks. This is true for most of the other security
areas in this part of the Forest as well. How long elk are able to remain in National Forest
security areas depends on fall weather in any given year, but often they are forced down into
transitional and winter ranges on the edge of the Forest and on private/State lands where
hunting season security can be marginal.
Until recently, elk moving off the Forest to the west had been able to settle in a large block of
private ranchland in the Spotted Dog country, which was been off-limits to public hunting. Elk
began moving to this winter range area as early as the start of the bow season in September.
The move may be a direct response to pressure from bow hunters and motorized recreation on
the Forest, but it may also reflect an established pattern of migration down to secure and
benign valley habitat regardless of other circumstances. MFWP felt that the refuge provided by
this private land suppressed hunting opportunity and allowed the elk population to maintain
itself well in excess of Motana Elk Management Plan objectives (although mature bull numbers
remained low) [MFWP 2004a]. In August 2010, the State was able to purchase most of this land
and convert it to a Wildlife Mangement Area. Public hunting is now allowed, but most of the
area is off-limits to motor vehicles, which tempers the effect.
In spite of the change in ownership and management, elk continue to move to this off Forest
area and recent population trends in HD 215 still hold. In response, the Fish and Game
Commission increased the number of B-licenses for cow elk in this district in from 150 in 2008 to
200 in 2011 and 400 in 2012. Nonetheless the upward population trend continues. At the same
time, mature bull numbers remain very low and in spite of the burgeoning cow population, calf
numbers over the past three years have dropped to half of what had been the norm for over a
decade.

Hunting District 343
Hunting District 343 lies east of the Continental Divide and north of U.S. Highway 12. It takes in
most of the Greenhorn EHU and the northeastern half of the Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU
(which is outside the Divide Travel Plan Area). These EHUs account for roughly ⅓ of the hunting
district. The rest of the district extends eastward off the Forest into the Helena and Little Prickly
Pear Valleys and northward to Flescher Pass on the Lincoln Ranger District.
Counts of the elk population in this district were relatively stable between 1999 and 2008,
ranging from 644 to 973 animals (average equals 787); but then they dropped into the 445 to
580 range in 2009 and 2010 [Table 92]. Given the absence of a commensurate increase in
hunter success and natural mortality (although mortality due to wolf kills has increased
somewhat over the last decade), or a drop in calf production and survival, MFWP suspects that
the lower winter counts reflected the switch to a less effective survey method and movement of

WILDLIFE - 325

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

elk off winter range prior to survey flights rather than a large population decline. The 2011
count was back up to 713 elk. This is well within the population objective for HD 343, which is
700 elk (plus or minus 20 percent equals 560 to 840 elk) [see 2011 Post-season Survey of Elk in
HD 343].
Bull/cow ratios have averaged 12.4 bulls/100 cows since 1999 (range equals 8 to 18), which is
considered a “moderate” ratio and is in excess of the hunting district objective of 10 bulls/100
cows [Table 93]. Calf/cow ratios have averaged 30.5 calves/100 cows since 1999, ranging from
16 in 2008 to 49 in 2011. This is typical of calf survival rates throughout the Divide Travel Plan
Area and suggests that natural predation has not been unduly suppressing calf survival in these
populations. Counts for 2013 and 2014 have been below average (around 19 calves/100 cows),
a pattern which has shown up in other local hunting districts as well [Table 93]. MFWP
biologists are uncertain as to what is driving this pattern, but the fact that it has been consistent
over a relatively broad area suggests that it is weather related.
In recent years, HD 343 has sometimes picked up elk from HD 293 to the west later in the year
because of extended hunting seasons in that district. Many elk in HD 343 seek refuge during the
hunting season on large blocks of private land where landowners do not allow public hunting.
Of the large landowners in the district, five allow hunting, five do not. With private lands
accounting for 52 percent of the district, this has a real impact on hunting success, which has
been relatively low (about 40 percent on antlerless permits) in recent years. Statewide success
averages about 50 percent.

Hunting District 335
Hunting District 335 lies east of the Continental Divide and south of U.S. Highway 12. It
encompasses the Quartz EHU, the eastern half of the Jericho EHU and most of the Black
Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge EHU [Figure 27]. These Helena NF herd units make up the western
60 percent of the hunting district, the eastern reaches of which occupy BLM and private land in
the adjacent foothills and Prickly Pear Valley south of Helena.
MFWP winter range surveys showed the elk population increasing in the decade 1999 to 2008:
Population counts that averaged 510 elk earlier in the decade had risen into the 667 to 776
range by 2006 to 2008 [Table 92]. MFWP biologists felt that this was a function of mild winters,
increased travel restrictions in the Clancy-Unionville area of the Helena NF and fewer hunting
permits for antlerless elk (MFWP HD 335 Elk Survey 2005, 2007). In 2009 the number of elk
counted dropped to 450 and then to 388 in 2010. As in some other local districts, MFWP
believes that the lower counts were a function of a less effective survey method and of elk
having moved off winter range by the time surveys were conducted [see Post-season Survey of
Elk in HD 335 for 2010 and 2011]. There was no evidence of a sudden increase in hunter
success, elevated natural mortality, or decreased calf production/survival that might initiate a
downward trend in local elk numbers. In 2011, the elk count was back up to where it had been
prior to 2009: 670 elk were tallied, which is well within the population objective for HD 335
(600 elk plus or minus 20 percent). The most recent counts (2012 to 2014) have ranged from
827 to 1,187 elk, well above the objective.
Bull/cow ratios have been fairly consistent over the last decade, averaging 12.6 bulls/100 cows.
The 2011 count was the highest in the last 25 years at 19 bulls/100 cows. The objective for the
hunting district is a minimum of 10 bulls/100 cows [Table 93]. Brow-tined bulls, however, have
accounted for only about two percent of the count during this period (almost certainly an
underestimate, but lower than biologists would like to see). Calf/cow ratios have been more

WILDLIFE - 326

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

variable over the last 10 years, ranging from 15 calves/100 cows (2008) to 56 calves/100 cows
(2001). The 15-year average is 31.6 calves/100 cows, which is typical of hunting districts in the
Deerlodge and Granite Butte EMUs and indicates a level of calf production and survival
sufficient to maintain current elk populations under a normal regime of hunting and natural
predation. As with the other three local hunting districts discussed here, calf counts have been
below average for the last three years [Table 93].
MFWP feels that elk in HD 335 are being impacted by livestock grazing, partly on the Helena NF,
but more so on privately-owned winter ranges. In addition, MFWP believes that the big
Montana Tunnels mine east of the Forest on Clancy Creek has reduced winter range opportunity
for elk (and more so for mule deer) in the area southwest of Jefferson City east of the Forest
boundary. Native forage is limited, therefore, elk turn to agricultural fields and haystacks
stockpiled for winter livestock feed. This, in turn, has led to ranchers requesting special hunts to
trim elk numbers. Elk numbers have been particularly high over the last four years, in spite of
deficient elk security in the Quartz Creek EHU on the National Forest [Table 88 and Table 89].
As with some other local hunting districts, elk are taking advantage of closed private lands off
the Forest for security, allowing the population to expand.

Elk Population Summary

Key population parameters that MFWP uses to gauge the status of elk populations within
hunting districts and elk management units are summarized for the four local hunting districts
over the the last 15 years in Table 92 and Table 93 below. Most of this information derives
from annual survey flights of winter range. These surveys have provided a stream of data that
has allowed MFWP to estimate total elk numbers, bull/cow ratios and calf/cow ratios over a
period of decades and thus to illuminate population trends and indicate to what degree elk
populations are meeting management objectives. Occasionally, surveys are missing for some
districts (for a variety of technical reasons) and in other years, the accuracy of the counts has
been compromised by unfavorable flying conditions, poor visibility, inopportune flight timing
and so on. But, in most years, the estimates are accurate enough for management purposes
[see State of Montana 2002].

Mule Deer
Of the two deer species that inhabit the Helena NF, the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) is the
more common. In spring, summer and fall, mule deer are most often found in montane habitats
from the foothills on up into the high alpine zone, whereas white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus) focus much of their activity on riparian bottomlands, lowland forest and agricultural
lands in the valleys, most of it off the Forest (Foresman 2012, p. 384-393). In winter, both
species occupy winter ranges in the lower foothills and valleys, sometimes living in close
proximity to one another when deep snow forces them into the same areas.
Like elk, the mule deer serves as an MIS for hunted wildlife on the Helena NF. Most big game
standards and guidelines in the Forest Plan, however, are directed specifically at elk, the
assumption being that management addressing the needs of elk will automatically take care of
mule deer (and other big game species). This is true to a degree, but deer are different enough
from elk that resource management, vegetation manipulation, in particular, needs to account
for certain local habitat configurations that are important specifically to deer. Shifts in the road
and trail system proposed in the Divide Travel Plan, however, would not generate problems
specific to mule deer that are different from those that impact elk and for this reason, mule deer
analysis is not carried forward as a separate section in the “Environmental Consequences”
portion of this report.

WILDLIFE - 329

Divide Travel Plan

Habitat Relationships

As with elk, a majority of mule deer in the Divide landscape over-winter on private and State
land in the foothills and valleys. Unlike elk, however, not all deer move en masse to high
elevation summer ranges. Some may remain in the valleys all year. The deer population in the
City of Helena, for example, is a year-round resident population, distinct from adjacent
migratory groups. Other deer that winter in the valley move only a short distance up onto
neighboring Helena NF land where they remain through the fall. This is an example of what Pac
et al. (1991, p. 97) call “adjacent” seasonal ranges. Many more continue on to more distant
summer ranges at higher elevation, an example of “distinct” seasonal ranges (Pac et al. 1991, p.
97). These migrating deer tend to follow the spring green-up as it spreads from the valleys up
through the foothills and into the montane summer ranges in June.

Mule and white-tailed deer are in the rut for much of the hunting season in October and
November and bucks are often on the move within their fall ranges. But because deer are less
inclined than elk to move off local ranges to security areas several miles away (Mackie et al.
1998), they often rely on local hiding cover to avoid hunters. Thus, local blocks of hiding cover
outside unroaded security areas (in patches considerably less than the 40 acres recommended
for elk) are more important to deer than to elk.
As a rule, the quality of summer range (not winter range) is the primary factor regulating deer
numbers (Mackie et al. 1998, p. 131; Pac et al. 1991, p. 279). In mountain and foothills
environments, summer habitat should provide high forage quality (of leafy forbs) and security
for fawn rearing. Management needs to emphasize habitat diversity (Mackie et al. 1998, p.
136). Mature and over-mature conifer stands with multiple layers, numerous openings,
abundant edge and inclusions of other diverse micro-communities are ideal (Mackie et al. 1998,
p. 49, 55; Pac et al. 1991, p. 279). A balance of high-quality forage, summer thermal cover and
screening/hiding cover are important for raising fawns and building energy reserves for winter
survival and future fawn production.
While summer nutrition may be the key factor that provides deer the wherewithal to survive the
winter, effective winter habitat is also important, allowing animals to hold onto as much of their
accumulated body weight as possible. Pac and others (1991, p. 276) emphasize the need to
manage mule deer winter ranges as maintenance habitat where animals can conserve energy.
Their studies in the Bridger Range of southwest Montana suggest that forage characteristics are
often of secondary importance to local topography and to the abundance of conifer stands that
can ameliorate snow depth and temperature. The conclusion that thermal cover (greater than
or equal to 70 percent canopy closure) is seldom a key habitat component for elk on winter
range [see previous discussion of elk winter range] does not necessarily apply to deer. Research
indicates that mule and white-tailed deer are more dependent on thermal characteristics of
forest cover than are elk. At least on some winter ranges, deer appear to require dense stands
of mature timber with canopy closure in excess of 60 percent to withstand prolonged bouts of
severe winter weather. While typically deficient in forage, these stands can provide a favorable
thermal environment and minimize snow depth (Mackie et al. 1998, p. 52, 136; Pac et al. 1991,
p. 77, 276, 279).
While deer are more likely than elk to become habituated to open roads and associated human
activity (as common observation across the Helena NF and adjacent lands will attest), most deer
do in fact avoid roads as much as possible (Rost and Bailey 1979). As a result, regular vehicle
traffic will lower habitat effectiveness, thus reducing the amount of habitat that deer find
suitable for foraging, resting, raising young and escaping from perceived danger. It is important

WILDLIFE - 330

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

that Forest road systems do not occupy so much key summer habitat that many deer do not
have good access to the high quality habitat they need to maintain productivity and
survivorship. The impact of roads on deer summer habitat in general can be estimated via the
“habitat effectiveness” indices calculated for elk summer range
Deer in many sub-populations have adapted to living in close proximity to humans, especially in
winter (as in numerous local subdivisions and in the City of Helena). But, those that winter on
less-settled agricultural lands and in the foothills are more likely to try to avoid humans in
winter. Some researchers have noted that in order to minimize all responses by mule deer to
snowmobiles or hikers, they would have to be more than 350 meters away (Freddy et al. 1986).
Perry and Overly (1976) recommended a distance of one half mile away to prevent disturbance
and displacement of mule deer. They found that mule deer were interrupted more often and
longer, by persons afoot than by snowmobiles.

Local Mule Deer Population Management

Mule deer numbers have cycled up and down over past decades, hitting low points in the 1970s
and 1990s. MFWP does not survey deer as rigorously as elk in the Divide landscape, picking
them up incidentally during elk winter range flights and as a result, population estimates are
often murky. However, the aerial surveys of elk/deer winter range, check station data, hunter
surveys and field observations by biologists provide enough information on population trends to
allow the Fish and Game Commission to make yearly adjustments in the allowable mule deer
harvest.

As discussed earlier, four hunting districts overlap the Divide landscape: HDs 215 and 293 west
of the Divide and HDs 335 and 343 east of the Divide. In all of these districts, antlered deer
harvest is managed via the general deer license or by B license permits; these two licenses place
no limits on the number of hunters but restrict the take to one deer per hunter. This pattern
has remained constant over several decades in spite of population fluctuations. The allowable
harvest of antlerless deer, however, has varied over time and between districts and has been
the primary mechanism for making adjustments in response to population shifts revealed by
field data. During the population ebb of the 1990s, no antlerless harvest was permitted, thus
protecting the reproductive segment of the population. In 2001, with local populations
increasing east of the Divide, a total of 50 B-licenses for antlerless deer became available in HDs
335 and 343. The number of antlerless B-licenses in these districts peaked at 500 in 2008 and
has since dropped to 300 licenses as deer numbers again look to be falling off. In the two
hunting districts west of the Divide, no antlerless deer B-licenses were issued until 2008 when
50 licenses were permitted in HD 215. This number dropped to 25 in 2012. In HD 293, no Blicenses for antlerless deer have been issued in the last two decades.
All this is now in the process of changing, however, as numbers of mule deer (and white-tailed
deer) are again dropping precipitously (by 60 to 90 percent) across much of Montana. Reasons
for the current population decline are multiple: they include the aforementioned cyclical trends
in deer populations, increase in disease (primarily a problem in white-tailed deer), harsh winter
conditions in 2011 to 2012 and a rise in predator populations. Shifts in habitat quality and road
patterns have not been implicated in the decline. In response, the Fish and Game Commission
has eliminated B-licenses for both antlered and antlerless deer across much of the state. In the
case of the four hunting districts that overlap the Divide Travel Plan Area, the 2014 regulations
do allow for harvest of antlered mule deer during the general rifle season but eliminate harvest
of antlerless deer (does and young bucks with antlers shorter than four inches) in three of the

WILDLIFE - 331

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

districts. The only rifle season opportunity for antlerless mule deer comes in the form of 50 Btags on private land in HD 293. The end result of the new regulations is that hunters are limited
to one deer and presure is taken off reproductive females [see Helena Independent Record:
2013 Dec. 13, 2013 and Jan. 5, 2014; Montana 2014 Hunting Regulations:
http://fwp.mt.gov/hunting/regulations].

Moose
The Shiras moose (Alces alces shirasi), the smallest of the four North American moose
subspecies, is widely, but erratically distributed across the Rocky Mountains of southern Canada
and the northern U.S. During the 20th century, Shiras moose dispersed southward into areas
where they had not been observed by explorers and settlers in the 1800s, ranging as far south
as northern Utah and Colorado by the 1990s (Kay 1997). Recently, however, moose populations
have been declining in several parts of the west (as well as in other parts of the country, most
notably Minnesota). In Montana, populations appear to be dwindling in some areas (the Big
Hole country) but expanding in others (the Centennial Valley; eastern Montana along the
Missouri River) (Foresman 2012, p. 374-375). Given the absence of hard data, Montana Fish,
Wildlife and Parks has initiated three long-term population studies to decipher trends in the
Montana moose population. Current hypotheses as to why some local moose populations are
shrinking include climate change-driven increases in parasites, decline in the quality of foraging
habitat and rising predator populations. Hunting pressure on moose has dropped off
significantly since 2006 and is not seen as a driving factor (see Helena Independent Record, 2013
Oct. 31).
The Helena Forest Plan addresses the needs of moose by specifying that moose habitat “will be
managed to provide adequate browse species diversity and quantity to support current moose
populations” (HFP, p. II/19). Moose are also covered, to an extent, by Forest Plan management
guidelines for elk that limit road density, maintain certain levels of forest cover and protect key
habitat components, particularly riparian areas and other productive wet habitats [Figure 8,
Figure 50]. As with mule deer, because moose are unlikely to be affected by changes in the
road and trail system proposed in the Divide Travel Plan differently than elk, they will not be
analyzed separately in the “Environmental Consequences” section of this report.
Moose are solitary for most of the year, aside from cows-with-calves and loose winter groupings
and their numbers in and around the Helena NF are inherently low compared to those of elk and
deer (MFWP observation records; personal observation). The Divide landscape provides
numerous patches of suitable moose habitat. Key habitat is naturally fragmented because of its
association with riparian areas, drainage-head basins, productive north- and east-slope forest
and other habitat features with disjunct distribution on the landscape (Costain 1989, p. 138-143;
Costain and Matchett 1992, p. 27-31).
From mid-spring through mid-fall, moose move between productive local foraging sites every
few days, sometimes traveling several miles (Matchett 1985, p. 123, 130). Although they often
travel at night, moose are sometimes seen on the move during the day in habitats that seem to
offer them little in the way of food or cover. The travel routes moose choose in moving around
appear to have no consistent habitat characteristics and they may use open roads for this
purpose. While moose may spend part of the winter in stands of mature timber at midelevation, most winter range is concentrated in lower elevation riparian areas where browse is
plentiful and snow depths are more moderate (Costain 1989, p. 89-90, 34-36).

WILDLIFE - 332

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The number of annual moose licenses issued to hunters in the three moose hunting districts
that cover the Divide landscape is small. From 1995 through 2007, the combined total for the
three districts (which extend from Butte in the south to the Scapegoat Wilderness in the north)
was 10 to 12 licenses per year. Since then, the total has dropped to seven licenses per year, all
for antlered bulls. Nonetheless, because many moose choose to feed and rest in key habitat
sites near roads, putting up with nearby human activity, they are susceptible to poaching or
accidental shooting. As a result, human induced mortality inevitably exceeds the hunting quotas
set by MFWP (Matchett 1985, p. 132; G. Joslin, comments in MFWP 2007 Elk Survey, HD 335;
personal observation). The higher the open road density in areas with productive moose
foraging habitat, the greater the risk to moose.

Grizzly Bear
Grizzly Bear Biology
Habitat Use, Behavior, Movements
The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) is the largest carnivore in North America and one of the
only animals that consistently alters the way in which humans function in wildland settings.
Grizzlies are imposing, intelligent animals with both genetic and learned abilities to take
advantage of the resources in their local environments, to adapt to new ranges and to deal with
environmental change, including human intrusion and habitat alteration (Jonkel 1978, p. 227).
Grizzly bears are individualistic in their habitat use and behavior. Adult males are normally
solitary wanderers within extensive home ranges, which they come to know in detail (McLellan
1985). Likewise, adult females, in spite of the need to tend cubs, are perpetually on the move
scouting out the resources needed for survival. The home ranges of adult male grizzlies are
generally two to five times larger than those of adult females: average range estimated from
four Montana populations was 71 mi² for females and 319 mi² for males (Schwartz et al. 2003, p.
566). Home ranges of adult bears overlap to a certain extent and they vary in size and location
depending on food availability, weather conditions and interactions with other bears (USFWS
1993). The densities of established populations vary considerably, but they are inevitably low,
an average of 102 bears/1000 mi² for five Montana populations (with a range of 18 to 207
bears/1000 mi²) (Schwartz et al. 2003, p. 573-574). These estimates are for core populations:
densities are substantially lower in more marginal habitats and linkage zones, such as the Divide
landscape.
Grizzlies, while formidably equipped as carnivores, behave basically as omnivores. The majority
of their food intake consists of vegetation (green plant matter, roots, seeds), which they
consume in huge quantities (Foresman 2012, p. 347). Items with high crude protein content are
particularly important. Seeds from whitebark pine are an important food source wherever they
occur, but if they become unavailable for a time, the bears switch to other foods. As
opportunistic feeders, grizzlies prey on or scavenge any animal food source that becomes
available, including insect larvae, rodents, elk and moose calves, incapacitated or unwary adult
ungulates, domestic livestock and carrion of any sort. Winter-killed ungulates and other carrion

WILDLIFE - 333

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

are a key source of energy in spring when green vegetation is less available (Craighead et al.
1995, p. 235-237).
While grizzly bears make extensive use of forest cover, they generally prefer to operate in a
landscape with a variety of habitat formations ranging from dense interior forest [Figure 6,
Figure 57, Figure 60] to open meadowlands [Figure 8, Figure 20, Figure 53] (Dood et al.
2006, p. 18). The bears use forested habitats for resting, general concealment, thermal relief in
summer and foraging and hunting (USFWS 1993, p. 7-8). They spend considerable time feeding
on vegetation in more open habitats or in brushy areas along streams. They are drawn to areas
with an abundance of deciduous shrubs in both forested and unforested habitats [Figure 49].
In mountainous terrain, avalanche chutes often serve as foraging areas (USFWS 1993, p. 7). The
search for food is a primary influence on grizzly movements and the bears will adapt to local
conditions and go wherever they need to in order to meet their food requirements (USFWS
1993).

Influence of Roads and Human Presence

Historically, grizzly bears occupied a variety of habitats across much of central and western
North America, but by mid 20th century, human domination of the landscape had reduced their
range in the lower 48 states to pockets of well-forested montane habitat in the northern Rockies
(Foresman 2012, p. 346). Five areas in this region, representing less than two percent of the
grizzly’s historic range, now support grizzly bear populations (USFWS 1993) and these are the
areas in which Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones have been esablished. Of the five areas, two of
them straddle the Continental Divide in Montana: The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE)
and the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE). The Divide Travel Plan Area is located
along the Divide partway between these large wildland ecosystems and thus is in a position to
intercept any exchange between the two. Virtually all movement through the landscape is from
the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem toward the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, north to
south.

Field studies in the northern Rockies, Montana, British Columbia, Alberta, have lent support to
the presumption that grizzly bear persistence in any given area is determined by (1) habitat
quality, (2) the number of humans within that habitat and (3) the behavior of those humans
(Apps et al. 2004). To that end, ‘effective’ habitat in and around Recovery Zones is described in
terms of “core areas”, blocks of suitable habitat free of motorized access during the nondenning period (IGBC 1994).
Research has indicated that grizzly bears, in order to avoid negative interactions with humans,
underutilize habitat near roads (Apps et al. 2004; Mace and Waller 1998; McLellan and
Shackleton 1989). Mace and Manley (1993) determined that adult grizzlies used habitat with
open road densities exceeding 1.0 mi/mi2 less than expected. All sex and age classes used
habitat with total road densities above 2.0 mi/mi2 less than expected. Grizzly bears generally
adjust to disturbance associated with roads by avoiding the areas around regularly-traveled
routes, which diminishes the amount of habitat available to them. New roads often escalate
human access into previously remote areas, increasing the frequency of human-bear
confrontations, elevating mortality, reducing habitat availability and ultimately suppressing
grizzly populations.
Be that as it may, ongoing research in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem suggests that,
in spite of the grizzly’s aversion to contact with humans, a substantial number of bears are now

spending time outside of mountainous wilderness areas, focusing instead on the agricultural
lands of the intermountain valleys and the prairies east of the Rocky Mountain Front [Mace
2014; Mace and Roberts 2012]. This research, based on tens of thousands of telemetry points,
emphasizes the importance of areas with diverse and abundant food sources, be they roaded or
unroaded and the propensity of grizzlies to opportunistically move from one place to another in
search of different foods, regardless of the season. Blocks of roadless habitat remain important,
however, as areas where bears can avoid human activity and where the probablity of lifethreatening interactions is low. This evolving trend in habitat use is likely a consequence of
increasing population density and competiton for resources in the core Northern Continental
Divide Ecosystem back-country.
With or without roads, regular human presence in occupied grizzly range increases the
likelihood of negative interactions. While many such encounters between grizzlies and
backcountry recreationists are a matter of chance, others are created by slipshod sanitation and
food storage that can draw bears into camps. Gut-piles and other parts of downed animals left
unattended by hunters are an additional attractant that may bring bears and humans into close
contact. Trash, bird feeders, gardens, fruit trees and other outdoor food sources may also
attract grizzlies to rural residences that they would otherwise avoid. In some areas, the
presence of free-ranging livestock on both public and private lands provides a relatively easy
prey source for grizzlies, leading to ranchers calling for predator control.
Considering the gamut of human activity in grizzly country, the USFWS identifies three primary
management elements that adversely affect grizzly bears in and around the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE): (1) human access management (roads and trails), (2)
sanitation and (3) livestock grazing. While other land management activities influence grizzlies,
these are the three human generated components that produce most of the adverse effects
(USFS 2013). Of the three elements, “human access management”, which encompasses both
roaded and unroaded means of access, is directly relevant to Divide Travel Plan proposals.

Population Dynamics

General Parameters

Grizzly bears are long-lived and many individuals survive more than 20 years in the wild.
However, they have one of the lowest reproductive rates among terrestrial mammals, which
precludes rapid population increase. Age of first reproduction and litter size varies and appears
often to be related to nutritional state. In areas where suitable resources are less plentiful or
compromised by human development and activity, the ability of local populations to multiply is
limited (USFWS 1993).

Sources of natural mortality have proven difficult to quantify, but old-age, conflicts with other
bears, starvation and accidents (avalanches, den collapse) are known to be factors. Disease and
parasites appear not to be major sources of mortality (Dood et al. 2006, p. 21; Schwartz et al.
2003, p. 571). Most mortality in dependent young (cubs and yearlings) is natural, but the exact
causes are often unknown because so few are radio collared. The bulk of adult mortality is
human-caused. Bears are hit on railways and highways, shot by hunters (accidentally,
maliciously, in self-defense), killed by residents protecting themselves or their property, or
removed for management purposes (usually for killing livestock or threatening humans). Death
rates in northern Rocky Mountain grizzly populations have varied dramatically over past
decades, but in recent years, rates of mortality in the two large Recovery Zones [Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem] have been regularly

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

exceeded by rates of production (and survival of young), resulting in slow but consistent
population increase (USFWS 2014, p. 12-23). Population parameters in “Distribution Zones” and
other more marginal areas beyond the Recovery Zones are unknown.

Population Status in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem

Analysis by Mace and others (2011), based on six years of demographic data derived from a
variety of field research, indicates that by 2009 the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem and
adjacent areas were supporting a growing population of more than 1,000 grizzly bears. The
analysis estimated annual population growth rate at about three percent. Annual monitoring
since 2009 (Mace and Roberts 2012a, 2012b) shows that the rates of reproduction and mortality
that have been producing the three percent growth rate are continuing. Current population
numbers (approxmately 1,100 grizzlies) are significantly greater than the estimate of 440 to 680
bears believed to have inhabited the ecosystem in 1975 when the grizzly was listed as a
threatened species.

Also, work by Kendall and others (2009) has shown that this population is characterized by high
genetic diversity and is expanding its distribution beyond the Northern Continental Divide
Ecosystem in all cardinal directions. This expansion, documented by targeted survey work and
many fortuitous observations in the field, led USFWS, USFS, MFWP and IGBC biologists in 2002
to designate the northern half of the Divide landscape on the Helena Ranger District as part of a
“Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone”, an area outside the Recovery Zone that was beginning to be
occupied by grizzlies. Given the number of credible grizzly reports in the southern portion of the
Divide landscape since 2002, the Helena NF has now extended this Distribution Zone southward
to encompass the entire landscape down to the Helena/Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF boundary
[USFS 2013]. In sum: research and monitoring over the last decade clearly point to a continuing
“positive trajectory in population trend” in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem grizzly
bear population (Mace et al. 2011).

Management Guidance
Regional Management
The grizzly bear has been listed as a threatened species in the lower 48 states since 1975. The
governing management document is the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan, initially approved in 1982
and revised in 1993 (USFWS 1993). The 1993 version remains in effect today, although as bear
distribution and management needs have shifted, the Recovery Plan has been clarified by more
recent documents such as the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee Guidelines (IGBC 1986), the
Biological Assessment for Grizzly Bears Inside the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem and
the Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone (USFS 2005) and the Grizzly Bear Management Plan for
Western Montana (Dood et al. 2006). The 1993 Recovery Plan identified seven grizzly bear
ecosystems (five currently occupied, two unoccupied) around which the primary recovery zones
were to be centered. The intent of the Recovery Plan has been to generate viable grizzly
populations sufficient to remove the bear from the Endangered Species List in each of the seven
ecosystems. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) felt that this goal had been achieved in
the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in 2007 and delisted the species at that time. This action
was reversed by a court ruling in 2009 (due primarily to concerns over the decline of whitebark
pine as a food source) and as a result, grizzlies remain listed as threatened in all seven
ecosystems.

WILDLIFE - 336

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

As of 2014, the USFWS has no active proposals for delisting grizzlies in either the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem or the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. However, discussion
within Federal agencies and ongoing research are heading in that direction. Among other
findings, monitoring of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population has indicated that with
the loss of much of the whitebark pine seed resource, the bears have simply switched to other
foods, which have proven sufficient to maintain ongoing population increases.

Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee Guidelines
The 1986 Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee Guidelines (IGBC 1986, p. 3-5) outline five
“Management Situations” (MS’s), three of which (MS 1, 2 and 3) apply to areas in and around
recovery zones and two of which (MS 4 and 5) apply to areas further afield. The Helena Forest
Plan has mapped the areas where Management Situations 1 and 2 apply (namely, inside the
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone) but it has not done so for Management
Situations 3, 4 and 5 (since their introduction post-dated the release of the Forest Plan). The
status of these latter three management situations in any given area is often in a state of flux,
due to shifts in human settlement, roading, recreational activities, vegetation conditions, bear
distribution and so on. As a result, their site-specific delineation has been left to biologists at
project level as needed.
Given the small number and low density of grizzlies in the Divide landscape, the management
situation that most often applies (irrespective of the area’s status as a Distribution Zone), is MS
5. Although the description of MS 5 in the Guidelines is an imperfect fit for much of the
landscape, it comes the closest of the five management situations. Population and habitat
conditions for MS 5 are described as follows: “Grizzlies do not occur, or occur only rarely in the
area. Habitat may be unsuitable, unavailable, or suitable and available but unoccupied. The
area lacks survival and recovery values for the species or said values are unknown…..” (IGBC
1986). A primary element that reduces suitability of grizzly bear habitat in the Divide landscape
is the density of roads and motor trails. Management direction for MS 5 is that grizzlies are to
be given deference up to a point but are subject to “control” in cases of conflicts with humans.
Maintenance of habitat for grizzlies is an “option” but “is not directed”

Helena Forest Plan
The Helena Forest Plan (HFP) (1986) addresses grizzly bear management via the following
Forestwide standards and guidelines:
•

•

HFP Appendix D, Guidelines for Management of Grizzly Bear Habitat: These guidelines
provide direction based on the 1982 version of the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan. “Grizzly
bear habitat” (as of 1986) is identified and population/habitat conditions and
management direction are specified for two “management situations” that occur in
areas occupied by grizzlies. All grizzly bear habitat identified in the Forest Plan is on the
Lincoln Ranger District: management situation 1 lands are inside the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Area; management situation 2 lands are south
of the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem boundary.
HFP Appendix E, Grizzly Bear Management Outside of Recovery Areas. These guidelines
specify steps to be taken in identifying and inventorying potential grizzly habitat,
documenting grizzly “biological activity centers” (BACs), protecting areas used by
grizzlies and determining if management direction for the areas should be changed to
emphasize grizzly bear needs. The guidelines apply to the Divide, Big Belts and Elkhorns

landscapes on the Helena and Townsend Ranger Districts, as well as the Lincoln District
south of Highway 200.
Indicator Species (HFP, p. II/17). The grizzly bear is to be monitored as a management
indicator for the threatened and endangered species group, the objective being to
determine whether or not viable populations are being maintained.
Biological Evaluations (HFP, p. II/19). A biological evaluation must be written for all
projects that have potential to impact grizzly bears and appropriate mitigations
developed (in consultation with the USFWS, if necessary) if adverse impacts are likely.
Field Studies (HFP, p. II/19). Field studies should be conducted in areas not yet
designated as occupied grizzly habitat but where grizzlies are known to be present. The
areas should be managed according to guidelines in appendix E of the wildlife specialist
report.
Open Road Density (HFP, p. II/19): In occupied grizzly habitat, so as to minimize humancaused mortality, open road density should not exceed 0.55 mi/mi².

Linkage Zone Considerations
An objective of the 1993 Recovery Plan has been to develop management tactics that will help
remove limiting factors that retard population recovery. One such factor is the presence of
unsuitable habitat and barriers to movement (roads and motor trails being a prime example) in
linkage zones between recovery zones (USDI 1993). The Divide Landscape is not identified as a
primary linkage zone in the Recovery Plan or in recent modeling efforts (Servheen et al. 2003;
Walker and Craighead 1997), mostly because of “intense roading in the Helena National Forest”
(Walker and Craighead 1998). However, increasing observations of bears throughout the
landscape since the 1990s suggests that it may in fact be functioning in this way (J. Jonkel,
personal communication 2007; Servheen 2005). Limited DNA sampling has found that grizzlies
as far south as Elk Park just north of Butte and the Anaconda Range have come from the
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, possibly having moved through the Divide landscape to
get there (J. Jonkel, personal communication 2007, 2012).

Management in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone vs the
Distribution Zone
The Helena NF portion of the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone occupies
the northern half of the Lincoln Ranger District, north of State Highway 200 in the Blackfoot
landscape. Much of the management guidance for the Recovery Zone does not apply to the
Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone in the Divide and southern Blackfoot landscapes. In particular,
Forest Plan requirements for Management Situations 1 and 2 and the requirement for
maintaining a minimum open road density of 0.55 mi/mi² in occupied grizzly habitat do not
apply to the Distribution Zone (HFP, p. II/19; Appendices D and E). Likewise, guidelines for
maintaining a certain acreage of unroaded grizzly bear “core areas” apply only to bear
management units (BMUs) in and around the Recovery Zone: While we have used these core
area guidelines as a means of gauging the quality of grizzly bear habitat in the Distribution Zone,
they do not apply to that area as a management requirement (see IGBC 1998; USFS 2005, p. 7,
32; USFWS 2006, p. 22).

WILDLIFE - 338

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Grizzly Bear Status in the Divide Travel Plan Area
Non-Motorized Habitat Blocks and Road Densities

Non-Motorized Habitat (Core Areas)

Effective grizzly bear range requires a reasonable distribution of core areas that can provide the
bears with basic habitat components (food and cover) in an environment free from motorized
disturbance and other forms of “high-intensity” human use (as along popular hiking trails)
during the period when bears are active (April to November) (IGBC Motorized Access
Management guidelines 1998). For the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone
(Management Situations 1 and 2), the Helena NF delineates grizzly bear “core areas” as blocks of
suitable habitat larger than 2,500 acres with all boundaries 0.3 miles from motorized routes
open during the non-denning period (see IGBC 1998; USFS 2005, p. 7, 32; USFWS 2006, p. 22).
These core area parameters are not intended to be applied outside the Recovery Zone, but I
have calculated them for the Divide landscape as a means of comparing conditions in the
Distribution Zone with those in primary grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide
Ecosystem.

The Divide landscape currently supports four areas that would qualify as “core areas” in the
Recovery Zone [see Table 113 in “Environmental Consequences”]. These non-motorized areas
(based on open road and motor trail patterns in summer) represent about 29 percent of the
landscape south of Highway 12 and about 15 percent north of the highway (24 percent overall).
Compare this with core area percentages of 67 percent to 75 percent in Bear Management
Subunits within the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone on the Lincoln
District (USFWS 2006, p. 21-22). These percentages relect the difference in grizzly bear habitat
potential between wildland areas in and around the Bob Marshall Wilderness complex and lands
in and around the Divide landscape, which have been roaded, settled, mined, grazed, logged
and otherwise meddled with since the mid 1800s.
The effectiveness of these non-mototized areas as grizzly bear habitat, in terms of their size,
abundance of key habitat components and proximity to other such core areas, is variable.
Grizzly bears have been reported in two of these areas [Black Mountain–Deadman Creek
(Figure 61 and Figure 62) and Electric Peak Roadless Area (Figure 12, Figure 24)]. But
observations have also come in from smaller non-motorized habitat patches (less than 2,500
acres) both north and south of Highway 12. The Divide landscape, while not a region with
enough secure habitat to provide for a core grizzly bear population, does provide habitat
enclaves for bears moving through and apparently, for a very small resident population.

Road Density

Another key to determining habitat suitability for grizzly bears is the overall density and
distribution of roads and motor trails. Mace and Manley’s (1993) research in northwest
Montana suggest open road densities above 1.0 mi/mi2 and total road densities above 2.0
mi/mi2 are likely to suppress local habitat use by grizzly bears. The IGBC Motorized Access
guidelines (IGBC 1998) thus recommend calculating the overall density of open roads and total
roads (open and restricted) in addition to delineating core areas in and around Recovery Zones.
Although “closed” or “restricted” roads exclude motor vehicles, they still provide travelways for
hikers, equestrians, bicycle riders and hunters afoot. If these uses occur at high levels, the
ability of an area to hold grizzly bears may be compromised much as it would be by open roads
and motor trails (Mace and Manly 1993).

WILDLIFE - 339

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Open route densities for the Divide Travel Plan Area (in summer) are shown in Table 114
[alternative 1]. Open road density is notably higher north of U.S. Highway 12 than south of the
highway. Overall density of 1.36 mi/mi² in the Travel Plan Area is 3 to 10 times higher than
densities in Bear Management Subunits of the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery
Zone on the Lincoln Ranger District. Those units, which are managed specifically to enhance
grizzly bear recovery, show densities in the range of 0.14 to 0.47 mi/mi² [a maximum of 0.55
mi/mi² is the Forest Plan standard for Recovery Zone Management Situations]. The fact that
grizzlies continue to move through and occupy parts of the Divide landscape in spite of road
densities that approach or exceed levels recommended by Mace and Manley (1993) may reflect
the rough, primitive condition of many Forest and private roads and the low levels of vehicle use
they receive in summer, to the point that bears may often not perceive them as functioning
roads [Figure 11, Figure 13, Figure 14, Figure 39 to Figure 43, Figure 46 to Figure 49,
Figure 59, Figure 60]. The presence of a few larger unroaded enclaves the size of core areas in
the Recovery Zone also ameliorates the impact of surrounding road networks [Figure 12,
Figure 26].

Grizzly Bear Area Use

The Divide Landscape in General

Grizzly bears have been observed throughout the Divide landscape several times over the past
20 years [Helena NF wildlife observation data base; MFWP records (Helena Area Resource
Office)]. A majority of observations have come from the northern half of the landscape toward
the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone and have probably been of transient
bears. Some of these animals have been recognized from one year to the next and are assumed
to be bears that den and center much of their activity in the Blackfoot landscape on the Lincoln
Ranger District but that range southward during part of the year.

Most, though not all, observations south of Highway 12 have been in the upper Little Blackfoot
watershed and along the border between the Helena and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NFs
(including the upper Cataract and Basin Creek drainages just to the south). The number of
credible grizzly bear reports in these areas has been increasing in recent years as the population
in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem expands to the point that more bears are
exploring new territory further to the south (J. Jonkel, personal communication, 2007). Since
2010, the Helena NF has participated in monitoring efforts designed to identify individual
grizzlies through DNA analysis of hair samples collected from rub trees. So far, no bears have
been identified by this method south of Highway 12, a further indication of their scarcity in this
area.
The tally in Table 94 is incomplete, but it includes most credible observations made by or
reported to Helena NF and Helena-area MFWP biologists from 1999 to 2012. Most of the
reports are from the Helena NF, but seven observations are from south of the Forest boundary
on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF. One of these consists of a series of close-up photos from a
camera station on the Continental Divide south of Electric Peak in 2012; another is a MFWP
report of a grizzly shot in the Boulder River Drainage further to the south [both, obviously,
verified occurrences]. I eliminated reports that were vague or otherwise dubious (of which
there are many) and retained those deemed credible by professional wildlife specialists or that
seemed reliable for other reasons.

The actual number of grizzlies that have ranged into the Divide landscape since 1991 is
considerably less than these totals might suggest since some of the bears have been observed
and tallied multiple times over 20 years.
Additional reports have come in since 2012 but at this point, I do not have complete data from
MFWP for those years. Observations in the Helena NF database, 2013 to 2014, include credible
sightings south of Elliston and in Conners Gulch in the upper Little Blackfoot drainage;
observation of a grizzly sow and cub in Spotted Dog Creek; a good set of tracks on Bison
Mountain; and a mass of grizzly-sized scat in Little Corral Gulch in the southeast part of the
landscape (for which we are awaiting DNA analysis).

North Divide

The northern half of the Divide landscape is an area still in transition with regard to its role in
grizzly bear recovery. Although it lies adjacent to the Blackfoot landscape where a resident
grizzly population has been established for several decades, only its northernmost reaches, the
Little Prickly Pear watershed, may accommodate resident bears (animals that either den in the
upper drainages or spend much of their active spring-summer-fall season there). Bear activity in
the rest of the landscape appears fluid, associated with long-distance dispersal or with wideranging seasonal forays beyond core home ranges to the north. The number of bears likely to
be present in the northern Divide landscape at any given time is unknown. But, two decades of
fortuitous observations and occasional targeted field checks suggest the following:
•

•

•

•

In spite of the fact that the original grizzly bear “Distribution Zone” extends southward
to Mullan Pass, there is currently no bonafide “resident” population in the area south of
the Little Prickly Pear watershed (at the northern end of the Divide landscape).
Bears observed in most of this area appear to be either transient animals moving
southward through a linkage zone or those with ranges centered further north (the
Lincoln Ranger District) that sometimes range southward.
Neither denning nor reproduction has been documented in the Divide landscape
between the Dog Creek/Little Prickly Pear divide in the north and the upper reaches of
the Little Blackfoot watershed to the south.
The north Divide landscape is thus not currently part of a Biological Activity Center for
grizzlies [which requires that females with cubs be observed five out of 10 years (HFP,
Appendix E)].

South Divide

Grizzly bears that occupy or move through the Expanded Distribution Zone in the southern half
of the Divide landscape also range into the drainages flowing southward into Boulder River on
the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF. Although rural residences, open roads, motorized trails,
developed recreational facilities (campgrounds, etc.), livestock grazing, mining operations and
other human activities are spread throughout this block of territory, substantial portions of it
WILDLIFE - 341

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

are unroaded or lightly roaded [Figure 12, Figure 24, Figure 26]. While the area is not
sufficiently untrammeled to serve as a Recovery Zone, the fact that grizzlies seem to have
persisted here for at least two decades (albeit in very low numbers) suggests that it has a role to
play in the recovery process, potentially providing local habitation opportunities and linkage
between bonafide Recovery Zones.
As with the area north of Highway 12, the southern half of the Divide landscape is still very
much in transition with regard to its role in grizzly bear recovery. At this time, the the number
of grizzlies operating in this area is unknown and their status uncertain. All that can be said,
based on field observations to this point, is the following:
•
•
•

Population density is very low (only five verified occurrences in the general area 2004 to
2012, although several additional observations are highly credible).
Reproduction is uncommon (five reports of a sow with cubs since 1991).
The stability and persistence of the current population may be tenuous (since the
presence of grizzlies may be indicative of a linkage zone with transient individuals rather
than an incipient Biological Activity Center) (HFP, Appendix E).

Canada Lynx
Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships
The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is confined to regions of North America with cold, snowy
winters. Core populations are centered in Canada with persistent peripheral populations across
the northern tier of the lower 48 states and a patchy southward extension along the Rockies.
Lynx inhabit coniferous forests capable of supporting snowshoe hares as a prey base: In North
America, the distribution of lynx is nearly coincident with that of snowshoe hares (Ruediger et
al. 2000). In the northern Rockies, most lynx occurrence is associated with conifer forests
dominated by lodgepole pine, subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce in the 4900 to 6550 foot
elevation zone. Secondary interspersed vegetation includes Douglas-fir, grand fir, western larch
and aspen. Dry forest types, such as ponderosa pine and dry Douglas-fir seldom provide
suitable lynx habitat (Aubry et al. 1999).
Females establish maternal denning sites in a variety of forest structures ranging from mature
and old-growth coniferous forest to young regenerating stands (USFS 2007a, p. 16). In all cases,
the key component of lynx den sites appears to be the abundance of coarse woody debris, not
the age of the forest (Mowat et al. 2000). Middle-aged conifer stands (40 to 120 years old) with
open understories and sparse deadfall do not provide good denning or foraging environments
but often serve as travel habitat (Koehler and Aubry 1994).
Lynx usually avoid large unforested areas and prefer to move between primary habitat sites
under cover of mature forest, dense early-seral forest, or tall shrubs, typically following ridges or
riparian zones and moving through saddles. Based on fieldwork in north-central Washington,
Koehler (1990) surmised that openings created by regeneration harvest, where the distance to
cover was more than about 325 feet (100 meters), might restrict local lynx movement and
habitat use patterns until forest cover had regrown. On the other hand, research has
documented many instances of lynx crossing unforested openings (Roe et al. 2000, cited in USFS
2007a, p. 10). Lynx will move across extensive non-forested areas as needed during dispersal or
other long-range excursions (Koehler and Aubry 1994, p. 88; Ruediger et al. 2000, p. 1-12; Aubry

WILDLIFE - 342

et al. 1999, p. 379), although they prefer to travel through forested habitats or along forest
edges (Squires et al. 2013; Ruediger et al. 2000, ch.1 p.4; Mowat et al. 1999). Lynx seldom
forage in open habitats, most likely because preferred prey species are uncommon there
(Maletzke et al. 2007).
Snowshoe hares are the primary prey, making up anywhere from 35 percent to 97 percent of
lynx diet. Koehler (1990) reports that snowshoe hare densities are correlated with densities of
trees and shrubs less than 1.0 inch diameter-at-breast-height. Preferred lynx foraging habitat
consists of dense young conifer growth, either in early seral stands or in mature forest
understories, that provides cover and browse for hares (Koehler 1990). Koehler and Brittell
(1990) recommend that seedling/sapling stands in the lodgepole/subalpine fir zone be well
dispersed to provide optimal lynx foraging. Squires (2010) found that in the Seeley Lake region
of western Montana, lynx hunted for hares primarily in mature, multi-storied spruce-fir forest in
winter and in dense early-seral stands in summer. He cautioned, however, that in southern lynx
populations, regional and local habitat differences were likely to generate variations in lynx
foraging patterns: a number of southern populations depend primarily on early successional
forests year-round and some inhabit primarily lodgepole pine rather than spruce-fir forests
(McKelvey et al. 1999; Aubry et al. 1999, p. 8). These differences are a function of the local
availability of key forest types and the distribution of snowshoe hares among them (Maletzke et
al., p. 1473; Squires et al. 2010, p. 1656).
In the mountains of Montana and further south, lynx prey on a wider diversity of species than
northern populations because of lower hare densities and the presence of different small
mammal communities. Potential alternate prey includes red squirrels, jackrabbits, cottontails,
woodrats, marten, marmots, ground squirrels, chipmunks, mice, voles and grouse (Buskirk et al.
1999b, p. 408-409; Aubry et al. 1999, p. 375-378). Of these, red squirrels are, in most locales,
the most important (Ruediger et al. 2000, ch.1 p.8-10; Buskirk et al. 1999b, p. 408-409). Field
research indicates that while lynx will opportunistically take advantage of the full array of
potential prey species in summer, they focus almost entirely on snowshoe hares in winter
whenever they are abundant (Aubry et al. 1999, p. 378).
Lynx are highly susceptible to declines in the prey numbers. When hare populations are low,
many lynx are unable to raise litters successfully and in some cases, adults are unable to sustain
themselves. As a result, local populations decline (Koehler and Aubry 1994). The other principal
natural cause of mortality is conflict with larger carnivores, most notably, mountain lions
[Squires (unpublished data, 2009); Buskirk et al. 1999a, p. 89-95]. Among human caused
mortality factors, trapping has historically been primary. Heavy trapping throughout the 19th
and 20th centuries extirpated lynx from many areas of the Rocky Mountains where they had
once been consistently present and in some areas, common. Montana set restricted trapping
seasons for lynx from 1991 to 1998 and then suspended trapping after the 1998 to 1999 season
(Ruediger et al. 2000). Lynx are still taken incidentally in traps set for wolves, coyotes and other
large/mid-sized carnivores. Lesser mortality factors in recent decades have included disease,
shooting and roadkill (USFS 2007b, p. 2; Squires and Laurion 1999, p. 10).
Despite this plethora of mortality factors, lynx population numbers in western Montana do not
appear to have declined appreciably in recent years, increasing slightly in some areas,
decreasing in others. Based on monitoring of 129 lynx over a 10 year period (1998 to 2007),
Squires (unpublished data, 2010) concluded that the lynx population in the Seeley Lake region of
west-central Montana has been inching downward while the population in the Purcell
Mountains in the northwest corner of the state has been increasing slightly. These are

preliminary conclusions and population data on lynx in the Rocky Mountain region of the U.S.
and southern Canada remains sparse and inconclusive. It can be said, however, that these
southern lynx populations are substantially smaller than those of the boreal forests of northern
Canada and Alaska (because snowshoe hare populations are much smaller and more
fragmented). On the other hand, southern lynx populations appear to be more stable (Aubry et
al. 1999, p. 15-18).
As solitary, wide-ranging predators, lynx in both northern and southern ranges maintain low
population densities relative to most other North American carnivores. Home range size varies
primarily with the dispersion pattern of suitable habitat, the abundance of prey, lynx population
density and the intensity of trapping (Koehler and Aubry 1994, p. 89-91). In Montana, Brainerd
(1985, cited in Koehler and Aubry 1994) has reported home range sizes of about 17 mi2 for
females and 122 mi2 for males. Nellis (1989) concludes that most home ranges fall between five
to 20 mi2. In northern populations where hares are more abundant, home ranges are typically
smaller (Squires and Laurion 1999, p. 347).
Lynx have been documented throughout the mountains of western Montana from the Canadian
border into the Yellowstone area. Current distribution is disjunct and a number of areas that
support what seems to be extensive blocks of suitable habitat are unoccupied. On the other
hand, some localities that appear to have little classic lynx habitat may be supporting small local
populations or serving as linkage zones through which lynx move. On the Helena NF, the most
robust lynx habitat and resident population is in the Blackfoot landscape of the Lincoln Ranger
District. The Divide landscape supports a sparse but apparently persistent population. While
some of these animals are probably transients, winter tracking surveys backed by DNA analysis
of scat and hair over the past five years indicates that others are long-term residents (Gehman
2006; Gehman et al. 2007-2010; Pilgrim 2009-2010; Pilgrim and Schwartz 2007-2008).

Influence of Roads

Koehler and Aubry (1994) identified road management as an important aspect of managing lynx
habitat. Construction of Forest roads destroys local habitat for some lynx prey species (mature
forest for red squirrels) and creates new opportunities for others (edge and eventually, dense
young conifer habitat for snowshoe hares). Lynx are not averse to hunting along the roads and
using them for travel, a behavior that can make them more vulnerable to human-caused
mortality. Rarely, lynx may be shot from roads or killed by vehicles on some of the primary
gravel roads that allow higher speeds (typically County roads on the Helena NF).

Occasionally, lynx are caught in traps along roads that serve as conduits for trappers on
snowmobiles. Even though lynx can no longer be targeted for trapping, they continue to fall
victim to traps set for other species. Lynx are curious and opportunistic carnivores and they are
likely to check out any baited traps along one of their travel routes. Roads that allow vehicle
access to lynx habitat in winter, plowed routes or snowmobile trails, may serve as travelways for
carnivores that compete with lynx (esp. bobcats and coyotes) and that would otherwise be
unable to probe into lynx foraging areas in winter (Ruediger et al. 2000; USFS 2007b). The
significance of such competition is still open to debate, but it may not be as severe as initially
hypothesized (see USFS 2007b, p. 22-25; Kolbe et al. 2005).
Most research suggests that the types of roads managed by the Forest Service seldom adversely
affect lynx directly (USDI 2007). Vehicle strikes are unlikely because of the relatively low speeds
most vehicles are forced to travel and the meager traffic volume. Ruggiero et al. (2000)
concluded that the evidence accumulated to date suggests that lynx do not avoid roads. In fact,
WILDLIFE - 344

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (USFS 2007b, p. 27) concluded that one of the
primary efforts of Forest road management should be to eliminate shrub growth, young conifer
thickets and other habitat features that might support hares and thus attract lynx to the road
corridors. Studies also show that Forest road density does not appear to affect lynx habitat
selection (McKelvey et al. 2000; Ruediger et al. 2000).

Lynx Management
Management Direction
The Canada lynx was listed as a threatened species in 2000 and is now managed via the
Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD) (USFS 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, 2007d),
which has been amended into forest plans in the northern Rockies. Attachment 1 in the
Record of Decision for the Management Direction (2007b) displays 13 objectives, seven
standards and 24 guidelines designed to achieve the goal of conserving the Canada lynx. These
are divided among five categories. All management practices and activities (ALL), vegetation
management (VEG), livestock management (GRAZ), human use projects (HU) and linkage areas
(LINK).
Six of the 12 guidelines that address human use projects are potentially relevant to travel
management. Guidelines HU G6 and HU G8 deal with upgrading and maintenance of existing
Forest roads; guidelines HU G7 and HU G9 address the placement, design, reclamation and
closure of new Forest roads; guideline HU G11 restricts expansion of over-snow routes (mostly
snowmobile trails) in lynx habitat; and guideline HU G12 limits winter access for non-recreation
special uses and for mineral and energy projects to designated routes in lynx habitat.
Two other directives of potential relevance are in sections addressing linkage areas and “all”
management practices and activities. These are (1) Standard LINK S1, which mandates
identification of potential lynx highway crossings when highway construction or reconstruction
is being contemplated in identified linkage areas; and (2) Guideline ALL G1, which advocates
pursuing methods to minimize effects on lynx from construction or reconstruction of highways.

Lynx Analysis Units (LAUs)
The basic units for analyzing the effects of management actions on lynx are lynx analysis units
(LAUs), areas about the size of individual female lynx home ranges. The rationale for defining
units on this scale is discussed in the Canada Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy
(CLCAS) (Ruediger et al. 2000, p. 7-2). Based on this guidance, biologists delineated LAUs for the
Helena NF in 2000 as part of the process by which the lynx was listed as a threatened species.
Some of the units have been adjusted since that time, leaving a current total of 29 LAUs on the
Forest, six of which are situated in the Divide landscape (designated di-01 through di-06).
Because lynx home ranges tend to be smaller in areas of better habitat (with higher prey
density), LAUs are smaller and more numerous in the Blackfoot landscape, where habitat is of
higher quality and larger in the Big Belt landscape where habitat is often marginal. LAUs in the
Divide landscape fall somewhere in between these two, averaging 34,920 acres.
Basic logistics of the six Divide landscape LAUs are shown in Table 95. The LAUs are mapped in
Figure 28 and Figure 29, on following pages.

Delineating Lynx Habitat
Most objectives, standards and guidelines in the Lynx Management Direction apply only to
designated lynx habitat within LAUs on National Forest System lands (NRLMD, Attachment 1, p.
1-6). The Helena NF delineates lynx habitat based on information in the timber stand database
and satellite imagery (the Region 1 VMAP database). In the Divide landscape, potential “lynx
habitat” consists of cool, moist coniferous forest habitat types, in any stage of development, on
Helena NF land above 5,500 feet. These are environments that we feel are likely to support
habitat components suitable for lynx denning and foraging or that can be expected to develop
such characteristics over time. In most Divide landscape LAUs, only a small percentage of
“potential” habitat currently supports vegetation structure that provides for effective lynx
denning and foraging.
Within potential lynx habitat, the Helena NF has delineated snowshoe hare habitat as the key
component, that is, dense stands of young conifers capable of providing hiding cover and
enough overhead structure to create under-snow shelter and feeding enclaves. These
conditions occur in young sapling conifer stands (stand initiation structural stages) and in the
understories of mature forests (multistoried structural stages).

Delineating Occupied Habitat

The Lynx Management Direction applies to National Forest lands “occupied” by the lynx. On the
Helena NF, the Blackfoot and Divide landscapes are considered to be “occupied”. The Big Belts
and Elkhorns landscapes are not currently occupied by resident lynx, although transient animals
have been documeted in the Big Belts [Lynx Mgmt Direction ROD (USFS 2007b, Attachment 1)].
In the Divide landscape, areas north of U.S. Highway 12 are categorized as “core” occupied
habitat and those south of the highway as “secondary” occupied habitat [Northern Rockies Lynx
Planning Area Map (USFS 2007a)]. Preliminary objectives for “secondary” habitat areas are
somewhat different than those for “core” areas (USFS 2007c, p. 3-4), but we apply Management
Direction standards and guidelines to both areas in the same way.

Critical Lynx Habitat

The USFWS Final Rule (50 CFR Part 17) designating “critical” habitat for lynx in the contiguous
U.S. (Federal Register, Vol. 74, No. 36, Feb. 25, 2009) has been in effect since March 2009. It
expands upon previous mapping efforts and designates approximately 101,000 acres of critical
lynx habitat in the contiguous 48 states, 26,200 acres of which are in the northern Rockies. The
critical habitat designation is based on field research and professional opinion. On the Helena
NF it takes in the entire Blackfoot landscape (Lincoln Ranger District) and the northern part of
the Divide landscape (north of U.S. Highway 12) [Figure 30]. Critical habitat includes all
National Forest land: (1) the previously designated area of “occupied core lynx habitat” and (2)
all of the surrounding and intervening non-lynx habitat, “matrix habitat” that may provide
linkage.

Figure 30 - Lynx analysis units (LAUs) and critical lynx habitat on the Helena NF.
The critical habitat zone covers the entire Blackfoot landscape on the Lincoln Ranger District and
the northern part of the Divide landscape on the Helena Ranger District (LAUs di-01 and di-02).

Besides designating critical habitat, the Final Rule identifies “physical and biological features
that are essential to the conservation” of lynx: that is, “primary constituent elements” (PCEs).
The overarching PCE for lynx critical habitat is summarized as “boreal forest landscapes
supporting a mosaic of differing successional forest stages”. These landscapes contain (a)
snowshoe hares and their “preferred habitat conditions, which include dense understories of
young trees, shrubs, or overhanging boughs that protrude above the snow and mature multistoried stands with conifer boughs touching the snow surface”; (b) “winter snow conditions that
are generally deep and fluffy for extended periods of time”; (c) “sites for denning that have
abundant coarse woody debris, such as downed trees and root wads”; and (d) matrix habitat
(not supporting hares) “that occurs between patches of boreal forest in close juxtaposition (at

the scale of a lynx home range) such that lynx are likely to travel though such habitat while
accessing patches of boreal forest within a home range” (Fed. Register, Vol. 74, No. 36, p. 8638).
The Rule indicates that “lands within critical habitat will require some level of management to
address the current and future threats to the lynx and to maintain and protect the physical and
biological features essential to the conservation of the species” (Federal Register, Vol. 74, No.
36, p. 8638). That is, management actions need to maintain the PCEs. The USFWS is to decide
whether a proposed Federal action amounts to “adverse modification” of lynx habitat based on
whether it allows “the affected critical habitat to remain functional…to serve the intended
conservation role for the species” (Federal Register, Vol.74, No. 36, p. 8644).
At this point, the Helena NF, knowing that lynx are in fact resident in the “non-critical” habitat
zone south of Highway 12, applies the standards and guidelines of the NRLMD to all areas of the
Divide landscape. While the PCE guidance does not currently apply to the region south of
Highway 12, the Helena NF takes it into account when planning projects in this area.

Local Status
Lynx Survey Work and Field Observations
The Helena NF wildlife data base shows 12 observations (or groups of observations) of lynx or
lynx tracks in the six Divide landscape LAUs since 1999 that have been verified or are considered
highly credible (by MFWP and/or Helena NF biologists). These include an adult lynx
photographed in a tree in Hahn Creek in 2006 and a juvenile female killed on Highway 12 west
of MacDonald Pass in 2003. Other reports have come from these areas, but their credibility is
unclear (HRD/ Helena NF wildlife observation files). In particular, a number of reports of
“unknown credibility” from LAU di-01 probably represent valid lynx sightings, given the
proximity of that LAU to high quality habitat on the Lincoln Ranger District.
In addition to these fortuitous observations, data is available from systematic tracking surveys
conducted by MFWP along the Continental Divide between Boulder River in the south and
Bullion Parks/ Jericho Mountain in the north [B. Giddings, personal communication; HNF/ HRD
observation files]. Most lynx tracks encountered in these surveys over the past 15 years have
been in the Boulder River drainage a few miles south and east of the Helena NF boundary. But
some, are from the Continental Divide trail (CDNST) where it runs along the HNF/ B-D NF line.
Since 2006, Wild Things Unlimited of Bozeman has run winter track surveys over a wide area
north and south of MacDonald Pass. Surveys have identified several carnivores, but the primary
targets have been wolverines and lynx. Much of the fieldwork has been done in the upper Little
Blackfoot and Telegraph Creek drainages south of the pass, but areas along the Divide toward
Greenhorn Mountain and in the upper Tenmile drainage have been surveyed as well. Surveys
involve systematic back-tracking and collection of hair, scat and urine samples, which are then
sent to the USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula for DNA analysis [see Gehman
2006; Gehman et al. 2007 to 2010; Pilgrim 2009 to 2010; Pilgrim and Schwartz 2007-2008]. DNA
analysis allows identification of species and individual animals.
In the winter of 2007 to 2008, Wild Things Unlimited tracked lynx through the greater Telegraph
Creek drainage (Telegraph Creek, Hahn Creek, Flume Gulch, Mike Renig Gulch) [LAU DI-04] and
cataloged resting sites and prey kill sites (Gehman et al. 2008) [Figure 25, Figure 26]. The
Rocky Mountain Research Station confirmed that a majority of the tracks had been made by a
single adult male (Pilgrim and Schwartz 2008). Several samples from this area could not be
tagged to an individual, but their pattern suggested the presence of a second lynx. This data
WILDLIFE - 350

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

supports earlier reports by longtime local residents that lynx have been present in the area for
some time (Helena NF wildlife observation files). The Mike Renig/Flume Gulch data are also in
line with photos of an adult lynx in that area from 2006 (Helena NF and MFWP wildlife files).
In the winter of 2008 to 2010, Wild Things Unlimited tracked lynx through accessible reaches of
the Little Blackfoot and Telegraph drainages [LAUs DI-03, DI-04] and also followed animals into
upper Minnehaha Creek in the Tenmile drainage [LAU DI-05] (Gehman et al. 2009). DNA
labwork on samples from these surveys identified the same male that had been present in 2007
to 2008, in addition to an adult female. More limited survey work around Greenhorn Mountain
north of Highway 12 yielded no definitive results for lynx [although wolverines were found].
Fieldwork in the winter of 2009 to 2010 again found numerous signs of adult lynx in the
Telegraph Creek drainage. DNA analysis verified the presence of the same adult male that had
been in the area the previous two years (Pilgrim 2010). Lynx tracks were also followed in the
Mullan Pass area north of U.S. Highway 12, but no DNA samples were taken (Gehman et al.
2010). Behavior patterns deciphered during four seasons of tracking, coupled with the fact that
at least one lynx has been present for three years, is a strong indication that some of these
animals are local residents rather than transients lingering in the area as they make their way
through a linkage zone.

Figure 31and Figure 32, following, illustrate the kinds of habitats where lynx have frequently

been located in the greater Telegraph Creek drainage in winter and in which they have been
able to successfully forage for snowshoe hares. These habitats, while marginal by standards
applied to moist westside and more northerly Forests, have been sufficient to support
snowshoe hares in winter as well as a small group of lynx in the Divide landscape. Over the past
several years, lynx have spent much of the winter in the areas such as those depicted in Figure
31 and Figure 32.

Dispersion is irregular, but there are enough saplings throughout to support snowshoe hares in

Conifer and shrub density is irregular and often fairly open. Nonetheless, lynx have been
documented foraging for snowshoe hares here in winter and probably do so in summer as well.

Snowmobile Trails in Lynx Habitat

Of the 426 miles of regularly-used snowmobile routes in the Travel Plan Area, approximately
349 miles are specifically identified for snowmobile use under the current Travel Plan (Table 99).
Another 77 miles, although shown on the Forest Visitor Map as closed to motorized use yearround, have been regularly used by snowmobiles for the past 25 years. In the absence of any
evidence of resource damage or conflict with other resources, this use has not been challenged
by the Helena NF. [For a more complete discussion of how snowmobile routes have been
classified, see the lynx “Effects” section and Table 96, Table 99 and Table 115; See also the map
of Snowmobile Routes on the Helena National Forest for 2003 and maps for Travel Plan
alternatives].
Snowmobile trail mileage is a relevant parameter because it figures into NRLMD Guideline HU
G11 (expansion of designated over-the-snow routes). Table 96, following, compares the
mileage of regularly used snowmobile routes in potential lynx habitat in the “core occupied
habitat” region north of U.S. Highway 12 and the “secondary occupied habitat” region south of
the highway. These data are for the Divide Travel Plan Area only and do not include those
portions of LAUs di-01 and di-06 that fall outside the Plan Area. An estimated 165 miles of
active snowmobile trails currently pass through potential lynx habitat, resulting in a trail density
of 1.4 mi/mi² in these areas. This trail system has been relatively stable over the last two
decades.
Road miles/densities within LAUs are not addressed by standards or guidelines in the NRLMD.
So, those figures are not provided here. Open road density data for elk and grizzly bear units

Sensitive Species
Species Present
USFS Region 1 issues a revised “sensitive species” list each year, the latest being from August
2014. Currently, six species on the 2014 list are known to inhabit the Divide Travel Plan Area,
although some are rarely observed . These species, gray wolf, wolverine, fisher, flammulated
owl, black-backed woodpecker and boreal toad, are discussed in this section and in the
“Environmental Consequences” analysis later in the report. These sections serve as the
Biological Evaluation for sensitive species in the Travel Plan Area. Species likely to be directly
and measurably affected by Travel Plan alternatives or that inherently generate public
controversy are discussed at greater length. Sensitive species that have not been observed in
the Divide landscape or that pass through only occasionally as transients are summarized briefly
in the following section, but they are not discussed further.

Species Not Present
Sensitive species that are resident elsewhere on the Helena NF but have not been identified in
the Divide landscape are the bighorn sheep, Townsend’s big-eared bat, fringed myotis bat, bald
eagle, peregrine falcon and plains spadefoot toad. The northern bog lemming and harlequin
duck are suspected to occur on the Forest, but have not been positively identified as being
present.
Bighorn sheep inhabited the Divide landscape historically but have not been present since the
late 19th or early 20th century. There is a certain amount of suitable habitat in the Travel Plan
Area, but so far, MFWP has chosen not to reintroduce the sheep and none have migrated in
from neighboring regions. Bighorn sheep populations are at risk primarily from disease. Travel
management issues for the sheep are similar to those affecting elk and mule deer, although on a
more limited scale and in a different assortment of habitats.
The Townsend’s big-eared bat has not been found in the Divide landscape. Bat surveys
conducted on the Helena NF in recent years have located big-eared bats in the Big Belt Range to
the east but not elsewhere on the Forest [Point Observation Database, Montana Natural
Heritage Program (http://mtnhp.org/tracker/HNTMap.aspx)].
Road construction may destroy potential roosting sites in large decadent trees, but once in
place, roads and motor trails have not been demonstrated to have any direct effect on these
bats. Indirect effects may occur where travel routes facilitate human access to bat caves,
abandoned mines and large snags.
Northern bog lemming habitat is present but highly fragmented and uncommon. Bog lemmings
may be present on the Helena NF but they have not yet been reported here. The best habitat is

WILDLIFE - 353

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

on the Lincoln Ranger District west of the Divide. Management of roads and motor trails in
higher elevation riparian and wetland areas is directly related to the welfare of this species.
Bald eagles are occasionally reported in the Divide landscape, but so far, only as transients. For
several years a pair nested west of the Forest boundary along Snowshoe Creek, but these birds
spent virtually all of their time along the lower Little Blackfoot River on private and State land.
This nest is no longer active, but bald eagles are still regularly reported along the lower Little
Blackfoot River several miles west of the Helena NF boundary. Potential nesting, roosting and
foraging habitat is available on the Forest, in particular, along the upper Little Blackfoot River,
but to date no eagles have chosen to occupy it. The Montana Bald Eagle Management Plan
contains guidelines for road management and human access around nest sites that would guide
management if eagles were to establish themselves in this part of the Forest.
Peregrine falcons have been reported in the Divide landscape at various times over the past 20
years, mostly in the vicinity of Mount Helena and around Sheep Mountain just east of the
Helena NF boundary near Clancy. Most observations have been during the spring and fall
migration periods and no eyries are known to have been established. Since 1989, when the
falcons returned to the Helena NF, all known eyries have been in the Big Belt Range.
Management of these birds focuses on keeping recreationists off the cliffs where the eyries are
established. Motorized travel management is seldom an issue.
Harlequin ducks are suspected to be present on the Lincoln District of the Helena NF, but none
have been reported in the Divide landscape. Only marginal habitat is present, mostly on the
upper Little Blackfoot River. Open roads can serve to introduce human disturbance into areas of
otherwise suitable habitat for these reclusive ducks.
The plains spadefoot toad has been found only along the Missouri River below Meriwether
Canyon in the Big Belt Mountains. Its range barely edges onto the Helena NF in an area where
there are no roads.
The leopard frog, once relatively common in and around the Helena NF, including the Divide
landscape, has not been reported in this part of Montana in nearly 20 years. It has almost
certainly been extirpated, probably as a result of global factors (increased ultra-violet radiation,
global warming, the spread of pathogenic chytrid fungus) in addition to local habitat change.
Leopard frogs are still relatively common in parts of eastern Montana. Standard management
for the common spotted frog and the western (boreal) toad will take care of habitat needs for
leopard frogs, if they are in fact still present.

Wolverine
The North American wolverine (Gulo gulo) has been classified as a “sensitive” species in Forest
Service Region 1 for 20 years. The USFWS proposed listing the wolverine as a “threatened
species” under the ESA in February 2013, but, after an 18 month review of the most recent
scientific information, withdrew the proposal in August 2014. As a result, the wolverine is
discussed here as a sensitive species.

Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships
Wolverines are generally solitary animals. They range widely from high alpine regions to lowelevation big game winter ranges but may exhibit some fidelity to particular areas for months or
years. Long-term observations indicate that the species exhibits flexible behavior when

WILDLIFE - 354

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

environmental conditions (such as food supply) change, leading to movement beyond normal
boundaries (Hatler 1989). Wolverine habitat is best defined in terms of adequate year-round
food supplies in large sparsely inhabited areas, rather than in terms of particular topography or
plant associations (Kelsall 1981). However, studies indicate that wolverines select alpine fir
forests over other forest types with some preference for lodgepole pine and western larch
(Hornocker and Hash 1981). Copeland (1996) found that wolverines preferred Douglas-fir
forests in summer and lodgepole pine forests in winter. Generally, habitat use follows distinct
seasonal shifts with higher elevational talus/rock areas preferred in summer, montane conifer
forests in winter and riparian habitats in spring (Copeland 1996). Wolverines also exhibit a
particular affinity for higher elevation alpine habitats that accumulate deep snow in winter.
Preferred ranges appear to be large, isolated tracts of land supporting a diverse prey base
(Hornocker and Hash 1981). Wolverines will range into roaded areas with a modicum of human
activity, but this use often occurs in winter when many of these areas become, because of
winter conditions, “remote”. During summer, wolverines typically move to higher elevations.
These behaviors effectively separate wolverines and humans other than for rare encounters.
Human encroachment into existing refuges may threaten the wolverine’s ability to maintain
basic life history requirements (Copeland and Hudak 1995). Human activity (road building,
developed campgrounds) near subalpine boulder talus sites may eliminate historic foraging or
denning habitat. It has been hypothesized that persistence of wolverines in Montana, despite
unlimited historic trapping and hunting, may be attributed to the presence of designated
wilderness and remote, inaccessible habitat (Hornocker and Hash, 1981).
Wolverines occur in low densities in all places they have been studied. This is generally
attributed to naturally low reproductive rates and delayed sexual maturity as well as the
unreliability of adequate food supplies throughout the year (Banci 1994). Maintenance of large
territories and susceptibility to trapping also play a role (Hatler 1989). Overall, food availability
seems to be the primary factor determining movement and specific habitat use and is probably
the primary limiting factor for wolverine populations (Hornocker and Hash 1981; Hatler 1989).
Although the wolverine is primarily a scavenger, it forages for most of its own food during the
summer. Common foods include the eggs and young of ground nesting birds, burrowing
rodents, snowshoe hares and berries. In winter, wolverines rely on carrion and therefore are
dependent upon the presence of other predators. They establish food caches in winter and are
also adept at seeking out and raiding caches made by other wolverines and other carnivores
such as mountain lions and foxes. Ungulate carrion is a primary winter food item, mountain
goats at higher elevations; elk, deer and moose at low and mid elevations (Banci 1994).
Beginning in late winter, reproducing females establish a series of dens ranging from natal dens
(associated with the birth of kits) to maternal dens (post-birth, pre-weaning) and post weaning
dens (rendezvous sites) (Copeland 1996). Natal dens are established at high elevations, typically
in talus or cirque basins while maternal dens occur in both talus and among fallen trees
(Copeland 1996). Rendezvous sites may occur in talus or coniferous riparian zones. Protection
of natal denning habitat is critical for wolverine persistence.
Data collected in northwestern Montana indicate that average yearly ranges are 262 mi² for
males and 241 mi2 for females (Hornocker and Hash 1981). Although wolverines maintain large
home ranges and can utilize almost any habitat, they are sensitive to human disturbance and
are especially susceptible to trapping because of their opportunistic eating habits. Trapping
accounts for a high proportion of wolverine mortality, affecting even populations that are locally
protected (Squires 2007; Inman 2007; Banci 1994; Hatler 1989).

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Key components of wolverine ecology revealed by research over the past three decades can be
summarized as follows: (1) wolverines need adequate space to maintain populations; (2)
population fragmentation must be avoided to maintain genetic, social and spatial continuity of
subpopulations; (3) the environment must be capable of providing a varied seasonal diet; and
(4) security areas must be available to provide undisturbed seclusion for reproducing females
(Copeland and Hudak 1995).
Recent research suggests that an additional factor of key importance to wolverines is the need
for sites that retain deep snow in the spring. McKelvey and others (2010) have argued that
while wolverines can be considered habitat generalists in many respects, the fact that females
are highly dependent on deep snow for establishing and maintaining viable reproductive dens
ties wolverine populations to areas with persistent spring snow. At present, this includes many
of the major mountain ranges in the northern and central Rockies, as well as the Cascade Range
in Washington and Oregon. The implication of this dependence is that wolverine habitat in
western North America is likely to become smaller and more fragmented as global warming
diminishes the capacity of many sites to provide suitable spring snow cover (McKelvey et al.
2010). This was a primary factor in the USFWS decision in 2010 to designate the wolverine a
candidate for listing as a threatened or endangered species (USDI 2010, p. 78046).

Influence of Forest Roads and Trails
Extensive unroaded or sparsely roaded habitat is often cited as a characteristic component of
wolverine habitat (Claar et al. 1999; Banci 1994; Kelsall 1981), but it is unclear whether this is a
cause-and-effect phenomenon or simply a function of the species’ tendency to inhabit higher
elevation areas inhospitable to most human development. It is also possible that more
wolverines are present in large wildland areas because of lower trapping mortality than occurs
among those animals frequenting environments with ready road and trail access (Banci 1994).
Research throughout the Rocky Mountain region of Canada and the northern U.S. reveals no
definitive conclusions as to whether wolverines are attracted to or avoid Forest roads and trails.
Krebbs et al. (2007) found that roads did not seem to influence habitat associations of male
wolverines. Copeland et al. (2007) found no aversion or attraction of wolverines to maintained
trails, although they noted that, wolverines frequently used snow-packed roads in their study
area as winter travel routes. In reviewing other studies, they noted a general “spatial separation
of wolverines and human-related infrastructure” but did not single out roads as a key factor.
The main impact of roads and motor trails on wolverines comes from their role as snowmobile
routes in winter for trappers and recreationists. They allow trappers to work traplines in
wolverine habitat that they would otherwise have difficulty reaching. Trapping has been cited
as a primary source of wolverine mortality in a variety of studies (see Squires et al. 2007; Inman
et al. 2007; Banci 1994; Hatler 1989; Hash 1987). Roadways also provide snowmobilers with
pathways up to high alpine basins where disturbance of natal denning habitat is negatively
impacting wolverine production in some areas (Claar et al. 1999; Banci 1994; Squires et al.
2007).

Wolverine Habitat

According to Copeland (pers. comm. cited in Hillis and Kennedy 2003) and Squires (pers. comm.
cited in Hillis and Kennedy 2003), wolverines are distributed throughout montane habitats
across USFS Region 1. Highest densities are associated with the main stem of the Rocky

Mountains, extending eastward to the Big Belt Range. Wolverines become relatively scarce in
island and peninsular ranges east and west of the Continental Divide (Ranges such as the Castle,
Little Belt, Snowy, Highwood and Crazy Mountains to the east; the Kettle River, Wallowa and
Blue Mountains to the west).
Locally, a number of potential wolverine safe havens exist in the Travel Plan Area both as
inventoried roadless areas and as undesignated blocks of non-motorized habitat where human
presence is minimal for much of the year. Such blocks larger than 1,500 acres occupy roughly 67
percent of the Travel Plan Area [see discussion of Habitat Connectivity in the Divide Landscape].
While the Helena NF does not manage habitat specifically for wolverines in the Divide
landscape, habitat management for other wildlife species serves to benefit wolverines.
Ungulate carrion is a major food source and management of elk and deer at levels sufficient to
provide for hunting enhances the potential for this resource. Management for elk security also
provides large blocks of non-motorized habitat that may provide incidental havens for
wolverines [see previous discussion of elk security areas]. In addition, management aimed at
improving connectivity of wildland habitat enhances the ability of wolverines to move
throughout the Divide and improves prospects for survival [see the discussion on Dispersal,
Fragmentation and Linkage].
The Helena NF has mapped natal denning habitat for wolverines across the Forest using a model
developed by the USFS Northern Regional office (Missoula). The model focuses on identifying
high mountain basins, rockslides, steep slopes and other alpine terrain where woody and rocky
debris along with deep snow are likely to accumulate. And while field investigation indicates
that some areas in the Divide landscape meet these criteria (areas around Nevada and Black
Mountains, Lee Mountain, Red Mountain, Cliff Mountain/ Electric Peak, Jericho Mountain,
Thunderbolt Mountain, Bison Mountain, Luttrell Peak), none were identified by the model.
Most potential wolverine denning habitat in the Divide landscape is immune from snowmobile
use because of land allocation status (the Helena NF prohibits snowmobiles in most of the
Electric Peak Roadless Area, for example) or by virtue of inhospitable terrain and forest
structure that makes snowmobile travel off established trails extremely difficult, if not
impossible.

Wolverine Occurrence
Reports of wolverines in the Divide landscape south of Highway 12 have been infrequent but
consistent over the past two decades. Most observations have come from upper Telegraph
Creek (from long-term local residents). Others have come from around Jericho Mountain, the
Occidental plateau and areas near Lava Mountain. In 1995, a wolverine was trapped in Cataract
Basin on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF just south of the Helena NF boundary.
More recently, winter tracking surveys by Wild Things Unlimited (Bozeman, MT) have found
wolverines along the Continental Divide both north and south of Highway 12 and in other parts
of the Little Blackfoot watershed over a four year period (2007 to 2011). DNA analysis of scat
and hair from 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 surveys verified the presence of two male
wolverines (Gehman et al. 2009, p. 5; Pilgrim and Schwartz 2008; Pilgrim 2009). These animals
range widely in the central and southern parts of the Travel Plan area and exhibit movement
and behavior patterns consistent with those of local residents rather than those of transients
moving through a linkage zone. In the fall of 2008, a hunter photographed a large adult

wolverine on an elk gut-pile in the vicinity of Greenhorn Mountain north of Mullan Pass [Figure
33]. Track surveys in 2008 to 2009 identified fresh wolverine sign in this area as well.

Figure 33 - Photo 22: An adult wolverine
An adult wolverine photographed by a hunter in the northern part of the Divide landscape in the
fall of 2008. This may be one of the resident males tracked by Wild Things Unlimited between
2007 and 2011.

In the past, wolverines have been reported just north of the Travel Plan area in the upper Little
Prickly Pear drainage and on the Lincoln Ranger District. Surveys from 2009 to 2012 continued
to locate wolverines in the same general areas as in previous years. So, it is likely that
wolverines have been resident in the Divide landscape in low numbers for several years.
Breeding activity, however, remains an unknown quantity.

Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf
It should be noted at the outset that the legal status of the northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf
(Canis lupus irremotus) in the Divide landscape has changed from “endangered” to “sensitive”
and back again several times since the original version of this assessment was developed.
Currently (early 2015), the wolf is classified as a USFS Northern Region “sensitive” species,
having been removed from the Endangered Species list in Montana and Idaho by an Act of
Congress in March 2011. Irrespective of this shifting legal ground, Helena NF management of
the wolf in the Divide landscape has remained more or less constant, grounded in basic
guidance of the Wolf Recovery Plan (1987) and the Montana Wolf Conservation and
Management Plan (2004).

Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships

WILDLIFE - 358

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Gray wolves are capable of inhabiting virtually any kind of natural habitat occupied by ungulates
or other large prey in temperate regions. Acceptable habitat includes forests of all types,
rangelands, shrubland, steppes, deserts, wetlands, alpine regions, tundra and barren ground
areas, as well as human-influenced environments such as agricultural lands and logged forests.
Wolves do not have any particular habitat requirement other than a preference for avoiding
areas with heavy human use whenever possible (USDI 1987).
Wolf packs occupy specific territories, typically ranging from 125 km2 to 550 km2 (Mech 1970
cited in Tucker 1988; Peterson 1977 cited in Tucker 1988). The number of individuals in a pack
and the availability of prey determine territory size (USDI et al. 2003). Daily pack movements
vary, as do seasonal movements: distances traveled are greater in winter than in summer. Lone
wolves cover larger areas than packs and their ranges may overlap two or three pack territories
(Mech 1973 cited in Tucker 1988; Fritts and Mech 1981 cited in Tucker 1988).
Wolves are generally not considered migratory but they may wander great distances within
their home ranges searching for prey. When local population increases, young adults disperse
to new areas, the primary source of new wolves that appear regularly in the Divide landscape.
Vegetative cover affects wolf survival by providing shelter for prey such as deer and elk and as a
means for quickly eluding humans. In general, healthy wolves themselves need little cover to
deal with heat, cold, or severe weather (Mech 1970 cited in Tucker 1988).
Wolf dens, for bearing and protecting pups, may be inhabited year after year, though pups are
sometimes moved from one den to another. Den sites are typically dug in sandy and welldrained soils near water, although they can be located in a variety of landforms (Mech 1970
cited in Tucker 1988; Fritts 1982 cited in Tucker 1988). Aside from these local site conditions,
the primary condition allowing successful wolf reproduction is isolation from human meddling.
Wolves typically hunt in packs but they may do so individually as well (Mech 1970 cited in
Tucker 1988; Fritts 1982 cited in Tucker 1988). Wolves prey primarily on large wild mammals
such as deer, elk, moose, bison and bighorn sheep (Kunkel et al. 1999; MFWP 2003). However,
they are opportunistic foragers and will take advantage of other foods, including domestic
livestock, dogs, small and midsized mammals (such as ground squirrels or beavers) , birds
(particularly grouse and waterfowl), fish, green vegetation and fruits, depending on their
availability and ease of capture (Kunkel et al. 1999). Wolves are also successful scavengers.
Because of the impact that wolves, as top predators, may have on domestic livestock and big
game populations, their presence on the Montana landscape inevitably stirs controversy.
MFWP has conducted intensive research on wolf-ungulate relationships in the greater
Yellowstone area (GYA) and southwest Montana (2001 to 2008) and continues to pursue less
intensive but more widespread monitoring throughout the rest of the state (Sime et al. 2010, p.
25-29). They have found that while elk (particularly elk calves) are the primary wolf prey in
Yellowstone and the southwest, white-tailed deer are the most common ungulate prey in the
northern half of the state, including the area around Helena. They found that, in spite of much
public opinion to the contrary, elk calf and adult female survival rates in most of southwest
Montana and the GYA following the return of wolves have been similar to rates prior to wolf
restoration. However, in certain areas with high predator-to-prey ratios (typically involving both
wolves and bears and sometimes mountain lions), elk numbers have declined substantially.
These areas include the northern Yellowstone, Gallatin Canyon and Madison-Firehole winter
ranges, as well as the West Fork of the Bitterroot (Sime et al. 2010, p. 27).

WILDLIFE - 359

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

MFWP also concluded that “some areas in Montana are unsuitable to wolves because livestock
depredations continually lead to wolf removals, preventing wolves from increasing to densities
that are seen in protected areas. In these areas, wolves are probably less likely to limit ungulate
populations than in areas where depredation removals do not limit wolf survival and population
growth” (Sime et al. 2010, p. 29). The greater Helena area, including the Divide landscape and
its neighboring ranchlands, appears to be one of these areas where predation on livestock
occurs at low levels but is an ongoing problem and where consequent wolf removals will
inevitably prevent wolves from having any measurable effect on big game populations.
Just to the north in the Big Blackfoot River Valley, an overabundance of wolves, black bears,
grizzly bears and mountain lions appears to be a primary determinant of local elk and deer
population configurations. However, the same is not true for the greater Helena and Little
Blackfoot Valleys that flank the Divide landscape. Elk populations are not declining in these
areas and other population parameters (calf production, bull/cow ratios) remain more or less
where they have been for the past several years [see MFWP post-season aerial elk surveys for
HD 343, 335, 293, 215: 1999-2011].
Most of the difficulty that hunters have had in bagging elk in and around the Divide Travel Plan
Area in recent years appears to be a function of (1) mild fall weather, which allows elk a broad
spectrum of far-flung escape areas and (2) the increasing tendency of elk to seek out private
lands in the fall where they are safe from most public hunting. Elk population decline due to
wolf predation is not a problem in the Divide landscape.

Influence of Roads
Wolves are not impeded by most Forest roads and in fact, often use primitive roads with low
traffic volume as travelways any time of year. Wolves are also attracted to road corridors that
focus prey, as when deer graze roadside green-up or rabbits concentrate in roadside brush. On
the other hand, some studies have worked out road density thresholds above which wolf pack
activity is suppressed. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, average threshold road density was
determined to be 0.72 mi/mi² (Mladenoff et al. 1995 cited in Forman et al. 2003). Whether or
not this density applies to National Forest road systems in the west has not been determined.
But given the facility with which wolf packs have made use of ranchlands and well-roaded
portions of the Helena NF in the last 15 years [weighted summer open road density in the Travel
Plan Area averages 0.81 mi/mi²], it seems likely that at least in parts of their territories, wolves
are able to deal with road densities higher than the Wisconsin thresholds.
While few roads on the Helena NF allow vehicle speeds high enough to threaten wolves, U.S.
Highway 12 in the center of the Travel Plan area has proven deadly in the past [at least one
adult having been killed on the highway near MacDonald Pass in 2002]. Roads may also be
indirectly lethal in that they funnel hunters and other Forest users with rifles into areas occupied
by wolves, leading to inadvertent or deliberate shooting. So far, however, neither strikes on the
highway nor illegal/accidental shooting have been significant road-related factors in wolf
mortality on the Helena NF since wolves began arriving in this area in the late 1980s.

Wolf Management
Wolf Recovery Plan
The Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf (Canis lupus irremotus) was listed as an endangered
species in 1973. Since 1987, wolf recovery has proceeded according to steps outlined in the
Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan (USDI 1987). The Plan was designed to provide
WILDLIFE - 360

Environmental Impact Statement

direction and coordination for recovery efforts. It is not a decision-making document, however
and has been modified as new information has become available, species status has changed
and tasks have been completed.
In 1994, the Final Rule on the Establishment of a Nonessential Experimental Population of Gray
Wolves (50 CFR Part 17) allowed reintroduction of wolves into the Greater Yellowstone and
Central Idaho Wolf Recovery Areas. It also expanded the size of the three insular recovery areas
delineated in the Wolf Recovery Plan. The Greater Yellowstone and Central Idaho Areas were
enlarged to include the entire state of Wyoming, most of Idaho and the southern half of
Montana. These two areas came to be referred to as “Experimental Population Areas” rather
than “Recovery Areas”. The third area, the Northwest Montana Recovery Area, originally within
the Bob Marshal Wilderness complex, was expanded to encompass the northern half of
Montana and the Idaho Panhandle [Sime et al. 2008, 2009, 2010]. The Divide Travel Plan Area is
located in the southwestern sector of the Northwest Montana Recovery Area.
In assessing the potential impacts of Helena NF projects on wolves, we apply relevant provisions
of the Wolf Recovery Plan and look to the most recent research findings and management
advice from MFWP and USFWS wolf biologists to deal with specific local issues. In general, we
focus on (1) protecting active denning and rendezvous sites from human interference, (2)
maintaining abundant big game as a prey base, (3) reducing factors that might lead to negative
confrontation with humans (open roads, untended livestock) and (4) retaining sufficient forest
cover to provide for local screening and concealment [see Oakleaf et al. 2006; USDI 1987].

Wolf Reintroduction and Dispersal
In 1995 and 1996, a total of 66 wolves from Alberta were introduced into the Greater
Yellowstone and Central Idaho Recovery Areas. In the absence of competition from resident
wolves, these animals quickly established robust populations. While the Yellowstone National
Park population appeared to have stabilized by 2009 to 2010, the Greater Yellowstone
population as a whole was continuing to expand. Likewise, the central Idaho population
continued to increase in distribution and abundance (Sime et al. 2008, 2009, 2010). However,
the introduction of wolf hunting seasons in Idaho and Montana since 2010 has now inserted a
new dynamic into the population equations, the outcome of which remains at issue.
No reintroduction has been needed in the Northwest Montana Recovery Area, as natural
southward migration of wolves from Canada has been gradually populating this region since the
mid-1980s and continues to do so [personal observation: Yaak River drainage 1984 to 87, Big
Hole Valley 1987 to 1992, Helena NF Divide and Blackfoot landscapes 1991 to present] [see also
Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Annual Reports 1995 to 2013; Interagency Annual Reports (Sime
et al. 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010)]. Annual population increase in this recovery area has been
varied, but the overall trend has been upward. Wolf populations in Montana as a whole
increased 34 percent in 2007, 18 percent in 2008, four percent in 2009, eight percent in 2010
and 15 percent in 2011 [see Table 97].
Increasingly, wolves are moving between the Northwest Montana and Central Idaho Recovery
Areas, enough so that the two populations appear to be gradually merging (Sime et al. 2008).
There is little movement, however, from these areas into the Greater Yellowstone Recovery
Area, a function, apparently, of low quality dispersal habitat (Oakleaf et al. 2006) and of the high
wolf density in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. On the other hand, wolves from the greater
Yellowstone area in northern Wyoming and southern Montana are now beginning to show up in

WILDLIFE - 361

the more northerly reaches of that experimental population area and occasionally, in the
Northwest Montana Recovery Area (see examples in Sime et al. 2010, p. 47-67).
The Divide Travel Plan Area lies entirely within the Northwest Montana Recovery Area, near its
eastern edge). Individual wolves began to be regularly reported in the Divide landscape in the
late 1980s and the first resident pack was identified in 1995 (in the Telegraph Creek drainage of
the upper Little Blackfoot watershed). The number of packs on the Helena NF has waxed and
waned over the past 17 years, with most mortality stemming from management actions by
State and Federal agencies attempting to minimize predation on livestock. Until 2010, all
verified packs on the Helena NF had been located in the Blackfoot and Divide landscapes, which
provide the primary north-south dispersal zone for wolves moving southward from northern
populations. In 2010, a pack was identified in the Elkhorn landscape and in 2011 and 2012,
multiple wolves were reported in the central Big Belt landscape.

State Wolf Management and the Delisting Process 2004 to 2011
By the end of 2002, the biological requirements for wolf recovery in the northern Rockies had
been met (at least 10 breeding packs each in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming for three
consecutive years). State management plans for Idaho and Montana were in place by 2004 and
in 2004 to 2005, day-to-day management of wolves in Montana was transferred from the
USFWS to MFWP. The Wyoming state plan (though considered marginal by the USFWS) was
tentatively approved in early 2008, allowing the USFWS to proceed with delisting.
The USFWS removed the northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf from the Endangered Species list
in February 2008. However, litigation led to a court injunction (July 2008) and eventually,
restoration of wolves to the list (October 2008). The primary rationale for this action stemmed
from the relatively low genetic diversity measured in the Greater Yellowstone wolf population
and the uncertainty as to long-term prospects for wolves under State management programs
(particularly in Wyoming).
Given these circumstances, the USFWS revised its original delisting order and removed the wolf
from the Endangered Species List (May 2009) in Montana and Idaho where State management
plans were deemed adequate and where effective genetic interchange between subpopulations
appeared to be occurring. Unlike Yellowstone, where wolves were reintroduced from two
Canadian populations of Mackenzie Valley wolves, the Northwest Montana Recovery Area has
been repopulated by wolves naturally migrating in from a variety of areas to the north, a
circumstance that may be producing a more genetically diverse population (although this has
not yet been verified by systematic studies).
Following standard procedure, USFS Region 1 then added the wolf to its Sensitive Species List.
Shortly thereafter, environmental groups again took the USFWS to court seeking to reinstate
endangered species status and in August 2010, Federal District Court in Missoula ruled that the
Service could not drop the wolf from the List in some states (Montana and Idaho) and continue
to list it in another (Wyoming). The wolf thus returned to its pre-May-2009 status as an
“endangered” species in the Divide landscape. Once again, local ranchers could take wolves
that were actively chasing or attacking livestock only if authorized by a permit from the USFWS.
In April 2011, after a negotiated agreement between environmental groups and the USFWS to
again delist the wolf was scuttled by Federal District Court, the U.S. Congress approved a
measure to remove the wolf from the Endangered Species List in Montana, Idaho and parts of
Washington, Oregon and Utah as of June 2011. While this action circumvents the traditional
pathway for delisting a species (with regard to the role of the courts), the terms essentially
WILDLIFE - 362

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

reinstate the USFWS’s 2009 science-based delisting order. That is, wolves are removed from the
Endangered Species List and placed under state management in areas that support viable wolf
populations and are covered by management plans designed to maintain those populations.
The upshot for the Helena NF is that wolves are again classified as a “sensitive” species. While
this new categorization may change the way in which local ranchers deal with problem wolves
around their livestock operations, it does not alter management strategy for the Helena NF,
which will continue to manage the wolf as a relatively uncommon top carnivore within the
ecosystem.

Wolf Hunting Seasons 2009 to 2012
In 2009, the State of Montana initiated its first “fair chase” wolf hunting season. The state was
divided into three large wolf management units (WMUs) with an overall quota of 75 wolves.
The hunt was initially slated to coincide with the big game rifle season (October 25 to November
29); however, the quota was reached by mid-November and the season was closed at that
point. Although MFWP had predicted that approximately 590 wolves would remain following
the season, the year-end estimate put the population at 524 animals. This amounted to a net
increment of 27 wolves over the 2008 population, but it represented an abatement in the rate
of increase from previous years (Sime et al. 2010).
In 2010, the planned hunt was cancelled as wolves were returned to the Endangered Species
List in August of that year. In 2011, a statewide quota of 220 wolves was set across 14 WMUs.
MFWP expected that if the hunting quota were met and added to mortality from other sources,
the wolf population would be reduced from around 565 wolves in 2010 to around 425 animals
in 2011. But even with the season extended to mid-February 2012, only 152 wolves were
harvested. This, combined with fewer dead wolves via agency control (because of lower
livestock losses), resulted in a year-end wolf population of about 653 animals, notably higher
than the predicted 425 (Hanauska-Brown et al. 2012).
Given these results, the State doubled down in 2012 with a wolf hunting season extending from
September 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013. With the exception of two of the now 17 WMUs, no
quotas were set for the number of animals that could be taken. In addition, a wolf trapping
season extending from December 15 to February 28 was initiated. By the end of the season,
hunters had harvested 128 and trappers had taken 97 wolves
(http://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/management/wolf). For 2013 to 2014, the hunting/trapping
season was extended to March 15, resulting in 143 wolves shot and 87 trapped. In its 2013
annual report (Bradley et al. 2014), MFWP noted that between 2012 and 2013, the statewide
wolf population increased by only two animals (from 627 to 627 wolves), essentially no increase
at all. Population data for 2014 are not yet available, but it appears that the current level of
hunting and trapping, combined with management removals and natural mortality, is holding
the wolf population near its present size
(http://fwp.mt.gov/fishAndWildlife/management/wolf).
Although the state is divided into 17 management units and MFWP has the authority to stop
hunting in any given district if local circumstances dictate, the system has so far proven unable
to bring greater hunting pressure to bear on areas with real wolf predation problems (involving
livestock and/or big game) and to tread lightly in areas where wolves are causing few problems.
In mid-December 2012, the Department did attempt to shut down hunting in two small areas
north of Yellowstone National Park where wolves that had been collared for research purposes
in the Park were being killed. A court order, however, prevented the ban from going into effect.

After five years, the wolf hunt is still a work in progress and future adjustments to the system
can be expected.

Area Use
Gray Wolf: Region-Wide Status
The wolf population in Montana increased from around 35 animals in 1990 to over 650 by the
end of 2011. Numbers have declined by about four percent since then, presumably because of
additional mortality generated by the wolf hunting and trapping season. Table 97 shows the
population trajectory of wolves in Montana over the past 10 years [from Montana Gray Wolf
Conservation and Management Annual Reports, 2004 to 2013]. Given the intensity of ongoing
field monitoring, these numbers should be an accurate reflection of the actual size of the
Montana wolf population.

Year

The Montana wolf population increased by an average of 24 percent per year from 2004 to
2011, although with decreasing frequency as State wolf hunts began to take a toll beginning in
2009. As can be seen in Table 97, although overall numbers have declined since 2011, the
number of packs has continued to increase, with an average annual increment of 13 packs per
year. Given the slight decline in overall numbers, it would appear that hunting and trapping is
reducing average pack size but not the number packs being formed. The number of breeding
packs, however, which increased steadily from 1990 through 2008, reached a relative plateau
after that point and in fact, declined markedly in 2013. So it may be that hunting and trapping is
beginning to generate a wolf population with more small non-breeding packs. Whether or not
this pattern continues to develop and its implications for wildlife populations and domestic
livestock remain to be seen.
Regionwide, the USFWS estimated that the total population in the Northern Rockies was at least
1,706 wolves (115 breeding pairs; 242 packs) by the end of 2009. This was up from an
estimated 1,645 wolves (95 breeding pairs; 217 packs) at the end of 2008, an increase of almost
four percent (USFWS et al. 2010). An estimated 1,000 pups were born in these areas in the
spring of 2009 (Ed Bangs, USFWS Wolf Coordinator, quoted in the Helena Independent Record,
June 3, 2009). By the end of 2013, four years after the initiation of recreational wolf hunting in
Montana and Idaho, the USFWS estimates a Northern Rocky Mountain population of at least
1,691 wolves in 320 packs, 78 of which represent breeding pairs. This is essentially the same

total population estimated for 2009 and as with the Montana portion of the population, pack
numbers are up while the number of breeding pairs has dropped. The population has thus more
or less plateaued and consists of a larger number of small non-breeding packs than prior to
regulated hunting and trapping.
While the population is likely to decline further in the future if State hunting and trapping
quotas and seasons are expanded, the USFWS expects that the long term average will be at least
1,000 wolves (USFWS et al. 2013). The Service also notes that the Northern Rocky Mountain
population now represents a genetically viable 400-mile southern range extention of the
contiguous wolf population of Canada and Alaska, a population that includes roughly 65,000
wolves (USFWS et al. 2013).

Gray Wolf: Local Occurrence 1995-2007

While the Montana wolf population as a whole is secure, the persistence of individual wolf
packs across the landscape is dynamic, with new packs forming and established packs failing to
persist for a variety of reasons (Sime et al. 2010, p. 12). Five wolf packs have been active in and
around the Divide landscape at various times since 1995 (although two of the packs have
formed from the remnants of previous packs).
The Boulder pack (1995 to 2000) originally denned in upper Telegraph Creek in the Little
Blackfoot watershed in 1995 and then moved southward into the Boulder River drainage on the
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, where it spent most of the next five years, sometimes
ranging northward back onto the Helena NF. This pack preyed on livestock often enough that it
was the subject of multiple control actions, a circumstance that led to its eventual demise.
The Castle Rock pack (2001 to 2003) was partially descended from the Boulder pack and
centered its range west of the Helena NF boundary in the Spotted Dog Creek drainage. It
operated on the National Forest, ranging eastward into the upper Little Blackfoot, as well as
throughout the extensive private ranchland to the west. It, too, eventually concentrated
enough on domestic livestock that management agencies (led by USFWS) removed all but a
remnant.
The Spotted Dog pack (2004 to 2007) formed from a surviving female of the Castle Rock pack
and a newly arrived male. It ranged through roughly the same territory as the Castle Rock pack
and like its predecessor, ran afoul of management agencies over livestock predation. It was
dramatically reduced in size in 2006 to 2007 and no remnant members were detected after
2007.
The Halfway pack (2002 to 2004) was established by migrants coming down through the AvonHelmville valley and the Garnet Mountain Range. Its local range was immediately north of the
Castle Rock pack, generally north of Highway 12 in the Avon and Little Blackfoot valleys and
surrounding National Forest lands. It, too, was subject to management reduction because of its
proficiency in preying on livestock. It faded away about the same time as the Castle Rock pack.
[See Figure 39 for a view of the Spotted Dog Creek country throughout which the previous four
packs operated over a 10-year period].
The Great Divide pack (2002 to 2003) initially denned in the Marysville area but soon came to
center its activities near the Mullan tunnel atop the Continental Divide. It was a small pack to
begin with and after its alpha female was killed on Highway 12 near MacDonald Pass in 2002, it
had difficulty maintaining itself (J. Fontaine, personal communication, 2003). Field personnel

from the USFWS and MFWP were unable to locate wolves in the area after 2003 and concluded
that the remnants of the pack had dissipated or not survived.

Gray Wolf: Local Status 2008 to 2011
Since 2008, MFWP biologists have monitored a variety of wolf activity in the Divide landscape.
In the fall of 2008 Helena NF field personnel and field trackers from Wild Things Unlimited
(Bozeman) noted numerous signs of wolves in the upper Little Blackfoot watershed (Flume
Gulch, Jericho Mountain, Little Blackfoot River) [HNF wildlife observation files]. Also in the fall
of 2008, MFWP received reports of wolves and wolf sign from hunters in the Tenmile drainage
just east of the Divide (Sime et al. 2009). Wolf sightings in the vicinity of Rimini in the Tenmile
drainage have continued into 2011, although no pack activity has been substantiated. Individual
wolves have also been sighted north of Highway 12 several times since 2008, one animal having
been photographed at Priest Pass in 2009 (Sime et al. 2010, p. 67).
While no regular activity from packs with breeding pairs has been confirmed in the Divide
landscape since 2007, a group of seven wolves was photographed near Stemple Pass just north
of the Helena RD boundary in October 2010 (Helena NF wildlife observation file). MFWP has
been monitoring several packs within a few miles of the landscape to the north, northeast and
west. Given the mobility of wolves, any of these packs could have ranged into the Travel Plan
Area in the past four years. Of these wolves, the Elevation Mountain pack (Garnet Range/ Avon
Valley), the Nevada Creek pack (Helmville/ Avon Valley) and the Mitchell Mountain Pack (Sieben
Ranch/ Little Prickly Pear Creek) had been eliminated by Wildlife Services by early 2010
following persistent livestock predation (Sime et al. 2010, p. 52-63; MT Wolf Program Weekly
Reports 2010).
The Sixmile pack (Avon Valley, just west of the Travel Plan Area) appeared in 2009 and was also
slated for reduction because of livestock predation, but it managed to evade capture. MFWP
had difficulty locating and monitoring these animals (Sime et al. 2010, p. 63): The pack was
composed of at least five wolves at the end of 2009 and at least seven wolves by the end of
2010. Discovery of wolf-killed cattle between Avon and Helmville in June 2011 suggested that
this pack was still active at that time (MFWP Weekly Wolf Reports).
In the spring of 2011, a small group of adult wolves began preying on calves in the Little
Blackfoot valley between Elliston and Avon a few miles west of the Helena NF. This group may
have had some connection to the Sixmile pack, but it was not believed to be a coherent pack in
itself (K. Glazier, personal communication, June 2011). After a period, all four animals were
killed by USFS Wildlife Services at the request of MFWP in June 2011. It is not known whether
members of the pack had bred and produced offspring, no natal den having been located.
After mid 2010, wildlife Services moved in on another pack, the Canyon Creek pack, a few miles
northeast of the Travel Plan Area, somewhat south of the old Mitchell Mountain pack’s
territory. These animals had been killing livestock and after a series of removals, the pack was
reduced to the point that cattle losses ceased to be an obvious problem, although it took nearly
two years..
All of these packs, as well as most of those that have frequented the Divide landscape in the
past, have eventually preyed on livestock such that USFWS or MFWP have felt obligated to
remove (via USDA Wildlife Services) all or most pack members. This is one of the areas in the
state where livestock predation by wolves, while not widespread, is so persistent when it occurs
that wolf population densities will never approach those of backcountry and protected areas
(such as Yellowstone or Glacier NPs) or other areas of high ungulate density (such as the Big

Blackfoot River valley or the West Fork of the Bitterroot). Livestock depredation in and around
the Divide landscape will continually lead to wolf removals. As a result, wolf impacts on local big
game populations should continue to be minimal (Sime et al. 2010, p. 29).
At present, only one identified wolf pack is operating in or near the Divide Travel Plan Area, the
Ophir Creek pack, along the north border. Wildlife Services has removed some members of the
pack, which now appears to consist of four wolves. A second group has been identified via
tracks and observation along the southern boundary of the Travel Plan Area near Cataract
Meadows on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF, but little is known of it. We have picked up a few
fortuitous observations of individuals or small groups of wolves in or near the Travel Plan Area
over the past couple years, in Flume Gulch, the South Fork of Quartz Creek, near Luttrell Peak
and west of the Forest boundary toward Avon. So, wolves are present, but their numbers are
small and their impact on local prey populations is minimal.

Fisher
Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships
The fisher (Pekania pennanti) is a small to mid-sized carnivore strongly associated with
structurally complex forest stands, most often at low and middle elevations rather than in high
montane forests (Powell and Zielinski 1994). In the Rocky Mountains, fishers most often use
stands dominated by grand fir, Engelmann spruce and lodgepole pine (Jones 1991). Old-growth
and mature riparian forests provide particularly good habitat. Fishers make use of hollow logs,
standing tree cavities and dense tree crowns (often witch’s brooms) for denning, rearing young,
resting and general refuge (Jones 1991). They prey on a variety of small and mid-sized mammals
(snowshoe hares, porcupines, squirrels, voles), as well as birds and carrion (Heinemeyer and
Jones 1994). This diverse diet makes them less vulnerable to shifts in prey abundance than lynx
and other predators that rely heavily on one or two prey species.
Like lynx and marten, fishers avoid large openings (parks, meadows, early-seral clearcuts and
burns). Also, like other forest carnivores, fishers maintain low population densities and range
widely in search of prey and of key habitats (structurally complex forest) (Powell and Zielinski
1994). Because of their aversion to openings, they seek out forested connections between the
habitat sites in which they focus activity (Powell and Zielinski 1994). These connecting habitats
may consist of any number of forest formations and seral stages and do not necessarily exhibit
the complex structure and prey density of preferred habitat sites (Heinemeyer and Jones 1994).
The importance to fishers of riparian and wetland forest has been noted by researchers in
several areas of North America, including Idaho (Jones 1991) and Montana (Heinemeyer and
Jones 1994). In Montana, fishers prefer areas within 200 meters of water (Heinemeyer and
Jones 1994). Investigators have documented that riparian corridors are often used as travel
routes (Heinemeyer and Jones 1994). Jones (1991) suggests that preferred resting habitat and
prey are more available in forested riparian areas.
Beginning in the 19th century, fisher populations were decimated throughout most of western
North America by trapping, which continued unabated into the 1930s and by loss of key habitat
to logging. Fisher populations have rebounded naturally in some areas and have been
reintroduced in others (as in the Cabinet Range of northwest Montana, 1988 to 90). Still, fisher
numbers remain low in the northern Rockies, leaving local populations more vulnerable to
decimating factors than species with larger, more diverse populations. Given its inherently low
WILDLIFE - 367

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

population density, the fisher is likely to remain on the Northern Region Sensitive species list for
the foreseeable future. A recent biological status review by the USFWS has determined that the
fisher population in the northern Rockies of the U.S. (Idaho and Montana) is a “Distinct
Population Segment of the species”. But the Service also determined that based on its current
conservation status and the nature of potential threats, the fisher does not warrant listing under
the Endangered Species Act at this time (Federal Register: FWS-R6ES-2010-0017, June 30, 2011).

Influence of Roads and Trails
Fishers are not averse to crossing roads and snowmobile trails or using them as travel routes in
winter, as long as they are associated with mature forest cover. Overall, research has found no
consistent relationship between fisher habitat use and open road density, although the absence
of obvious or statistically valid patterns may be simply a function of insufficient research effort
to date. High-traffic roads that run along forested stream bottoms probably reduce the
attractiveness of otherwise suitable sites for birthing and raising young but they do not seem to
prohibit use of the areas for hunting and resting. Several authors recommend against
construction of loop routes in riparian areas, since these tend to encourage human traffic in
general and trappers in particular [see Heinemeyer and Jones 1994; Claar et al. 1999].
As is the case with lynx and wolverines, one of the primary threats that open roads pose to
fishers comes from their role as snowmobile routes for trappers in winter. Fishers are curious
and opportunistic and they are prone to being caught in traps set for marten and other
furbearers, as well as for themselves (Douglas and Strickland 1987). In some areas, this is a
significant source of mortality, especially where snowmobile routes pass through forested
riparian bottoms, old-growth stands and forested saddles (Heinemeyer and Jones 1994).
Removal of large snags from the road corridor by firewood cutters is another indirect effect,
although its import is related to the availability of such components elsewhere in the landscape.
Fishers use cavities in dead trees for resting, concealment and protection of young.

Area Use
Local Occurrence
Fishers have seldom been reported in the Divide landscape and only one observation has been
verified in the last 20 years [on Meyers Hill at the northern edge of the Travel Plan Area in 1997
(Helena NF, MFWP wildlife observation files)]. Two probable observations (of tracks and an
animal) have come from Ontario Creek toward the southern end of the Plan Area. Winter track
surveys over the last five winters along the Continental Divide and in the Little Blackfoot
watershed (Wild Things Unlimited) have detected no sign of fishers. Recent hair snag surveys
targeting fishers across the Helena NF (Pilgrim 2007, 2008) found no evidence that fishers were
present in the Divide landscape but did locate them on the Lincoln Ranger District just to the
north. Fishers have been caught by trappers on the Lincoln District in recent years as well.
Given these results and the fact that Forestwide surveys did not find fishers in either the Big Belt
or Elkhorn Ranges just to the east, it appears that the Divide landscape may be the eastern
extent of the fisher’s geographical range [see also map from Maj and Garton 1993 cited in
Heinemeyer and Jones 1994].

Local Habitat
In the Divide landscape, most suitable habitat, low/mid elevation mature and old-growth
riparian forest, is present only in relatively small plots, with more marginal habitat available in
larger blocks. This habitat is patchy in that it is separated, often by some distance, from other
WILDLIFE - 368

Environmental Impact Statement

such tracts; but these sites are usually interconnected via forest habitat that, while unsuitable
for long-term residence, provides an adequate travel environment.
The ongoing bark beetle epidemic across the Divide landscape is proving a double-edged sword
for fishers, increasing snag and log density (both key habitat elements) while eliminating live
forest canopy cover. Its impact, either way, will be limited since most habitat changes are
occurring in drier upland pine forests, rather than in riparian sites. But where lodgepole or
ponderosa pine lies adjacent to or intrudes into such riparian forests, there exists some
potential for new combinations of fisher habitat components.

Black-backed Woodpecker
Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships
The black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a primary cavity nester in coniferous forests.
They excavate their own nest cavities in a variety of live or dead tree species and as with many
woodpeckers, play a key role in creating holes later used by other birds and mammals
(secondary cavity nesters) (Dixon and Saab 2000). Engelmann spruce, Douglas fir, lodgepole
pine, ponderosa pine and western larch are all used as nest trees. Black-backed woodpeckers
forage almost exclusively on the larvae of bark beetles and wood-boring beetles that inhabit
dying and newly-dead trees. Home range size varies from around 180 to 810 acres depending
on habitat quality.
Black-backed woodpeckers are largely restricted to early post-fire forests (Hutto 1995) and
while they can survive in other habitats in low numbers, they appear to require a regular
recurrence of new burns for long-term survival (Kotliar et al. 2002). They arrive in burned-over
forest within the first year following a fire and remain for up to six years, as long as the post-fire
supply of wood-boring insects remain sufficient, but their local population usually peaks in three
to four years (Hutto 1995). The woodpeckers are far more abundant in burned forests than in
any other forest configuration. They are much less frequently observed in live mature forests,
even those where snags are common.
For many decades in the 20th century, black-backed woodpecker populations were depressed by
effective fire suppression, frequent salvage logging and to a lesser extent, by insect eradication
(Hutto 1995). In the last few years, as crown fires have increased in size and intensity on the
Helena NF and throughout the west in general (due to suppression-generated fuel build-ups),
habitat opportunities for black-backed woodpeckers have been increasing.
Black-backed woodpeckers also occur in unburned landscapes where insect infestations, severe
winter weather, or other phenomena have produced high densities of dead or dying trees with
bark beetles and woodborer beetles. But, population density in these habitats is inevitably low,
one possible explanation being that the largely black birds are less visible in fire-blackened snag
aggregates (Dixon and Saab 2000, p. 2) and thus less vulnerable to predation than in other snagrich habitats. Whatever the reason, recent research focused in Montana suggests that networks
of recently burned forest, not just recently dead trees, are the key to long term survival of these
birds (Hutto 1995).

Influence of Roads and Trails
The presence of open roads and motor trails has no direct effect on habitat use by black-backed
woodpeckers. As with most woodpeckers, human presence does little to deter the birds from
WILDLIFE - 369

Environmental Impact Statement

drilling for insects, excavating cavities, or attending young in a nest (Hamann et al. 1999). They
will, however, challenge intruders that approach a nest too closely (Dixon and Saab 2000, p. 15).
The primary impact of open roads is indirect: Dead trees are lost to firewood cutting or to
Forest operations that remove hazard trees along the roads. Since most of this activity occurs
soon after the death of the trees, when bark insects are present in large enough numbers to
attract woodpeckers, it amounts to a reduction of local habitat, at least for some species. In the
case of black-backed woodpeckers, such snag removal could have an effect on potential habitat
opportunity in stands where most trees have been killed (and less so in stands with variable
mixtures of dead and dying trees). In the end, however, black-backed woodpeckers seem
interested almost entirely in stands killed by fire and not those succumbing to bark beetles.

Area Use

Over the last 25 years, large stand-replacing fires have provided an abundance of suitable
habitat for black-backed woodpeckers on the Helena NF. These include the Warm Springs
(1988) and Boulder (2000) fires in the Elkhorn Range; the North Hills (1984), Cave Gulch (2000),
Maudlow-Toston (2000), Jimtown (2003), Meriwether (2007) and Lakeside (2010) fires in the Big
Belt Range; and the Monture (2000), Moose-Wasson (2003) and Snow-Talon (2003) fires in the
Blackfoot landscape. These fires, as well as a number of smaller burns, have accounted for
hundreds of thousands of acres of burned forest in these three landscapes. Targeted post-fire
surveys in the Cave Gulch and Snow-Talon burns (2002 to 2006) found black-backed
woodpeckers making widespread use of these areas. General surveys suggest the same result in
the Warm Springs and Jimtown Burns as well (HRD wildlife files).

The Divide landscape has not experienced fires of this magnitude since the early 20th century
and thus has not provided viable habitat for resident black-backed woodpecker populations.
The 2009 MacDonald Pass fire (170 acres) is the only recent “large” fire that is providing some
habitat. Recent wildlife surveys (spring/summer 2010) identified black-backed and northern
three-toed woodpeckers, among others, in the burn about half a year after the fire [HNF wildlife
observation files]. The current bark beetle outbreak is rapidly expanding habitat opportunities
for a number of the more versatile woodpeckers, such as hairy and downy woodpeckers, rednaped sapsuckers, northern flickers and even pileated and northern three-toed woodpeckers.
But, the scarcity of burned forest is likely to limit the number of black-backed woodpeckers.

Western Boreal Toad
Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships
The Western toad (Bufo boreas) is widely distributed in the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific
Northwest. The Montana subspecies is the “boreal toad” (Bufo boreas boreas), a name often
applied to it in this area. Western toads are found most often in mountainous terrain, up to
9,220 feet. They are capable of breeding in shallower reaches of any clean standing water
ranging from roadside ditches to lakes (Werner et al. 2004, p. 73-74). But, they generally prefer
larger bodies of water than other local amphibians, such as spotted frogs and long-toed
salamanders, which may breed in puddles and other small ephemeral pockets of water (G.
Hokit, personal communication, 1995 to 1998 ). Eggs are laid in May or June (depending on
elevation) and tadpoles and young toads are present in and around aquatic sites through the

WILDLIFE - 370

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

summer. Recent research in western Montana (Schmetterling and Young 2008) suggests that
the toads may also make use of calm pockets of water in mountain streams for breeding.
Adults are largely terrestrial and outside of breeding season, may wander considerable distances
from their aquatic breeding sites. Females generally range farther from water than do males
(Werner et al. 2004). Both juvenile and adult toads have been documented using small, fastflowing streams as movement corridors as well (Schmetterling and Young 2008). Western toads
occupy a variety of terrestrial habitats from valley bottoms to high elevation slopes, including
both forested and unforested sites. The quality of ground-level microhabitat is more important
than large-scale vegetation structure. When not feeding, toads may seek cover in rodent
burrows or under logs.
Western toads, once relatively common, have declined dramatically throughout Montana and
most of the West, over the last 25 years (Reichel 1996). Some decimating factors are local
draining and alteration of aquatic habitat, proliferation of cattle in breeding sites, pollution of
aquatic habitat, introduction of predatory fish, fragmentation of upland habitats and travel
routes. Others are probably continental or global, most prominently, the proliferation of lethal
chytrid fungus. The most likely scenario is that the fungus is the primary source of mortality
while local human-generated activities are acting as contributing factors (Bartelt et al. 2004).

Influence of Roads and Trails
Toads are small, relatively slow-moving animals that are often enough on the move (between
breeding, foraging and hibernating areas) that they are more at risk from roads and motor trails
as barriers and agents of fragmentation than virtually any other species of interest on the
Helena NF [see Maxell and Hokit 1999]. Forest roads that seldom deter mammalian and bird
species from moving about can be lethal barriers to toads. The roadways are exposed,
environments that are difficult to cross. Western toads are one of the few species found dead in
Forest roads and motor trails during the course of general wildlife surveys (G. Joslin, pers.
comm.; personal observation). While the loss is not significant in terms of total population
numbers, it is high compared to other species, particularly where traffic volume is steady (see
Fahrig et al. 1995) and it amounts to another cumulative impact on a population under stress.

Area Use

Western toads have been identified at a number of breeding sites across the Divide landscape.
Biologists and students from Carroll College in Helena have conducted systematic surveys and
tallied western toads at several locations in recent years (G. Hokit, pers. comm.). Helena NF
wildlife surveys have found them as well, usually around aquatic breeding sites (Little Corral
Gulch, Frohner Meadows, Blackfoot Meadows, MacDonald Creek, Dog Creek, Cellar Gulch)
where use is concentrated. Occasionally they are observed in upland habitats, but their
relatively low densities in these areas and their tendency to burrow under cover (in logs, under
litter, in dense vegetation) make them difficult to discover. Population numbers are unknown,
but we assume, given regionwide trends, that their numbers are lower than they have been
historically.

Flammulated Owl
Biological Factors
Population Parameters and Habitat Relationships

WILDLIFE - 371

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The flammulated owl (Otus flammeolus) is a small insect-eating raptor with specialized habitat
requirements. They are secondary cavity nesters in mature or old-growth ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir stands. Occasionally, they are found in mature aspen or cottonwood. They forage
for large insects at twilight and after dark in open-grown forest formations with productive
understories (tall grass, brush, young conifers) (McCallum 1994). This vegetation pattern is key
to maintaining an adequate supply of insect prey while providing the owls with perches from
which to forage and a substrate for large nesting cavities. Patches of denser trees or multistoried vegetation within or near the open stands are important for roosting (Morgan 1994).
Because of the nature of their food base, flammulated owls migrate south in winter.
Flammulated owls are unevenly distributed, a function of the spotty dispersion of suitable
habitat and numbers now substantially lower than under historic conditions. Primary threats to
flammulated owls are habitat loss to logging and human settlement and the transformation of
open-grown ponderosa pine stands into dense interior forest as a result of fire prevention
(Morgan 1994). The scarcity of large open-grown ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir at mid-low
elevation limits habitat opportunities throughout the Divide landscape and as a result, the owls
sometimes take advantage of less-traditional habitat formations: aspen stands or small patches
of open-grown ponderosa pine adjacent to dense stands of Douglas-fir, for example.
Management strategy involves maintaining open-grown old-growth ponderosa pine and
Douglas-fir forest at low and middle elevation with lightly grazed grasses and shrubs in the
understory. The stands should contain a number of large snags with cavities similar to those
that will support pileated woodpeckers and northern flickers (Bull et al. 1990). These conditions
will not evolve naturally in the short-term and management needs to eliminate dense secondgrowth within these stands and burn away needle accumulations so that native grasses and
shrubs can flourish and provide an environment for large insect prey (Morgan 1994). Retention
of large trees, spaced fairly widely, should provide adequate perching and nesting sites for owls.
Inclusions of denser tree growth is important for providing roosting habitat.

Influence of Roads
Flammulated owls are very tolerant of humans (McCallum 1994). Open roads appear to exert
little direct influence on the owls and on their selection and use of habitat. As with most cavity
dependent species, effects are indirect: Removal of large cavity-prone snags by firewood
cutters and of roadside hazard trees by the Helena NF may reduce potential nesting
opportunities. For flammulated owls, this is a concern in stands of certain composition and
structure, namely, more open-grown forest environments with large trees at lower and mid
elevations.

Area Use

The flammulated owl is classified as a sensitive species in Region 1 because of population
viability concerns, some of which stem from obvious habitat problems and some of which are a
function of insufficient field information. Information about population patterns is beginning to
accumulate, primarily from research on the Bitterroot and Lolo National Forests, but also from
recent wide-ranging survey work throughout Region 1 National Forests [see Climburg 2006;
Smucker and Climburg 2008]. Because of their diminutive size, reclusive daytime habits and low
population densities, flammulated owls are seldom seen and can normally be detected only
through specialized survey methods. These efforts suggest that, in most areas, populations are
small and fragmented (primarily because of the scarcity of suitable habitat).

WILDLIFE - 372

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Regionwide survey efforts, 2005 to 2008, have found that the Helena NF supports the highest
flammulated owl densities of the five National Forests located east of or astride the Continental
Divide, with overall densities more characteristic of the Westside Forests (Lolo, Bitterroot, Nez
Perce, Kootenai) (Climburg 2006; Smucker and Climburg 2008). The surveys found, however,
that the most robust Helena NF populations were on the Lincoln Ranger District, west of the
Divide.
In the Divide landscape, flammulated owls have been found east of the Divide along the Mount
Helena ridge and near Unionville in relatively dry, mid elevation environments (4,900 to 5,100
feet) with a mix of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir and aspen, regularly interspersed with grassland.
Both of these sites are outside the Divide Travel Plan Area. Within the Plan Area, flammulated
owls have been located at Priest Pass atop the Continental Divide. This site is at higher
elevation (close to 6,000 feet) than the Mount Helena and Unionville sites and is dominated by
large Douglas-fir. Ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine and aspen are present but less common.
The current mountain pine beetle outbreak presents habitat opportunities for flammulated owls
wherever it creates large ponderosa pine snags in open forest stands away from roads. The
snags provide new cavity nesting substrate and the selective loss of live overstory trees may
open up forest canopies in a manner that makes them more conducive for occupancy by the
owls, allowing development of more vigorous ground vegetation and opening up understory
flyways. Meanwhile, nearby Douglas-fir stands remain intact as a source of roosting habitat.

Management Indicator Species

Management indicator species (MIS) are intended to gauge the effects of Forest management
practices on representative wildlife habitats. Indicator species have been designated to
represent species groups whose habitats are most likely to be changed or affected by Forest
management. In addition to those discussed in detail below, pileated woodpecker, hairy
woodpecker, goshawk, marten, the Forest Plan also designates indicators for threatened and
endangered species (grizzly bear, gray wolf, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, species listed at the
time of Forest Plan release in 1986) and hunted species (elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep). The
status of species in these two groups is summarized in the following section, but they have been
addressed in more detail in previous sections on Big Game, Threatened and Endangered Species
and Sensitive Species.

Pileated Woodpecker (Old-Growth Dependent Group)
Biological Considerations
Habitat Use and Population Status
The pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) serves as an indicator of the health and
availability of old-growth forests because of its need to nest in large diameter snags that occur
most frequently in old-growth stands (Bull and Holthausen 1993). As well, it is often described
as a “keystone species” because of the disproportionate effect it has on its environment, in spite
of its inevitably low population density. Pileated woodpeckers create numerous large
excavations in dead trees that are then used by a variety of secondary cavity dwellers; they
enlarge cavities in living trees providing unique habitat for other species; they hasten the decay
process in the live trees they excavate and in the logs they break apart while foraging (Bull and
Jackson 1995). This “ecosystem engineering” alters the physical structure of the environment in

WILDLIFE - 373

Environmental Impact Statement

ways that influence habitat opportunity for other species and general ecosystem processes
(Aubry and Raley 2002).
In the Northern Rockies, pileated woodpeckers inhabit mixed conifer stands of various
configurations, focusing on western larch and ponderosa pine as the key tree species. They also
nest and feed in black cottonwood bottoms when they are available (McClelland and McClelland
1999; Hutto 1995). While pileated woodpeckers are most often found in mature and old
forests, they frequently forage in immature forest stands with large residual trees, logs and
stumps left by previous disturbance (logging, burning) [see review in Bonar 2001, p. 3]. While
the woodpeckers seem to prefer “closed” stands, Bull et al. (2007, p. 325-326) found that loss of
considerable canopy closure due to high natural tree mortality did not appear to be detrimental
to the birds as long as large dead or live trees and logs were abundant.
For nesting and roosting, pileated woodpeckers require large standing dead trees [typically
greater than 30 inches diameter-at-breast-height]. The availability of night-time roosting sites,
provided most frequently by large hollow trees, has been hypothesized to be even more of a
limiting factor than the presence of potential nest sites (Aubry and Raley 2002). Foraging sites
are provided by standing trees (dead and alive) and by large logs and stumps, where the
woodpeckers feed on a variety of wood-boring insects, preferably carpenter ants (Bull 1987; Bull
et al. 1997). The pileated woodpecker is powerful enough to excavate deep foraging cavities in
undecayed living conifers (Bull and Jackson 1995), which opens up a wider range of feeding
possibilities than is immediately available to other local woodpeckers.
Pileated woodpeckers are very mobile and are considered a large-patch-size species. Their
home ranges are extensive and require a generous percentage of unlogged or partially logged
forest with a reasonable distribution of large trees. The average size of 27 home ranges
(sometimes referred to as “territories”) in good quality habitat in the Pacific Northwest has been
calculated at 1,234 acres (just under two square miles) (Bull and Holthausen 1993; Mellen et al.
1992). This translates to relatively low population density even in optimal habitat. Pileated
woodpeckers have seldom been studied in more marginal habitats that characterize much of
the east slope of the northern Rockies in Montana (including the Divide landscape), but field
observation suggests that population densities are appreciably lower in these environments.
One study in Alberta in the eastern foothills of the Rockies found a strong correlation between
habitat quality and territory/home range size. Pileated woodpeckers had much larger territories
where potential foraging substrates and cavity trees were more sparse. The larger territories,
however, did not result in reduced fitness, productivity and survival were actually higher than
those reported for prime habitat in the Pacific Northwest (Bonar 2001, p. 66).

Influence of Roads
Construction of new Forest roads imposes a direct effect on pileated woodpeckers in that it
removes trees from long, narrow corridors of forest habitat (typically 12 to 20 feet wide) that
the birds might otherwise put to use. To date, however, research has not documented any
instances where habitat alteration in this configuration and on this scale has diluted the ability
of an area to support resident pileated woodpeckers.
Most of the meaningful impact of roads is indirect. Large dead trees in the road corridor are
consistently lost to firewood cutting or to Forest operations designed to remove hazard trees
from along the roads. This represents an inevitable loss of key habitat components within open
road corridors that are considerably broader than the roadbed itself (generally, a zone out to
300 feet on each side of the road). This loss affects local pileated woodpecker habitat

WILDLIFE - 374

Environmental Impact Statement

opportunity as well as that for numerous other dead tree associated species. In the average
Divide landscape road corridor, however, dead trees large enough to serve as nesting or
roosting sites for pileated woodpeckers are few and far between. So, even considering a 600
feet wide roadside zone for dead tree removal, it is highly unlikely that the total area involved
will be large enough to measurably alter local population viability in eastside forests of the
Northern Rockies.
Field research and prodigious observation have revealed that, as with the other woodpeckers
reviewed in this report, human presence does little to alter the birds’ normal regimen of
foraging, excavating cavities, roosting and attending to young in a nest (Hamann et al. 1999).
Possible exceptions are sites adjacent to open roads that support regular motor traffic and other
human activity. While the woodpeckers are unlikely to discontinue foraging in these areas, they
may avoid them as nesting and roosting sites. This behavior pattern has not been documented
by research and in any event, its significance as a limiting factor for pileated woodpecker
populations appears dubious.

Area Use

Pileated woodpecker habitat has been modeled for the Forest based on the USFS Region 1 (R1)
protocols identified above in the Methodologies and Assumptions Section. Based on this model,
the Divide Travel Plan Area supports approximately 59,264 acres of suitable habitat.

Roughly 147 miles of open road traverse this habitat, providing firewood cutters with
opportunities for removing dead trees. If the maximum corridor available to snag removal is
delineated at 300 feet on either side of the road, then approximately 10,691 acres (18.0
percent of pileated woodpecker habitat) is vulnerable to snag loss. Actually, this is a substantial
over-estimate, since in most cases, steep, irregular terrain and other habitat features make the
firewood corridor narrower than 600 feet. As well, few snags in the corridor are large enough
(in the 30 inch diameter-at-breast-height range) to provide nesting or roosting sites for pileated
woodpeckers; and as a result, only a minimal amount of this component would the lost. Many
smaller trees on which the woodpeckers might feed, however, are likely to be removed.
Data on the occurrence of pileated woodpeckers in the Divide landscape has come from
systematic surveys by the Northern Region Landbird Program, observations during general
wildlife surveys since 1992 and reports from a variety of biologists and forest users. Pileated
woodpeckers, while low in numbers, are relatively easy to detect because of their large size,
striking color pattern, loud distinctive calls and highly visible and unique tree excavations.
Pileated woodpeckers in the Divide landscape are near the eastern reaches of their geographic
range and population densities are low (Hutto and Young 1999, p. 24). Suitable habitat is widely
distributed but of lower quality than that found in Forests further west (in the Bitterroot, Lolo
and Flathead NFs). Habitats in the Divide landscape are drier; large trees less common; and two
key habitat components, western larch and black cottonwood, are not present. The most
robust pileated woodpecker populations on the Helena NF occur on the Lincoln RD, where
habitat is more akin to that in the west-side Forests. Since the supply of big trees cannot be
expanded in the short-term in order to increase habitat opportunity, Helena NF management
strategy has been to retain as many large diameter conifers as possible, regardless of the forest
configurations in which they occur. This, coupled with management of enough mature forest to
provide for the future supply of large trees, should ensure the stability of these woodpecker
populations on the landscape, albeit at characteristically low densities.

Northern Goshawk (Old-Growth Dependent Group)
Biological Considerations
Habitat Use and Population Status
The northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) is the only large diurnal raptor adapted to interior
forest environments in the northern Rockies. While some large forest owls (great horned, great
gray) occasionally move about and hunt during daylight hours, these birds are primarily
nocturnal. Key elements of goshawk habitat are extensive blocks of older forest with tight
groups of mature nesting trees, abundant prey (squirrels, hares, larger songbirds, grouse) and
mid-level flyways. In the northern Rockies, optimal habitat for goshawks is provided by oldgrowth Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forest and for that reason, the goshawk was chosen as a
management indicator for those habitats in the Forest Plan (and in those of most other Region 1
Forests). Since the 1980s, copious field research and survey work have shown that goshawks
are more versatile in their use of habitat than was believed when the Forest Plans were written.
Goshawks have specific requirements for nesting and post-fledging habitat (closed-canopied
mature forest) but otherwise have been shown to be forest generalists and not particularly
useful as Douglas-fir old-growth indicators (Braun et al. 1996; Reynolds et al. 1992; Clough 2000;
McGrath et al. 2003).
Surveys over the past 15 years on the Helena, Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Lewis and Clark and
Medicine Bow National Forests have found that goshawks will nest and forage in stands of
mature lodgepole pine as long as the basic structural attributes they need are in place and prey
is adequate (Lemke 1993; Squires and Ruggiero 1996; Clough 2000). In the more fragmented
forest environments east of the Continental Divide where mountains and plains intermingle,
goshawks often occupy mosaics of forest and grassland or a mixture of different forest seral
stages. They are drawn also to aspen stands because of the robust populations of potential prey
these habitats support (grouse, cottontails, snowshoe hares, ground squirrels, mourning doves,
flickers, small owls and numerous large songbirds and woodpeckers). They are capable of
foraging through open parks and woodlands and along forest edges. In certain circumstances,
they do so on a regular basis (Younk and Bechard 1994). But regardless of the structural
diversity of foraging habitat and of goshawk ranges in general, nesting and post-fledging habitat
inevitably requires solid blocks of mature interior forest.
Extensive survey work over the past 15 years has demonstrated that goshawks are widespread
across the Helena Forest. They maintain large home ranges (estimated at 5,820 acres per pair)
(Reynolds et al. 1992; Clough 2000) and population densities are naturally low, even where
suitable habitat is abundant. In areas with high prey populations and optimal habitat structure,
home ranges may be smaller or overlap. The optimal size of a goshawk nesting stand is
estimated to be about 15 to 30 acres; optimal post-fledging areas (PFAs) are about 620 acres
(and contain several potential nest stands). Nest stands and substantial portions of PFAs need
to be densely forested with mature trees so as to provide effective nesting sites, suitable
microclimate, abundant prey and security from open-forest predators. The rest of the home
range consists of foraging habitat and inclusions of unsuitable habitat. Foraging habitat, while
predominantly mature forest, often includes a variety of tree densities and age classes and an
array of forest openings (Reynolds et al. 1992). Goshawks can make use of such environments
as long as prey is adequate.
Loss of habitat to clearcut logging and stand-replacing fire are primary threats. Goshawks are
sensitive to human disturbance of nest sites and can be very aggressive in defending the nest
WILDLIFE - 376

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

and the larger area within which newly fledged young are operating (post-fledging area)
[personal observation, Helena and Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forests 1987 to 2010]. They
may occupy the same nest stand in consecutive years but rarely the same nest (although they
may return to an old nest two or three years later). Just as often, they move to a new stand
elsewhere in the home range. Because of their large home ranges and their natural tendency to
cycle among different nest sites between years, they are capable of adapting to many
environmental changes (such as fire and timber harvest) by moving to adjacent undisturbed
sites.

Influence of Roads
Construction of new Forest road into nest stands and post-fledging areas can make life difficult
for resident goshawks by introducing regular human disturbance into sites that the birds feel
obligated to defend. As well, it can eliminate key habitat components (nest trees, perch sites,
snags and logs used by prey species). Habitual human activity near an active nest may cause
goshawks to abandon the site (Reynolds et al. 1992). But most often, while not abandoning the
nest, goshawks will exert much more energy defending it (and defending the fledglings, once
out of the nest) than they would under normal circumstances. This diversion of time and energy
can negatively impact their ability to successfully raise and fledge young (Morrison et al. 2011).
The presence of a road may also eliminate the stand as suitable nesting habitat in the future.
Since high-quality nesting habitat is often a primary limiting factor for goshawks, new road
systems that push into these areas can erode the overall habitat quality of a goshawk home
range. Reopening closed roads or trails to motorized use can have a similar impact.
A recent analysis in the Lake Tahoe Basin of California suggests that goshawks avoid placing
nests near roads, based on the intensity of traffic that they experience in a previous year
(Morrison et al. 2011). Fieldwork on the Helena NF, however, has shown that goshawks will
establish nests relatively close (within a few hundred feet) to existing roads (Sweeney Creek,
Jimtown, Kelly Gulch, Cottonwood Gulch, Spring Gulch, South Fork Quartz Creek, Elliston Creek,
Minnehaha Creek) or trails as long as most human activity predictably remains in the road or
trail corridor. While foraging goshawks spend most of their time in mature forest environments,
they frequently cross open roads and may use a road corridor as a convenient flyway when the
forest presses in closely on either side and traffic is infrequent.

Area Use

In spite of the fact that goshawks maintain naturally low population densities (active nests on
the Helena NF are typically two to three miles apart), they are fortuitously observed and
reported on a regular basis across the Divide landscape each year. As well, the Helena NF has
actively surveyed for goshawks each year since 1995. Because of the rarity of stand replacing
fire in recent decades, the Divide Travel Plan Area has been dominated by mature forests that
provide widespread opportunities for goshawk occupancy. The most recent Helena NF
modeling effort (USFS 2009) estimates approximately 116,695 acres of goshawk foraging habitat
and 1,920 acres of optimal nesting habitat in the Planning Area. The character of much of this
habitat is changing as large numbers of lodgepole and ponderosa pine trees die and forest
canopies open up as a result of ongoing bark beetle infestation. In the short-term, this
phenomenon is likely to improve goshawk foraging opportunity, but eventually it will
measurably reduce the suitability of numerous nesting stands, as well as foraging habitat.
While survey efforts have not been complete enough to provide precise population estimates in
any given year, they do suggest that virtually every potential goshawk home range in the Divide
WILDLIFE - 377

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

landscape (5,000 to 6,000 acres of predominantly forested habitat) is occupied sooner or later.
At any given time, some ranges will be unoccupied because of the ongoing process of ranges
being vacated through natural mortality and the mechanics involved with new birds locating and
establishing new home ranges.

Hairy Woodpecker (Snag-Dependent Species Group)
Biological Considerations
Habitat Use
The hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus) is a management indicator for species dependent on
snags. Snags provide the essential substrate for excavating cavity nests and the primary food
source in the form of wood-boring and bark-dwelling insects. Hairy woodpeckers inhabit a wide
spectrum of habitats ranging from open snag fields created by stand replacing fire to interior
forests with a smattering of snags and other insect-prone trees (Hutto and Young 1999). Hairy
woodpeckers are year-round residents in the northern Rockies and primary cavity nesters. The
cavities that they excavate are eventually available to a myriad of other small birds and
mammals.
The woodpeckers require dead or decaying trees at least 10 inches in diameter for nesting
(Thomas et al. 1979), but they may forage on smaller trees. They feed on insects, wood borers,
bark beetles, ants and grubs, as well as on fruits, berries and sometimes, seeds. These resources
are gleaned from variety of substrates: dead and dying trees, live trees, logs, stumps, the
ground, anything with a supply of appropriate insects or other suitable food.
The primary habitat component on which hairy woodpeckers depend is ephemeral, more so
than key habitat features required by most non cavity-dependent species. While fire killed trees
may remain standing for up to several decades and continue to supply a potential base for nest
cavities, their ability to support the insects on which the woodpeckers depend for food
deteriorates quickly (typically, within five to eight years). Trees killed by insects or disease may
remain upright for only two to three years after becoming suitable for cavity excavation. As the
supply of dead trees waxes and wanes in a given area, the hairy woodpecker population follows.
The woodpeckers reach their highest population densities in new burns and in stands beset with
disease or insect irruptions (such as the current pine beetle outbreak), responding to the
increased food source (Sousa 1997). In these cases, they may be the most common woodpecker
present. As the abundance of wood-boring insects in a recently afflicted forested area begins to
decline, the population density of hairy woodpeckers also drops and home ranges expand.
Covert-Bratland et al. (2006) measured a six fold decrease in population density and more than
a tenfold increase in home range size between the second and nineth year following a stand
replacing fire in Arizona. Hairy woodpeckers are also capable of inhabiting healthy mature
forests as long as a few snags or living trees with a ready supply of insects are scattered through
the stand. Their population densities in these cases are relatively low, however. Given the
range of habitats and food supplies that hairy woodpeckers are capable of exploiting, their
population densities and their home range sizes can vary dramatically. Typical home ranges run
from around 2.5 miles to more than 37 square miles depending on habitat quality and food
abundance.

WILDLIFE - 378

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Influence of Roads
As with the other woodpeckers reviewed in this report, hairy woodpeckers appear to suffer no
meaningful effects from the presence of open roads and motor trails in their home ranges.
Human presence, motorized or otherwise, does little to alter the birds’ normal habitat use
patterns (Hamann et al. 1999).
Other indirect effects are more substantive: Virtually any accessible solid dead tree (pole-sized
and up) in the road corridor (estimated at 300 feet on either side of the road) will inevitably be
removed by firewood cutters or, less often, by Helena NF personnel as roadside hazard trees.
This represents an unfortunate but predictable loss of potential habitat components within
open road corridors for hairy woodpeckers and other dead tree dependent species for which
they serve as an indicator. Because hairy woodpeckers are mobile and range widely, loss of key
components within road corridors may amount to little. The relative significance of the loss
depends on the availability of snags in areas outside the road corridor. In current
circumstances, the proliferation of beetle-killed pine trees across the landscape renders snag
loss in the road corridor inconsequential.

Area Use

Hairy woodpeckers can be found with regularity in any forest habitat with a modicum of dead
trees for nesting and enough insect-prone trees to provide feeding substrate (Hutto and Young
1999, p. 22). In the Divide landscape, hairy woodpeckers have been observed at similar
frequencies in mature lodgepole pine, spruce/subalpine fir, Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, mixed
conifer and aspen stands; in young forest and cutting units (including clearcuts) with residual
snags and older trees; and in wetland and riparian shrub associations. They are very common in
the MacDonald Pass burn, the only recently created post-fire environment of any size in the
Divide landscape.

Hairy woodpecker habitat has been modeled for the Helena NF based on the USFS Region 1
protocols identified above under Methodologies and Assumptions. The model employs a
narrow definition of suitable hairy woodpecker habitat, focusing on certain densities of dead
trees as would occur in older forest stands. Post-fire habitats, which would normally supply the
best hairy woodpecker habitat, have been extremely rare in the Divide landscape in recent
decades. So, the model falls back on older mature stands and old-growth stands as the next
best habitat. But this habitat is also limited in the Divide landscape, because of intense timber
harvest and large fires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The upshot is that the Region 1
model identifies only 16,050 acres of habitat in the Divide Travel Plan Area. Given the wide
distribution of hairy woodpeckers across the Divide landscape, the 16,050 acres identified as
suitable habitat by the Region 1 model has to be considered a minimal estimate of optimal
nesting habitat. The woodpeckers actually occur in forest habitats exceeding 100,000 acres in
this landscape.
We have no population density estimates for hairy woodpeckers in the Divide Travel Plan Area.
But, extensive wildlife surveys by Helena NF biologists and numerous point-count surveys by the
Northern Region Landbird Survey Program over the past 15 years indicate that the hairy
woodpecker is common in the Divide landscape and on the Helena NF as a whole. It is a rare
session in the field that does not produce hairy woodpecker observations. The Birds and Burns
study (2002 to 2006) in the northern Elkhorn Range just east of the Divide landscape found that
in healthy mature ponderosa pine dominated stands, the hairy woodpecker was the 17th most
common of 44 bird species detected on regular point-count surveys (Russell and Saab 2004,
WILDLIFE - 379

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

2005). The study also intensively investigated nesting patterns and productivity of cavity
dependent birds and found that when conifer snags were uncommon in healthy forests, hairy
woodpeckers, along with most other primary cavity nesters, found nesting opportunities in
scattered aspen stands (Saab et al. 2007).
With the ongoing proliferation of beetle-killed pine trees over several hundred thousand acres
across the Helena NF, nesting and foraging opportunities for hairy woodpeckers and other cavity
dependent species are now increasing dramatically and their populations can be expected to do
likewise over the next few years.

American Marten (Mature Forest Dependent Species Group)
Biological Requirements
Habitat Use
While the Helena Forest Plan uses the American marten (Martes americana) as an indicator for
the integrity of large blocks of mature forest cover in general, marten appear to be dependent
primarily on a certain kind of mature forest, namely that with a relative abundance of large
woody debris and an adequate distribution of standing snags. While marten will travel through
forest habitats with “clean” understories, they need logs, stumps and snags for resting, denning,
protection from the elements and as habitat for prey. This is particularly important in winter,
when marten live in a subnivean (under-snow) environment where woody debris provide
needed structure and shelter (Thompson and Colgan 1994; Coffin et al. 2002, p. 7, 13-14). The
upshot is that research now indicates marten are not an accurate management indicator for all
mature forests.
Stumps and logs provide critical habitat structure for foraging, resting and denning (Spencer
1987; Coffin 1994) and marten dependence on mature forests in the Rockies seems to be linked
to the availability of coarse woody debris that provides resting sites and thermal cover (Buskirk
et al. 1989). Chapin et al. (1997) found that vertical and horizontal structure of forest stands
was more important than age or species composition.
Marten population densities and trends are notoriously difficult to evaluate; long-term data sets
are rare and populations often fluctuate dramatically over short periods of time, in large part
because of variable trapping pressure. Where reasonably accurate data have been obtained,
population densities have been very low compared to most other mammals, generally in the
range of 0.4 to 2.4 marten per square kilometer (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994, p. 14-15). Marten
home ranges are large by mammalian standards, although they tend to be smaller in areas of
high prey density (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994, p. 27) and larger in areas of fragmented habitat
(Coffin et al. 2002, p. 6). Recent studies in southwest Montana have calculated winter-spring
home ranges of marten between 2.5 and 66.1 square kilometer, with female home ranges
substantially smaller than those of males (Coffin et al. 2002, p. 6). Large home ranges, in this
case, are a correlate of naturally low population densities (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994, p. 15, 28).
Fragmentation of coniferous cover by logging has reduced habitat suitability. Marten appear
sensitive to patch size and usually avoid clearcuts because these areas don’t provide functional
subnivean zones or offer protection from predators, although they will cross (as quickly as
possible) open areas up to 91 meters wide. Thompson (1994) concluded that higher marten
densities in unlogged forests might be due to lower predation rates.

WILDLIFE - 380

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Influence of Roads
Marten do not like to cross broad open areas and when they do, they move very quickly (C.
Fager, personal communication 1991). However, they show little reluctance to cross Forest
roads, groomed snowmobile trails, or paved highways (Coffin et al. 2002, p. 7). As with
wolverines and fishers, marten are not averse to crossing roads and motor trails or using them
as travel routes in winter as long as they are associated with a reasonable degree of mature
forest cover. Overall, research has revealed no obvious relationship, positive or negative,
between marten habitat use and open road density. High-traffic roads that run through mature
forests with abundant deadfall may reduce the attractiveness of otherwise suitable sites for
birthing and raising young but probably do not prohibit their use as hunting and resting areas.
As is the case with lynx, wolverines and fishers, one of the primary threats that open roads pose
to marten comes from their role as snowmobile routes used by trappers in winter. Marten are
the most common target of trappers (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994). Trapping intensity waxes and
wanes with the trajectory of fur prices and trapping mortality is periodically a more important
determinant of marten population density than is habitat availability. Trapping can be a
significant source of mortality where snowmobile routes pass through riparian bottoms, oldgrowth stands and other complex forested habitats (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994).
Snag removal by firewood cutters working the road corridors represents a loss of habitat
components important to marten. The abundance of standing and downed dead trees is one of
the key factors allowing marten to occupy a forest stand.

Area Use

Marten are found throughout the Divide landscape wherever suitable habitat occurs, primarily
in mid-high elevation forests with a strong component of subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce and
lodgepole pine with pockets of coarse woody debris. Marten are rare in lower elevation
ponderosa pine and dry Douglas-fir forests (Buskirk and Ruggiero 1994, p. 22), although these
habitats sometimes provide linkage between forests suitable for long-term occupancy.
Marten habitat has been modeled for the Helena Forest based on the Region 1 Protocols
(identified above in the Methodologies and Assumptions Section). The model identifies some
145,655 acres of potential marten habitat in the Travel Plan Area. In fact, much of this habitat
consists of travel/linkage zones and somewhat marginal foraging habitat. Core habitat patches
with in appropriate habitat types with sufficient numbers of snags and accumulations of woody
debris account for much less of it.
The current pine beetle epidemic is changing potential habitat patterns for marten in the Divide
landscape wherever lodgepole pine is a predominant component. On the one hand, the bounty
of large snags and logs is highly beneficial to marten. On the other hand, the natural thinning
and in some cases, outright loss of the forest canopy as trees fall creates a less favorable
environment for them. The proliferation of dead trees in ponderosa pine stands is of much less
importance to marten since they seldom inhabit these relatively dry lower elevation forests.
Evidence for the presence of marten throughout the landscape has come from regular winter
tracking surveys south of Highway 12 by MFWP, from more recent tracking surveys in the little
Blackfoot watershed by Wild Things Unlimited (Gehman 2006 to 2010) and from observations
during general wildlife surveys over the last 18 years (HELENA NATIONAL FOREST wildlife
observation files). These observations are insufficient to derive population parameters but they
give a general picture of marten distribution and habitat use and show that marten population
WILDLIFE - 381

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

densities are low throughout much of the landscape. This is probably a function of a number of
factors: past trapping; a relative abundance of naturally unsuitable habitat (dry ponderosa pine
and Douglas-fir forest, dry grassland); a predominance of mature and pole-sized forest not yet
old enough to provide prolific large woody debris (a function of historic fire patterns and past
timber harvest); natural and human-induced fragmentation of optimal habitat sites; and
inherently low population densities regardless of habitat conditions.
Be that as it may, MFWP, relying on trapping data and snow course surveys, feels that marten
population levels are sufficient to allow continued trapping in the Divide landscape (which is
split by Trapping District 4, east of the Divide and District 2 on the west side). There are no
quotas set for marten in Montana and trapping pressure is usually driven by fur prices. In Lewisand-Clark and Powell counties, which cover the Divide landscape (along with portions of the
Lewis-and-Clark and Beaverhead-Deerlodge NFs), trapping pressure in recent years has been
relatively light and few marten have been caught. Since 1996, an average of 5.2 marten per
year have been reported trapped in Powell County (range: 0 to 19 animals). None were
reported from Lewis and Clark County. MFWP has recorded an average of three trappers taking
marten in these areas since 1996 [FWP trapping website].
The Montana Natural Heritage database provides relative estimates of marten distribution
based on the number of observations reported in different latilong blocks across the state. For
the Divide landscape, the database shows the highest number of observations in the greater
Telegraph Creek drainage (15 to 20) and lowest number in the lower Little Blackfoot/ Spotted
Dog/ Elliston Creek area (one to seven). The rest of the landscape has produced an average of
eight to 14 observations.

Elk, Mule Deer, Bighorn Sheep (Commonly Hunted Species)
The Helena Forest Plan designates elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep as indicators of commonly
hunted species populations and by extension, of the habitats available to them on the National
Forest. This designation is somewhat problematic for the Helena NF in that population density,
structure and distribution of these species are often less a function of available habitat on the
National Forest than of State hunting regulations and local hunting pressure. This is equivalent
to the situation with the marten, whose populations in some areas may be controlled more by
trapping pressure than by habitat availability. An additional factor for bighorn sheep is the
proclivity of robust populations in good habitat to succumb to disease carried by domestic
sheep. In any case, maintenance of abundant suitable habitat is not enough by itself to govern
the population size and composition of hunted species.
Elk and mule deer are present throughout the Travel Plan Area and the surrounding region at
population levels well above those needed to maintain viability. Multiple annual field surveys
by MFWP attest to the fact that while local numbers fluctuate from year to year, overall
populations of these species have been basically stable for several decades. Helena NF and
MFWP habitat surveys indicate that the National Forest and surrounding lands are capable of
supporting greater numbers of elk and mule deer than are normally present. Current
population levels are set primarily by State hunting quotas designed to provide for public
recreational hunting and to keep numbers low enough to limit game damage on private lands,
while maintaining biologically healthy populations. In recent decades, debate about elk and
mule deer has had little to do with population viability. It has focused primarily on the size and
composition of the population surplus available to hunters and the degree to which agricultural
and other private resources need to be protected from local population pulses. This is true in
the Divide landscape as well as on the Helena NF as a whole.
WILDLIFE - 382

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Bighorn sheep were extirpated from most of the Helena NF in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries by subsistence hunting and disease brought into the country with domestic sheep.
Bighorns have been reintroduced to parts of the Forest and adjacent public lands in recent
years, in particular, the northern Big Belt range and the central Elkhorn range. Populations have
waxed and waned in these areas, largely in response to disease outbreaks. Habitat in both areas
appears capable of sustaining viable local populations, as long as some separation between wild
and domestic sheep can be maintained. Historic documents and occasional discovery of
crumbling skulls in the field attest to the former presence of bighorn sheep in the Divide
landscape (apparently more than 100 years ago). With rare (and temporary) exception, no
sheep have migrated into this area from adjacent regions (the Elkhorns, the Blackfoot/north
Divide) in recent times. Key habitat, while fragmented, is available in several locations across
the Divide landscape. In addition, the demise of domestic sheep allotments on this part of the
National Forest in recent years has removed a primary limiting factor for bighorn sheep.
Nonetheless, MFWP has no plans to artificially re-introduce bighorns to the area and
neighboring wild populations (at least at current levels) are not sufficiently robust to push
natural migrants in this direction.

It should be noted that some of the mileages shown in Table 98 vary slightly from those
presented in Chapter 2 of the EIS. In particular, “Non-System Motor Trails/four-wheel-drive
Tracks” in alternative 1 have either been eliminated or converted to designated Helena NF
System routes in alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5. In Table 98, the converted routes have been added
to the appropriate System categories. In the EIS, however, these routes continue to be shown
as “non-system” roads and trails in all five alternatives (so as to facilitate tracking their fate).
In Table 99, mileages in the first row, “Helena NF Roads Specifically Designated for snowmobile
Use by the Travel Plan”, are identical to those in Chapter 2 of the EIS. The remaining categories,
however, were tallied specifically for this analysis (particularly for the Lynx analysis), using the
map of Snowmobile Routes on the Helena National Forest (Helena Snow Drifters 2003), the
Helena National Forest Visitor Map, USGS quad maps, information in the Helena NF recreation
files and field observations by Helena NF recreation personnel and members of the Helena
Snowdrifters Snowmobile Club.

Mitigation Common to All Alternatives

The following mitigation is common to all alternatives:
•

•
•

All road closures will have yearlong or seasonal designations that accurately reflect the
needs of the local wildlife species upon which the restrictions are based.
Firewood retrieval will be addressed via the firewood permit process.
Road closure effectiveness will be monitored annually and local adjustments to closure
methods and enforcement made as necessary to protect wildlife resources.
Effects of the 300-feet off-road camping rule will be monitored in areas where key
habitat components for wildlife are at issue and local restrictions will be applied in the
future if needed.

Disturbance

Roads can lead to concentrations of human activity in wildlife habitat and affect the way animals
use an area. Human activities impact wildlife and wildlife habitat through four primary means:
exploitation (mortality), disturbance (displacement), habitat modification and pollution (via
chemicals or sediment). Wildlife behavior takes the form of avoidance, habituation, or
attraction (Knight and Cole 1995). Some animals avoid roads and the risks associated with them
and as a result, have less habitat to work with across the landscape. Species attracted to roads
or habituated to them have a more extensive array of habitat choices open to them but may
suffer higher rates of human-caused mortality as a consequence.

Human disturbances associated with roads and trails vary in intensity, duration and reach and
thus produce different reactions among wildlife species. Motorized activities such as ATV travel
and snowmobiling are of short-duration, high-intensity and large geographic scope (50 miles or
more per day). Non-motorized activities such as hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and
cross-country skiing generally are of longer duration at any given site but of low-intensity and
small to moderate geographic scope (five to 20 miles per day). The range of wildlife response to
these variable levels of disturbance varies among species and sometimes among individuals
within species. Motorized and non-motorized human presence may cause wildlife species to
abandon nests or dens, change movement patterns and alter foraging behaviors (Knight and
Cole 1995). While some species are quite tolerant of humans, a majority react negatively to one
degree or another.
Since 1986, the Helena National Forest has closed many miles of roads to motorized use (see
Affected Environment for Recreation). However, the remaining open roads still present impacts
to wildlife species sensitive to the disturbance associated with human activity. Road density
standards have been developed through research and are recommended for many species.
These analyses are used where appropriate and are discussed below under the respective
species. In many cases the traffic levels along Forest roads are consistently minimal, in other
cases substantial and in others periodic (sparse during the week, higher on weekends; low in
summer, high in hunting season). As a result, most analyses use weighted road densities to
account for varying levels of public use. Typically, primary arterial and collector roads are given
the most weight, local and primitive roads less and closed and private roads very little, if any.
This approach emphasizes the fact that the primary influence of most Forest roads on wildlife
stems not so much from their physical impact on habitat as from the degree to which they
funnel human activity into the landscape.

Habitat Loss

Construction of new roads creates a direct loss of habitat. Often, this represents a permanent
loss of natural substrate and native vegetation if the road surface is formidable enough (graded
gravel roads). Small animals are vulnerable to this local habitat loss, particularly in interior
forest environments.

Since none of the Divide Travel Plan alternatives proposes new road construction, direct habitat
loss will not be a factor in this case. Different alternatives, however, would close different
combinations of road and motor trail, thus allowing for different levels of route surface slowly
reverting to more natural habitat formations. This would happen more quickly on primitive dirt
roads, particularly those that are eventually reconditioned or recontoured. It would be a much
slower process on harder-surfaced Capital Investment roads, some of which may be retained as
gated routes for administrative use (fire protection, weed spraying, silvicultural improvements
and so on).
WILDLIFE - 385

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Fragmentation

Fragmentation has two components: reduction of total available habitat and apportionment of
remaining habitat into smaller, more isolated patches (Meffe and Carroll 1994). Roads generally
have less fragmentation effect on species with large home ranges and great mobility (mountain
lions, elk, goshawks). Species with small home ranges and limited mobility (deer mice, ground
squirrels, muskrats, pocket gophers, toads) generally are more susceptible to the barriers and
subsequent fragmentation created by roads (Meffe and Carroll 1994).

As discussed earlier, the main mechanism by which most Forest roads “fragment” habitat in the
Divide landscape is by serving as conduits for human activity, as expedited by motor vehicles.
Because many species are wary of vehicle corridors, the roads tend to repel regular use by these
species, confining the bulk of their activity to non-motorized islands. This is fragmentation of
wildlife use more than it is than of habitat and the degree to which it acts on local wildlife
populations depends upon the level of vehicle traffic on various roads at different times of year,
as well as the sensitivity of the species to it.
For smaller animals of limited mobility, the dirt/gravel roads themselves may serve to alter local
habitat use patterns, but they seldom prevent animals from crossing back and forth on a regular
basis, though such crossings are sometimes lethal. To one degree or another, habitat
opportunities are diminished.

Edge Effects
Linear strips of forest/grassland edge are features of National Forest road corridors that benefit
some wildlife species and create problems for others (Forman et al. 2003). Road edges increase
soil erosion and decrease soil moisture; they are zones where human activity is more likely; and
they allow for elevated levels of noise, evapotranspiration, temperature, incident solar radiation
and exotic species introductions, (Trombulak and Frissell 2000; Forman et al. 2003). On the
other hand, some species benefit from the additional habitat created by road corridors (Forman
et al. 2003). For example, raptors (kestrels, Swainson’s hawks, harriers, rough-legged hawks and
so on) sometimes use roadsides more than adjacent habitat because of greater availability of
perch sites coupled with better viewing and the presence of roadside prey.
The effects of edge on the adjacent forest depend on how much of the original canopy and
understory remains. Edge zones tend to be drier and less shady than interior forests and they
often favor shade-intolerant plants (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). As a result, interior forest
wildlife species are negatively impacted (Reed et al. 1996). Road edge habitat is different from
natural edges or those created by clearcuts: non-road edges become less distinct over time
while road edges tend to remain relatively sharp over the long-term (Reed et al. 1996) [Figure
15, Figure 16 and Figure 52].
Since edge effects occur, to one degree or another, along all road corridors, regardless of
whether the roads are open or closed, the affected area is more or less the same for all five
alternatives: about 785 miles of open and closed road and motor trail in the Divide landscape as
a whole. This is a very rough index of potential effects, since some roads exhibit little
contrasting edge, such as narrow, closed-in forested roads [Figure 13, Figure 47, Figure 48,
Figure 59] or those passing through grassland [Figure 14, Figure 40, Figure 42, Figure 43].
Also, some effectively closed forest roads that receive no motorized use would gradually lose
edge contrast as conifers colonize the roadbeds. While some of the wider motor trails may also
generate edge effects, trail mileage is not included in the above summary.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

General Habitat: Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Direct Effects
There are no direct effects on forested habitat or old growth habitat since no new road or trail
construction is a part of this alternative.

Indirect Effects
Indirect effects on general forested habitat and old growth would continue to be generated by
human activity along 450 miles of existing open roads and motor trails. This activity will wax
and wane periodically due to factors unrelated to travel planning.

Effects of Alternative 2
Direct Effects
Alternative 2 would generate no new direct effects on grassland or forest habitat (including oldgrowth) since no new road or trail routes would be constructed. This alternative would retain
five fewer miles of open road and motor trail than the current system, affording the potential
for return of some of these corridors to more natural condition.

Indirect Effects
Indirect effects on forest and grassland habitat would continue to be generated by human
activity along 445 miles of open roads and motor trails. Disturbance levels would decrease in
some areas and increase in others. Motorized activity will vary in time and place due to factors
unrelated to travel planning. Changes in motorized disturbance from the existing condition
would be insufficient to generate measurable differences in survivorship and viability of wildlife
populations. However, differences in local disturbance levels would be noticeable at several
sites in the form of shifts in wildlife behavior and local habitat use patterns.

Effects of Alternative 3
Direct Effects
Alternative 3 would not add to direct effects on forest or grassland habitat since no new roads
or trails are proposed. This alternative retains 71 fewer miles of open road and motor trail than
the current system, affording the opportunity for some of these corridors to return to more
natural condition.

Indirect Effects
Indirect effects on forest and grassland habitat generated by human activity would continue
along 379 miles of existing roads. Redistribution of motorized disturbance to new areas would
be minimal under alternative 3. Decrease in motorized disturbance from the existing condition,
though substantial, would be insufficient to generate measurable improvement in survivorship
and viability of wildlife populations. However, decrease in local disturbance levels would be
noticeable at several sites as shifts in wildlife behavior and local habitat use patterns.

Effects of Alternative 4
Direct Effects
Alternative 4 would not add to direct effects on forest or grassland habitat since no new road or
trail routes would be constructed. This alternative retains 57 fewer miles of open road and

motor trail than the current system but 13 miles more than alternative 3. Still, this affords the
opportunity for several route corridors to return to more natural condition.

Indirect Effects
Indirect effects on forest and grassland habitat would continue to come from human activity
along 393 miles of existing roads. Redistribution of motorized disturbance to new areas would
be less than under alternatives 1 and 2, but somewhat greater than alternative 3. Decrease in
motorized disturbance from the existing condition, though substantial, would be insufficient to
generate measurable improvement in survivorship and viability of wildlife populations.
However, decrease in local disturbance levels would be noticeable at several sites as shifts in
wildlife behavior and local habitat use patterns.

Effects of Alternative 5
Direct Effects
Alternative 5 would not add to direct effects on forest or grassland habitat since no new road or
trail routes would be constructed. This alternative retains 126 fewer miles of open road and
motor trail than the current system, affording the widest opportunity of any alternative for
some of these corridors to return to more natural condition.

Indirect Effects
Indirect effects on forest and grassland habitat generated by human activity would continue
along 324 miles of existing roads. Redistribution of motorized disturbance to new areas would
be minimal under alternative 5. Decrease in motorized disturbance from the existing condition,
though the most substantial of any altarnative, would be insufficient to generate measurable
improvement in survivorship and viability of wildlife populations. Decrease in local disturbance
levels would be noticeable at many sites in terms of shifts in wildlife behavior and local habitat
use patterns.

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and activities, in addition to
proposed Travel Management, that may affect general forest, old-growth and grassland habitat.
The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest
inholdings) and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County, Municipal and BLM).

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Several past and ongoing activities on the National Forest add to the direct effect of the road
system on forest and grassland habitats. These include activities that remove or alter wildlife
habitat such as timber sales, prescribed burning, harvest of dead trees, small mining operations,
noxious weed spraying and cattle grazing. A number of projects designed to deal with the bark
beetle outbreak are underway, some already completed. These include the Cromwell Dixon
campground, Park Lake campground, Kading campground, Moose Creek picnic area,
MacDonald Pass Ski Trails and Forestwide roadside hazard tree removal projects. Also nearing
completion is the Clancy-Unionville vegetation project, an extensive operation originally
designed to thin mature green forest, but now primarily a dead-tree harvest. In addition, the
MacDonald Pass carbaryl spraying project is designed to fend off additional beetle kill at

Environmental Impact Statement

developed recreation sites. Road access to upper Tenmile Creek is currently blocked by an
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) operation to deal with toxic mine wastes.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Vegetation management on private lands, particularly ongoing harvest of beetle-killed trees,
increases fragmentation and edge effects and may result in habitat loss for some species. Large
projects include expansion of developed recreation facilities (Great Divide ski area), expansion
of mining operations (Montana Tunnels), roadside tree cutting along Highway 12 and
reconstructing the Marysville Road.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities that may directly affect forest and grassland habitat include
revision of management plans for several grazing allotments, more projects designed to deal
with the aftermath of the mountain pine beetle epidemic; timber harvest projects (the
Telegraph, Red Mountain Flume and Tenmile south Helena vegetation projects); post and pole
harvest; ongoing firewood cutting; rerouting of some sections of the Continental Divide trail;
and the Rimini Road improvement project. These activities may positively or negatively affect
forest or grassland vegetation structure (including fragmentation and edge effect), some
substantially, others to a minor degree.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Numerous small developments and activities will continue to affect forest and grassland
habitats. Development of private land would continue to diminish wildlife habitat, increase
edge effects and fragment habitat. Removal of beetle-killed trees will continue to modify
habitat adjacent to the Forest.

Summary and Conclusions
All alternatives are in compliance with the Helena Forest Plan and with other appropriate legal
mandates with regard to direct and indirect effects of roads and motor trails on forest and
grassland habitat.

Disturbance
Alternative 1 would retain potential for motorized disturbance of wildlife along 450 miles of
roads and trails. Alternative 2 would decrease motorized disturbance in some areas and
increase it in others, but overall would reduce the motor route system to 445 miles. Under
Alternative 3, redistribution of motorized disturbance to new areas would be minimal and the
system would decrease to 370 miles. Alternative 4 is similar to alternative 3 but with 379 miles
of open routes. Alternative 5 is the most distinctive of the action alternatives in that it retains
substantially less open road (260 miles) while authorizing appreciably more motor trails (64
miles) than other options. Differences in motorized disturbance among alternatives would be
insufficient to generate measurable differences in survivorship and viability of wildlife
populations. Differences in wildlife habitat use patterns would be noticeable in local areas:
alternatives 1 and 2 would generate the most local disturbance, alternative 5 the least.

Habitat Loss
There would be no new road building and thus, no new habitat loss under any of the five
alternatives.

WILDLIFE - 389

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Edge Effects
Because, in the short-term, edge would remain the same along both open and closed roads,
there would be no differences in edge effects among the five alternatives. Over the long term,
edge will become less distinct along many closed roads as surrounding vegetation moves into
the road corridors. Areawide implications for wildlife are minor.

Riparian Habitats

Riparian Habitat: Common Effects of Travel Management

Riparian zones occupy relatively small areas, but they incur a disproportionate amount of
human activity (Hutto and Young 1999; Thomas 1979). Roads in riparian zones reduce habitat
effectiveness for many wildlife species through vegetation alteration and disturbance associated
with human presence (USFS 1996a). Many riparian zones are paralleled by roads, which often
host dispersed camping sites near the water. While this may enhance recreation opportunity
for camping, angling and wildlife viewing, it decreases habitat effectiveness of the riparian area
for many species. Recreation and firewood retrieval are the main activities facilitated by roads
in and adjacent to riparian areas.
The Divide Travel Plan Area currently supports about 93 miles of roads and motorized trails
within riparian habitat conservation areas (RHCAs), 83 miles of which are open to motorized
use. Table 100 summarizes mileage of motorized routes in riparian habitat conservation areas
under each of the five alternatives. Total open road miles are shown for comparison. Since in
many of these areas recreationists are allowed to drive up to 300 feet off the road to camp, the
zone of influence associated with these routes can be substantial.

Riparian Habitat: Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1
Current direction for off-road use in riparian areas is based on the Off-Highway Vehicle EIS
(2001). This allows for motorized travel up to 300 feet off designated routes to reach dispersed
campsites. Under Alternative 1, current levels of vegetation alteration and disturbance
associated with dispersed camping would continue. The potential for widespread degradation is
unlikely because the off-route use is restricted to dispersed camping. Vehicles are not
permitted in the off-route corridor for activities other than camping (firewood cutting,
picnicking, game retrieval, off-route recreational riding and so on). Periodic displacement of
wildlife and localized degradation of habitat components (vegetation, woody debris) would
continue at current levels. Impacts may be largely eliminated by suspension of the “300 feet
rule” in certain sensitive riparian areas where off-road vehicle is likely to cause environmental
damage.

WILDLIFE - 390

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would reduce the reach of open roads and motor trails in Riparian Habitat
Conservation Areas by six miles. This would result in a proportional decline in the impacts
summarized above in this section and in the previous section under “Affected Environment”.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would reduce open roads and motor trails in riparian habitat conservation areas by
22 miles, resulting in a consequent decline in the impacts summarized previously.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would reduce open roads and motor trails in riparian habitat conservation areas by
18 miles compared to current conditions, not quite as much as the reduction under Alternative
3. Still, this would measurably reduce local impacts in riparian sites.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would reduce open roads and motor trails in riparian habitat conservation areas by
29 miles, the most of any alternative. About one mile of currently open road in Slate Creek and
upper Tenmile Creek would be converted to motor trail. Overall, this would decrease riparian
impacts discussed previously.

Riparian Habitat: Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition to
proposed travel management, that may affect riparian habitats. The scope of the analysis
includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and immediately
surrounding lands.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Several recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest have implications for riparian
habitat, some positive. These include revision of grazing allotment permits that incorporate
riparian fencing and other means of limiting cattle access to productive wet habitats
(MacDonald Pass, Empire, Clancy); mine reclamation designed to limit seepage of toxic waste
into steams and riparian sites (Charter Oak, Frohner, Rimini); implementation of the Helena NF
Weed EIS, which will improve the functioning of vegetation associations in some in some
riparian sites; relocation of heavily-used recreational trails upslope out of riparian bottoms; and
closure of roads that have degraded riparian habitats. Some activities may reduce riparian
habitat effectiveness. These include scattered small mining operations (under the 1872 Mining
Act), cattle grazing in riparian sites on many allotments and retention of roads in riparian areas
that slowly slough sediment into streams. A number of recently completed and ongoing
vegetation projects have some potential to increase stream sedimentation and thus affect the
quality of the riparian environment, although most potential impacts have been reduced,
eliminated, or mitigated via the standard project NEPA process. Projects include the ClancyUnionville vegetation project; MacDonald Pass CDNST trailhead, Kading campground, Park Lake
campground, Moose Creek picnic area, MacDonald Pass Ski Trails and Cromwell Dixon
campground hazard tree removal.

WILDLIFE - 391

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Private land development continues to impact productive wet sites in some riparian areas. This
is occurring near the Forest boundary on both sides of the Divide, as well as on private
inholdings within the Forest. Timber harvest on private, State, BLM and Helena City lands may
also have implications for wildlife habitat in riparian areas, some positive, some negative.
Mining operations near the Forest have compromised the integrity of riparian function in the
past and continue to do so in some areas. The recently completed Marysville Road project has
influenced, if only marginally, the functioning of a drainage originating on the National Forest,
though long-term reduction of sediment is a benefit.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Foreseeable activities that may affect riparian habitats to one degree or another include the
upgrading of the Rimini Road, which closely parallels Tenmile Creek and reauthorization of
grazing in some of the Divide allotments, which inevitably involves riparian area monitoring and
improvement of problem sites. Larger vegetation projects likely to influence some riparian areas
include the Red Mountain Flume-Chessman Reservoir, Telegraph and Tenmile South Helena
projects.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Activity on non-Forest land expected to continue and add to the effects of travel management in
riparian areas includes: settlement and development of private lands (including road building)
that encompass riparian sites; timber harvest and removal of beetle-killed trees in and around
riparian areas; continued mining operations that alter stream courses and add to stream
sedimentation; continued ATV and other motorized activity in riparian areas on private, BLM
and State lands; continued livestock grazing on adjacent private and BLM lands; continued
diversion and impoundment of streams flowing off the National Forest for agricultural purposes
and in Tenmile Creek, for municipal water supply.

Riparian Habitat: Summary and Conclusions
All five alternatives would comply with Helena Forest Plan direction as to the effects of roads on
riparian and wetland wildlife habitat, primarily with regard to summer elk habitat in the
Montana Elk-Logging Study (HFP, Appendix C).
Alternative 1 would retain 96 miles of open roads and motor trails in riparian habitat
conservation areas (RHCAs). Alternative 2 would close roads/ motor trails in some riparian
habitat conservation areas and allow new motorized use in others, reducing overall presence to
90 miles. Alternative 3 would not introduce any new motorized use into currently restricted
riparian habitat conservation areas and would reduce overall road/ motor trail presence to 74
miles in these habitats. Alternative 4 would close nearly as many roads/ motor trails in riparian
habitat conservation areas (78 miles) as Alternative 3, but would sanction ongoing unauthorized
use at two sites (Spotted Dog Creek, Bison/ Ontario Creeks), a total distance of about one mile.
Alternative 5 would retain the fewest riparian habitat conservation areas roads of any
alternative, 67 miles. It would convert about one mile of existing open road in riparian habitat
conservation areas to motor trail.
In most cases, direct impact on riparian wildlife habitats from use of these roads and trails
would be minor (from erosion and sedimentation). Most effects would be indirect: disturbance

Environmental Impact Statement

of wildlife in these focal habitats and soil/vegetation damage from off-route riding. These
effects would be local and would not be measurable in terms of areawide population viability.

Connectivity and Fragmentation
Connectivity is important because it allows animals to move between habitats to meet daily and
lifetime needs (Forman et al. 2003). It also allows repopulation of unoccupied areas. Restricted
movement results in habitats where some species are absent, others are present in numbers
well below carrying capacity and diversity is depressed. This increases the risk of isolation,
decreased gene flow and local extinction (Forman et al. 2003; Noss et al. 1996).
Roads vary widely in their role as agents of fragmentation. Some highways act as true barriers
for large numbers of species, substantially altering the way animals are able to move through
the landscape [Figure 16, Figure 17]. Many Forest roads, on the other hand, are so
nondescript and little used that they exert virtually no influence at all on wildlife movement
patterns [Figure 13 to Figure 15, Figure 40, Figure 58].
Roads are not necessarily negative factors and some species are attracted to them (Knight and
Kawashima 1993; Knight et al. 1995). Ravens are more abundant along roadsides than
elsewhere because of food produced by road-kills. Many birds do not perceive roads as any
more of a deterrent to normal activity than natural features of the landscape (St. Clair 2003).
Lynx cross roads at frequencies that do not differ from random expectations (Ruggiero et al.
2000). Deer may be drawn to the forage provided by roadside vegetation, especially in spring.
Carnivores, such as wolves, bears, coyotes and bobcats use roads with low levels of human
activity as travelways, often at night, but sometimes during the day. This use may be greater in
winter when some roads become hard-packed snowmobile routes.

Connectivity: Common Effects of Travel Management

In the following assessment, effects on connectivity are described in terms of the ability of the
landscape to provide dispersal, migration and travel opportunities between suitable habitat
patches. The focus is on regional dispersal of large and mid-sized mammals through the
Continental Divide linkage zone, but the assessment is also applicable to more localized
movement zones. We assume that the primary human-generated complication for these
landscape functions is the density and dispersion of open roads (and in some cases, motorized
trails) and we use this as the basis for two indices to compare alternatives: (1) open road
density and (2) large non-motorized habitat patches.

Paved Roads and Highways
Most of the field studies and literature reviews that have found roads to be “barriers” impeding
wildlife movement and “fragmenting” habitat have dealt with paved roads and highways that
carry a recurrent flow of fast-moving traffic. These roads are hard-surfaced, wide, elevated and
often flanked by cleared corridors, fences and other impediments. They can be formidable
hostile environments, especially for small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and low-flying birds
(Mader 1984; Swihart and Slade 1984). Traffic speed and volume on some of these highways
make crossing them a challenge for humans, to say nothing of foxes, bears, rabbits, squirrels,
grouse, owls and other animals not entirely aware of the hazard they face. Some larger animals
may avoid crossing paved roads and consequently extend and convolute their movement
patterns to compensate (Trombulak and Frissell 2000). For some species, the mere presence of
a highway acts as a barrier. For others, the width of the road, associated clearing and the
presence of roadside barriers (typically fences) may be the deciding factors (Oxley, et al. 1974).
WILDLIFE - 393

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The only paved highway in the Travel Plan Area is U.S. Highway 12, a well-traveled four-lane
thoroughfare that runs through Helena NF lands for about four miles on its way over MacDonald
Pass, an area where numerous wildlife species are killed by vehicles each year [Figure 16]. The
Highway also runs close enough to the National Forest for another 15 to 16 miles on both sides
of the pass that it influences animals crossing from one part of the National Forest to another
over private, State and BLM lands. No Travel Plan alternative proposes any changes that directly
or indirectly alter the impact of Highway 12.

Forest Roads
With the exception of the Orofino Gulch Road, the Marysville Road and the lower segment of
the Little Blackfoot River Road, all Forest/County roads in or near the Travel Plan Area are
unpaved routes that range from regularly graded, well-traveled gravel roads [Figure 17] to
rough, narrow four-wheel-drive tracks that may see vehicles pass only two or three times a
week [Figure 13, Figure 59]. Most Forest roads fall somewhere in between these extremes
Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 44, Figure 48]. The implications of this type of road system for
wildlife have been discussed earlier; but, in essence, most of these routes do not physically
impede movement by most animals. Rather, they serve as conduits for human activity that
causes some species to avoid the road corridors or to seek out alternate travelways,
complicating their ability to move through the landscape in an efficient manner. Crossing these
roads can be lethal in that it puts big game animals at risk from hunters in the fall and certain
carnivores at risk from general shooting any time of the year. The roads also provide access for
trappers on snowmobiles in the winter.
Regularly traveled routes, such as the Sweeney Creek, Rimini and Little Blackfoot River roads,
are more formidable barriers to movement than the narrow, lightly traveled roads characteristic
of much of the Plan Area. Vehicle speeds may be high enough on sections of these roads that
animals are hit and killed [Figure 17]. The summary below in Table 101 shows unweighted
densities of open roads and motor trails in the Divide landscape (within Helena NF
administrative boundaries). Overall route densities range from 1.55 mi/mi² at present to 1.20
mi/mi² under alternative 5. Because this computation gives equal weight, in terms of human
disturbance, to primitive, little-used routes and major Forest thoroughfares, it tends to
exaggerate the impact of the travel network. An earlier, but more limited version of this
analysis that weighted roads by estimated use level [Draft Wildlife Background Report, 2013]
produced weighted road densities in the range of 0.71 to 0.84 mi/mi². These estimates were
considerably less precise than those shown in Table 101, but they probably more accurately
portray the general level of impact perceived by animals attempting to navigate the landscape.

Alternative 2 would eliminate only five miles of open road and motor trail in the Travel Plan
Area [Table 98], resulting in minimal change in road density in the landscape as a whole.
Alternatives 3 and 4 would eliminate 57 to 71 miles of road and motor trail and would produce a
more appreciable drop in open route density. Alternative 5 would close a net total of 126 miles

of road and trail to motorized use and would produce the most obvious decline in open route
density. In general, the decline in open routes would be more substantial in the area north of
Highway 12 than in the area to the south.
Table 102 summarizes the occurrence of non-motorized habitat patches larger than 1,500 acres
throughout the Travel Plan Area. Unlike elk security areas and grizzly bear core areas, which are
buffered from motor routes by unroaded zones of 0.3 and 0.5 miles, the non-motorized patches
delineated for connectivity purposes begin at the edge of the road/trail corridor, the corridor
being defined as a 300 foot zone on either side of an open road and a 150 foot zone on either
side of a motor trail. These habitat blocks provide sanctuaries in which animals wary of road
activity should be able to operate with minimal disturbance from humans. All things being
equal, fewer, larger patches translate to better habitat integrity and connectivity for these
animals. It should be noted that most of these habitat patches abut additional unroaded
country in adjacent travel plan areas, ranger districts and blocks of non Forest land and are thus
larger than than the acreages shown in Table 102.

The data in Table 102 are summarized in Table 103 in terms of the number of large unroaded
patches, average patch size and percent of the Plan Area occupied by such habitat. North of
Highway 12 all four action alternatives enlarge average patch size and reduce the number of
patches (compared to now) by lumping unroaded areas between Sweeney and Austin Creeks
and in the Black Mountain–Deadman Creek area. As discussed earlier, an array of larger patches
(even if unconnected) appears to provide greater habitat opportunity than a collection of
numerous small patches connected by narrow corridors.
South of Highway 12, alternative 2 consolidates patches in the Slate Lake–Hat Creek area but
splits an unroaded block in Ontario–Bison Creek with a motor trail. Alternative 3, on the other
hand, combines three separate unroaded patches in the Slate Lake–Hat Creek–Spotted Dog area
and enlarges the Bison Creek–Ontario Creek, Electric Peak block. Alternatives 4 and 5, like
alternative 2, splits the Bison-Ontario Creek block and the Hat Creek-Spotted Dog block with
motorized routes; but the resulting unroaded blocks are larger than in alternative 2. Overall,
alternative 5 provides the most land in large non-motorized patches, increasing such habitat
from 63 percent to 74 percent of the Travel Plan Area. Looking at the landscape as a whole,
average patch size under all alternatives is larger than indicated here, since several of these
habitat blocks connect with other non-motorized areas outside the Plan Area.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The benefits of establishing and maintaining corridors between suitable habitat patches versus
enlarging patches in which various species can survive over time has been analyzed by Falcy and
Estades (2007). They conclude that enlarging viable habitat patches is a more productive
strategy than trying to maintain corridor connections between smaller patches. Rosenberg et
al. (1997) reached a similar conclusion. In the case of the Divide landscape, none of the patches
are truly isolated from any other (although Highway 12 does present a formidable barrier for
some species). So, alternatives that consolidate and enlarge effective living space would be the
most beneficial for local wildlife. This pattern of larger unroaded patches would also facilitate
movement through the Divide landscape linkage zone. In this regard, Alternative 2 is somewhat
more effective than the current condition (alternative 1) and alternatives 3, 4 and 5 are
substantially more so.
None of the alternatives would influence the more prominent roads that retard or alter efficient
wildlife movement through the Divide landscape. These include U.S. Highway 12, the Rimini
road (Powell County Road #495), the Little Blackfoot River road (Forest Road #227), the Mullan
Pass–Austin Creek road (Forest Road #1805), the Sweeney Creek–Priest Pass road (Forest Road
#335), the Orofino Gulch road (Lewis & Clark County Road #454) and the Grizzly Gulch road
(County Road #753).

Connectivity: Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 would preserve the existing condition, maintaining 20 non-motorized habitat
blocks larger than 1,500 acres in the Travel Plan Area. The nine patches north of U.S. Highway
12 average 3,319 acres in size, the 11 patches south of the highway average 7,403 acres. Patch
size south of the highway is influenced by the three inventoried Roadless Areas in that part of
the Plan Area. Overall patch size averages 5,565 acres. Roughly 63 percent of Helena NF land is
in large non-motorized patches with Alternative 1.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would reduce the number of large non-motorized habitat patches from 20 to 17 by
consolidating unroaded areas between Sweeney and Austin Creeks and in the Black Mountain–
Deadman Creek area. As a result, average size of these habitat blocks north of Highway 12
would increase from 3,319 acres to 4,465 acres. This would benefit a number of resident wildlife
species and would make movement through the linkage zone less problematic. The alternative
would consolidate non-motorized patches in the Slate Lake–Hat Creek area but would split a
non-motorized habitat block in the Ontario–Bison Creek area with a motor trail (on now-closed
Roads #4104-A1 and #4104-A2). The average size of non-motorized blocks south of the highway
would increase from 7,403 acres to 7,732 acres. In the Planning Area as a whole, patch size
would increase from 5,564 acres to 6,391 acres.
While increasing average patch size, Alternative 2 would slightly reduce the total amount of land
in large non-motorized patches compared to the existing condition. In the Slate Lake–Hat Creek
area, for example, the proposal combines two non-motorized patches, but at the same time, it
shaves the size of the Slate Lake portion by designating a new motorized trail in a currently
restricted area. On balance, the improvement in non-motorized patch size would be favorable
to wildlife movement through the area, more than making up for the slight overall loss of nonmotorized acreage.

WILDLIFE - 397

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would reduce the number of large non-motorized habitat blocks from 20 to 15 by
combining unroaded areas north of Highway 12 between Sweeney and Austin Creeks and in the
Black Mountain–Deadman Creek area. It is similar to Alternative 2 in this regard, but by
eliminating additional motorized routes toward the periphery of the consolidated patches, it
would produce larger non-motorized blocks than Alternative 2. Average patch size north of
Highway 12 would increase from 3,319 acres to 4,881 acres.
South of Highway 12, Alternative 3 would merge five separate non-motorized patches north of,
east of and including the Electric Peak Roadless Area into a single non-motorized habitat block
of 48,900 acres. Unlike Alternative 2, it would retain the integrity of the Bison–Ontario Creek
habitat area and would eliminate motor travel in the Baldy ridge area. In sum, Alternative 3
would increase acreage in large non-motorized habitat blocks in the Plan Area from 111,305
acres to 121,705 acres. It would increase the average non-motorized patch size from 5,565
acres to 8,114 acres. Key areas that would see improvement in facilitating wildlife movement
through the area would be (1) Black Mountain–upper Deadman Creek, (2) Austin Creek–
Sweeney Creek–Priest Pass, (3) Bison Creek–Ontario Creek and (3) Slate Lake–Hat Creek–
Spotted Dog Creek.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 3, but it provides for three more motorized routes in
strategic locations, resulting in slightly less acreage in large non-motorized patches (120,155
acres in alternative 4 as opposed to 121,705 acres in Alternative 3) and smaller average patch
size (7,510 acres in Alternative 4; 8,114 acres in Alternative 3). The increase in patch size is
achieved by consolidation of adjacent areas, thus reducing the total number of large nonmotorized habitat patches from the current 20 to 16 (one more than Alternative 3, by virtue of
its splitting off the Treasure Mountain and Slate Lake–Hat Creek areas from the central Electric
Peak Roadless Area with motorized routes).
Three routes would fragment or reduce the size of non-motorized patches: (1) a motor trail
north of Meyers Hill (#136-007), (2) a motor trail following Roads #4104-A1 and #4104-A2 along
upper Ontario and Bison Creeks and (3) Road #314 in upper Spotted Dog Creek. Effects would
be felt primarily in the Bison-Ontario and upper Spotted Dog areas as a result of motorized
intrusion into high-country summer ranges. The Meyers Hill route would be less problematic.
Be that as it may, Alternative 4, while somewhat more disruptive of local wildlife than
Alternative 3, would be a substantial improvement over Alternatives 1 and 2 in this regard.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would provide the most non-motorized habitat of any alternative: 130,745 acres,
74 percent of the Travel Plan Area. This represents an increase of 19,440 acres (or 11 percent)
over the existing condition in Alternative 1. The increase is particularly notable in the area north
of Highway 12, where substantial increases in non-motorized habitat would occur around Black
Mountain–Deadman Creek, Esmeralda Hill–Clarks Canyon, Greenhorn Mountain, Sweeney
Creek– Austin Creek and Little Porcupine Creek. In total, large non-motorized habitat patches
would increase from 29,870 acres to 43,765 north of the highway (up 47 percent). This is
substantially more than any other alternative.
South of Highway 12, increases would be considerably less, seven percent over current
conditions. Some non-motorized blocks would decrease in size or would be fragmented into
two smaller patches. This follows from the sanctioning of a number of new motor trails
WILDLIFE - 398

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

throughout the area. In some cases, the new trails would be converted from existing open
roads, but in others, they would be established on currently closed roads, sometimes with newly
built connector routes. Those likely to generate the most problems for wildlife are in the area
between Negro Mountain and upper Telegraph Creek (the #1857-1859 road system), in upper
Ontario Creek (road #4104-A1, as in Alternatives 2 and 4) and particularly, in the Slate Lake area
(the #1871 road system), where illegal ORV use has damaged the wet meadow system in the
past [see the later section on “Local Effects in Key Areas”].

Connectivity: Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the matrix in appendix B, which identifies all
past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions and circumstances, in addition to proposed
Travel Management, that may affect connectivity. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide
landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings), adjacent National Forest lands (on the
Lincoln Ranger District and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF) and neighboring non-Forest lands
(private, State, County, municipal and BLM). This summary is common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Several recent and ongoing activities on the Forest may affect habitat connectivity and the way
animals move through the landscape. Actions that have improved connectivity and habitat
quality in the Divide linkage zone include: implementation of the Statewide OHV Plan (USFS,
USFWS 2001), which prohibits riding off established motor routes; a variety of trail relocation
projects that have removed trails from sensitive wildlife areas likely to serve as local movement
corridors to upslope locations; mine reclamation projects that have improved the functioning of
riparian habitats likely to attract animals moving through a linkage zone; grazing allotment
revisions that have generally reduced cattle numbers and improved habitat condition; and road
and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest projects (Clancy-Unionville, Sound
Wood, Mullan Pass, Lava Mountain, Treasure Mountain).

Activities that have reduced effectiveness of connectivity or had a mixed impact (negative for
some species, positive for others) include: timber harvest that has created large clearcuts (Bison
Creek, Mike Renig-Hahn Creek, Deadman Creek, Slate Creek, Ophir Creek-Cave Gulch, Lump
Gulch, Lava Mountain, Mullan Pass); road permits allowing access across Helena NF land to
private holdings; retention of recreational residences on Helena NF land (as at MacDonald Pass);
small mining operations (under the 1872 Mining Act); construction and maintenance of power
lines and communications sites; Forest road improvement projects that have widened road
corridors; and fencing associated with grazing allotments that can impede movement by some
animals.
Recently, harvest of snags from the mountain pine beetle outbreak have created “clean”
openings in the forest, whereas natural processes eventually would have produced openings full
of large woody debris. Most of these projects have been along roads and at developed
recreation and administrative sites and so have had little impact on unroaded habitat. Most
recently, the Red Mountain Flume-Chessman Reservoir project, on both National Forest and
private land, has been removing dead trees from a broad corridor along the flume and around
the Reservoir in the upper Tenmile drainage. The project has been mostly completed on private
lands, but is ongoing on the Helena NF.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Private land development (esp. rural home building) continues to create sites that make it more
difficult for animals to move through the landscape. Problems also come from new and
upgraded roads, mining operations, ATV-trail bike riding areas, private timber harvest, clearing
of vegetative cover from riparian sites and widening and paving of the Marysville road.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect connectivity to one degree
or another include improvement of the Rimini Road and projects designed reduce fuel
accumulations and salvage dead trees created by the on-going bark beetle outbreak, in
particular the Telegraph and Tenmile South Helena projects.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that is expected to continue in the
future and that may affect connectivity includes: settlement and associated development of
private lands (including road building); timber harvest and removal of beetle-killed dead trees;
continued mining operations that usurp habitat and create disturbance zones (most notably, the
Montana Tunnels mine expansion); continued ATV and other motorized activity.

Connectivity: Summary and Conclusions
All alternatives would comply with mandates and management direction as to the impacts of
roads and motor trails on connectivity and fragmentation. The Helena Forest Plan has no
standards or guidelines that deal directly with the issue, although some of those dealing with big
game and grizzly bear habitat are relevant.
Alternative 1 would retain current unweighted open route density of 1.55 mi/mi². Acreage of
large non-motorized habitat patches would remain unchanged at 111,305 acres (63 percent of
all land in the Plan Area). Under Alternative 2, open route density would decline slightly to 1.52
mi/mi². The area occupied by large non-motorized habitat patches would decrease slightly to
109,970 acres (62 percent of all land ownership). Alternative 3 would lower open route density
to 1.34 mi/mi² and increase the total of large non-motorized habitat blocks to 121,705 acres (68
percent of lands in the Plan Area). Alternative 4 would allow for a slightly higher open route
density than Alternative 3, 1.37 mi/mi², but less than Alternatives 1 and 2. The area covered by
large non-motorized blocks would increase over current acreage to 120,155 acres, a bit less than
Alternative 3, but more than Alternatives 1 and 2. With Alternative 5, open route density would
decrease to 1.20 mi/mi², substantially lower than at present; non-motorized habitat patches
would total 130,745 acres (74 percent of the Plan Area), the most of any alternative.
Dirt/gravel Forest roads and motor trails would not physically “fragment” the environment in
ways meaningful to most wildlife species [exceptions being some small mammals and
amphibians]. Differences between alternatives would arise from the degree to which they
provide refuges free from human activity along open roads and motor trails. In this regard,
Alternatives 1 and 2 would be similar. Alternatives 3, 4 and 5, on the other hand, would provide
a number of new opportunities for wildlife use of non-motorized habitat patches, although each
would provide these patches in different patterns.

Snags and Woody Debris
Snags and Woody Debris: Common Effects of Travel Management
Direct Effects
Direct effects of Forest roads on snags and coarse woody debris stem from initial clearing of the
road corridor, leading to conversion of suitable habitat to non-habitat for the long-term (Hann
et al. 1997, Reed et al. 1996, Trombulak and Frissell 2000). The same is true for motor trails,
though to a lesser degree since most trail corridors are relatively narrow. As none of the Divide
Travel Plan alternatives propose any new road or trail construction, no direct effects follow.

Indirect Effects
Indirectly, roads negatively impact snags and logs by providing access for firewood retrieval
(Hann et al. 1997; Hamann et al. 1999; Bate and Wisdom 2002a, 2002b). Traditionally, effects
were limited to the distance a person could cut and carry firewood to a vehicle. Now, retrieval
is aided by technology, such as cable systems and by increased access through off-road driving
(Bate and Wisdom 2002a). Most recently, the ability of firewood cutters to drive further offroad than in the past has been facilitated by the mountain pine beetle outbreak, which has
opened up the forest and provided new access routes. Formal studies that quantify the indirect
impacts of roads on snags and logs have been lacking until recent studies in Montana and
Oregon (Bate and Wisdom 2002a, 2002b; Wisdom and Bate 2008).

Standing Dead Trees

Wisdom and Bate (2008) found that on the Flathead NF in Montana, mean snag density was 40
percent lower in forested areas within 50 meters (164 feet) of an open road compared to areas
beyond that distance. This was true of 88 percent of the unharvested forest stands that they
sampled. In the zone 50 to 100 meters (164 to 328 feet) from the road, 48 percent of the stands
showed signs of snag removal; and in the region beyond 100 meters, 22 percent of the stands
were found to have been cut.
Table 104 estimates how much habitat in the Travel Plan Area may be susceptible to roadside
snag removal under different alternatives. I have used data from the marten habitat model to
estimate potential large snag habitat, since this is a summation of most of the mature forest
habitat in the Plan Area (where most of the large snags occur). Estimates of the potential
firewood retrieval area are shown for distances of 70, 150 and 300 feet from the road (140, 300
and 600 foot corridors).

Recently, the average number of large dead trees (greater than seven inch diameter-at-breastheight) in these areas has been a fluid quantity because of the increasing numbers of new snags
made available by the mountain pine beetle infestation between 2006 and 2012. Snag numbers
will be high in mature stands dominated by ponderosa pine and especially, by lodgepole pine
(Figure 18, Figure 47, Figure 48) and usually much lower in stands dominated by other
conifer species. For snag-associated wildlife, loss of standing dead trees means loss of nesting,
roosting and foraging habitat, as well as hiding and thermal cover. [See also the black-backed,
pileated and hairy woodpecker analyses and marten analysis below for additional discussion of
the effects of snag removal on wildlife].
In aAlternatives 2, 3 and 4, the “300-foot rule” would allow off-road vehicle use for dispersed
camping in a 600-foot road corridor. Alternative 5 would reduce the off-road driving distance to
30 feet, with dispersed camping allowed out to 70 feet (a 140-foot off-road corridor). These off-

road driving zones are intended to apply only to dispersed camping, not firewood cutting. It is
likely, however, that many firewood gatherers will continue to drive off-road a certain distance
to load firewood (as is common practice now). Also, under the 300 foot rule, it would be
permissible to cut firewood from an occupied dispersed camp site up to 300 feet off the road.
Firewood cutters will be drawn further into the forest in areas where the Roadside Hazard Tree
Project has already removed dead trees from the first 50 to 150 feet adjacent to the road. The
potential loss of snags to firewood cutting in any given section of road corridor is mediated by
topography natural impediments (steep slopes, streams, rock outcrops).

Coarse Woody Debris
Effects on logs in the road corridor are a direct result of snag attrition and removal for firewood.
Bate and Wisdom (2002b) found that log densities along open roads were significantly lower
than those along closed roads. The areas vulnerable to large log attrition are thus the same as
those for snags. In general, roadside corridors are likely to have more remaining large logs than
snags. Some snags will fall before they are taken for firewood and if not solid, will be left in
place by firewood gatherers. This will be the case most often with the more punky ponderosa
pine logs than with lodgepole pine. Because of the large volume of dead timber now available
and the relatively short time span that beetle-killed trees remain standing, downed trees will be
providing an increasing proportion of the roadside firewood resource over the next few years.
As with standing snags, steep slopes, rough terrain and otherwise difficult ground will limit the
extent of the roadside zone from which logs are taken. On a steep downward slope, for
example, 25 to 50 feet may be all the distance most firewood cutters are willing to venture off
the road to retrieve a fallen snag.
The loss of logs and other coarse woody debris represents a diminution of foraging, denning,
nesting and resting sites, as well as cover and refuge for a variety of wildlife species (Rose et al.
2000). Other indirect effects associated with removal of large logs include influence on basic
ecosystem processes, soil development and productivity, nutrient immobilization and
mineralization and nitrogen fixation (Rose et al. 2000).

WILDLIFE - 402

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

There would be no direct effects on snags and coarse woody debris beyond what has occurred
during past road and trail construction. No new construction is a part of Alternative 1.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 1 would preserve the existing condition in which roughly 10,650 acres of roadside
forest (about six percent of the resource) are open to removal by firewood cutters in the 300feet road corridor and 21,300 acres (nearly 12 percent of the resource) are open in the 600-feet
corridor.

Effects of Alternative 2
Direct Effects
There would be no direct effects on snags and coarse woody debris beyond what has occurred
during past road and trail construction. No new construction is a part of Alternative 2.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 2 would reduce the area available to firewood cutting to about 9,450 acres in the
300-feet road corridor and to about 18,900 acres in the 600-feet corridor. This is a reduction of
about 2,400 acres vulnerable to snag and log loss in the 600-foot corridor compared to current
circumstances.

Effects of Alternative 3
Direct Effects
There would be no direct effects on snags and coarse woody debris beyond what has occurred
during past road and trail construction. No new construction is a part of Alternative 3.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 3 would reduce the area available to firewood cutting to about 8,485 acres in the
300-feet road corridor and to about 16,970 acres in the 600-feet corridor. This is a reduction of
about 4,330 acres vulnerable to snag and log loss in the 600-foot corridor compared to current
circumstances.

Effects of Alternative 4
Direct Effects
There would be no direct effects on snags and coarse woody debris beyond what has occurred
during past road and trail construction. No new construction is a part of Alternative 4.

Indirect Effects
Alternative 4 would reduce the area potentially available to firewood cutting from around
10,650 to 8,550 acres in the 300-feet road corridor and from around 21,300 to 17,100 acres in
the 600-feet corridor, slightly more available acres than in Alternative 3. This is a reduction of
about 4,210 acres vulnerable to snag and log loss in the 600-foot corridor compared to current
circumstances.

Effects of Alternative 5

Indirect Effects
Alternative 5 would reduce the area potentially available to firewood cutting from around 4,990
acres to 2,850 in the 140-foot road corridor, from around 10,650 to 8,550 acres in the 300-feet
corridor and from around 21,300 to 17,100 acres in the 600-feet corridor. The gain in areas
beyond the reach of most firewood cutters would be the most of any alternative.

Snags and Woody Debris: Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition
to proposed Travel Management, that may affect large snags and coarse woody debris habitat.
The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land, non-Forest inholdings)
and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County, Municipal and BLM).

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Activities that have cumulatively reduced snags or the potential for snag creation include a
number of past timber sales that have created large clearcuts with minimal residual snags or
replacement snags (Bison, Ontario, Upper Telegraph, Mike Renig-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Lump
Gulch-Strawberry, Ophir Creek-Cave Gulch, Deadman, Cellar Gulch). Some projects (Mike Renig,
Upper Telegraph, Hope-Snowshoe) were specifically designed to remove dead, dying and
decadent trees. The ongoing Clancy-Unionville project in the upper Lump Gulch and Quartz
Creek drainages, originally designed to harvest green trees, is now focused primarily on
removing dead trees. Also ongoing is the Red Mountain Flume Chessman Resevoir Project,
which is removing snags from 490 acres of beetle-impacted forest in the upper Tenmile Creek
drainage. Recent Carbaryl spraying of campgrounds and other administrative sites (Cromwell
Dixon campground, MacDonald Pass trailhead) has been intended to prevent large trees from
dying in areas of concentrated public use. This enterprise has met with limited success and thus
has not been a major factor in suppressing snag creation.

The ongoing policy of allowing public firewood cutting on the National Forest is the primary
factor driving the removal of most large snags from Forest road corridors. Ongoing efforts by the
Helena NF to limit the potential safety hazard posed by large numbers of dead trees in areas
frequented by the public have accelerated the process of snag loss in road corridors and other
accessible sites. These actions have also reduced the number of snags available to firewood
cutters. Hazard tree removal projects have recently been completed or are going forward at a
number of campgrounds (Cromwell Dixon, Moose Creek, Kading, Park Lake), day-use areas
(Moose Creek, MacDonald Pass), trailheads (MacDonald Pass CDNST), administrative sites
(Moose Creek ranger station, Kading cabin), as well as along the MacDonald Pass Cross-country
ski trails and most conspicuously, along many miles of open Forest roads (an on-going
operation).
Recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest that have improved prospects for snags are
the road closures associated with a number of timber harvest projects (Clancy-Unionville, Sound
Wood, Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain, Lava Mountain), which limit roadside firewood cutting.
These projects have all adhered to Forest Plan standards for retaining snags and replacement
snags. In some cases, decisions not to pursue potential salvage opportunities (Jericho
Mountain, Snowshoe Creek, MacDonald Pass burn) have resulted in retention of large blocks of
snags.

WILDLIFE - 404

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Numerous dead-tree salvage operations on private land within and adjacent to Forest
boundaries are eliminating many of the snags being created by the current bark beetle
infestation. As well, private land development is slowly eroding snag presence on many local
sites. Many thinning and snag removal projects on private, City and State land have been driven
by the desire to reduce the potential for catastrophic fire and in some cases, to remove hazards
to public safety.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect snag density and
distribution on the National Forest include proposals to deal with the effects of the ongoing bark
beetle epidemic: the Telegraph Creek Fuels Reduction and the Tenmile South Helena Projects,
both of which would remove snags and coarse woody debris over extensive areas in the
southern Divide landscape.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that is expected to continue in the
future and that may affect snags includes the continuation of land development, thinning for
fire prevention and dead tree salvage.

Snags and Woody Debris: Summary and Conclusions
All alternatives would comply with appropriate snag standards and guidelines in the Helena
Forest Plan and with guidance in the Northern Region Snag Management Protocol (USFS 2000)
and Estimates of Snag Densities for Eastside Forests in the Northern Region (Bollenbacher et al.
2008).
Alternative 1 would retain approximately 294 miles of open road corridor available to firewood
cutters in mature forest habitats. Within a 600 foot road corridor, this represents 12 percent of
mature forest in the Travel Plan Area. Under Alternative 2, road corridor open to firewood
cutters would decline to 260 miles in mature forest. Assuming a 600 foot road corridor, this
amounts to 11 percent of mature forest habitat in the Travel Plan Area. Under Alternative 3,
open road corridor available to firewood cutting and snag removal would decline to 233 miles in
mature forest. With a 600 foot road corridor, this amounts to 10 percent of mature forest
habitat in the Travel Plan Area. Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 3. It would maintain 235
miles of road corridor open to firewood cutting in mature forest. Within a 600 foot road
corridor, this also represents 10 percent of mature forest in the Travel Plan Area. Alternative 5
would put the most roadside snag habitat off-limits to firewood cutting, maintaining 168 miles
of open road in mature habitat and providing a potential 12,220 acres in the 600 foot road
corridor.
Dead trees and increasingly, large logs are prolific on the landscape in the wake of the ongoing
bark beetle infestation. Snags in Forest road corridors susceptible to harvest by firewood
cutters represent a relatively small proportion of the available resource.

Migratory Landbirds and Shorebirds
Management direction for addressing migratory landbirds and shorebirds in project planning
derives from (1) the Forest Service’s Landbird Conservation Strategic Plan (2000), (2) Executive
Order 13186 (2001) [Fed Reg. Vol 66, No. 11, p. 3853-3856] and (3) a memorandum of
WILDLIFE - 405

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

understanding (MOU) between the Forest Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2008).
These documents focus on habitat management and its role in protecting and enhancing bird
populations. The role of road and trail system management comes into play as it relates to (1)
altering, maintaining, or enhancing suitable habitat in the road corridor or (2) funneling human
disturbance into sensitive habitat sites.

Migratory Birds: Common Effects of Travel Management
Direct Effects
Direct effects of Forest roads on migratory bird habitat stem from initial clearing and long-term
maintenance of the road corridors (generally 12 to 20 feet wide), which results in strips of nonhabitat or habitat unsuitable for many species over the long-term (Hann et al. 1997, Reed et al.
1996, Trombulak and Frissell 2000). These corridors also create edge, an effect most evident in
forest and shrub habitats, less so in grasslands [see previous section, “General Habitat: Common
Effects of Travel Management”]. While some bird species have problems with road corridor
habitat and forest edge, others are attracted by these habitat features (Bull and Wales 2001).
Similar effects would be generated by motor trails that follow old roadbeds. Those that have
been established originally as trails subtract little habitat and create little recognizable edge
since in most cases the trail corridors are very narrow and often produce no more recognizable
edge than a well-established game trail.
As none of the Divide Travel Plan alternatives propose new road construction, no direct effects
beyond those already created by the present road/ trail system would follow in any alternative.
Differences between alternatives in terms of the acreage of existing road/road corridor habitat
would be negligible in the short-term since this habitat would remain intact whether roads are
open or closed. Over the long-term, road corridor habitat and edge would decline under
alternatives that close more roads, as obliterated and unmaintained roads would begin to fill
with trees and other vegetation.

Indirect Effects
Birds dependent on dead trees are often unable to find suitable habitat in the vicinity of open
roads (within 200 to 300 feet) because of ongoing snag loss to firewood cutting and hazard tree
removal. An estimate of the acreage potentially affected by these activities under different
alternatives can be found in the previous section, “Snags and Woody Debris” (Table 104). The
overall effect of this snag depletion on local bird populations is relatively small, given the
abundance of unaffected habitat away from roads and the proliferation of dead trees across the
landscape in the wake of the mountain pine beetle epidemic.
Birds that are sensitive to human activity are unlikely to frequent areas near roads that carry a
regular flow of traffic. This is particularly true of nesting raptors and waterfowl, but it applies to
some songbirds as well, particularly specialist species. Whereas most generalist songbird
species will forage and establish nests near Forest roads and trails, a study in Colorado found
that specialist species were less common in a zone within about 250 feet of active trails (Miller
et al. 1998). A number of other studies have defined considerably wider zones of disturbance
around roads; but most of these have been investigating the effects of paved highways, which
carry much more traffic than most Forest roads (Hamann et al. 1999, p. 3.23-3.24). It is likely
that on many roads in theTravel Plan Area, traffic volume is so low that displacement of
songbirds and even raptors, is negligible.

WILDLIFE - 406

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

It should be noted that the Northern Region Landbird Monitoring Program, which employed
Forest roads and trails as transect lines, consistently picked up a wide variety of both specialist
and generalist bird species in its surveys on the Helena NF over a 14-year period [see previous
discussion in “Affected Environment: Migratory Songbirds and Landbirds”].

Migratory Birds: Comparison of Alternatives

Table 105 summarizes potential effects of road management on migratory bird species of
concern for each of the five alternatives. Removal of snags from the 300-foot wide corridors
flanking each side of open roads is a primary influence for snag users. Species listed as “averse
to nesting near open roads” would choose nesting sites in other areas, although in the Divide
Travel Plan Area, few of the nesting components used by these species are available in road
corridors to begin with. Golden eagles and prairie falcons, for example, generally nest in high
cliffs. Great blue herons establish nest colonies in groves of cottonwood trees adjacent to rivers
and lakes.

Each of the four action alternatives would decrease the acreage of roadside habitat open to the
impacts listed in Table 105. Species that make use of habitats or of habitat components little
influenced by the road system are shown as sustaining “no effect”, that is, no effect that
measurably alters their distribution or habitat use patterns within their home ranges.

As indicated in Table 86[“Affected Environment: Migratory Songbirdes and Landbirds”], Forest
roads have not been determined to be a limiting factor for any of the Species of Concern listed
in that table or in Table 105 above. None of the effects generated by any of the Divide Travel
Plan alternatives would be substantial enough to limit population potential for any of the

Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 proposes no new road or trail construction. Consequently, there would be no
direct effect on migratory bird habitat beyond that from past road/trail construction. The
alternative would maintain 450 miles of existing open road and motor trail with varying degrees
of human disturbance and edge effect. It would maintain 294 miles of open road in mature
forest habitat capable of producing snags useful to some of the species listed in Table 105.

Assuming a 300 foot wide firewood removal zone on each side of the road, this would amount
to 21,300 acres, 12 percent of such habitat in the Travel Plan Area. These effects would not be
sufficient to measurably depress populations of any bird species of concern.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would reduce open roads and motor trails slightly to 445 miles, thus subtracting
five route miles subject to motorized disruption. It would maintain 260 miles of open road in
mature forest capable of producing snags useful to some of the species listed in Table 105. This
represents a decline of 34 miles from existing condition. Assuming a 300 foot wide firewood
removal zone on each side of the road, this would amount to 18,900 acres, 11 percent of such
habitat in the Travel Plan Area. These effects would not be sufficient to measurably increase or
decrease populations of any bird species of concern.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would reduce open roads and motor trails to 379 miles, a decline of 61 miles in
routes with motorized disturbance. Alternative 3 would maintain 233 miles of open road in
mature forest habitat capable of producing snags useful to some of the species listed in Table
105. This is a decline of 71 miles from existing condition. Assuming a 300 foot wide firewood
removal zone on each side of the road, this would amount to 16,970 acres, 10 percent of such
habitat in the Travel Plan Area. The net effect would not be sufficient to measurably alter
population potential of any bird species of concern.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would reduce open roads and motor trails to 393 miles, somewhat more than
Alternative 3 but 57 miles less than at present. These closed routes would no longer be subject
to motorized disturbance. Alternative 4 would maintain 235 miles of open road in mature forest
habitat capable of producing snags useful to some of the species listed in Table 105. This is
similar to Alternative 3 and 57 miles less than the existing condition. Assuming a 300 foot wide
firewood removal zone on each side of the road, this would amount to 16,970 acres, 10 percent
of such habitat in the Travel Plan Area. The net effects would not be sufficient to measurably
alter population potential of any bird species of concern.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would reduce open roads and motor trails to 325 miles. This is 126 miles less than
at present and represents the largest decine of any alternative in routes no longer susceptible to
motorized disturbance. Alternative 5 would maintain 168 miles of open road in mature forest
habitat capable of producing snags useful to some of the species listed in Table 105. This
represents a substantial decrease, 126 miles, from existing condition. Assuming a 300-foot wide
firewood removal zone on each side of the road, this would amount to 16,970 acres, only seven
percent of such habitat in the Travel Plan Area. The net effects of these changes would not be
large enough to measurably increase population potential of any bird species of concern.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Activities that have cumulatively altered habitat for migratory birds by reducing snags or shifting
the balance between mature and early-seral forest include a number of past timber sales:
Bison, Ontario, Upper Telegraph, Mike Renig-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Lump Gulch-Strawberry,
Ophir Creek-Cave Gulch, Deadman and Cellar Gulch. Some projects (Mike Renig, Upper
Telegraph, Hope-Snowshoe) were specifically designed to remove dead, dying and decadent
trees. The recently completed Clancy-Unionville project in the upper Lump Gulch and Quartz
Creek drainages, originally designed to harvest green trees, ended up focusing primarily on
removing dead trees created by the bark beetle outbreak. Prominent among ongoing habitatalterning projects is the the Red Mountain Flume Chessman Resevoir Project, which is removing
snags from 490 acres of beetle-impacted forest in the upper Tenmile Creek drainage. Recent
Carbaryl spraying of campgrounds and other administrative sites (Cromwell Dixon campground,
MacDonald Pass trailhead) has been intended to prevent large trees from dying in areas of
concentrated public use. This enterprise has met with limited success and thus has not been a

The policy of allowing public firewood cutting on the National Forest is a primary factor driving
the removal of most large snags from Forest road corridors. Ongoing efforts by the Helena NF
to limit the potential safety hazard posed by large numbers of dead trees in areas frequented by
the public have accelerated the process of snag loss in road corridors and other accessible sites.
These actions have also transformed forest habitat dominated by mature trees to open earlyseral environments. These changes subsantially shift the compositon of local migratory bird
associations. Hazard tree removal projects have recently been completed or are going forward
at a number of campgrounds (Cromwell Dixon, Moose Creek, Kading, Park Lake), day-use areas
(Moose Creek, MacDonald Pass), trailheads (MacDonald Pass CDNST), administrative sites
(Moose Creek ranger station, Kading cabin), as well as along the MacDonald Pass Cross-country
ski trails and most conspicuously, along many miles of open Forest roads (an on-going

Recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest that have improved prospects for snags

snag presence on many local sites. Many thinning and snag removal projects on private, City

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect snag density and

beetle epidemic: the Telegraph Creek Fuels Reduction and the Tenmile South Helena Projects,
both of which would remove snags and coarse woody debris over extensive areas in the
southern Divide landscape. Harvested areas with relatively “clean” ground-level environments
would provide different habitat opportunity for birds than sites left with accummulated coarse
woody debris.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that is expected to continue in the

fire prevention and dead tree salvage.

Migratory Birds: Summary and Conclusions
None of the effects generated by project alternatives would be sufficient to measurably depress
populations of any migratory bird species of concern.
Alternative 1 would retain approximately 294 miles of open road corridor available to firewood
cutters in mature forest habitats, a zone with few habitat components for snag dependent bird
species. It would retain 450 miles of open road and motor trail, some of which would unsuitable
for nesting birds sensitive to human activity.
Under Alternative 2, road corridor open to firewood cutters would decline to 260 miles in
mature forest. It would retain 445 miles of open road and motor trail.
Under Alternative 3, open road corridor available to firewood cutting and snag removal would
decline to 233 miles in mature forest. Open road and motor trail would drop to 379miles.
Alternative 4 would maintain 235 miles of road corridor open to firewood cutting in mature
forest and would retain 393 miles of open road and motor trail.
Alternative 5 would put the most roadside snag habitat off-limits to firewood cutting,
maintaining 168 miles of open road in mature habitat. It would reduce open road and motor tail
to 324 miles.

Big Game: Elk
Effects of travel management on elk are discussed in terms of (1) habitat effectiveness (as
measured by open road density) on summer range, (2) human disturbance on winter range and
(3) elk security during the hunting season. Implications for compliance with current Helena
Forest Plan standards are discussed with regard to (1) hiding cover and calving sites on summer
range, (2) thermal cover and human disturbance on winter range and (3) open road density/
hiding cover ratios on fall range. Also discussed are compliance with (1) the proposed
amendment for determining elk security and (2) recommendations of the Montana Cooperative
Elk-Logging Study 1970-1985 (Lyon et al. 1985). Results of management are assessed via elk
population data furnished by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

Elk: Common Effects of Travel Management
Big Game Summer Range

WILDLIFE - 411

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Rationale for Management

Energetic demands of elk, growth, development, lactation, are high during the summer as
animals are simultaneously recovering from weight lost the previous winter, supporting young
of the year through lactation and building fat reserves for the coming winter. Motorized
activities impact elk through direct disturbance and potentially, displacement from high-quality
habitats, resulting in lowered reproductive performance. As well, new road construction and
cross-country ORV use can degrade or eliminate segments of productive summer elk habitat, in
particular, local wet habitats (subirrigated meadows, streamside habitat, drainage-head basins),
thus reducing habitat potential on summer range (Grover and Thompson 1986; Hamilton 1997;
Rowland et al. 2003; Ward and Cupal 1979).

Wisdom et al. (2004) indicate that off-road recreation, motorized and non-motorized, increases
movement rates and flight responses of elk. Elk react more to ATV and mountain bike riding
than to horseback and hiking activities (though mule deer may respond more to hikers). Elk
energy reserves may deteriorate as a cost of fleeing from off-road activity on a regular basis
because of increased movement and displacement from foraging habitat.

Summer Range: Forest Plan Standards

The Helena Forest Plan uses hiding cover as the primary indicator of summer range quality. The
rationale is that “[t]he total amount of hiding cover on summer habitat is an important part of
the overall elk habitat capability” (USFS 1983]. Big game standard 3 specifies that hiding cover is
to be maintained at or above 35 percent (as per the USFS definition) or 50 percent (as per the
MFWP definition) of the elk/deer summer range within each elk herd unit or equivalent analysis
area (HFP, p. II/18). Standard 5 then specifies that in order to be tallied as part of this “Forest
Plan hiding cover” the cover must occur in blocks of 40 acres or more (HFP, p. II/19). In this
analysis, we use the MFWP definition of hiding cover (in which greater than or equal to 40
percent canopy closure is used as a surrogate for actual hiding cover as measured on the
ground) and we thus aim for greater than or equal to 50 percent canopy closure on elk summer
range.

The Divide Travel Plan would have no effect on the status of Forest Plan hiding cover and any
ongoing and future changes in hiding cover generated by other factors (most notably, losses due
to mountain pine beetle infestation) would be the same for all alternatives [see Table 106 and
Table 108 in the following section, “Comparison of Alternatives”]. Application of this Forest Plan
indicator thus leads to the conclusion that summer habitat quality would be identical under all
alternatives, a result that is problematic, given the different road and motor trail configurations
in elk summer range under the different alternatives.

Summer Range: Habitat Effectiveness

Because roads have long been known to influence how elk are able to use summer habitat (see
Lyon 1979, 1982; Lyon et al. 1985), we have employed “habitat effectiveness”, which is based
on open road density, as an additional means of detecting potential differences in how
alternatives impact elk summer range. As it turns out, overall elk habitat effectiveness (HE) for
the Travel Plan Area, as measured by weighted open road density from late spring through early
fall, is roughly the same among the five alternatives (72 percent to 74 percent). The alternatives
vary more, however, in the habitat effectiveness they provide in some individual herd units. All
six herd units are well above the minimum 50 percent level recommended for elk summer range
(Christensen et al. 1993) under each of the five alternatives. The current range of HE values

runs from 65 percent in the Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU to 87 percent in the Black Mountain–
Brooklyn Bridge EHU [see Table 107].
Calf production and survival in local hunting districts, as indicated by cow/calf ratios are in line
with MFWP objectives for this area, 35 to 40 calves/100 cows (MT Elk Management Plan 2004),
which is a good indication of suitable habitat effectiveness on summer range. The status of
summer range in local elk herd units and hunting districts has been discussed in detail in the
“Affected Environment” segment of this report. Specific instances of how different alternatives
may funnel human activity into or away from elk calving areas are provided toward the end of
this report in the section dealing with “Local Effects in Key Areas”. That analysis provides
information relevant to HFP big game standard 4b, which seeks to minimize motorized
disturbance in these key habitat areas (HFP, p. II/18).

Big Game Security during the Hunting Season

Rationale for Management

In the Divide landscape (as on much of the Helena NF), elk security/vulnerability during the
hunting season is a primary determinant of elk abundance and population structure. While the
ability of elk to survive the hunting season is influenced by a number of environmental
circumstances, the status of the local Forest road system is often the key factor. Several studies
have documented the effect of roads on elk security, population structure and hunter success
(Edge and Marcum 1991; Leptich and Zager 1991; Unsworth and Kuck 1991; Gratson and
Whitman 2000). While most studies demonstrate that open roads influence elk distribution
during the hunting season and that road closures can lower the kill rate in a given area, at least
one study indicates that in certain circumstances road closures do not alter hunter success
(Burbridge and Neff 1976 cited in Gratson and Whitman 2000). In an increasing number of
cases, displacement of elk from roaded public land into more remote terrain or to inaccessible
private land early in the fall can depress hunter success rate throughout the remainder of the
season.

Big Game Security: Current Forest Plan Standard

The current Helena Forest Plan (1986) standard for measuring elk vulnerability during the
hunting season is based on an index that combines open road density and hiding cover (HFP, pp.
II/17 – II/18: standard 4a). Hiding cover will change over time, decreasing with losses to fire,
insects and disease, commercial timber harvest, thinning and stand aging. It will increase as
conifer regeneration fills in forest openings and the understories of mature stands. However, in
this case, hiding cover changes will be the same for all five Travel Plan alternatives. Thus, the
variable that separates alternatives is open road density. [See “Affected Environment for Elk”
for a discussion as to how the Helena NF determines compliance with the standard]. Table 108
shows that only three of the six Divide EHUs comply with standard 4a under all five alternatives.
A fourth EHU (Little Prickly Pear–Ophir) comes into compliance with Alternative 5. Although
open road density declines under all action alternatives, sometimes substantially, the only
change in status that the standard recognizes is the shift in the Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU in
Alternative 5. Likewise, the standard provides no indication as to how much elk may benefit
from declining open road densities in the three EHUs that are in compliance.

Big Game Security: Amended Forest Plan Standard

The Helena NF is proposing to replace the current Forest Plan big game security index (standard
4a) with a new standard that is less dependent on “open road density” per se than it is on the
pattern of open roads and motor trails on the landscape [see the previous discussion in
WILDLIFE - 413

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

“Affected Environment”]. While recognizing that cover can be an important component of
security, the new standard does not require a specific percentage of hiding cover relative to
open road density. This approach is based in large part on “U.S. Forest Service and Montana
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Collaborative Overview and Recommendations for Elk
Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena and Lewis and Clark National Forests”
[FS/MFWP Big Game Working Group (USFS and MFWP 2013)] and is detailed in the Forest Plan
Programmatic Amendment for Big Game Security for the Divide Travel Plan. Application of this
“elk security” approach to the Divide Travel Plan and to future projects in the Travel Plan Area is
summarized as follows:

Definitions.
Elk security is a measure of the degree to which habitat conditions (both natural and humangenerated) enable elk to survive the hunting season. On the Helena NF, this is considered to be
primarily a function of hunter access and in particular, motorized hunter access. Elk security is
expressed as the percentage of hunting season home range within Helena NF administrative
boundaries occupied by effective elk security areas.
Elk security areas capable of holding elk through the hunting season are defined in terms of
parameters developed by Hillis et al. (1991) modified for “eastside” environments: security
areas are non-linear, predominantly forested blocks of habitat at least 1,000 acres in size with all
borders ½ mile from open roads and motor trails.
Intermittent Refuge Areas are unroaded areas 250 to 999 acres in size with all borders ½ mile
from open motor routes. While generally not large enough or diverse enough toserve as “fullservice” security areas, they provide important escape areas for elk during the hunting season
and need to be preserved as such.
Hiding cover (coniferous vegetation capable of hiding 90 percent of a standing elk at 200 feet) is
recognized as an important habitat component to be preserved and developed within security
and refuge areas. There is, however, no specified percentage of a security area that needs to be
maintained as hiding cover under the new standard. Screening cover (forest more open than
hiding cover but capable of blocking clear sightlines) and low-level concealment cover (provided
by deadfall, shrubs, young conifers, boulders, etc.) are also recognized as useful habitat
elements to be nurtured within security and refuge areas.
Herd units are fixed analysis areas that do not shift with variable movement patterns of
individual elk herd groups or from one project to another. Elk security is determined for the
portions of individual elk herd units (or other equivalent elk analysis units) that lie within Helena
NF administrative boundaries (regardless of ownership).
Percent elk security for is based on the combined acreage of full security areas (greater than or
equal to 1,000 acres) within a given herd unit. Intermitent refuge area acres are not added into
the total for purposes of determining compliance with the standard.
The big game hunting season is defined as extending from September 1 through December 1,
thus including both the archery season and the general rifle season.
Amended Standard.
Road management will be implemented to maintain or improve big game security and hunting
opportunity. Road management will also be implemented to maintain or improve big game
intermittent refuge areas. The standard applies only to the National Forest System lands within

WILDLIFE - 414

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

those portions of an elk herd unit that are within the Helena Ranger District, Helena National
Forest administrative boundary.
The standard specifies the minimum security level (the percentage of each elk herd unit
occupied by security areas and intermittent refuge areas) that needs to maintained under each
Divide Travel Plan alternative. These security levels are shown in Table 109, which follows in the
“Comparison of Alternatives” section. The values shown in the table represent baseline security
levels that, at present (Alternative 1), are providing sufficient protection for local elk
populations so as to allow MFWP to meet management goals [Table 92 and Table 93], which
has been the rationale for using them as the baseline. As long as future projects or
circumstances do not depress these percentages, the elk herd units remain in compliance with
the standard. But since all herd units are well below the optimal goal of 50 percent elk security,
it is desireable to increase security area acreage. As can be seen in Table 109, the general trend
under all action alternatives is increasing acreage in elk security areas.
Currently, only 19 percent of the Divide landscape is occupied by bona fide elk security areas
(greater than or equal to 1,000 acres). The total contribution of security areas increases by
about 1,650 acres in Alternative 2, but the overall rounded percentage remains at 19 percent.
The percentage progresses to 23 percent in Alternative 4, 24 percent in Alternative 3 and 27
percent in Alternative 5 [see Table 109].
For individual EHUs at present, only two support security areas occupying more than 20 percent
of the unit: Little Prickly Pear–Ophir (23 percent) and Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot (30 percent).
One herd unit (Quartz) contains no security areas, although it does include two intermittent
refuge areas. Under Alternative 2, two units would increase in security area acreage, one
(Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot) would decrease and three would remain unchanged. Only two
units would be above 20 percent security and none would surpass 30 percent. Under
Alternatives 3, 4 and 5, four herd would increase in percent security and two would remain
unchanged. Under Alternative 5, three herd units would be near or above 30 percent security.
Although security area acreage increases under all action alternatives, particularly alternatives
3, 4 and 5, the overall acreage in intermittent refuge areas remains relatively constant at two to
three percent of the landscape under all alternatives (Table 110). The classification of these
small areas actually changes appreciably between alternatives, as new new refuges are created
and others enlarge into full security areas as road patterns shift [Figure 34 through Figure 38].
Refuge area acreage is not added into the security total for the different herd units, but we felt
that the importance of these areas to elk needed to be recognized and that they should be
delineated as areas not to be compromised by resource management activity.
All herd units in all alternatives would comply with the amended Forest Plan security standard.
Although in a couple cases, security area acreages would decline from current levels, each
alternative is independent of the others in terms of defining the compliance baseline. Once an
alternative is selected and implemented, then the given security levels for that alternative
cannot decline in any herd unit if it is to remain in compliance with the standard.
For the most part, these levels of elk security have been yielding elk populations that exceed
MFWP objectives for total elk numbers in the Granite Butte and Deerlodge Elk Management
Units (EMUs) (Montana Elk Management Plan 2004). Bull/cow ratios in those portions of the
EMUs that overlap the Divide landscape are at or slightly above objectives (currently around 12
to 14 bulls/100 cows). Given the unregulated mature bull hunt allowed in these areas, this ratio
is a good indicator of the adequacy of elk security throughout the Divide landscape.

Divide Travel Plan

The nature of elk security and vulnerability in local hunting districts, elk management units and
elk herd units has been discussed in detail earlier under “Affected Environment”.

Winter Range

Rationale for Management

Winter range can be a key limiting factor for elk (and all ungulates). Wintering areas with little
human activity and adequate forage will help minimize energetic costs associated with overwinter survival. As discussed earlier, much of the elk winter range in the Divide landscape is on
private, State and BLM lands outside the Helena NF boundary and beyond the reach of the
Forest winter road and trail system. In many cases, elk choose to spend much of the winter on
private ranch and agricultural lands, rather than on Forest grasslands in the foothills, even when
they are readily available and stocked with abundant palatable forage.

While winter recreationists on foot (cross-country skiers, snowshoers) can disturb elk on winter
habitat, few local winter ranges see this kind of activity (most of which occurs at higher
elevation). Winter ranges for Helena NF elk are subject primarily to disturbance from
snowmobiles, wheeled vehicles (ATVs, four-wheel-drive rigs, cars and trucks on roads) and a
variety of activities associated with ranching operations and in some cases, subdivisions.
Depending on the intensity, frequency and predictability of the disturbance, elk reactions could
involve an increase in general alertness, slow retreating movement, or outright flight (Canfield
et. al. 1999). A steady stream of disturbance, particularly in severe winters, has potential to
increase mortality on winter and spring ranges and to lower reproductive success (Skovlin et al.
2002).

Helena Forest Plan Winter Range Standards

The Helena Forest Plan aims to limit vehicle use on winter range to established routes that
provide access to other parts of the Forest or to adjacent private lands (big game standard 4c).
These travel restrictions are intended to prevent disturbance and harassment of elk and other
big game animals during a period when physical stress is already high. Most, though not all,
existing routes on winter range meet this standard. Alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5 propose new
restrictions for motorized recreation on winter range via new snowmobile area closures and
seasonal closure of some motorized recreational trails. None of the Travel Plan alternatives
would allow new motor routes on elk winter range. In a number of cases, the classification of
snowmobile routes would change, not to allow a new use, but to more accurately describe
existing snowmobile routes where no conflicts with wildlife or other resources have arisen. In
cases where a winter range conflict has become apparent (lower Sweeney Creek, Mike Renig
Gulch), action alternatives propose closing existing snowmobile access.

The Forest Plan standard to maintain at least 25 percent of winter range in thermal cover (big
game standard 3) is not now being met on any of the five Divide elk herd units with winter
range. In the Divide landscape, most of the winter range used by elk in all but the mildest of
winters is on private and public land beyond the National Forest boundary. Field observation
across this off-Forest region, along with perusal of aerial photos, reveals that thermal cover is
well below 25 percent on these winter ranges as well. Be that as it may, recent MFWP surveys of
winter ranges in the Divide landscape and adjacent foothills and valley lands suggest that elk
and deer populations are suffering no ill effects from the dearth of classic thermal cover. Both
species make frequent use of mature/pole timber on winter range, although most of these
stands are not dense enough to provide the 70 percent canopy closure required of true thermal
cover.

WILDLIFE - 416

Divide Travel Plan

In the end, this is a moot point for Divide Travel Plan proposals since no alternative would have
any effect on big game thermal cover: its status would be the same in all herd units under all
alternatives.

Elk: Comparison of Alternatives
Summer Range

Forest Plan Big Game Standard 3: Hiding Cover

Forest Plan big game standard 3 stipulates that 35 percent of summer range in each elk herd
unit should be maintained as Forest Plan hiding cover. When hiding cover is measured indirectly
via crown closure, 50 percent of the range needs to be maintained at 40 percent crown closure
(MDFWP hiding cover). Hiding cover acres in Table 106 are based on pre-beetle-kill crown
closure estimates (from 2011 R1 Vmap satellite imagery). Given that some elk now remain on
low and mid elevation off-Forest lands yearlong, this analysis considers all lands, public and
private, within the elk herd units to be potential summer range. This includes the 1.5 mile
extension of herd unit boundaries onto private and other non-Forest lands.

At present, based on the 2011 data, all six elk herd units are above the MDFWP 50 percent
threshold to one degree or another. No Travel Plan alternative would affect Forest Plan hiding
cover and any changes in cover generated by other factors (most notably, losses to mountain
pine beetle) would be the same for all alternatives. This standard is thus not useful in
differentiating between Travel Plan alternatives in terms of their effects on elk summer range.

Habitat Effectiveness on Summer Range

Habitat effectiveness is not a Forest Plan standard, but because it is based on open road density,
it relates more directly to travel planning proposals than measures based on hiding cover.

Table 107 summarizes open road density and habitat effectiveness (HE) on summer range for
the five alternatives. Habitat effectiveness percentages estimate how much of the potential
summer range is free from motorized disturbance throughout the season. Percentages are
derived from an index developed by Lyon (1983) and employed by Christensen et al. (1993),
who recommended habitat effectiveness levels of at least 50 percent on elk summer range as a
whole and 70 percent in areas of key habitat (productive sites where elk consistently
concentrate). For the sake of consistency, habitat effectiveness is calculated for the same areas
as is Forest Plan hiding cover for big game standard 3: that is, entire elk herd units, including the
1.5 mile off-Forest extension zone. While elk do use low/mid-elevation non-Forest habitat in
some summers, most summer use occurs in higher elevation habitats on the National Forest.

WILDLIFE - 417

Divide Travel Plan

So the delineation of summer range used in these analyses takes in virtually all areas that elk
may inhabit under a wide range of summer conditions.
As can be seen in Table 107, all elk herd units in the Travel Plan Area are currently above the
recommended 50 percent habitat effectiveness level and all of them would remain above that
level under all action alternatives. This comports with USFS field observations as to summer
habitat availability and condition and with MFWP asessments as to the general health of the elk
population, which lead to the conclusion that summer range in general is not a limiting factor
for elk in the Divide landscape.

While habitat effectiveness in most elk herd units increases over current values under each of
the action alternatives, there are no major shifts. All habitat effectiveness values fall within the
range of 54 percent to 65 percent. The inference is that, in all cases, elk will have access to
enough general summer range free from regular motorized interference to meet their needs.
These values are for broad areas of public and private land that elk may use to one degree or
another, depending on summer conditions. An earlier analysis for the Travel Plan that looked
only at areas within National Forest boundaries and weighted Forest roads according to
estimated use levels (primary roads equal 100 percent of length; lightly used local roads equal
25 percent of length) came up with habitat effectiveness values in the range of 65 percent to 88
percent. Actual habitat effectiveness of summer range most often used by elk probably falls
somewhere between the results of these two analysis approaches.
The above analyses consider the suitability of elk summer habitat in general, but they do not
zero in on the quality and distribution of specific habitat components that elk need regular
access to. Table 107 does not calculate the habitat effectiveness of key areas (esp. wet
meadows, mesic grasslands and riparian sites) where the 70 percent recommendation would
apply. Some of these issues are addressed in the later section, “Local Effects in Key Areas”,
which looks at how individual motorized routes effect habitat sites of particular importance to
elk and other big game animals.

Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 maintains the status quo. Under this scenario, all herd units exceed the
recommended 50 percent habitat effectiveness for overall summer range. Habitat effectiveness
values for five of the herd units are in the 54 to 58 percent range; one unit (Black MountainBrooklyn Bridge) is at 65 percent. Habitat effectiveness of this order suggests that open road
density is not high enough to regularly prevent elk on summer range from foraging successfully
and thus building fat reserves for the upcoming winter. In this case, problems with roads and
motor trails are not a function of overall road density, which is within acceptable limits, but with

site-specific intrusion of vehicles into habitats of particular importance to elk, typically riparian
areas, wet meadows and other productive sites that focus elk activity. Some of these areas are
discussed in “Local Effects in Key Areas” toward the end of this report.
In the short run, all six herd units would remain in compliance with Forest Plan big game
standard 3 (with crown closure greater than or equal to 50 percent and hiding cover thus
greater than or equal to 35 percent). But within the next 5 to 10 years, all herd units will
probably fall below 35 percent cover due to the loss of standing trees killed by the mountain
pine beetles.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would retain the same overall level of habitat effectiveness as Alternative 1 for the
Travel Plan Area as a whole (56 percent), but shifts would occur within some herd units. Habitat
effectiveness would improve in two units (Little Prickly Pear–Ophir and Greenhorn), decline in
one unit (Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot) and hold steady in three units (Jericho, Quartz, Black
Mtn–Brooklyn Bridge) [see Local Effects in Key Areas for a discussion of what the changes mean
for elk in specific areas]. One area where habitat effectiveness would erode is the Baldy Ridge–
upper Spotted Dog region near the south end of the Plan Area. This area holds elk through the
summer and into the fall. Along the Continental Divide, habitat effectiveness would improve
south of Jericho Mountain and in several sites between Greenhorn Mountain and MacDonald
Pass north of Highway 12. Summer range hiding cover would remain the same as in alternative
1.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would see more of an upswing in habitat effectiveness, to 58 percent overall.
There would be notable improvement (4 to 5 percent) in the Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot and
Greenhorn EHUs and slight improvement (one percent) in the Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU. The
Jericho, Quartz and Black Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge EHUs would remain unchanged. All EHUs
would continue to achieve the recommended 50 percent habitat effectiveness level. Summer
range hiding cover would remain the same as in alternative 1.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would provide habitat effectiveness identical to alternative 3 in five herd units. It
would, however, provide only a one percent increase over current conditions in the Spotted
Dog–Little Blackfoot EHU (as opposed to four percent in alternative 3), a function of proposed
vehicle access to elk summer range (1) in upper Ontario and Bison Creeks and (2) along upper
Spotted Creek and adjacent Baldy Ridge. Both areas encompass drainage-head locales with
productive summer habitat that holds elk from late spring through mid-fall. All EHUs would
continue to achieve the recommended 50 percent habitat effectiveness level. Summer range
hiding cover would remain the same as in alternative 1.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would produce the highest habitat effectiveness of any action alternative (60
percent overall). Four EHUs would increase in non-motorized summer range, one of them
(Greenhorn Mountain) by seven percent, the others by two to three percent. Two units (Black
Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge and Quartz) would remain essentially unchanged. All EHUs would
continue to achieve the recommended 50 percent habitat effectiveness level. Summer range
hiding cover (HFP big game standard 3) would remain the same as in alternative 1.

Big Game Security in the Hunting Season
Road Density/Hiding Cover Security Standard
Hiding cover and open road density are the measures of elk vulnerability/security identified in
the Helena Forest Plan (1986). Table 108 summarizes each elk herd unit relative to big game
standard 4a (HFP, p. II/17 - II/18) as described previously under “Affected Environment”.
Canopy closure of 40 percent or greater (as determined by satellite imagery) is used as a
surrogate for hiding cover and is correlated with road density via the “MDFWP” formula (HFP, p.
II-18). Road miles are weighted so that roads on Helena NF land are calculated at 100 percent of
length and those on private lands at 25 percent of length. Elk herd units include all lands within
Helena NF administrative boundaries plus a 1.5 mile extension beyond the boundary. The
assessment is for entire EHUs, not just the portions within the Divide Travel Plan Area.

* Standard 4a hiding cover percentages are for fall range, entire herd units. They differ from the percentages in
Table 106, which are for summer range and thus cover only those parts of the herd units within Helena NF
administrative boundaries.

As can be seen in Table 108, three herd units (Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot, Jericho and Black
Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge) comply with standard 4a under all five alternatives. Substantial
portions of these herd units are taken up by the three Inventoried Roadless Areas located south
of Highway 12, Electric Peak, Jericho Mountain and Lazyman Gulch. Two of the remaining herd
units (Quartz and Greenhorn) show open road densities (in several alternatives) that are similar
to those in the three units that meet the standard; but hiding cover is insufficient to produce
compliance, even when road densities drop in alternative 5. The final herd unit (Little Prickly
Pear-Ophir) does not comply with the standard under alternatives 1, 2, 3 and 4, but does so
under lower road density in alternative 5.
The pattern under standard 4a is that, in spite of shifts in open road density between
alternatives, herd units that currently comply with the standard tend to remain in compliance
and those that do not comply with the standard tend to remain out of compliance. The only
exception is the rise to compliance of the Little Prickly Pear-Ophir EHU under alternative 5, due
to the closure of 52 miles of Forest roads combined with ample hiding cover (60 percent).
On the other hand, in the Greenhorn EHU, road closures of 47 miles in alternative 5 are
insufficient to bring the herd unit into compliance with standard 4a because of hiding cover that
remains at 41 percent. The road density/hiding cover index masks this improvement in fall elk
security, simply indicating that the herd unit remains out of compliance. Likewise, the Spotted
Dog–Little Blackfoot EHU is simply credited with remaining in compliance with the standard, in
spite of 40 miles of road closures in alternative 5. The Black Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge EHU is
also credited with remaining in compliance, although it closes no roads at all. This herd unit is

clearly different from the previous two in terms of elk security improvement, but the current
Forest Plan standard recognizes no difference between them. In sum, the standard does not
accurately indicate to what degree the changes in road density improve or degrade the habitat
situation for elk.

Proposed Elk Security Area Standard
The amended Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability of elk to hunting mortality is
based on how much of a given management unit (typically, an elk herd unit) is taken up by elk
security areas. The rationale for using this measure has been discussed in some detail in the
“Affected Environment” section and in the preceding section, “Common Effects of Travel
Management”. In order to comply with the new standard, herd units with more than 50
percent elk security are allowed to lower percent security only if they remain above 50 percent;
those with less than 50 percent security are allowed no further decrease [see the previous
section on “Common Effects of Travel Management” for the exact wording].
Table 109 displays acreage of full-sized elk security areas (greater than or equal to 1,000 acres)
and the percentages of each herd unit that they occupy under different project alternatives.

Security areas in Table 109 are based on the pattern of roads and motor trails open from
September 1 through December 1 within Helena NF administrative boundaries. These are the
acres and percentages used to determine the degree to which the herd units approach 30
percent and 50 percent security levels: the acres of intermittent security areas in Table 110 are
not added in for purposes of determining compliance.
Table 110 displays the acres of intermittent refuge areas and the percent of each elk herd unit
that they occupy. While these acreages are not combined with those for elk security areas
(Table 109) in determining security status for the herd units, these smaller refuges do contribute
to the ability of elk to survive the hunting season. The management guidance with regard to
hiding cover, open roads and management activity in full-sized security areas apply to these
smaller refuge areas as well.

Hillis et al. have recommended that at least 30 percent of the fall range in each analysis area,
such as a herd unit or larger management area, be maintained as elk security areas if elk
vulnerability is to be effectively tempered during the hunting season. The new HFP elk security
amendment sets the objective for the Divide landscape at 50 percent. This follows from the
objective already in place for the adjacent Blackfoot landscape just to the north. While that
objective is realistically attainable in most of the herd units in that landscape (much of which is
in or near the Scapegoat Wilderness Area), it is highly unlikely to be attainable in all but one or
two herd units in the Divide landscape and then, only with draconian road closures detrimental
to the most basic kind of Forest access. Nonetheless, we have advanced that as the ideal
security area percentage, attainable or not.

Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 is the no-action scenario and it would retain the existing condition. As to the
current big game security index (HFP standard 4a), only three of the six Divide elk herd units
comply with the standard (Table 108). As to the amended security area standard, only one of
the six EHUs (Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot) reaches the 30 percent security level recommended
by Hillis et al. (1991) and none approach the 50 percent level proposed by the amended
standard. One herd unit, the Quartz EHU, supports no full-sized security areas at all, only two
intermittent refuge areas. All herd units, however, meet the amended standard for the time
being because none are declining in percent security.
Currently, MFWP population objectives for elk are being met in three of the hunting districts
that cover the Divide landscape (HD 215, HD 335, HD 343). In the 4th district (HD 293), elk
objectives are being met in the portion of the district associated with the Divide landscape,
while problems in the rest of the district are related to high rates of predation rather than
deficiency in security habitat [see the previous discussion of “Hunting Districts”].

Figure 34 - Elk security and intermittent refuge areas under Alternative 1.

It should be noted that in all EHUs, elk have been able to find refuge on private land beyond the
Helena NF boundary where public hunting is not allowed or to which hunting access is very
difficult because of land ownership patterns. These opportunities are more limited in some
EHUs than others. While private sanctuaries do not qualify as “security areas” under the Hillis
criteria, they do in effect serve much the same purpose. And, as a result, elk are usually more
secure in these EHUs than the security area percentages in Table 110 suggest. Elk compensate

WILDLIFE - 423

Environmental Impact Statement

for the shortage of National Forest security by moving to private-land security zones as the
hunting season progresses.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would produce the same pattern of compliance with Forest Plan big game
standard 4a as alternative 1: three elk herd units would comply, three would not. Two of the
herd units that currently do not comply with the standard would see declines in open road
density, but their compliance status would not change.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Applying the amended elk security area standard, overall security within Helena NF boundaries
would improve north of U.S. Highway 12 (from 19 percent to 21 percent) but decline south of it
(from 19 percent to 18 percent). The decline in the southern sector (a loss of 235 security acres)
would result from a newly sanctioned motor trail in upper Ontario Creek in the Spottted Dog–
Little Blackfoot EHU (Table 109). Nearly 1,750 acres would also be subtracted from intermittent
refuge areas in this herd unit as a result of newly opened roads and motor trails (Table 110;
Figure 35). North of Highway 12, the large security area around Black Mountain (of the north)
would expand with the closure of the Black Mountain Road and the effective closure of the
pioneered motor trail off its west end. The security area around Greenhorn Mountain would
expand as well, increasing from 1,494 to 2,134 acres with the closure of an unauthorized motor
trail and its access road.
The spatial pattern of security and refuge areas in alternative 2 can be seen in Figure 35 above.
Overall percent security in the Divide landscape would remain at 19 percent under alternative 2.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would produce the same pattern of Forest Plan compliance with the current big
game security index (HFP standard 4a) as alternatives 1 and 2: three elk herd units (Spotted
Dog-Little blackfoot, Jericho and Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge) would continue to comply
with the standard, the other three would not (Table 108).
Applying the amended security area standard, alternative 3 would provide notably more
security than alternatives 1 and 2, expanding security areas from the current 43,453 acres (19
percent of the landscape) to 55,727 acres (24 percent of the landscape). South of Highway 12,
the Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge and Quartz EHUs, which are in large part unaffected by the
Travel Plan, would remain unchanged. Security in the Jericho EHU, however, would rise from 12
percent to 16 percent and in the Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot EHU it would jump from 29
percent to 39 percent of the herd unit. These changes follow from (1) closure of an OHV route
south of Jericho Mountain and (2) a number of road and motor trail closures on Baldy Ridge and
in the upper Spotted Dog Creek drainage, allowing the big security area centered on the Electric
Peak Roadless Area to expand northward [Figure 36, below]. This latter expansion would be
particularly effective since it is contiguous with security habitat on the adjacent BeaverheadDeerlodge NF, as well as with the Roadless Area. As in all action alternatives, security would
remain unchanged in the Black Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge and Quartz EHUs.
North of Highway 12, security in the Little Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU would expand slightly (from
25 percent to 26 percent); but in the Greenhorn EHU, it would jump from 10 percent to 23
percent of the unit as a result of multiple motor trail closures in lower Sweeney Creek and an
OHV route atop the Continental Divide south of Priest Pass [see Figure 36].
As under current conditions, MFWP objectives for elk populations would continue to be met in
three of the four hunting districts that cover Divide elk herd units (HD 215, HD 335, HD 343).
MFWP elk population objectives are also being met in the southern half of HD 293, which covers
this herd unit. The northern half of HD 293 in the Big Blackfoot Valley (Lincoln Ranger District) is
below population objectives because of predation problems unrelated to security on the
National Forest [see previous discussion of “Hunting Districts”].

Under the amended elk security area standard, alternative 4 would be much the same as
alternative 3. A minor diference would be a slight reduction in security area size in the Little

Prickly Pear–Ophir EHU (110 acres) resulting from a motor trail (#136-007), open yearlong, just
north of Meyers Hill. Alternative 4 would add other open roads and motor trails to the
alternative 3 scenario, but all would be closed for the big game rifle season and thus would not
affect hunting season security for elk (though they would lower habitat effectiveness in summer
(Table 107).

Effects of Alternative 5
Under Alternative 5, a fourth herd unit, Little Prickly Pear-Ophir, would come into compliance
with the current big game security index (HFP standard 4a) following the closure of a number of
dead-end, parallel and deteriorating roads, mostly in the greater Dog Creek and upper
Snowshoe Creek drainages. The pattern of these closures would not allow expansion of elk
security or refuge areas but they would produce a reduction in open route density. Two herd
units (Greenhorn and Quartz) would remain out of compliance with the standard in spite of
reductions in open road density in those units.

Figure 38 - Elk security and intermittent refuge areas under Alternative 5.

WILDLIFE - 428

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Under the amended elk security area standard, security would rise from the current 19 percent
to 27 percent of the Divide landscape, from 43,543 acres to 62,007 acres. These security areas
are mapped in Figure 38.
Alternative 5 would develop the designated motor trail system more than other alternatives
[Table 98]. While this would prove problematic for summer habitat effectiveness in some areas,
it would not erode fall elk security since the trails would be closed to motorized use during the
big game hunting season (September 1 to December 1). New increments in elk security and
refuge areas (compared to alternatives 3 and 4) would occur both north and south of Highway
12. North of the highway, these include increased security in Sweeney Creek, Ophir Creek, the
upper forks of Little Prickly Pear Creek and around Greenhorn Mountain. South of the highway,
the principal gain would come from the transformation of an ittermittent refuge area (651
acres in alternative 3) in the Negro Mountain-Treasure Mountain area into a larger security area
(2,247 acres in alternative 5) [Figure 36 and Figure 38].
Under alternative 5, three herd units (Little Prickly Pear-Ophir, Greenhorn and Spotted DogLittle Blackfoot) are near or above 30 percent security. The Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot herd
unit, with 44 percent of its area in elk security areas, would be the only unit that approaches the
ultimate goal of 50 percent. Since five herd units would see increases in elk security, some of
them substantial and the 6th unit would retain current security levels [Table 109 and Table 110],
all would meet the amended standard for elk security. Current levels of security have proven
compatibile with MFWP population objectives for elk in local hunting districts and the increment
in security proposed in alternative 5 would substantially improve the prospects of continuing to
achieve those objectives.

Application of the Security Area Standard
As can be seen in Table 109 and Table 110 and in the security area maps (Figure 34 through
Figure 38), elk security areas provide a means of gauging elk vulnerability/ security that is
sensitive to changes in open road configuration. This allows a more fine-tuned and realistic
assessment as to potential impacts of travel management proposals in different herd units than
the 1986 Forest Plan standard (the hiding cover/ road density index). The difference between
the two methods results largely from eliminating hiding cover as a primary determinant of elk
security and focusing on the size and distribution of large habitat blocks to which hunter access
is limited. This is particularly appropriate in this case, as Divide Travel Plan alternatives deal
with changes in open road patterns and have no impact on Forest Plan hiding cover. Forest
cover is recognized as an important component of security, but it is not the make-or-break
factor that it has become under the current standard (the road density/hiding cover index).
Compliance with the amended elk security standard hinges on whether or not security area
acreage within a given elk herd unit is increasing, decreasing, or holding steady, regardless of
what the percent security happens to be. While the the ideal situation would be to have 50
percent of each elk herd unit in security areas of 1,000 acres or more, the fact that a given herd
unit is below the 50 percent level does not prevent it from complying with the standard.
The rationale is that current security levels are allowing MFWP population objectives for elk to
be met in local hunting districts or in those portions of the hunting district subject to influence
by Divide herd units. That being the case, the four action alternatives, all of which would
improve upon the overall security level, should do likewise. Figure 27 (in the “Affected
Environment” section) provides a map of the six Divide elk herd units and shows their

WILDLIFE - 429

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

relationship to the four hunting districts that encompass the landscape. Table 92 and Table 93
(also in the “Affected Environment” section) display the status of the four hunting districts with
regard MFWP elk population objectives over the past 15 years.
Table 109 indicates the degree to which security acres and percentages in each herd unit
increase or decrease, or whether they remain steady, under different alternatives. Herd units
that maintain or increase security, regardless of what the percent security is, may be in
compliance with the amended elk security standard. A decrease in security could be an
indication of non-compliance. As can be seen in Table 109, security area acreages in two herd
units (Quartz Creek and Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge) neither decrease nor increase under
any alternative (or do so to a trivial degree). So these EHUs initially comply with the standard,
even though the Quartz Creek unit supports no bona fide security areas. This herd unit does
support intermittent security areas [Table 110] and in fact shows an increase in this acreage
under alternative 5; but this does not affect its standing with regard to the standard. Table 109
shows that security area acreages in the remaining four herd units consistently increase over
current conditions under all action alternatives, with one exception. The exception is a slight
decrease in the Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot EHU under alternative 2. This unit thus needs to be
flagged to see if it is in fact out of compliance with the standard.

Winter Range
The Helena Forest Plan measures impacts on elk winter range in terms of (1) the acreage and
dispersion of thermal cover and (2) the location of motorized routes. Thermal cover does not
figure into the current analysis: None of the Travel Plan alternatives would affect it. But,
changes in the classification of snowmobile routes and open roads that can be driven during
winter are of interest. The Forest Plan allows for designated routes through winter range on
Helena NF lands in order to facilitate land management, allow access to private land, or to
provide routes to public recreation opportunities (most often, snowmobiling) in other areas
(HFP, p. II/17-18). The greater the miles of roads, motor trails and snowmobile routes accessible
to vehicles on winter range the greater the potential for disturbance and displacement of elk.
In general, Forest Plan winter range, as mapped during development of the Forest Plan in the
1980s, is quite restrictive, focusing on areas consistently used by most elk in most winters. In
the Divide landscape, relatively little of that winter range falls on Helena NF land so as to be
affected by the Forest road system. A more expansive mapping of winter range was developed
for the Helena NF Oil and Gas Leasing EIS in 1995 (USFS, USFWS 1995). The map was based on
assessments by MFWP and Helena NF biologists as to what sites big game animals might occupy
under a wider variety of winter conditions than contemplated by the Forest Plan. As with Forest
Plan winter range, Oil and Gas winter range is mapped only for areas within Helena NF
boundaries.
More recently, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP) [with assistance from the Rocky
Mountain Elk Foundation (RMEF)] has constructed a broadscale (Statewide) planning map of elk
seasonal ranges that has adopted an even more expansive version of potential winter range,
one that incorporates considerably more land on the Helena NF than does the Oil and Gas EIS
map. The “MFWP map” covers both Helena NF and private land and its winter ranges extend
well out into the Helena and Little Blackfoot valleys. The initial version of the map came out in
1999 and a second version (delineating even more winter range) in 2004. A third version,
developed by MFWP between 2008 and 2010, has adopted a new definition of winter range
(“areas where populations....tend to concentrate during the winter season, commonly

WILDLIFE - 430

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

December through April”), eliminated some of the winter range mapped by the previous two
editions and omitted mapping of “crucial winter range”. As with previous versions, the new
maps are “appropriate for general planning purposes or broad landscape review…” The data are
“not intended for planning and/or review of site-specific activities” (MFWP 2011). Because of
these broadscale objectives, winter range boundaries are drawn along section lines rather than
along local topographic or vegetative features and are therefore less precise.
One of the problems with the MFWP map for Forest Plan purposes has been the inclusion of
broad areas into which small numbers of elk occasionally range during mild winters or through
which they pass in late April on their way to summer range. While these sites have been used
by elk in this way over the past 30 years, they do not represent areas where populations “tend
to concentrate during the winter”. The inclusion of these areas of extended winter range is
useful in that it highlights areas where segments of the elk population may be vulnerable to
human interference under mild winter conditions and as they move across transitional range
toward summer range late in the season. But it does not contribute to an accurate delineation
of true winter range, which is the area addressed by HFP standards.
In determining what constitutes elk winter range for purposes of applying HFP standards and
guidelines, I have proceeded as follows:
On a GIS map of the Divide landscape showing both the Helena NF Oil and Gas EIS winter range
(1995) and MFWP extended winter range (2010), I plotted the location of several thousand
“winter” elk locations (December 1 to April 30). Locations were derived both from tracking of
radio collared elk (1983 to 1987) and from annual MFWP aerial winter range surveys (2000 to
2010). I then tallied elk locations within Helena NF boundaries for (1) the Helena NF Oil and Gas
winter range and (2) those found only on MFWP extended winter range beyond the Oil and Gas
range. I confined the comparison to Helena NF lands, since this is the area that would be
affected by Travel Plan alternatives.
Results were as follows:
Total winter elk locations in the sample: 7,856
•
Locations within Helena NF administrative boundaries: 1,149
•
Helena NF locations on Oil and Gas EIS winter range: 1,102 (95.9 percent of NF
locations)
•
Helena NF locations only on MFWP extended winter range: 32 (2.8 percent of NF
locations)
•
Helena NF locations not on winter range: 15 (1.3 percent of NF locations)
Because Helena NF Oil and Gas EIS winter range accounts for nearly 96 percent of the winter elk
locations/ observations and includes all of the sites where elk have been observed to
concentrate for most of the winter, I have concluded that this delineation is appropriate for
assessing potential effects of the Divide Travel Plan on the National Forest. I have, however,
eliminated two areas previously designated as winter range in the Oil and Gas EIS that have
since been determined not to be used by elk in winter: these habitat blocks are located
immediately south of Elliston and in the upper Spotted Dog drainage. Elk use these areas as
transitional and summer range, but not as winter range.
•

Even with the Oil and Gas delineation, a few problem areas remain with regard to Forest Plan
standards. These involve snowmobile routes that have been in place for several decades and
that, until 1995, were not considered to be on big game winter range. The greatly expanded

WILDLIFE - 431

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

delineation of winter range in the Oil and Gas EIS brought portions of these trail systems into
the area covered by HFP standard 4c. This standard states that “all winter range areas will be
closed to vehicles between December 1 and May 15,” with the exception of access routes to
“other lands” (HFP, p. II/18).
For the most part, the Helena NF has allowed snowmobiles to continue using these traditional
trail networks, the assumption being that as long as the snow base in any given area remains
solid enough to support recreational snowmobiling, it will not be suitable for use by grazers,
notably elk. Once the snow deteriorates to the point that elk are able to move through it
without difficulty and get down to ground forage, it will no longer be suitable for snowmobiles.
So, there should be little overlap and minimal conflict between these uses.
Field observation over several decades validates the assumptions as to the temporal separation
of elk and snowmobiles on winter range, with a few exceptions. These have occurred in areas
where newer model snowmobiles, able to deal with shallow, patchy snow, have been used to
access antler hunting grounds in April. These incursions onto occupied winter/transitional
ranges involve extensive off-trail riding and most of the areas where these problems have arisen
are covered by a variety of snowmobile area closures proposed in different alternatives.

Table 111 tallies acreages of areas closed to snowmobiles under the five Travel Plan
alternatives. Cross-country snowmobiling is not permitted in these areas and the only interior
access is by occasional, longstanding access routes, such as the Rimini and Sweeney Creek/Priest
Pass Roads. Rationale for excluding snowmobiles include minimizing disturbance of big game
animals on winter and spring ranges and deterring the use of snowmobiles for hunting. In
addition, some closures help minimize disturbance of lynx, protect potential wolverine denning
habitat and alleviate conflicts between motorized and non-motorized recreation (primarily
cross-country skiing and snowshoeing).
Some of the additional closures in action alternatives are in new areas separated from the three
existing closure blocks; others represent expansions of those areas. The three consolidated
blocks currently closed to snowmobiles are Baldy Ridge/Electric Peak Roadless Area, Lazyman
WILDLIFE - 432

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Gulch Roadless Area and the MacDonald Pass cross-country ski trail complex. Additional
closures in alternative 2 expand the number of separate closure blocks to six. Consolidation of
some of these blocks in alternatives 3 and 4, reduces the number to five. Alternative 5 reduces
the closure pattern to three large aggregations: Electric Peak/ Bison Creek at the south end of
the Plan Area; Black Mountain/Deadman Creek at the north end; and Lazyman/Jericho/Sweeney
Creek west and southwest of Helena [refer to alternative maps in the FEIS].

Roadless and MacDonald Pass), only the Lazyman Roadless Area block incorporates Helena NF
(Oil and Gas EIS) elk winter range. This latter closure discourages snowmobile-based antler
hunting on late winter and transitional ranges and reduces potential harassment of elk
(particularly bulls) in these areas. In addition, it compliments winter range area closures
recently established in the adjacent Clancy-Unionville Travel Plan area to the south and east.
Snowmobile area closures on big game winter range total about 10,950 acres.
Under alternative 1, 39 miles of regularly-used snowmobile routes impinge on Helena NF winter
range, most of them in the upper reaches of the range where snow conditions are most
conducive to snowmobile use. Few elk and deer venture into these areas in most winters and
no conflicts have been reported on the trail system. Almost 75 percent of winter range
snowmobile routes occur on the east side of the Continental Divide north of U.S. Highway 12,
that is, in the Sweeney Creek, Austin Creek, Greenhorn Creek and Skelly Gulch drainages. Other
areas with trails are along the western Forest boundary in the Threemile-Ophir–Snowshoe Creek
area and south of Highway 12 in Hahn Creek and Mike Renig Gulch. Of the existing snowmobile
routes, 16 miles are specifically designated as snowmobile trails, 20 miles are on roads open
year-round to all vehicles able to navigate them and four miles are on roads technically closed to
all vehicles but on which the Helena NF has allowed snowmobile use for several decades. Some
of these winter ranges are also traversed by roads leading to areas where resource
management, public recreation, or private land require access: vehicle use is thus permitted
under Forest Plan big game standard 4c (HFP, p. II/18).

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would appreciably expand snowmobile area closures on winter range. Most
significant is the 6,065 acre area immediately northeast of Sweeney Creek, a key wintering area
for elk, moose and deer [Figure 56]. This area is now open to all vehicles in winter and while it
normally sees little snowmobile use, it is often accessible to ATVs and four-wheel-drive vehicles
because of its low elevation and lesser snow accumulation [Figure 56, Figure 57]. Other new
closures include the fringe of elk winter range along the Helena NF border in the Threemile,
Ophir and Snowshoe Creek drainages; a patch of winter range in upper Mike Renig Gulch and
Hahn Creek; and an extension of the Black Mountain–Mount Helena closure westward across
the Tenmile drainage and northward into Walker Creek. New snowmobile closures would put
an additional 14,315 acres of Helena NF elk winter range off-limits to snowmobiles compared to
current conditions.
Alternative 2 would reduce snowmobile trails on elk winter range from about 40 miles to 24
miles. Most of the reduction would come from closing the Sweeney Creek–Blue Cloud Creek
area, including the trail system, to all vehicles between October 14 and May 16. The closure is
intended to eliminate motorized disturbance on key big game winter range and on late fall and
early spring transitional range, as well as during the hunting season. Of the remaining 24 miles

WILDLIFE - 433

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

of winter range snowmobile routes, nine miles would be specifically designated for
snowmobiles and 15 miles would involve roads open to all vehicles, including snowmobiles
(although, with few exceptions, only snowmobiles are able to negotiate these routes in winter).
Under alternative 2, the current policy of tolerating snowmobiles on certain roads that are
technically closed to them would cease. Alternative 2 would leave open to all vehicles the
current array of “crossing routes” that provide winter access to other parts of the Forest.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would close an additional 3,240 acres to cross-country snowmobile use (compared
to alternative 2) by consolidating closures in the Hahn Creek, Tenmile Creek and Lazyman
Roadless blocks. The new closure would connect areas across the Continental Divide. With
regard to snowmobile closures on winter range, alternatives 2 and 3 are nearly identical.
Alternative 3 is the same as alternative 2 in terms of snowmobile routes on winter range. That
is, nine miles of designated snowmobile trails; 15 miles of roads open to all vehicles able to
negotiate them (in most cases, only snowmobiles); and no sanctioning of snowmobile use on
road systems closed to all vehicles year-round. As with alternative 2, the route and area closure
in the Sweeney Creek–Blue Cloud Creek area represents the most significant removal of
motorized disturbance from actively-used winter range. Other trails remaining open are on
higher elevation ”winter range” in areas not used by big game animals until after snowmobile
use has ceased. “Crossing routes” that allow motor vehicles to pass through winter range to
access other parts of the Forest would be the same as in alternatives 1 and 2.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3 in terms of (1) Forest roads and trails open to
snowmobiles on winter range (24 miles) and (2) “crossing roads” open to wheeled vehicles and
snowmobiles on winter range. It also follows alternative 3 in the the acreage of snowmobile
closures on elk winter range.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would consolidate and increase the size of snowmobile area closures considerably
more than other action alternatives. Closure acres would total 71,305 acres, nearly 18,000 acres
more than alternatives 3 and 4. Alternative 5 would (1) create a new closure area in the Black
Mountain/Deadman Creek region at the northern tip of the Travel Plan Area (adjacent to the
Nevada Mountain Roadless Area), (2) merge separate closures (as proposed in alternatives 2, 3
and 4) west and southwest of Helena into one large block and (3) add much of Bison Creek and
part of upper Ontario Creek to the Electric Peak Roadless Area closure. This latter closure would
compliment similar snowmobile restrictions on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF immediately to
the south.
Under alternative 5, big game winter ranges would carry the fewest designated snowmobile
routes of any alternative, just over 11 miles. This would be in addition to the standard “crossing
routes” used by wheeled vehicles throughout the winter. These are common to all alternatives
and include sections of the Rimini Road and U.S. Highway 12. Other routes, such as the
Sweeney Creek/Priest Pass Road and the Mullan Pass Road may also be driveable by wheeled
vehicles early in most winters.
Alternative 5 would maintain active snowmobile routes at more-or-less the same level as other
alternatives: 403 miles, which is within the range of the other four alternatives (394 to 418
miles) [Table 99]. This mileage remains relatively constant in spite of the decline in snowmobile

WILDLIFE - 434

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

routes on big game winter range, as these losses are balanced by an increase in designated
routes elsewhere. Overall, this shift is a benefit to elk on winter range. Alternative 5 is the only
alternative that eliminates the category “regularly-used snowmobile routes that the Travel Plan
identifies as ‘closed to motorized use yearlong’ ” [Table 99]. In alternative 5, all snowmobile
routes are specified as “designated snowmobile routes” or as routes on which snowmobile use
is “allowed”. This eliminates the ambiguity of snowmobiles being allowed to use routes that are
technically closed to them (by the Travel Plan) because they pass through areas in which offroute use is allowed.

Elk: Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in the EIS, which identifies
past, present and reasonably foreseeable actions and circumstances that may affect elk and elk
habitat. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with nonForest inholdings), adjacent National Forest lands (the Lincoln Ranger District of the Helena NF
and the Jefferson Ranger District of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF) and neighboring non-Forest
lands (private, State, County, municipal and BLM). This summary is common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Recent and continuing activities on the Helena NF that have improved prospects for big game
species include: Implementation of the Statewide OHV Plan (USFS, USFWS 2001), which
prohibits riding off established motor routes; a variety of trail relocation projects that have
removed trails from productive riparian areas to upslope locations; mine reclamation projects
that have improved the functioning of riparian habitats likely to attract these animals; grazing
allotment revisions that have generally reduced cattle numbers and improved habitat condition;
road and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest projects (Clancy-Unionville, Sound
Wood, Mullan Pass, Lava Mountain, Treasure Mountain); and ongoing noxious weed
treatments.

Other activities have locally displaced elk, reduced the effectiveness of elk habitat, or have had a
mixed effect. These include: timber harvest, mostly in the 1970s and 1980s, that has created an
abundance of large clearcuts (Bison Creek, Mike Renig-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Lump Gulch,
Ophir Creek-Cave Gulch, Deadman); numerous road permits allowing access across Helena NF
land to private holdings; retention of private recreational residences on Helena NF land
(MacDonald Pass, Tenmile Creek); small mining operations (under the 1872 Mining Act);
construction and maintenance of communications sites and power lines; Forest road
improvement projects that have widened road corridors; and widespread fencing associated
with grazing allotments that may complicate movement.
The Forest has also undertaken several vegetation projects unlikely to affect elk because they
are highly localized or situated close to human development. These include hazard tree removal
in developed recreation sites, at administrative sites and along road corridors. The recent
removal of beetle-killed trees in the MacDonald Pass Ski Trail recreation area falls into this
category, as do recently completed tree removal projects in Kading, Park Lake, Cromwell Dixon
and Moose Creek campgrounds.
Other recent vegetation projects have been large enough to have more impact. The ongoing
Forestwide Roadside Hazard Tree Removal Project, which is removing beetle-killed lodgepole
and ponderosa pine from roadside corridors ranging in width from a few feet to as much as 150
feet (each side of the road). Often, these corridors have little effect because they are roadside
WILDLIFE - 435

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

environments seldom used by elk. In other cases, where they are situated in strategic locations,
primarily where elk have traditionally moved along or crossed the road corridors, the more open
habitat structure may be altering elk movement patterns and in some cases, putting them more
at risk from human generated mortality.
The just-completed Clancy-Unionville Project south of Helena has also opened up extensive
areas formerly occupied by closed-canopy forest. Much of the original treatment was proposed
as an array of partial cuts designed to create open-canopied stands more resistent to standreplacing fire. But with the mountain pine beetle outbreak creating entire stands of dead trees,
many of these prescriptions were necessarily changed to regeneration cuts, clearcuts with
reserve trees, seed-tree cuts and widely spaced thinning. This has improved foraging
opportunity for elk but diminished forest cover.
The ongoing Red Mountain Flume-Chesman Reservoir Project is removing dead trees (mostly
lodgepole pine) from 490 acres along the flume corridor and around the reservoir. While
relatively localized and contiguous, these new openings change areas that elk have used
primarily for concealment, escape and resting to those used mostly for foraging.
It should be noted that all of the projects that have removed or are removing dead trees are
merely accellerating the rate of cover loss that would have occurred naturally within another
five to 10 years as dead trees fall. The difference in the end is that treated areas are
characterized by relatively “clean” ground-level environments dominated by grasses, forbs,
shrubs and regenerating conifers; untreated sites are cluttered with an abundance of coarse
woody debris with a matrix of ground vegetation and young conifers dispersed irregularly
throughout. Both of these habitat configurations are useful wildlife environments, although
species mix and use patterns vary.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Private land development (primarily rural home building) is continuing to create sites that create
problems for animals attempting to move through and occupy the landscape. Other endeavors
with similar effects include mining operations (Drumlummon mine, Bald Butte mine clean-up),
ATV-trail bike riding areas, private timber harvest, clearing vegetative cover from riparian sites
and new and upgraded roads (particularly improvements to the Marysville road).

Recent acquisition by the State of Montana of 27,000 acres of private land centered in the
Spotted Dog Creek drainage immediately west of the Helena NF boundary has implications for
elk security. These holdings were previously off-limits to most public hunting and have, in
recent years, served as a refuge for elk during the hunting season. As of 2010, these lands have
been open to public hunting and to other uses throughout the rest of the year, mostly hiking,
wildlife watching, mountain biking and horseback riding. Motorized access is limited. Other
restrictions will be designed to protect elk on winter range, since these formerly private lands
have served as primary winter habitat for elk for several decades. Public use of these lands may
alter elk movement and use patterns on State, private and adjacent Helena NF lands in the near
future, although limited motorized access is likely to ameliorate elk vulnerability to hunting.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect elk to one degree or
another include improvement of the Rimini Road, revision of several grazing allotments
(MacDonald Pass, Austin, Empire and several others) and large vegetation manipulation projects

WILDLIFE - 436

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

(Telegraph salvage and thinning; Tenmile South Helena Vegetation Project). The Telegraph and
Tenmile South Helena Projects are extensive vegetation manipulation projects focused on
removing beetle killed trees in large blocks through a combination of cutting and prescribed
burning. Both would alter habitat opportunity for elk by transforming sites potentially
dominated by stacked, coarse woody debris to uncluttered sites with more continuous ground
vegetation and regeneration. Proposed salvage would accellerate the loss of current
hiding/screening cover by at least five years.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land that may affect elk and other big game species includes:
settlement and other development of private lands (including road building); continued timber
harvest and removal of beetle-killed dead trees; continued mining operations that usurp habitat
and create disturbance zones (notably, the Montana Tunnels mine expansion); continued ATV
and other motorized activity.

Elk: Summary and Conclusions
No alternative would create circumstances that would measurably shift elk population size or
population structure. The four action alternatives, however, would incrementally alter big game
security and habitat effectiveness in local areas, thus altering elk habitat use patterns and
hunter opportunity.

Elk Summer Range Habitat Effectiveness

Summer range hiding cover, the Forest Plan measure of summer habitat quality, would remain
the same in all alternatives. Habitat effectiveness, however, as a function of open road density,
would vary.

Alternative 1 would retain summer habitat effectiveness (HE) at 56 percent of the Divide
landscape as a whole. Habitat effectiveness would remain above the recommended 50 percent
level in all six elk herd units (EHUs).
Under Alternative 2, habitat effectiveness would increase in two EHUs, decrease in one and
remain steady in three. Habitat effectiveness in the landscape as a whole would remain at 56
percent.
With Alternative 3, habitat effectiveness would increase in three EHUs and remain steady in the
other three. Landscape-wide habitat effectiveness would increase to 58 percent
Habitat effectiveness under Alternative 4 would be identical to that of Alternative 3 in five of the
six EHUs. In one unit, however, (the Spotted Dog – Little Blackfoot EHU) habitat effectiveness
would be three percent lower than in alternative 3 because of routes in upper Spotted Dog
Creek, on Baldy Ridge and in upper Ontario Creek that would be open to wheeled vehicles in
summer. Overall, habitat effectiveness would be 58 percent.
Under Alternative 5, habiatat effectiveness would increase in four herd units and remain
unchanged in the two units that are mostly outside the influence of the Travel Plan Area (Quartz
Creek and Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge). Overall habitat effectiveness would be 60 percent.
In sum: Habitat effectiveness would be similar in all five alternatives and the overall availability
of summer habitat would not be a limiting factor for elk under any alternative.

WILDLIFE - 437

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Elk Hunting Season Security

Under Alternative 1, elk security areas (greather than or equal to 1,000 acres) would continue to
occupy 19 percent of elk herd units (EHUs) within Helena NF administrative boundaries across
the Divide landscape as a whole. Intermittent refuge areas would occupy three percent. Only
two EHUs would exceed 20 percent security. If this alternative is chosen, these percentages
would become the baseline security levels that would need to be maintained or improved
within each herd unit. These security levels are, for the time being, allowing MFWP to meet elk
population goals in local hunting districts or in those portions of the districts influenced by
Divide landscape elk herd units.
Under Alternative 2 , elk security areas would occupy 19 percent of the Divide landscape, the
same as alternative 1. Security area configuration would be redistributed, however. Security
would rise in two EHUs, decrease in one and remain steady in three. As with alternative 1, only
two EHU would exceed 20 percent security. If this alternative is chosen, these percentages
would become the baseline security levels that would need to be maintained or increased
within each herd unit.
Under Alternative 3, elk security areas would occupy 24 percent of the landscape. Security
would increase in four EHUs and remain steady in two. Three EHUs would now exceed 20
percent security on fall range. Security in one unit (Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot) would increase
to 39 percent. Intermittent refuge areas would account for two percent of the landscape. If this
alternative is chosen, these percentages would become the baseline security levels that would
need to be maintained or improved upon within each herd unit.
Under Alternative 4, elk security areas would occupy 23 percent of the landscape, slightly less
than under alternative 3. Overall coverage of intermittent refuge areas would remain in the
same range as other alternatives: two percent in this case. As with alternative 3, security would
increase in four herd units and remain steady in two others. If this alternative is chosen, these
percentages would become the baseline security levels that would need to be maintained within
each herd unit.
Alternative 5 would provide the highest security level of any alternative, 27 percent overall. As
with alternatives 3 and 4, four herd units would see increased security and two would remain
essentially unchanged. Security increases would be more substantial under this alternative,
however, with three herd units near or above the 30 percent level. If this alternative is chosen,
these percentages would become the baseline security levels that would need to be maintained
or improved upon within each herd unit.
Current elk population numbers, bull/cow ratios and calf/cow ratios are at or above MFWP
objectives for three of the four hunting districts that cover the Divide landscape (HDs 215, 335,
343). In the 4th district (HD 293), total elk numbers are below MFWP objectives, but elk
populations in the portion of the district influenced by the Divide Travel Plan Area are at
acceptable levels.

Winter Range

With regard to Forest Plan big game standard 3, no alternative would affect thermal cover on
winter range. With regard to big game standard 4c, all alternatives would continue to allow the
presence of some longstanding snowmobile routes on elk winter range. All four action
alternatives would reduce snowmobile and OHV use on big game winter range, most

WILDLIFE - 438

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

significantly in the Sweeney–Blue Cloud Creek area. Alternative 5, however, would be much
more effective in this regard.
Alternative 1 would retain approximately 10,950 acres of snowmobile area closures on Helena
NF (Oil and Gas EIS) winter range. It would retain 39 miles of active snowmobile trails on winter
range.
Alternative 2 would expand snowmobile area closures to cover approximately 25,490 acres of
elk winter range and would reduce winter range snowmobile trails to 24 miles, most located
toward the upper edge of winter range where elk seldom venture in winter.
Alternative 3 would provide the same snowmobile area closures and the same mileage of
snowmobile trail on elk winter range as alternative 2.
Alternative 4 would provide the same snowmobile area restrictions and the same array of
snowmobile trails on elk winter range as alternatives 2 and 3.
Alternative 5 would reduce snowmobile routes on elk wintr range to about 11 miles.
Snowmobile area closures would increase to approximately 29,500 acres on winter range.

Threatened and Endangered Species
Grizzly Bear
Roads distribute human activity across the National Forest in ways that are known to diminish
utility of otherwise suitable grizzly bear habitat. Travel management obviously has a key role to
play in determining occupancy patterns for grizzlies on the landscape. This section describes
potential effects in terms of road patterns in the Divide Travel Plan Area. Grizzlies are scarce in
the Divide landscape, but they continue to range southward out of solid populations in the
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone to the north. The presence of nonmotorized areas with a good dispersion of productive habitat is key to allowing bears to move
through and occupy the landscape, albeit in small numbers.

Common Effects of Travel Management and Alternative Comparison

In this analysis, potential effects of the five alternatives on grizzly bears are gauged in terms of
(1) the size of large non-motorized core area equivalents, (2) road density and (3) motorized use
in key habitat areas. Effective grizzly habitat requires large core areas free from motorized use
during the period when bears are active (April to November) (IGBC 1994). The analysis of large
(greater than 1,500 acres) non-motorized habitat blocks in the previous
“Connectivity/Fragmentation” section provides a basic summary of such areas in the Plan Area.
A modified version more specific to grizzlies is displayed below in Table 112, which shows nonmotorized areas larger than 2,500 acres and 0.3 miles from open motor routes [USFS 2005, p. 7].
This delineation is based on the parameters used to define “core areas” in and around the
Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem.

The Travel Plan Area currently supports 20 non-motorized habitat patches larger than 1,500
acres, as measured from the edge of the road/motor trail corridor [see Table 102and Table
103]. However, when the the more stringent parameters for grizzly bear core habitat in the
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone are applied to the Divide Travel Plan
Area (177,713 acres), only four of these non-motorized blocks emerge under current conditions.
Secure core area characteristics (blocks of contiguous habitat at least 0.3 mile from motorized
routes and larger than 2,500 acres) are based on recommendations of the Interagency Grizzly
Bear Committee (IGBC 1994) for the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone and
have been used in a number of recent analyses in that area (see USFS 2005; Servheen et al.
2001). The core areas provide habitat that is less impacted by human activity and where grizzly
bears are at lower risk of displacement and human-caused mortality (Servheen et al. 2001, p.
167).
In delineating non-motorized habitat blocks for grizzlies in this way, I found that several sizable
blocks of unroaded habitat dropped below the 2,500 acre threshold when the 0.3 mile buffer
was applied. These included non-motorized or lightly roaded areas around Greenhorn
Mountain, Little Porcupine Creek, upper Snowshoe Creek, Sweeney Creek, Priest Pass, Red
Mountain, Lee Mountain, Treasure Mountain, Slate Lake, Hat Creek, upper Spotted Dog Creek,
Jericho Creek and Negro Mountain [see Table 102]. Grizzlies have been reported in some of
these areas over the past 20 years.
Some of the smaller blocks are tenuously connected to the larger core areas (listed in Table 112)
by narrow corridors of unroaded habitat. The Jericho Creek block (currently 3,265 acres in Table
102), for example, is connected over the Divide to the Jericho Mountain Roadless Area by a 0.3
mile-wide corridor of non-motorized habitat. Likewise, the Upper Elliston Creek and Treasure
Mountain patches are both connected to larger core areas to the south by narrow necks of
unroaded habitat.
Two of the potential core areas shown in Table 112 connect with large roadless areas outside
Planning Area boundaries. The Black Mountain – Deadman Creek area abuts the large Nevada
Mountain Roadless Area to the north and reports of grizzly bears have been consistent
throughout this country for several years. Likewise, the extensive Electric Peak Roadless area at
the southern end of the Plan Area is contiguous with roadless country on the BeaverheadWILDLIFE - 440

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Deerlodge NF, a zone within which a majority of grizzly reports from the southern half of the
landscape have occurred over the past 20 years.
Under current road and trail patterns, only a single potential grizzly bear core area (Black
Mountain – Deadman Creek) is present north of Highway 12. As mentioned, this core area is
contiguous with another extensive non-motorized region (roughly 35,000 acres) that abuts the
Travel Plan Area on the north, providing the Distribution Zone in the Travel Plan area with an
effective linkage to established grizzly populations in the Blackfoot landscape on the Lincoln
Ranger District. Under the four action alternatives, a small number of strategic road and motor
trail closures in the area between Sweeney and Austin Creeks allow formation of a second large
non-motorized block north of Highway 12. This area is a peninsula of non-motorized habitat in
an an otherwise settled region of the greater Helena Valley. It does, however, provide a
combination of habitat characteristics (rugged terrain, dense conifer forest, aspen stands,
productive open foraging areas) that the bears may find useful in moving through the Divide
landscape. The Helena NF and MFWP have received rare, but credible, reports of grizzlies in the
upper (western) reaches of this area since 1990.
In the new southern extension of the Distribution Zone, the four action alternatives are more
conducive to grizzly bears than alternative 1 (the existing condition) in terms of the total acreage
within potential core areas and the number of such areas. This is particularly true of alternative
5, which provides a total of six large non-motorized blocks and adds more than 22,000 acres to
this habitat compared to alternative 1. Differences relate primarily to effective motorized trail
and road closures in the Meyers Hill, Sweeney Creek, Treasure Mountain, Baldy Ridge, Es and
areas under alternatives 3 and 4. In alternative 2, core area acreage decreases from current
conditions because of new motor routes in upper Ontario Creek and around Treasure Mountain.
The density and distribution of roads and motor trails, public and private, are important in
determining core areas and understanding the extent of habitat security for grizzly bears. Mace
and Manley (1993) have found that in Montana adult bears use habitat with open road densities
that exceed 1.0 mi/mi2 less than would be expected (if habitat use were random). All sex and
age classes use habitat with total road densities in excess of 2.0 mi/mi2 less than expected.
Table 113 shows the kinds of open road and motor trail densities that grizzly bears would have
to deal with in the Divide landscape under different alternatives. The volume and type of traffic
these routes carry and the resulting impact they have on grizzlies, varies widely within
categories and I have not attempted to apply any weighting factors to the road mileages.

Currently, in the Divide landscape, total road density (including private roads) is about 2.4
mi/mi². Density is around 3.0 mi/mi² in the northern Distribution Zone and 2.1 mi/mi² in the
southern Zone [Table 113]. Total road density is appreciably higher in the northern half of the
Distribution Zone than in the southern half, a consequence of the large Inventoried Roadless
Areas in the region south of Highway 12 outside the zone (Electric Peak, Lazyman Gulch,
Jericho). Route densities in the northern Zone are well in excess of Mace and Manley’s 2.0
mi/mi² total road benchmark; densities in the southern zone are just short of the threshold. In
spite of this, grizzly bears continue to be encountered more frequently in the more heavily
roaded northern Zone than in the area to the south, apparently a function of the Zone’s
proximity to the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Total road densities (open and closed)
are the same for all alternatives, at least in the short-term. These densities could decline where
closed roads are eventually recontoured following action alternatives. Open route densities, on
the other hand, are different for each alternative (Table 113). Mileages and densities include all
routes within the Travel Plan Area open to wheeled vehicles during at least part of the year:
Helena NF roads, motor trails, County roads, State highways and open private roads.
Areawide open route densities would be 1.5 mi/mi² in alternatives 1 and 2, 1.3 mi/mi² in
alternative 3, 1.4 mi/mi² in alternative 4 and 1.2 mi/mi² in alternative 5. All of these exceed the
threshold of 1.0 mi/mi² that Mace and Manley’s research suggests is likely to discourage grizzly
bear use. Table 113 includes motor trails in addition to open roads, but the contribution of the
trails is relatively minor (and in alternative 3, non-existent), so this data is quite comparable to
that of Mace and Manley. Action alternatives reduce open route density only slightly in the
southern half of the Distribution Zone. Current open route density is 1.3 mi/mi²; action
alternatives range from 1.1 to 1.3 mi/mi². In the northern half of the Zone, alternatives 2, 3 and
4 reduce the density from 2.1 mi/mi² to 1.7-1.9 mi/mi². Alternative 5 produces the only notable
decline, down to 1.4 mi/mi².

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The fact that grizzlies continue to move through and occupy parts of the Travel Plan Area may
reflect the rough, primitive condition of many Forest and private roads and the low levels of
vehicle use they receive in summer, to the point that bears may often not perceive them as
functioning roads. Be that as it may, all road densities under all alternatives exceed levels
recommended for and achieved by most Bear Management Subunits in the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone on the Lincoln District to the north, areas in which
the bears thrive [see USFS 2005].
Open roads and motor trails that penetrate key grizzly bear habitats may have an impact well
beyond that indicated by unqualified road density and roadless patch size. Productive grizzly
foraging sites are typically localized and fragmented and they are often a limiting resource in
any given landscape. Motor routes that compromise the functioning of these sites are of
particular concern (see USDI 2006, p. 9, 18-19, 35-38; USDI 1993, p. 146).
A number of local areas that are treated differently under each Travel Plan alternative and that
may be providing habitat for grizzly bears are discussed in some detail in the section on “Local
Effects in Key Areas” (which follows toward the end of this report). Five of these areas are of
particular interest because they support key grizzly bear habitat components and represent
locations in which grizzly bears have been reported in the past five years. One of them, Black
Mountain, is inside the original Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone north of Mullan Pass. The other
four (Baldy Ridge, upper Telegraph Creek, Slate Lake–Slate Creek and upper Ontario Creek–
Bison Creek) are in the new southern extension of the Distribution Zone and south of Highway
12 where grizzly population density is very low.
As to Black Mountain, all four action alternatives eliminate user-made motorized routes into the
otherwise unroaded area of forest habitat through which grizzly bears move between the
Lincoln and Helena Ranger Districts. South of Highway 12, alternative 2 increases motorized
access (over present condition) into all four areas listed above. Alternative 2 increases use into
three of them via motorized trails (Baldy Ridge being the exception). Alternatives 3 and 4
maintain the status quo or decrease motorized access, although alternative 4 is less effective as
it increases motorized access in upper Ontario Creek and maintains some of the current routes
in the upper Spotted Dog–Baldy Ridge area. These areas, while further removed from the
Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, have seen some grizzly bear activity (sparse though it
may be) in recent years.

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1
Alternative 1 is the existing condition. As displayed in Table 113, open route densities in the
Travel Plan Area are well beyond the lower limits that research suggests cause grizzly bears to
be reticent about using a particular area (greater than 1.0 mi/mi²). Current open road density
(unweighted by use) is 2.1 mi/mi² in the region north of Highway 12 and 1.3 mi/mi² to the south.
The average size of the 20 non-motorized patches larger than 1,500-acres in the “Connectivity/
Fragmentation” analysis is 5,565 acres [Table 103]. This compares with an average patch size of
7,124 acres for the six potential grizzly bear “core areas“ larger than 2,500 acres and surrounded
by an additional 0.3 mile non-motorized buffer zone [Table 112] 2. This average is considerably
2

Large non-motorized road patches used in the connectivity/fragmentation analysis are delineated from
road’s edge, whereas grizzly bear core areas require a buffer of 0.3 mi between the road and the core area.

WILDLIFE - 443

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

larger than the recommended 2,500 acres for such core areas in the Northern Continental
Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone to the north [see USFS 2005]; but on the other hand, the core
areas account for only 24 percent of the Divide landscape. By way of comparison, guidelines
applied to Bear Management Units (BMUs) in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem
Recovery Zone to the north aim for a minimum of 68 percent of each Subunit in unroaded core
areas. These inherent differences are indicative of why the Divide landscape is classified as a
“distribution zone” and not a “recovery zone”.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would reduce current open route density from 2.1 mi/mi² to 1.9 mi/mi² in the
northern Distribution Zone. In the southern Distribution Zone, the reduction is minimal, with
density remaining at about 1.3 mi/mi² [Table 113].
Alternative 2 would increase the total area in secure core areas from 42,745 acres to 47,055
acres. In the northern distribution Zone, it would enlarge an already secure habitat block in the
Black Mountain-Deadman Creek area and create a new refuge in the and Sweeney-Austin Creek
area [Table 113]. In the southern part of the Zone, two of the three existing core areas would
remain essentially the same but the third (Electric Peak) would lose 250 acres because of newly
opened motor routes in the Baldy Ridge area. Overall, the appreciable expansion of secure
habitat north of Highway 12 would more than compensate for the relatively small loss to the
south. The number of habitat blocks large enough to qualify as potential grizzly bear core areas
would increase from four to five. Secure habitat blocks would come to occupy about 26
percent of the landscape, a bit more than in alternative 1 [Table 112].
In terms of motorized disturbance around key sites, alternative 2 would increase motorized use
in four areas: Baldy Ridge, upper Telegraph Creek, Slate Lake–Slate Creek and upper Ontario
Creek–Bison Creek (all in the southern half of the Distribution Zone). It would eliminate
motorized intrusion in the Black Mountain area (inside the Distribution Zone at the northern
end of the Plan Area).

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would reduce open route density in the Distribution Zone from the current 1.5
/mi² to 1.3 mi/mi² [Table 113], somewhat less than alternative 2. This reduction would be more
notable in the northern part of the Distribution Zone, dropping from the current 2.1 mi/mi² to
1.7 mi/mi². In the area south of Highway 12, open route density would drop only from 1.3
mi/mi² to 1.1 mi/mi², but the motorized closures would be more strategic in terms of expanding
secure habitat areas. In the area north of the highway, the Black Mountain-Deadman Creek
area would increase in size and the new Austin-Sweeney block would be larger than the area
produced by alternative 2. In total, secure habitat would increase from the current 10,010 acres
to 16,330 acres [Table 112]. South of the highway, secure habitat acreage would increase from
32,735 acres to 39,450 acres. All three core areas would expand, although the change would be
minimal in the Lazyman Gulch Roadless block. Altogether, secure core area type habitat would
increase from 24 percent to 31 percent of the landscape [Table 113].
Alternative 3 would not increase motorized presence in any of the key areas likely to have been
providing habitat for grizzlies in the last five years. It would decrease potential for such
presence in three of these areas. The resulting parameters, while well below what is required of
a grizzly bear recovery zone, represent a measurable improvement over current conditions.

WILDLIFE - 444

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would produce the same open motor route density in the northern half of the
grizzly bear Distribution Zone as alternative 3 (1.7 mi/mi²). In the southern half of the Zone,
open route density (1.2 mi/mi²) would be slightly more than in alternative 3 (1.1 mi/mi²). These
two alternatives are very similar, with alternative 4 allowing only 13 more open route miles than
alternative 3 [Table 113].
Alternatives 3 and 4 differ somewhat more in terms of the amount of secure core area habitat
produced: 51,075 acres in alternative 4 as opposed to 55,780 acres in alternative 3 [Table 112].
Almost all of this difference occurs in the souther half of the Distribution Zone as a result of
newly opened motor routes in the Jericho Mountain and Electric Peak blocks. Nonetheless,
open route patterns in alternative 4 would allow 29 percent of the landscape to provide secure
grizzly bear habitat blocks as opposed to 24 percent at present (alternative 1) [Table 112].
In terms of motorized presence in key areas likely to have been providing habitat for grizzlies in
recent years, alternative 4 is less intrusive than alternatives 1 and 2 but more so than alternative
3. Like alternative 2, alternative 3 would establish a summertime motor trail on currently closed
road #4104-A1 along upper Ontario and Bison Creeks, an area of excellent potential grizzly
habitat and within two to three miles of sites where grizzlies have been reported in the last five
years. While not as disruptive as an arterial or collector road, the trail would introduce
motorized disturbance into an environment potentially useful to grizzlies. Alternative 4 would
not sanction motorized use in other key grizzly areas and in this regard it is nearly identical to
alternative 3. This includes expansion of non-motorized core areas in the Black Mountain region
along the northern edge of the Plan Area.
As with alternative 3, the resulting conditions, while well below what is required of a grizzly bear
recovery zone, represent a measurable improvement over current conditions.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would produce the lowest open route densities in both the north and south
segments of the Distribution Zone and the lowest overall density of any alternative (1.2 mi/mi²).
Although the miles of motor trails active during the summer would increase, the miles of open
road would decline substantially, both north and south of Highway 12 [Table 113]. Alternative 5
would also generate the largest increase in non-motorized grizzly bear habitat blocks: from
42,745 acres at present to 64,980 acres. A new habitat block (3,405 acres) would appear in the
Treasure Mountain area, increasing the number of these potential core areas from five to six
[Table 112].
On a large scale, alternative 5 would be the most favorable to grizzly bear habitat because of its
lower open road densities and appreciable increment in contiguous unroaded habitat.
However, newly designated motor trails proposed in this alternative would create some sitespecific problems in key habitat areas likely to be used by grizzlies. These include the Slate Lake
area, upper Elliston Creek and upper Ontario/Bison Creeks, all areas where grizzlies have been
reported (though rarely) over the past dozen years. These areas are discussed in some detail
the later section, “Local Effects in Key Areas”.

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the matrix in appendix B, which identifies past,
present and reasonably foreseeable actions and circumstances, in addition to this project, that
may affect grizzly bears and their habitat. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide

Environmental Impact Statement

landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings), adjacent National Forest lands (on the
Lincoln Ranger District and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF) and neighboring non-Forest lands
(private, State, County, municipal and BLM). This summary is common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Recent/ongoing activities on the Forest that have improved prospects for grizzly bears include:
Designation of the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone north
of Mullan Pass (2002) and its recent expansion southward to cover the entire Divide landscape
(2013); trail relocation projects that have removed trails from riparian areas to upslope locations
(Blackfoot Meadows, CDNST); mine reclamation projects, some of which have improved riparian
habitat function favorable to bears; establishment of the Statewide OHV Plan (2001), which
prohibits riding off established motor routes; grazing allotment revisions that have often
reduced cattle numbers and improved habitat; road and motor trail closures associated with
timber sales (Clancy-Unionville, Sound Wood, Treasure Mountain) that have enlarged nonmotorized habitat blocks.

Activities that have locally reduced the effectiveness of potential grizzly habitat or have had a
mixed effect include: timber harvest in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s that has created large
clearcuts, as opposed to a finer-grained habitat mosaic (Bison Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn
Creek, Slate Creek, Lump Gulch, Ophir Creek-Cave Gulch, Mullan Pass, Lava Mtn, Deadman);
road permits allowing access across Helena NF land to private holdings; retention of private
recreational residences on Helena NF land (esp. near the Divide at MacDonald Pass); small
mining operations (under the 1872 Mining Act) in areas where grizzlies have been observed;
construction and maintenance of communications sites and power lines; widespread fencing
associated with grazing allotments that complicate movement; efforts to spread out livestock
use on some allotments, which may bring cattle into new areas of potential grizzly habitat;
retention of numerous dispersed camping sites; unrestricted back-country recreational use
(backpackers, day-hikers, horseback riders, hunters). Timber harvest has recently been
completed in the Clancy-Unionville project area, removing blocks of beetle-killed lodgepole pine
in the upper Lump Gulch/ Travis Creek drainages and along the Brooklyn Bridge ridge south of
Helena. The ongoing Red Mountain Flume Chessman Reservoir Project is removing dead
lodgepole pine from 490 acres in the upper Tenmile drainage. Resulting habitat opportunity for
grizzly bears would be mixed.
Some recent hazard tree removal projects are unlikely to impact grizzly bears because of their
association with roads and developed recreation sites (Park Lake and Cromwell Dixon
Campgrounds, MacDonald Pass CDNST Trailhead). Several other projects designed to remove
hazard trees are unlikely to influence grizzly bears because of their association with roads and
developed recreation sites (Kading and Moose Creek campgrounds, Tenmile picnic area,
Roadside Hazard Trees, MacDonald Pass Ski Trails).

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Private land development (mostly rural home building) continues to create sites that generate
problems for animals striving to move through or occupy the landscape (barriers to movement,
habitat loss, bear attractants, dogs). Other human endeavors with similar effects include mining
operations, ATV-trail bike riding areas, new and upgraded roads (notably, the widening and
paving of the Marysville road), unregulated private timber harvest and clearing of vegetative
cover from riparian sites. Livestock grazing on private lands near the Forest has some potential

WILDLIFE - 446

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

to create conflicts with bears under certain circumstances (sheep being particularly vulnerable).
Recent purchase of 27,600 acres of private ranchland in the Spotted Dog drainage by MFWP will
forestall subdivision and development of those lands immediately west of the Helena NF
boundary and allow them to remain in a condition more amenable to grizzly bear habitation and
passage.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect grizzlies to one degree or
another include improvement of the Rimini Road (in a potential wildlife travel zone),
implementation of grazing allotment revision (Clancy, MacDonald Pass, Austin, Empire),
increased recreational use of back-country environments and salvage projects designed to deal
with dead tree and woody debris accumulations resulting from the recent mountain pine beetle
epidemic. Some of these projects would be extensive: (1) the Telegraph Vegetation Project,
affecting a variety of habitats just west of the Continental Divide and (2) the Tenmile-South
Helena Project, which would alter dead-tree environments over a wide area from the
Continental Divide eastward to the outskirts of Helena. Effects on grizzly bear habitat would be
mixed, some beneficial, some problematic. Key ahbitat sites would be protected in all cases.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land in the cumulative effects area that may affect grizzly bears
includes: settlement and associated development of private lands (including road building);
timber harvest and removal of beetle-killed dead trees; continued motorized recreation.

Summary and Conclusions
All alternatives would comply with the Grizzly Bear Recovery Plan, the IGBC Guidelines and with
appropriate standards and guidelines in the Helena Forest Plan.
Alternative 1 would retain four large non-motorized core habitat areas averaging roughly 10,685
acres each (24 percent of the landscape). Unweighted open motor route density would remain
at 1.5 mi/mi².
Alternative 2 would increase the number of large non-motorized core habitat areas to five with
an average size of 9,410 acres (26 percent of the landscape). Unweighted open motor route
density would remain at 1.5 mi/mi².
Alternative 3, like Alternative 2, would support five large non-motorized core habitat areas, but
with an average size of 11,155 acres. They would cover 31 percent of the landscape.
Unweighted open motor route density would decline to 1.3 mi/mi².
Alternative 4 would also support five large non-motorized core habitat areas. These areas
would average 10,215 acres and would cover 29 percent of the landscape, a bit less than
alternative 3. Unweighted open motor route density would be 1.4 mi/mi².
Alternative 5 would increase the number of non-motorized potential core areas to six. These
areas would average 10,830 acres and would cover 37 percent of the landscape. Unweighted
open route density would drop to 1.1 mi/mi².
Under all alternatives, road/ motor trail densities in the Travel Plan Area would remain overly
high by Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem Recovery Zone standards. Given the presence of
a few several large non-motorized habitat areas, they are low enough to support a small local
grizzly bear population and to support linkage zone function. No conflicts with livestock and no

human-caused grizzly bear mortalities have been recorded in the Divide landscape in several
decades.

Canada Lynx
Effects of travel management on lynx are assessed via standards and guidelines in the Northern
Rockies Lynx Management Direction(NRLMD) (2007b, attachment 1), which is now incorporated
into the Helena Forest Plan. Since none of the alternatives propose new road construction or
specific road improvements that would directly alter vegetation, direct effects on habitat are
essentially non-existent for this particular phase of travel management. Primary effects,
therefore will be those generated by shifts in open road distribution and in snowmobile routes
that provide access for trappers and packed over-snow travel routes into lynx winter habitat for
competing carnivores. There is also some potential for motorized routes disrupting lynx
movement patterns in linkage habitat. Potential effects on critical habitat are further evaluated
in relation to “primary constituent elements” (PCEs) for lynx identified by the USFWS in
documentation designating critical habitat in February 2009 (Federal Register, Vol. 74, No. 36, p.
8638).

Common Effects of Travel Management
General Effects of Open Roads
Useful information on the effects of roads and trails on lynx and their prey is meager (Apps
2000; McKelvey et al. 2000). Much of it is anecdotal and studies that have specifically targeted
road impacts have not produced definitive conclusions.
Construction of roads sometimes removes linear swaths of suitable lynx habitat, which may
have a local impact if habitat is limiting or key sites are affected. Some researchers have noted
that adult females may move kittens to new den sites to avoid nearby vehicle traffic that
escalates as summer comes on (Ruggiero et al. 1999). In some cases, lynx may alter normal
travel and hunting patterns to avoid open roads, but they are also likely to travel along
roadways less than 50 feet wide with good cover along both edges (Koehler and Brittell 1990).
Field research and observation indicate that in normal circumstances most lynx do not
necessarily avoid habitat near roads except for roads with high traffic volume (Aubry et al. 1999;
Ruggiero et al. 1999).
Lynx are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by trapping (Bailey et al. 1986). Although they
can no longer be targeted by trappers in Montana, lynx are at risk from traps set for any midsized furbearer and therefore are affected by roads and snowmobile trails that provide access
for trappers in winter. Research does indicate that lynx are probably more vulnerable to
trapping near open roads (Koehler and Aubry 1994; Bailey et al. 1986).
Denning habitat is usually not a limiting factor for lynx in the northern Rockies (USFS 2007c, p.
173) and the Lynx Management Direction does not present a standard that specifies how much
denning habitat needs to be retained in a given LAU (USFS 2007b, p. 14-17). However, Guideline
VEG G11 states that substantial pockets of large woody debris should be distributed throughout
each LAU and that if denning habitat appears to be deficient, projects should be designed to
retain coarse woody debris (USFS 2007b, Attachment 1, p. 5). The Divide Travel Plan does not
propose to alter existing patterns of woody debris, but it would indirectly provide opportunities
for firewood cutters to remove snags and logs from road corridors, which, in some cases, may
degrade potential lynx denning habitat. Normally, areas within 300 feet of open roads are
unlikely denning sites, but they could serve the purpose in certain circumstances, such as where
WILDLIFE - 448

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

understory regeneration is thick, downfall is abundant, traffic is infrequent and opportunities
are limited elsewhere.

Refuge and Connectivity
While it is not conclusively known what effect roads and motorized trails have on lynx, research
suggests that local unroaded or non-motorized refuges are important for successful lynx
reproduction and for ecological fitness (Ruediger et al. 2000). Such refugia include large areas of
high quality habitat relatively secure from human exploitation, habitat degradation and
disruptive winter access. Landscape connectivity is also an important component of lynx
conservation. Areas of high human use can interrupt habitat connectivity and further fragment
lynx habitat (Ruediger et al. 2000). Previous sections of this report dealing with “Fragmentation
and Connectivity” and with the “Grizzly Bear” present assessments of large blocks of nonmotorized habitat that may be of use to lynx as sanctuaries [see Table 102, Table 103, Table 112
and associated discussion]. These analyses show that the average size of potential lynx refuges
increases substantially under alternative 2 and more so under alternatives 3 and 4.

Snow Compaction
Roads and trails provide unobstructed routes for snowmobiles, cross-country skiing and other
winter uses that create snow compaction. Compacted routes facilitate winter access for
carnivores that would otherwise be unable to negotiate the deep snow characteristic of lynx
winter habitat. Lynx have evolved a competitive advantage in deep, non-compacted snow that
tends to exclude other predators during winter, a time when prey is most limiting (Buskirk et al.
1999; Ruediger et al. 2000). Competing carnivores that might be able to take advantage of solid
over-the-snow routes include coyotes, bobcats, red foxes, mountain lions, wolves and
wolverines (although wolverines are also willing to move through deep loose snow on a regular
basis). Although coyotes and bobcats are most often cited as the primary competing carnivores
taking advantage of compacted snow routes, systematic tracking surveys in the Divide landscape
(Wild Things Unlimited, 2007-2010) found that the most frequently encountered winter
competitors were coyotes and red foxes [see Gehman et al. 2008, 2009].
Research on this issue is new and so far, conclusions have been limited. One study of the effect
of snow compaction on coyotes and lynx in western Montana (Kolbe et al. 2005) found that
while coyotes did use packed snowmobile and ski trails in lynx habitat, most of their travel was
off-trail, often in areas where snow was shallow or naturally compacted. As well, coyotes acted
primarily as scavengers in winter and did not compete significantly with lynx for live prey.
Another recent study in northern Utah (Bunnel 2006, cited in USFS 2007c) found that coyotes
stayed relatively close to snowmobile trails (within 350 meters) when snow was deep and prey
was common in the trail corridor. The sum of recently completed and ongoing research
suggests that lynx and coyote populations often coexist on winter range but that there is no
good evidence that lynx populations are suffering as a result (USFS 2007b, p. 24). A number of
studies have observed also that lynx normally tolerate at least moderate levels of snowmobile
traffic through their winter habitats and that they readily use packed snowmobile routes as
travelways (Aubry et al. 1999).

Effects Assessment: Comparison of Alternatives

Attachment 1 in the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction ROD (2007b) displays the
objectives, standards and guidelines designed to promote lynx conservation. Objectives are
descriptions of desired resource conditions for lynx. Standards are management requirements
WILDLIFE - 449

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

designed to meet objectives. Guidelines are management actions that, while not required, are
normally taken to meet objectives (USFS 2007b, p. 7). Standards and guidelines that deal with
the potential effects of travel management on lynx can be found in NRLMD sections addressing
“human use projects” (HU), “linkage areas” (LINK) and management applicable to all actions in
LAUs (ALL).
Guidelines HU G6 and HU G8 deal with road upgrading and maintenance. They will apply to
future road projects emanating from the Divide Travel Plan but not to this phase of the planning
effort. Guidelines HU G7 and HU G9 address the placement, design, closure and reclamation of
new roads. Since no Travel Plan alternative proposes to construct new roads, this guidance does
not apply, although it may be useful in assessing the closure of existing roads. The NRLMD does
not provide standards or guidelines that address the density of open roads, motor trails, foot
trails, or closed roads [see discussion in NRLMD ROD, p. 26-27].
Standard LINK S1 requires identification of potential lynx highway crossings when planning
highway construction or reconstruction in known linkage areas. Likewise, Guideline ALL G1
directs using methods that avoid or reduce effects on lynx when constructing or reconstructing
highways. Since none of the alternatives propose highway construction or reconstruction, this
direction does not apply to the Divide Travel Plan. The problems that two these
standards/guidelines address, however, are relevant in that (1) highway crossings are a problem
on U.S. Highway 12 around MacDonald Pass and (2) one project (by another agency) that may
qualify as “highway reconstruction” (the Rimini road project) lies within the Plan Area. These
circumstances do not influence the Divide Travel Plan’s compliance with the NRLMD, but they
are part of the environmental baseline that needs to accounted for.
This leaves Guidelines HU G11 and HU G12, which deal with over-the-snow routes and the issue
of winter access into lynx habitat. These guidelines are as follows:
HU G11. Designated over-the-snow routes or designated play areas should not expand outside
baseline areas of consistent snow compaction, unless designation serves to consolidate use and
improve lynx habitat. This may be calculated on an LAU basis or for a combination of
immediately adjacent LAUs.
HU G12. Winter access for non-recreation special uses and mineral and energy exploration and
development should be limited to designated routes or designated over-the-snow routes.
A breakdown of snowmobile routes in the Divide Travel Plan Area is shown in Table 99.
Currently, the Plan Area supports 81 miles of roads and trails that have been specifically
designated for snowmobile use under the existing Travel Plan [see HELENA NATIONAL FOREST
Visitor Map, 2006; Divide Travel Plan map for alternative 1]. The Travel Plan also allows
snowmobile use on any Forest or County road open to highway-legal vehicles, whether or not it
is specifically designated as a snowmobile route, as long as the road is (1) unplowed and (2) not
within an area closed to snowmobiles. Snowmobilers currently make use of 239 miles of these
“allowed” routes, most of which have been in use for decades [Helena NF Recreation files;
Helena Snowdrifters Snowmobile Club meetings]. Roughly 48 percent of the non-specified
routes (114 miles) are shown on the map of Snowmobile Routes on the Helena National Forest
(Helena Snowdrifters 2003). Action alternatives would specifically designate many of these
traditional routes as “snowmobile trails”. This represents a shift in status from an allowed use
to a specifically designated use. It does not, however, represent an actual increase in the
identified network of packed over-snow routes.

WILDLIFE - 450

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

In addition to this system of routes on which snowmobile use is specified or allowed by the
Travel Plan, a number of roads that technically are “closed to motorized vehicles yearlong” also
have been serving as snowmobile trails for the past two to three decades. The reasons for the
original route restrictions for snowmobiles [which date from the 1970s and 1980s] are unclear,
particularly since the areas through which the roads travel are open to cross-country
snowmobiling, which means that, in practice, snowmobilers have been permitted to ride next to
or between the roads, but are technically forbidden to ride on the roads. In some cases,
snowmobilers have established trails adjacent to the roadbeds, but in other cases they have
been using the roads themselves.
For the most part, the Helena NF has allowed the unauthorized on-road use to continue in areas
where no problems for wildlife or other recreational activity (notably, cross-country skiing and
snowshoeing) have been evident. Alternatives 2, 3, 4 and 5 would now legitimize the
longstanding snowmobile use on a number of these restricted road systems and allow the nextto-the-road and cross-country use to move onto the roads. The road systems to be thus
designated have been chosen based on historic snowmobile use patterns and the absence of
observed resource problems [supporting data coming from longtime field observations by
Helena NF recreation and wildlife personnel and discussions with the Helena Snowdrifters
Snowmobile Club]. Under all alternatives, wheeled vehicles would continue to be excluded
year-round.
The change in designation would affect 36 miles of currently restricted roads in lynx habitat
under alternative 2, 33 miles under alternatives 3 and 4 and 49 miles under alternative 5.
Combined with new road/trail closures in other areas, the net increase of officially sanctioned
snowmobile routes in lynx habitat would be 32 miles under alternative 2, 28 miles under
alternatives 3 and 4 and 44 miles under alternative 5 [the change in actual usage, apart from
trail designation, is displayed in Table 114 below; LAU maps are in Figure 28, Figure 29 and
Figure 30 in “Affected Environment “].

None of the action alternatives would produce an on-ground increase in established over-thesnow routes as per NRLMD Guideline HU G11 [refer to the bottom row of Table 99]. That is,
the area of snow compaction in lynx habitat would not increase under any of the action
alternatives and would not be greater than the baseline level of snow compaction that was

Divide Travel Plan

documented for the Canada Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy (CLCAS) in 1999 to
2000. The baseline snowmobile route mileage in the Travel Plan Area is 425 miles, of which, 165
miles are in lynx habitat. This has not changed since 1999. Route miles in lynx habitat would
decrease to 161 miles in alternative 2 and to 159 miles in alternatives 3 and 4. Table 114 shows
the changes by LAU.
The Helena NF has not designated off-route “play areas” for snowmobiles in the Divide
landscape; but unless such riding is prohibited by specific area closures, it is allowed and there is
a general understanding as to where these traditional play areas are located. While in most
cases, off-trail riding involves play areas near sanctioned trails, there is potential for pioneering
routes off into new areas, which could extend the reach of competing carnivores. In the Divide
landscape, most of this activity is confined to higher elevation meadows, parks and other breaks
in forest cover where snowmobiles have room to maneuver. As a result, almost none of it is in
mapped lynx habitat (which is forested). No Travel Plan alternative designates specific play
areas or makes changes to existing snowmobile routes that would encourage more off-route
riding. To the contrary, alternatives 2, 3 and 4 propose to expand the number and size of areas
where off-route snowmobile riding is restricted. As a result, all four alternatives comply with
the “play area” aspect of Guideline HU G11.
Table 115 summarizes acreages within each LAU closed to off-trail snowmobile riding under
each alternative [see also Alternative maps]. Acres in Table 115 have been estimated from
Divide Travel Plan alternative maps and rounded to the nearest 10 acres. The snowmobile
closure in the MacDonald Pass cross-country ski area (820 acres) in di-05 has not been included
since it contains numerous packed over-the-snow routes generated by trail grooming.

Alternative 1 would maintain about 34,600 acres of snowmobile area closures, of which roughly
70 percent are in potential lynx habitat. Alternative 2 would expand this to more than 50,100
acres, of which about 77 percent are in lynx habitat. Alternatives 3 and 4 would provide a
closure area of around 53,400 acres, with about 79 percent in lynx habitat. Alternative 5 would
close the most acreage to cross-country snowmobiling, roughly 71,300 acres, of which about 78
percent are in lynx habitat. A majority of the area closures in the Travel Plan Area are south of
U.S. Highway 12. This is the part of the Divide landscape that the NRLMD classifies as
“secondary” occupied lynx habitat, but it is the part of the landscape where most of the verified
lynx observations have been made in the last five years. The upshot is that these snowmobile
restrictions are targeted at that portion of the Travel Plan Area where they are most likely to
benefit lynx as currently distributed, regardless of whether or not the area has been classified as
critical lynx habitat.

Divide Travel Plan

As to Guideline HU G12, the Travel Plan does not address access for special uses or mineral/
energy exploration and development. The Helena NF deals with proposals for these activities via
a special use permitting process. So, this guideline does not apply to Travel Plan proposals.

Effects Assessment: Critical Habitat

Effects on critical habitat are assessed in terms of the impact that each alternative has on the
four primary constituent elements (PCEs) associated with “boreal forest landscapes” that are
capable of supporting lynx (Federal Register, Vol. 74, No. 36, p. 8638). PCEs apply both to
suitable (mapped) lynx habitat in the region north of U.S. Highway 12 and to “matrix habitat”
that surrounds and connects areas of suitable habitat in that area. Characteristics of the
various PCEs and potential effects of Travel Plan alternatives are as follows:
PCE (a). “Preferred habitat conditions, which include dense understories of young trees,
shrubs or, overhanging boughs that protrude above the snow and mature multistoried
stands with conifer boughs touching the snow surface”.
Effects: None of the proposed alternatives would have any effect this on this PCE
because none of them propose to alter forest vegetation. Any indirect effects, such as
might come from firewood cutting in open road corridors, would have no measurable
effect on dense understory vegetation.
PCE (b). “Winter snow conditions that are generally deep and fluffy for extended
periods”.
Effects: Alternatives influence this element by allowing snow-compacting activity,
primarily snowmobiling, in occupied winter lynx habitat. Alternative 1 would maintain
all current sanctioned snowmobile routes. The three action alternatives would slightly
reduce road and trail miles on which existing snowmobile use is sanctioned in critical
lynx habitat (by two miles in alternatives 2 and 4 and by three miles in Alternative 3).
PCE (c). “Sites for denning that have abundant coarse woody debris, such as downed
trees and root wads”.
Effects: Travel management affects this element indirectly by maintaining open roads in
potential lynx habitat that allow firewood cutters to remove snags and woody debris
that might, in some circumstances, contribute to lynx denning. Alternative 1 retains the
status quo in this regard. Alternative 2 reduces open road mileage in critical lynx habitat
by about seven percent and alternatives 3 and 4 reduce it by about eight percent.
PCE (d). “Matrix habitat (not supporting hares) that occurs between patches of boreal
forest in close juxtaposition such that lynx are likely to travel though such habitat while
accessing patches of boreal forest within a home range”.
Effects: None of the four alternatives would directly affect matrix habitat because none
of them propose to alter vegetation or other habitat components. There would be no
new road construction. Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 would reduce road density in matrix
habitat in LAUs that support critical lynx habitat (LAUs di-01, di-02).
The effects generated by these alternatives would not result in “adverse modification”
of critical lynx habitat. They would allow “the affected critical habitat to remain
functional…to serve the intended conservation role for the species” (Federal Register,
Vol.74, No. 36, p. 8644).

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Effects of Open Roads
Alternative 1 would maintain the status quo with regard to open roads and snowmobile routes
that facilitate access for trappers and firewood cutters. The Travel Plan Area currently supports
450 miles of roads and motor trails open at some time of the year. There have been no reports
of lynx incidentally trapped in the Divide landscape in recent years, although they are known to
inhabit the area yearlong.

Refuge and Connectivity
Alternative 1 would retain the existing dispersion of potential lynx safe areas. Connectivity
analysis indicates that there are currently 20 large non-motorized habitat blocks (greater than
1,500 acres) in the Travel Plan Area, averaging 5,565 acres in size (as measured from the edges
of surrounding open routes) [Table 103]. Grizzly bear habitat analysis indicates that the Divide
landscape supports four non-motorized potential core areas larger than 2,500 acres with
boundaries at least 0.3 miles from open routes. These areas average 10,645 acres and cover 24
percent of the landscape [Table 112]. The fact that lynx have been inhabiting the Plan Area
consistently in recent years suggests that this is adequate, at least for a small population.

Snow Compaction
Alternative 1 would maintain existing condition: The Travel Plan Area would continue to
support 418 miles of active snowmobile routes, 341 miles of which are currently sanctioned by
the existing Travel Plan and 77 miles of which are not. Roughly 165 miles of the active trails pass
through mapped lynx habitat. Alternative 1 would comply with NRLMD Guideline HU G11 with
regard to designated over-the-snow routes. No specific snowmobile play areas would be
designated in this alternative and all areas where off-route riding is currently restricted would
continue to be closed to such use. With the exception of a small closure around the MacDonald
Pass cross-country ski area, all snowmobile area closures are currently south of Highway 12 in
LAUs di-03, 04, 05 and 06. Of these, two are winter closures applicable to lynx habitat: the
Electric Peak and Lazyman Gulch Roadless Areas. Alternative 1 thus complies with the play area
direction of NRLMD Guideline HU G11.

Effects of Alternative 2
Effects of Open Roads
Alternative 2 would reduce miles of open road and trail available to wheeled vehicles and to
snowmobiles by about five miles (from 450 miles to 445 miles). Some of these closures apply to
lynx habitat and would selectively reduce access opportunity for trappers and wood cutters.

Refuge and Connectivity
Alternative 2 would increase the size of potential refuge zones by consolidating adjacent areas
(closing intervening roads) and enlarging others (closing peripheral roads). Connectivity shows
that Alternative 2 would produce 17 large non-motorized habitat blocks (greater than 1,500
acres) averaging 6,469 acres in size (as measured from the edges of surrounding open routes)
[Table 103]. However, the total acreage of habitat within such blocks would decrease slightly
from 111,305 acres to 109,970 acres. Grizzly bear habitat analysis indicates that the Plan Area
would support five areas larger than 2,500 acres with boundaries at least 0.3 miles from open

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

routes, with average size would increasing from 7,403 acres to 7,732 acres. Thee potential core
areas would cover 26 percent of the landscape [Table 112].

Snow Compaction
Alternative 2 would reduce the current network of active snowmobile trails in the Travel Plan
Area from 418 miles to 394 miles, resulting in a five mile reduction of packed trails in lynx
habitat. Trails “specified” or “allowed” by the Travel Plan would increase from 341 miles to 378
miles, a net increase of 37 miles in lynx habitat. All of these trails, however, were active prior to
1999 to 2000 and have been tallied as part of the baseline condition for the CLACS. In the end,
then, alternative 2, by reducing the actual mileage of snowmobile trails, would contribute to the
consolidation and improvement of lynx habitat. The alternative thus complies with NRLMD
Guideline HU G11 with regard to over-the-snow routes.
No snowmobile play areas would be designated in alternative 2 and no expansion of existing
non-designated play areas is likely (F. Bailey, personal communication 2011). The area closed to
off-route snowmobiling would expand from 35,570 acres to 50,130 acres, with new closures in
Tenmile Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Sweeney Creek and on the Avon Valley face.
Alternative 2 complies with designated play area direction in NRLMD Guideline HU G11.

Effects of Alternative 3
Effects of Open Roads
Under Alternative 3, routes open to wheeled vehicles would decline by 71 miles from 450 miles
to 379 miles. This would, in turn, incrementally reduce trapper access to certain lynx habitat
sites and reduce the area from which snags and woody debris could be removed from the road
corridor by firewood cutters.

Refuge and Connectivity
Alternative 3 would increase the acreage of potential lynx refuges. Connectivity analysis shows
15 large non-motorized habitat blocks (greater than 1,500 acres), averaging 10,942 acres [Table
103]. Total area within such blocks would increase from 111,305 acres to 121,705 acres. Grizzly
bear habitat analysis indicates that the Plan Area would support five areas larger than 2,500
acres surrounded by 0.3-mile buffers. The average size of these areas will increase from 10,686
acres to 11,156 acres. They would cover 31 percent of the landscape [Table 112].

Snow Compaction
Alternative 3 would reduce the network of active snowmobile trails in the Plan Area only slightly
from the current 418 miles to 379 miles. This would produce a decline of seven miles in lynx
habitat. Of these active trails, those “specified” or “allowed” by the Travel Plan would increase
from 341 miles to 396 miles. In lynx habitat the increase would be 28 miles. Since these trails
were calculated as part of the “baseline condition” in 1999 to 2000, there would be no increase
in active packed trails. In the end, alternative 3, would reduce the actual mileage of snowmobile
trails and would thus contribute to the consolidation and improvement of lynx habitat. The
alternative thus complies with NRLMD Guideline HU G11 with regard to over-the-snow routes.
No specific snowmobile play areas would be designated in alternative 3 and no expansion of
existing (though non-designated) play areas is foreseen (F. Bailey, personal communication
2011). The area closed to off-route snowmobiling would be expanded from 35,570 acres to
53,370 acres, with new or expanded area closures in Tenmile Creek, Mike Renig Gulch–Hahn

Creek, Sweeney Creek and on the Avon Valley face. Alternative 3 would comply with
snowmobile play area direction in NRLMD Guideline HU G11.

Effects of Alternative 4
Effects of Open Roads
Under Alternative 4, roads and trails open to wheeled vehicles and snowmobiles would decline
from current levels by 57 miles (from 450 miles to 393 miles). This would reduce trapper access
to certain lynx habitat sites and reduce the area from which snags and woody debris can be
removed from the road corridor by firewood cutters. Alternative 4 would maintain 14 miles
more open road and motor trail than alternative 3 but 52 miles less than Alternative 2.

Refuge and Connectivity
Alternative 4 would increase the acreage of potential lynx refuges from current levels somewhat
less than alternative 3. Connectivity analysis shows 16 large non-motorized habitat blocks
(greater than 1,500 acres) averaging 7,510 acres under alternative 4 [Table 103]. Total acreage
in these blocks would increase from the current 111,303 acres to 120,155 acres. Grizzly bear
habitat analysis indicates that the Plan Area would support five areas larger than 2,500 acres
surrounded by 0.3-mile buffers, averaging 10,215 acres and covering 29 percent of the
landscape[Table 112].

Snow Compaction
Alternative 4 would slightly reduce the the current network of active snowmobile trails in the
Travel Plan Area from 418 miles to 404 miles, a decline of six miles in lynx habitat. Of these
trails, 341 miles are currently “designated”or “allowed” by the Travel Plan. This number would
increase to 385 miles in alternative 4. The result in lynx habitat would be an increase of 44 miles
of “designated” routes. As with alternatives 2 and 3, alternative 4 would comply with NRLMD
Guideline HU G11 with regard to over-the-snow routes, since these trails were calculated as part
of the “baseline condition” for the CLCAS in 1999 to 2000. The upshot is that the alternative
would contribute to the consolidation and improvement of lynx habitat by reducing the actual
mileage of snowmobile routes on the ground.
No snowmobile play areas would be designated in alternative 4 and no expansion of existing
(though non-designated) play areas is foreseen (F. Bailey, personal communication, 2011). The
area closed to off-route snowmobiling would be the same as in alternative 3: 53,370 acres. The
alternative would comply with snowmobile play area direction in NRLMD Guideline HU G11.

Effects of Alternative 5
Effects of Open Roads
Under alternative 5, roads and trails open to wheeled vehicles and snowmobiles would decline
from current levels by 126 miles (from 450 miles to 324 miles), by far, the most of any action
alternative. This would substantially reduce trapper access to certain lynx habitat sites and
reduce the area from which snags and woody debris can be removed from the road corridor by
firewood cutters.

Refuge and Connectivity
Alternative 5 would increase the acreage of potential lynx refuges from current levels more than
any other action alternative. Connectivity analysis shows 17 large non-motorized habitat blocks
(greater than 1,500 acres) averaging 7,691 acres under alternative 3 [Table 103]. Total acreage

in these blocks would increase from the current 111,305 acres to 130,745 acres. Grizzly bear
habitat analysis indicates that the Plan Area would support six areas larger than 2,500 acres
surrounded by 0.3-mile buffers, averaging 10,830 acres and covering 37 percent of the
landscape [Table 112].

Snow Compaction
Alternative 5 would slightly reduce the the current network of active snowmobile trails in the
Travel Plan Area from 418 miles to 403 miles, a decline of six miles in lynx habitat. Of these
trails, 341 miles are currently “designated”or “allowed” by the Travel Plan. This number would
increase to 403 miles in alternative 5: that is, all snowmobile trails would be designated for use.
The result in lynx habitat would be an increase of 44 miles of “designated” routes. As with
alternatives 2, 3 and 4, alternative 5 would comply with NRLMD Guideline HU G11 with regard
to over-the-snow routes, since these trails were calculated as part of the “baseline condition”
for the CLCAS in 1999-2000. The alternative would thus contribute to the consolidation and
improvement of lynx habitat by reduccing the actual mileage of snowmobile routes on the
ground.
No snowmobile play areas would be designated in alternative 5 and no expansion of existing
(though non-designated) play areas is foreseen (F. Bailey, personal communication, 2011). The
area closed to off-route snowmobiling would be 71,305 acres, twice the current condition. The
alternative would comply with snowmobile play area direction in NRLMD Guideline HU G11.

Cumulative Effects

This summary is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which identifies all past, present
and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition to proposed Travel
Management, that may affect lynx and lynx habitat. The scope of the analysis includes the
Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and immediately surrounding
lands (private, State, County, municipal and BLM). This summary is common to all alternatives.

Lynx have large home ranges and travel great distances. Therefore, activities occurring
throughout the Divide landscape, in bordering areas of adjacent landscapes and on nearby
private, municipal, State and BLM lands may be of some relevance. Adjacent National Forest
lands, the Blackfoot landscape on the Lincoln Ranger District to the north and the BeaverheadDeerlodge NF to the south, are of particular importance. Most of the non-Forest lands
bordering the Helena NF to the east and west on either side of the Continental Divide are at
relatively low elevation (below 5,500 feet) and do not provide suitable habitat for lynx
occupancy, but they may serve as linkage or occasional travel zones. Non-Forest lands that are
capable of providing viable habitat are private and State inholdings within National Forest
boundaries at higher elevation (cool forest habitats above 5,500 feet).

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Some recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest have had a mixed influence on lynx
and lynx habitat. Timber harvest over the last 20 years has created clearcuts of all sizes. In each
case, this initially created blocks of unsuitable lynx habitat, some of it persisting over the longterm. But where seral communities dominated by dense sapling conifers have developed, viable
snowshoe hare habitat has emerged. These harvest units have created a mosaic of early and
later successional habitats across the landscape, an arrangement generally more favorable to
lynx than an unbroken sea of mature/pole forest. Timber harvest projects from the the 1970s,

WILDLIFE - 457

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

1980s and 1990s that have had this effect in lynx habitat, to one degree or another, include:
Bison Mountain, Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Deadman,
Strawberry, Corral Gulch, Lava Mountain and Buffalo Creek. Recent harvest activity in the
Clancy-Unionville project area is having some impact on potential lynx habitats, primarily by
taking out dead trees that could, in some circumstances, provide denning habitat components.
Be that as it may, the NRLMD has determined that denning habitat is not a limiting factor for
lynx and has not put forward a standard or guideline to address it (see NRLMD ROD, p. 17).
These areas will develop as stand-initiation hare habitat in the next 15 to 20 years. The ongoing
Red Mountain Flume-Chessman Reservoir project, which is removing a corridor of dead trees
from around the reservoir and flume (490 acres) will be maintained in an open-forest condition
in the future and will not provide suitable lynx habitat in the future. Recently completed and
ongoing hazard tree removal along open roads (Roadside Hazard Tree Removal Project) and in
developed recreation sites (Park Lake, Cromwell Dixon, Kading Moose Creek campgrounds;
CDNST trailhead) should have no effect on lynx.
Likewise, management of grazing allotments has proven detrimental to lynx simply by virtue of
its allowing large numbers of cattle to continue impacting Helena NF resources that may be of
use to lynx and more importantly, to primary lynx prey (snowshoe hares). On the other hand,
revision of allotment management plans over the past two decades has reduced cattle numbers
and spawned a variety of range improvements aimed at protecting riparian sites. These projects
have conspicuously improved vegetation condition in many riparian and other wet sites,
restoring foraging opportunities for lynx.
Actions that have improved prospects for lynx include: closure of Inventoried Roadless Areas to
snowmobiles (Electric Peak, Lazyman Gulch); trail relocation projects that have moved trails
from riparian areas to upslope sites (Blackfoot Meadows, CDNST); initiation of the Statewide
OHV Plan (2001), which prohibits riding off established motor routes; road and motor trail
closures associated with timber harvest projects that have expanded blocks of non-motorized
habitat (Clancy-Unionville, Sound Wood, Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain, Lava Mountain).
Activities that have locally reduced the effectiveness of potential lynx habitat or, in some cases,
had a mixed effect include: retention of private recreational residences on Helena NF land
(particularly in the linkage area near MacDonald Pass ); retention of numerous groomed
snowmobile trails in lynx habitat; retention of numerous roads passing through key lynx habitat
(saddles, forested stringers, riparian areas, denning habitat stands).
Recent and ongoing travel planning efforts on adjacent Ranger Districts could benefit lynx by
expanding security areas and reducing snow compacting activity. Lynx range widely and
enhanced habitat conditions in adjacent areas could aid lynx populations and subsequent
dispersal to the Divide landscape. Conversely, travel management decisions elsewhere could
reduce lynx populations in those areas and lower the potential for emigration/immigration.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Recent and ongoing private land development would continue to impact lynx where it occurs in
lynx habitat, primarily via degradation of available foraging habitat. It is unlikely that lynx occur
on most adjacent non-Forest lands because of their low elevation and a predominance of dry
forest and non-forest habitat types. Inholdings at higher elevation often qualify as potential lynx
habitat. Many of these holdings have been logged in the last 30 years and are in various stages
of succession, most of them not favorable to lynx because of erratic regeneration. Others are in
the process of being cleared of most standing timber that has been killed in the ongoing bark

beetle outbreak. Where lodgepole pine is the dominant overstory, there is some potential for
future development of stand-initiation hare habitat.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect lynx to one degree or
another include improvement of the Rimini Road (in a potential travel zone), continued revision
of grazing allotment management plans, winter travel planning in the Blackfoot landscape and
salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle epidemic. The most prominent
of these latter proposals are the Telegraph and Tenmile-South Helena projects, both of which
would remove dead and downed beetle-killed trees over an extensive area. The Telegraph
project also proposes thinning in early-successional lodgepole pine stands, although those
qualifying as viable snowshoe hare habitat would be left unthinned. These projects present a
mixed bag of effects for lynx. Removal of dead trees would provide an opportunity for more
rapid and dense regeneration of lodgepole pine stands, hastening the advent of extensive stand
initiation snowshoe hare habitat. Leaving the coarse woody debris in place would lead to
slower, more erratic regeneration of early seral forest, but would provide for better cover n the
immediate future and denning opportunities for lynx. Continued hazard tree removal along
open roads and in developed recreation sites is unlikely to affect lynx.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land in the cumulative effects area that may affect lynx includes:
settlement and associated development of private lands (including new roads); timber harvest
and removal of beetle-killed trees; continued snowmobile use and other motorized activity.

Summary and Conclusions
All alternatives would comply with relevant standards and guidelines of the Northern Rockies
Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD ROD, Attachment 1), which was amended into the Helena
Forest Plan in 2007.
Alternative 1 would retain 20 large unroaded habitat blocks, averaging 5,565 acres, as lynx
refuges. Such habitat would total 111,305 acres. Active snowmobile trails would remain at 418
miles and off-trail snowmobile closures at 35,570 acres. While the existing snowmobile trail
system may be having some effect on lynx habitat use patterns, lynx do not appear to be
adversely affected since they continue to coexist with the system in its current configuration.
This trail system would be retained in Alternative 1.
Alternative 2 would consolidate some large unroaded habitat blocks as lynx refuges. The result
would be 17 blocks averaging 6,469 acres. Total refuge habitat would be 109,970 acres, 1,335
acres less than at present. Active snowmobile trails in lynx habitat would decrease by five miles.
Off-trail snowmobile closures would increase to 50,130 acres. Alternative 2 may affect, but is
not likely to adversely affect lynx.
Alternative 3 would consolidate more unroaded habitat blocks as lynx refuges, resulting in 15
blocks averaging 8,114 acres. Total refuge habitat would be 121,705 acres, 11,735 acres more
than alternative 2. Active snowmobile trails in lynx habitat would decrease by seven miles. Offtrail snowmobile closures would increase to 53,370 acres. As with alternatives 1 and 2,
alternative 3 may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect lynx.
Alternative 4 would maintain 16 unroaded habitat blocks, with each block averaging 7,510 acres.
Total refuge habitat would be 120,155 acres, slightly less than alternative 3. Active snowmobile

trails in lynx habitat would decrease by six miles. Off-trail snowmobile closures would be the
same as alternative 3, 49,710 acres. As with the previous alternatives, alternative 4 may affect,
but is not likely to adversely affect lynx.
Alternative 5 would maintain 17 unroaded habitat blocks, with each block averaging 7,691 acres.
Total refuge habitat would be 130,745 acres, the most of any alternative. Active snowmobile
trails in lynx habitat would decrease by eight miles. Off-trail snowmobile closures would take in
considerably more ground than any other alternative, 71,305 acres. As with the previous
alternatives, alternative 5 may affect, but is not likely to adversely affect lynx.

Sensitive Species

This review of sensitive species, along with the assessment of management indicator species
that follows, serves as the Biologicval Evaluation for this project.

Wolverine
Effects on wolverines are described in terms of (1) human activity in areas likely to support natal
denning sites and (2) the availability of safe havens where motorized use and human activity in
general is absent or occurs at low levels. The abundance of ungulate carrion, an important
consideration for wolverines, is a function of big game habitat management by the Helena NF
and hunting regulation by MFWP and is not addressed in this section.

Common Effects of Travel Management

Remote country appears essential to wolverine viability (Hornocker and Hash 1981). Human
encroachment into existing back-country refuges may threaten the wolverine’s ability to
maintain basic life history requirements (Copeland and Hudak 1995). Certain activity may lead to
habitat fragmentation that could limit basic interaction between wolverine subpopulations
(Copeland 1996). It has been hypothesized that the persistence of wolverines in Montana,
despite unlimited historic trapping and hunting, may be a function of extensive designated
wilderness and remote, inaccessible habitat (Hornocker and Hash, 1981; Ruggiero et al. 1994).
High road densities and the associated human activity are known to disturb wolverines. Roads
may eliminate the potential for otherwise suitable foraging and denning habitat, reducing
chances of successful kit rearing (Copeland 1996). Roads allow access to hunters and trappers
and increase the possibility of poaching (Hornocker and Hash 1981). Wolverines are renowned
for their vulnerability to trapping and susceptibility to over-harvest (Claar et al. 1999).

Technological advances in snowmobiles and increases in winter recreation in general (crosscountry skiing, helicopter skiing, snowshoeing) have elevated the probabilities of displacing
wolverines from potential denning habitat (Copeland 1996). Magoun and Copeland (1998)
found that females in Idaho moved their young to new maternal den sites after disturbance by
researchers. Risk of litter loss is potentially high if den relocation occurs. Because wolverines
have low reproductive rates, such losses are magnified to a greater extent than in most mammal
populations. Squires and others (2002) did trap wolverines in areas of high snowmobile activity,
indicating that the animals do not necessarily avoid these areas, although reproductive success
may be impaired. In general, refuge zones, both for denning and for general daily activity, may
be the most important habitat components for wolverines. Protection of viable high elevation
denning sites where deep snow persists in spring is likely to take on added importance in the
future as global warming continues to shrink the size of these areas, potentially eliminating
some of them entirely.

Ungulate carrion is a primary winter food item for wolverines; so, human activities that reduce
elk and deer populations can also affect wolverines (Banci 1994; Copeland 1996). Be that as it
may, it is highly unlikely in the northern Rockies that ungulate populations could decline to such
a level that local wolverines would be measurably affected.

Natal and Maternal Denning Habitat
The Region 1 wolverine habitat model has not identified any natal/maternal denning habitat in
the Divide landscape. A few sites in the landscape, however, do exhibit characteristics typical of
wolverine denning sites (for both natal and maternal dens). These are mountain basins with
rockslides and avalanche chutes on steep slopes that tend to accumulate woody or rocky debris,
as well as deep snow that persists through the spring. Areas with these components include the
eastern slopes of Nevada and Black Mountains in the north end of the landscape and slopes and
basins on Lee Mountain, Red Mountain, Cliff Mountain, Electric Peak, Jericho Mountain, Bison
Mountain, Thunderbolt Mountain and Luttrell Peak in the southern half of the landscape.
A perusal of these areas on Divide Travel Plan alternative maps indicates that none of them
supports snowmobile trails or known snowmobile play areas close enough to potential denning
sites to be of concern. Habitat sites on Electric Peak and on Nevada, Black, Thunderbolt, Cliff
and Bison Mountains are in or adjacent to Roadless Areas where snowmobile use is prohibited
or impractical because of difficult terrain. Potential habitat on Red Mountain is also too difficult
for snowmobilers to access. Sites on Lee Mountain and Luttrell Peak are close to historic mining
operations but are not in areas likely to pick up snowmobile use. No the action alternative
would generate new snowmobile use in any of these areas and it is highly unlikely that any of
them would impact wolverines at natal or maternal denning sites.

Non-Denning Refuges
Beyond the denning season, wolverines are drawn to relatively large blocks of habitat,
abundantly forested, in which human presence is minimal. Such areas have been assessed
previously in sections on Connectivity and Fragmentation (non-motorized habitat patches larger
than 1,500 acres) [Table 102 and Table 103], Grizzly Bear (non-motorized habitat blocks larger
than 2,500 acres and at least 0.3 mile from open roads) [Table 112] and Elk (elk security areas
larger than 250 acres and at least 0.5 mile from open roads) [Table 109, Table 110]. These
habitat blocks are important to male wolverines year-round and to adult female wolverines
outside the natal denning season as areas in which they can forage, rest, breed, raise young and
travel with minimal human interference.
Table 116, below, estimates total acres in refuge zones available to wolverines as calculated by
these three different analyses. Connectivity analysis, which calculates non-motorized acreage
from the edge of surrounding open roads, provides a much broader estimate of available refuge
habitat (ranging from 62 percent to 74 percent of the Plan Area) than the two analyses that
buffer the distance from roads (by 0.3 mile for grizzly bear habitat and by 0.5 mile or more for
elk security). Refuges measured by the grizzly bear analysis range from 24 percnet to 37 percent
of the Plan Area and those measured via elk security area analysis cover 19 percent to 29
percent 3. As is evident in Table 116, alternatives 3, 4 and 5 provide notably more nonmotorized habitat than alternatives 1 and 2, regardless of the analysis method.

These percentages are higher than those from elk security analyses (Table 30) since they are calculated
only for the Travel Plan Area rather than for the entire Divide landscape as in the elk security analysis.

However measured, habitat with low human presence has been sufficient in the past to sustain
a small, apparently resident, wolverine population in the Divide landscape. Biologists, local
residents and other Forest users have been reporting the presence of wolverines for more than
20 years and recent winter tracking surveys have verified the presence of two adult males in the
area and suggested the presence of more animals. By this measure, refuge habitat appears
adequate. Alternative 2 (in two of three analyses) would improve this situation and alternatives
3 and 4 (in all three analyses) would improve it more.

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
No known wolverine natal or maternal denning habitat is threatened by current patterns of
snowmobile use or other winter recreation in the Divide landscape. This status is preserved in
alternative 1. Non-motorized refuges would continue to occupy approximately 63 percent of
the Travel Plan Area as calculated by connectivity analysis, 24 percent of the area as calculated
by grizzly bear refuge analysis and about 19 percent of the area as calculated by elk security
area analysis.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would not add snowmobile routes in areas with potential to support wolverine
natal or maternal denning habitat. It would increase the area closed to off-trail snowmobile
riding. No wolverine denning habitat would be threatened by resulting patterns of snowmobile
use or other winter recreation in the Divide landscape. Under alternative 2, non-motorized
sanctuaries would occupy approximately 62 percent of the Travel Plan Area as calculated by
connectivity analysis, 27 percent of the area as calculated by grizzly bear refuge analysis and 19
percent of the area as calculated by elk security area analysis.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would not add snowmobile routes in areas with potential to support wolverine
natal/maternal denning habitat. It would increase the area closed to off-trail snowmobile use.
No wolverine denning habitat would be threatened by the pattern of snowmobile use or other
winter recreation in the Divide landscape. Under alternative 3, non-motorized refuges would
occupy 25 percent of the area calculated by elk security area analysis, 31 percent of the area
calculated by grizzly bear refuge analysis and 69 percent of the Plan Area calculated by
connectivity analysis.

WILDLIFE - 462

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternative 4
In terms of snowmobile access, alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3 and it would have
essentially no effect on wolverine natal/maternal denning habitat. By increasing the area closed
to off-trail snowmobile riding, it would lower the potential for negative human-wolverine
encounters in winter. Under alternative 4, non-motorized refuge areas would occupy about 68
percent of the Travel Plan Area as calculated by connectivity analysis, 29 percent of the area as
calculated by grizzly bear refuge analysis and 24 percent of the area as calculated by elk security
area analysis.

Effects of Alternative 5
Under alternative 5, the pattern of snowmobile routes would remain similar to other action
alternatives (Table 99), but areas off-limits to cross-country snowmobiling would increase to
twice the current acreage (Table 115). By increasing the area closed to off-trail snowmobile
riding, it would lower the potential for negative human-wolverine encounters in winter. As with
other alternatives, alternative 5 would have no effect on potential wolverine natal/maternal
denning habitat. Non-motorized refuge areas would occupy about 74 percent of the Plan Area
as calculated by connectivity analysis, 37 percent of the area as calculated by grizzly bear refuge
analysis and 29 percent as calculated by elk security area analysis.

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition
to proposed travel management, that may affect wolverines and wolverine habitat components.
The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest
inholdings) and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County, Municipal and BLM).
Wolverines that currently occupy the Divide landscape are known to use areas immediately
adjacent to the National Forest and in fact, Wild Things Unlimited tracked one animal through
part of the town of Elliston during the winter of 2009 to 2010 (Gehman et al. 2010, p. 7, 11).
However, there is no indication that wolverines range further out into the valleys well beyond
Helena NF boundaries. Effects described in this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest that have improved prospects for
wolverine include: area closures for snowmobiles in the Electric Peak and Lazyman-Black
Mountain Roadless areas; establishment of the Statewide OHV Plan, which prohibits riding off
established motor routes; road and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest projects
(Clancy-Unionville, Sound Wood, Mullan Pass, Lava Mountain, Treasure Mountain). These
decisions have expanded blocks of non-motorized habitat and potential wolverine refuges.

Activities that have locally reduced the effectiveness of potential wolverine habitat to one
degree or another include: numerous road permits allowing access across Helena NF land to
private holdings; retention of private recreational residences on Helena NF land (especially in
the linkage zone at MacDonald Pass); small mining operations (under the 1872 Mining Act) in
areas where wolverines have been observed; construction and maintenance of communications
sites and power lines; development and retention of numerous snowmobile trails in potential
wolverine habitat; retention of numerous dispersed camping sites and unrestricted backcountry recreational use.

WILDLIFE - 463

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

These activities increase, to one degree or another, the potential for wolverine-human
encounters and reduce the country through which wolverines are able to roam generally free
from human influence. Few, if any, of these enterprises are likely to disrupt wolverine natal
denning sites, the exception being large-scale, year-round mining operations at high elevation
(the Luttrell Pit at the southern edge of the analysis area being the only current example). Other
activities that may approach potential denning habitat do not occur during the wolverine
denning period (winter and early spring). High-elevation snowmobile routes and play areas,
which have caused problems for denning wolverines in other parts of the northern Rockies, are
not located near perspective denning sites in the Divide landscape.
New road systems associated with timber sales, some of which remain open to vehicle use, have
reduced unroaded wolverine habitat and increased access for trappers. These include Bison
Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Lump Gulch, Ophir Creek-Cave Gulch,
Deadman, among others. Timber harvest itself has a mixed effect on wolverine habitat and the
ability of wolverines to avoid humans and find food. In general, projects that have removed
good quality cover and complex understory habitat supporting diverse potential food sources
have been detrimental. Those that have improved habitat productivity by opening up dense,
depauperate forest and increasing edge and ecotone may be beneficial.
Ongoing and recently completed removal of beetle-killed trees from along Forest roads
(Forestwide Hazardous Tree Removal Project, 2010) and in administrative and developed
recreational sites (Kading, Moose Creek, Cromwell Dixon, Park Lake, campgrounds; MacDonald
Pass CDNST trailhead; Tenmile picnic area; Moose Creek cabin) are unlikely to have any
meaningful effect on wolverines.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Private land development (primarily rural home building) is continuing to create more sites that
prove problematic for animals attempting to move through or occupy the landscape (barriers to
movement, habitat loss, food attractants, dogs). Many of these developments are at low
elevation in areas seldom traversed by wolverines, but some are associated with higher
elevation inholdings (Telegraph Creek, Ontario Creek, Little Blackfoot, upper Tenmile) and may
create problems. The town of Rimini and a number of dwellings on mid-high elevation Forest
inholdings occupy ground that might otherwise be favorable as wolverine habitat. Cabins used
only seasonally or intermittently throughout the year, especially those that harbor stored food,
may attract wolverines. The Great Divide ski area on BLM land in the northeast part of the
analysis area usurps a large block of potential habitat that wolverines are now likely to avoid in
winter.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Hazard tree removal and dead tree salvage projects resulting from the bark-beetle epidemic
have some short-term potential for negative human-wolverine encounters while work is in
progress but are unlikely to generate meaningful habitat problems or benefits. The most
prominent of these projects are the Red Mountain Flume-Chessman Reservoir and Telegraph
Creek fuels projects. While these projects propose to harvest dead trees that could conceivably
provide woody debris accumulations in which wolverines might den, the potential for future
denning in the proposed harvest units once trees fall is low (elevations are too low, there are no
avalanche chutes or large rockslides nearby, density of large dead trees is generally too low,
most areas are too close to regular human activity). Wolverines could use accumulated

WILDLIFE - 464

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

deadfall, if not for denning, then for resting or escape cover. Removal of dead trees could thus
influence future movement patterns. Given the abundance and wide distribution of nonharvested areas, however, the low density of the local wolverine population and the
adaptability of wolverines to a wide array of habitat formations, it is highly unlikely that the
proposed projects would have any influence on the ability of wolverines to continue to occupy
the landscape. Proposed hazard tree removal along open roads and in developed recreation
sites would have no effect on wolverines.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

The primary foreseeable activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that can
affect wolverines is the ongoing development of private inholdings (building construction, road
building, forest clearing, local mining and general human activity).

Summary and Conclusions
None of the alternatives would negatively impact key habitat components for wolverines. No
natal denning habitat would be disrupted by roads or snowmobile use and the acreage of nonmotorized habitat refuges (as measured from roads’ edge) would decrease slightly, remain
steady, or increase [see Table 116, row 1].
Alternative 1 would maintain large non-motorized sanctuaries at the current level of about 63
percent of the Travel Plan Area (as calculated by connectivity analysis). Alternative 2 would
shrink large non-motorized refuges slightly to about 62 percent of the Plan Area. Alternatives 3
and 4 would increase the reach of large non-motorized refuges to about 68 percent of the Travel
Plan Area. Alternative 5 would increase large non-motorized havens to about 74 percent of the
Travel Plan Area. The small, but persistent local population of resident wolverines would remain
in place under all alternatives.
None of the effects generated by this project or by other Helena NF fuels/timber management
projects in the Divide landscape are factors contributing to the wolverine having been listed as a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The USFWS has indicated that the listing
arose from concerns over the loss of natal denning habitat due to global climate change.

Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf
Common Effects of Travel Management

Effects are described in terms of parameters that threaten wolves through (1) human contact
and conflict (primarily, livestock grazing, human settlement in the wildland-urban interface,
legal wolf hunting and trapping and illegal shooting); (2) activities that compromise denning or
rendezvous sites and (3) activities that affect the prey base. These follow the three key
components of wolf habitat identified in the Wolf Recovery Plan (USDI 1987). Viable denning
and rendezvous sites, freedom from human interference and adequate prey.

Human Conflict
In the 19th century, wolf populations declined due to conflicts with humans, pressure from
human settlement, livestock predation, a lack of understanding of wolf ecology and habits and
subsequent eradication programs (USDI 1987). By 1920, wolves had been eliminated from most
of the 48 contiguous states (northern Michigan and Minnesota being the only exceptions).
Recovery in the northern Rockies began in the 1980s via slow immigration from Canada.

WILDLIFE - 465

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Today, in spite of wolf numbers far below those of the 1800s, wolf-human conflicts have reemerged, most notably with regard to predation of big game and livestock. Each year from
1997 through 2007, USFS Wildlife Services received an average of 79 complaints of suspected
livestock losses to wolves in Montana. Roughly 40 percent of the losses were confirmed to be
wolf kills (Sime et al. 2007, p. 18). In 2009, this proportion had risen to 50 percent (Sime et al.
2010, p. 34). Between 2006 and 2010, the number of livestock killed by wolves rose
significantly. Wildlife Services reported 79 wolf kills of adult sheep, lambs and young cattle in
2006. In 2010, the number was 164 kills (Sime et al. 2011, p. 33). At the same time, livestock
predation by other large predators (grizzly bears, mountain lions and particularly, coyotes) has
increased dramatically as well: 976 kills in 2006; 4,462 kills in 2010 [see summary in the Helena
Independent Record, Dec. 12, 2010]. In 2011, confirmed losses to wolves dropped off
dramatically from 2010 numbers, down to 86 kills statewide. MFWP speculates that this may be
due in large measure to targeted wolf control in certain areas with chronic predation problems
(Hanauska-Brown et al. 2011, p. 14).
Elevated wolf predation is partly, if not primarily, a function of expanding wolf populations.
Reasons for the spike in coyote, grizzly bear and mountain lion predation, however, is less clear,
since populations of these carnivores have been stable or have risen at more modest rates than
those of wolves. Nonetheless, the return of the wolf to the northern Rockies after an absence
of nearly three quarters of a century, coupled with heightened livestock losses and the historic
antipathy of ranchers toward this particular carnivore, have served to give the wolf a higher
profile than other predators. This is particularly true in local areas where ranchers consistently
see losses to their herds (Sime et al. 2007, p. 17). Currently, when wolves attack livestock and
where further losses appear likely, Wildlife Services, at the direction of MFWP, seeks out and
relocates or, most often, kills the offending animals. A total of 583 wolves were killed to resolve
conflicts with livestock from 1987 to 2009 in Montana (Sime et al. 2010, p. 34).
The impact that wolves can have on native ungulate populations puts them at loggerheads with
many hunters who see them as a threat to their ability to bag an elk or other game animal. In
essence, the wolf represents new competition to human predation-by-hunting. So far in
Montana, wolves have noticeably reduced elk populations to the detriment of hunters in a few
local areas, such as in the central Gallatin River watershed, the area immediately north of
Yellowstone Park and along the West Fork of the Bitterroot River (Cunningham 2010; Sime
2010). But many hunters perceive this to be a universal statewide phenomenon, which serves
to instill animosity toward wolves among this segment of the population. Anytime these
hunters find fewer elk in a given area in any given year, whether it be a function of weather,
retreat to private land sanctuaries, a variety of predators, or whatever, they feel it must be due
to wolves. It is likely that in parts of the state traditional elk population levels mediated by the
old equilibrium between elk, vegetation and human predation will now move to a lower plateau
with this re-emergence of another major predator (aside from humans) into the system
[Hebblewhite 2010]. It will be many years before these new levels are perceived as the norm
and resentment of wolves and consequent pressure to reduce wolf numbers, declines.
Increasingly, as people settle in the wildland-urban interface and on previously wide-open
ranchland, the potential for human-wolf encounters increases. While wolves are not known to
have directly threatened humans in Montana, they have killed dogs and other domestic animals.
As well, many people perceive wolves as a menacing presence and it is not uncommon for them
to shoot at wolves as a matter of course. Wolves are also sometimes caught in traps set for
other animals. A number of wolves have been hit and killed by vehicles on highways in

WILDLIFE - 466

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Montana, Idaho and Wyoming in recent years, including an adult female killed near MacDonald
Pass in the Divide Travel Plan Area in 2002.

Denning and Rendezvous Sites
Wolves may use the same den sites from one year to the next or maintain several dens in a local
area through which they cycle over the years (USDI 1987). Packs are sensitive to human activity
near den sites and they may move if disturbed (Ballard et al. 1987). Most dens are located well
away from trails and backcountry campsites. Rendezvous sites are specific resting and gathering
areas that wolves use in summer and early fall. Wolves move to several rendezvous sites in the
course of a summer, the first one usually located one to six miles from the natal den. Packs use
rendezvous sites until pups are mature enough to travel with the adults. Wolves are most
sensitive to disturbance at the first rendezvous site and become less so at later sites (USDI
1987).
The Wolf Recovery Plan (USDI 1987) recognized den and rendezvous sites as key components of
wolf habitat to be protected from human interference. Based on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS) recommendations, the Helena NF routinely proposes that known wolf dens on the
Forest be buffered from any local project (or recreational activity) by at least at least ½ mile
during the denning season. Rendezvous sites are more ephemeral and mobile, but any such
sites that can be identified are also buffered from human presence as much as possible while
they are active.

Prey Base
Wolves prey primarily on ungulates (USDI 1987). During May and June, wolves focus on
newborn deer, moose, elk and bison in calving/fawning areas. In summer and fall, ungulates
constitute the highest percentage of biomass; in winter wolves prey almost exclusively on deer,
elk and moose (although livestock may figure into the mix in ranchland areas). Because
ungulates represent the bulk of the wolf’s food supply, factors that affect ungulate distribution
and abundance (habitat and access management, winter range productivity) also affect wolves.
These factors are discussed in previous sections on Elk and other big game species.

Roads
Roads have not been identified as a component directly affecting the recovery and viability of
wolf populations in the northern Rockies. The presence of roads on the landscape, however, is
associated with indirect effects that can put pressure on wolves. These include the effect that
roads have on the local abundance and distribution of ungulate populations upon which wolves
depend for food; greater potential for human interference at key sites, such as dens; and the
loss of space free from regular human presence in general. Other indirect effects are the
potential for mortality associated with vehicle accidents and legal/illegal shooting that roads
facilitate (Theil 1985; Mech 1989; Mech et al. 1988; Boyd and Pletscher 1999).

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
There have been no known dens or rendezvous sites in the Travel Plan Area in the last several
years (the last known sites being those associated with the Great Divide pack prior to 2003).
Consistent, though low-key, wolf activity in the upper Tenmile drainage over the past five years,
however, suggests that there may have been den and rendezvous sites on the Forest in that

WILDLIFE - 467

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

area. Denning sites of known packs are located and monitored by MFWP each year and the
information passed on to the Helena NF so that adjustments to activities on the Forest, including
travel management, can be made to protect denning sites while they are active. As a result,
retention of the status quo in alternative 1, would have no effect on these key sites
Alternative 1 complies with all Forest Plan big game standards and elk and deer populations in
the Divide landscape are robust [see Affected Environment for Elk, Mule Deer and Moose].
Retaining the existing condition would not imperil the ungulate prey base for current and future
wolf packs.
The availability of large blocks of habitat free from motorized disturbance under alternative 1
has been quantified and discussed in previous sections on Grizzly Bear and Connectivity and
Fragmentation [see Table 102, Table 103, Table 113]. The fact that the Divide landscape and
adjacent areas have been occupied by resident wolf packs more or less continuously since 1995
suggests that these areas provide sufficient space for wolves to escape human presence. Wolf
packs have run into trouble confronting human enterprises (notably livestock operations) almost
entirely on private lands away from the National Forest. But while on the National Forest,
wolves have seldom, if ever, been involved in negative encounters with humans or livestock.
The reasons for their disinclination to pursue cattle on National Forest summer ranges is
unknown.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 is highly unlikely to affect established denning or rendezvous sites. It would
reduce slightly the total acreage in non-motorized habitat patches larger than 15,000 acres [see
Table 103]. On the other hand, it would increase the acreage of non-motorized blocks larger
than 2,500 acres (and more than 0.3 mile from open roads) [see Table 112]. In either case, the
changes in availability of habitat in which wolves might establish dens and carry on with other
activities on the Forest away from regular human presence would be relatively small under
alternative 2 and would have no measurable effect on wolf population viability.
In terms of the availability of large prey, while alternative 2 increases the acreage of elk security
areas (from 33 percent to 34 percent of the fall range) [Table 109, Table 110], elk numbers are
unlikely to measurably increase as a result of this change alone. The primary factor determining
the size of local elk populations in the future will not be due to variations in Travel Plan
alternatives, but rather, to the number and variety of elk hunting permits allowed by Montana
Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The roads certainly facilitate hunting opportunity, but overall
population numbers are a direct result of hunter success. In this regard, the degree to which
hunters are able to access off Forest lands where elk often seek refuge during the hunting
season will also affect elk numbers. Block management agreements and State land purchases
(as in the Spotted Dog country) will drive this access. Alternative 2 would allow elk to continue
inhabiting the Plan Area at least at current population levels, thereby assuring a prey base for
wolves.

Effects of Alternatives 3 and 4
Effects would be similar for alternatives 3 and 4. As with alternatives 1 and 2, alternatives 3 and
4 would have no effect on established denning or rendezvous sites. Both alternatives would
increase the total acreage of large non-motorized habitat patches (however measured) [see
Table 102, Table 103, Table 109, Table 110, Table 112 and Table 116], expanding the areas in
which wolves can establish new dens and carry on with other activities away from regular

WILDLIFE - 468

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

human interference. But, the effects, in terms of their contribution to wolf population viability,
are unlikely to be measurable.
Although alternatives 3 and 4 would improve elk summer habitat effectiveness [Table 107] and
expand the acreage of elk security areas [Table 109], elk numbers are unlikely to measurably
increase as a result of these changes alone. Elk populations have been increasing throughout
the Travel Plan Area in recent years and may continue to do so, as a result of improved elk
habitat effectiveness and security on the Forest and the increasing tendency of elk to move
early in the hunting season to private lands off-limits to hunters. While this continues to
provide a good prey source for wolves, it is unlikely to lead to a substantially greater wolf
presence in and around the Travel Plan Area over the long-term. Landowner concerns over
excess elk competing with livestock for forage on wintering grounds should curtail future
population increases. The tendency of wolves in this area of regular private/Forest land
juxtapositon to spend much of their time working the private ranch will continue to see their
numbers limited by control efforts, including hunting and trapping.

Effects of Alternative 5
As with the other four alternatives, alternative 5 would have no effect on established denning or
rendezvous sites. It would increase the total acreage of large non-motorized habitat patches, as
seen in Table 102, Table 103, Table 109, Table 112 and Table 116. This would expand the areas
in which wolves can establish new dens and carry on with other activities away from regular
human interference to a greater degree than any other alternative. However, as with other
alternatives, the effects, in terms of their contribution to wolf population viability, are unlikely
to be measurable.
Alternative 5 would provide the highest level of elk summer habitat effectiveness [Table 107]
and elk security [Table 109, Table 110] of any alternative. But, as with alternatives 3 and 4, elk
numbers are unlikely to measurably increase as a result of these factors alone: wolf populations
will be limited by factors other than prey availability, primarily, human control efforts (mostly on
private land in this area).

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition
to proposed Travel Management, that may affect wolves and wolf habitat components. The
scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings)
and enough surrounding non-Forest lands to encompass known den sites since 1995, in
particular, sites along Spotted Dog Creek, roughly three miles beyond the western Helena NF
boundary and in China Gulch, about ¾ mile beyond the NE corner of the Planning Area. Effects
described in this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest that have improved prospects for wolves
include: establishment of the Statewide OHV Plan, which prohibits riding off established motor
routes, thus reducing potential for negative wolf-human encounters; grazing allotment revisions
that have generally reduced cattle numbers and grazing seasons, thus improving habitat
conditions for big game species while at the same time reducing potential for wolf-livestock
interaction on the Forest; road and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest projects

WILDLIFE - 469

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

(Clancy-Unionville, Sound Wood, Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain, Lava Mountain) that have
expanded blocks of non-motorized habitat and potentially reduced opportunity for negative
wolf-human encounters; trail relocation projects that have removed trails from riparian areas to
upslope locations away from sites more likely to attract wolves and their prey (Blackfoot
Meadows, CDNST).
Activities that have increased the likelihood of wolf-human encounters include: road permits for
access across Helena NF land to private holdings; retention of private recreational residences on
Helena NF land; small mining operations (under the 1872 Mining Act) in areas where wolves
have been observed; construction and maintenance of communications sites and power lines;
efforts to spread livestock distribution across allotments, which may bring cattle into areas
where they are more vulnerable to wolf predation; retention of grazing allotments on the Forest
providing ongoing opportunity for wolf predation; retention of numerous dispersed camping
sites; unrestricted back-country recreation (backpackers, day-hikers, horseback riders, hunters).
The recent establishment (2009) and ongoing evolution of the State wolf hunting program is not
limited to National Forest land. However, because much of the big game hunting in the Divide
landscape occurs on the Helena NF and because many of the wolves that have been harvested
over the past four years have been shot by hunters looking primarily for deer and elk, wolf
hunting is likely to have an important impact on any animals that normally range over the
Forest.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Private land development (primarily rural home building) is continuing to create more sites that
prove troublesome for wolves moving through the landscape (bringing them into contact with
human habitation, domestic animals and residents with guns). Ranching operations on private
lands near the Forest have proven to have high potential for wolf-human conflict. Wolves
inevitably descend to private ranch and agricultural lands in the valleys as winter comes on and
sometimes, they remain there yearlong. This has been a problem primarily in the Avon Valley
and Greater Spotted Dog Creek drainage along the west side of the Divide landscape, a
circumstance that may, in part, be related to elk coming down off the Forest in early-mid fall to
avoid hunters on the National Forest and remaining in the valleylands for up to eight months. In
the last few years, wolves have also been attacking livestock on Sieben Ranch Company lands
northeast of the landscape, although this area is some 10 to 15 miles distant across the Little
Prickly Pear Valley. The demise of most wolf packs that have inhabited the Divide landscape has
resulted from their preying on domestic livestock and their subsequent removal by Federal and
State agencies.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect wolves to one degree or
another include improvement of the Rimini Road, which will allow higher traffic speeds in a
potential wolf travel zone; continued implementation of grazing allotment revision, which will
shift cattle distribution local. Large timber harvest projects designed to deal with the ongoing
bark beetle epidemic (Telegraph Creek, Tenmile South Helena) and continued hazard tree
removal projects at a number of developed recreation sites and along roadsides may cause
wolves to avoid local areas while project operations are active but will not alter habitat in ways
that would benefit or cause problems for wolves.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land in the cumulative effects area that may affect wolves is
mostly a function of continued settlement and development of private lands (including new
roads), activities that increase potential for wolf-human encounters. Unlike many large
carnivores on the Helena NF, wolves frequently inhabit and travel through the maze of private
and public lands in the valleys and foothills adjacent to the Forest. Continued development of
these lands may put pressure on wolves to seek out more isolated habitats on the National
Forest.

Summary and Conclusions
All alternatives would comply with guidance established by the Wolf Recovery Plan as to actions
that influence human-wolf conflict, denning and rendezvous sites and the big game prey base.
Alternative 1 would maintain the status quo, which is not negatively impacting wolves.
Alternative 2 would reduce open road density in some areas, increase it in others; it would
reduce the acreage of non-motorized habitat blocks larger than 1,500 acres but increase the
acreage of non-motorized blocks larger than 2,500 acres. In sum, it would provide a mixed bag
of changes, none of them substantial enough to influence wolf population viability.
Alternative 3 would reduce the potential for wolf-human encounters by lowering open road
density and substantially increasing the acreage of large non-motorized habitat blocks (however
measured). It would reduce the potential for negative wolf-human encounters more than
Alternative 2, but not enough to measurably influence population viability.
Alternative 4 would maintain slightly higher open road density and slightly less acreage in large
non-motorized habitat patches than alternative 3. But the two alternatives are very similar and
effects would be likewise.
Alternative 5 would maintain the lowest open road density and the most extensive acreage of
large non-motorized habitat blocks of any alternative. This would increase prey potential and
reduce probability of negative encounters with humans. Any measurable increases in local wolf
population numbers are unlikely to result from these factors alone.
Virtually all issues with wolves in and around the Divide landscape since their arrival in the late
1980s have been on private or other non-forest lands. Problems have not been driven by
management actions or other circumstances on the Helena NF. This scenario is expected to
continue.

Fisher
Common Effects of Travel Management

Fishers do not necessarily avoid roads and areas of human settlement, but the loss of suitable
forest habitat that often accompanies these developments has been a primary reason for
population decline (Heinemeyer and Jones 1994). Habitat loss and lessened habitat
effectiveness in riparian areas is especially detrimental. Even in areas unaffected by timber
harvest or clearing for building, firewood cutters typically remove most large snags from open
road corridors, eliminating a key habitat component of potential use to fishers. Another
problem has been trapping, often abetted by roads and other access channels for trappers on
snowmobiles. Fishers are wide-ranging, curious and opportunistic and thus highly susceptible to
trapping. Even in areas where quotas are minimal or where fishers are off-limits to trapping,
they are caught incidentally in sets for other species (Jones 1991).
WILDLIFE - 471

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 would retain the current configuration of motor routes. This includes 340 miles of
roads open to wheeled vehicles on public land (and thus, open to firewood cutters) and 418
miles of routes used by snowmobiles. Trapping access to potential fisher habitat (primarily,
patches of riparian forest) would remain at its current level. Trapping activity in the Divide
landscape is variable from year to year, but generally low. This, combined with the rarity of
fishers in the landscape, has resulted in no fishers being caught in recent decades. The potential
for fisher mortality via trapping, as facilitated by the road/trail network, would remain slight.

Effects of Alternative 2
With alternative 2, open road miles on public land would remain much the same as in
alternative 1, declining by only six miles to 334 miles. The area from which firewood cutters
would be able to remove large snags and logs that might be useful to fishers would thus be
essentially unchanged. Roads and trails available to snowmobiles would decline from 418 to
394 miles. At the same time, an additional 9,630 acres of off-route areas would be closed to
snowmobiles. Assuming that most trappers make use of established snowmobile routes for
setting traplines rather than pushing out into off-route areas, the key change under alternative 2
would be the decline in available routes. This would decrease trapper access to a variety of
habitats, including a limited amount of potential fisher habitat.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would produce a larger reduction in open road mileage on public land than
alternatives 1, 2 and 4: from 340 miles to 295 miles, a decrease of 45 miles in road corridor
accessible to firewood cutters. An additional 13,730 acres would be closed to off-route
snowmobile use and roads/trails available to snowmobiles would remain much the same as at
present, declining only from 418 miles to 416 miles. Trapper access to potential fisher habitat
would thus decrease slightly.

Effects of Alternative 4
In alternative 4, roads open to firewood cutters would fall partway between alternatives 2 and 3
at 304 miles (a decrease of 36 miles from current conditions). As with alternative 3, areas
available for off-route snowmobiling would decline by 13,730 acres. Roads and trails available
to trappers on snowmobiles would decrease by 14 miles to 404 miles, more than alternative 2
(394 miles), slightly less than alternative 3 (416 miles). Given the rarity of fishers in the
landscape and the relatively small amount of primary fisher habitat penetrated by the road
system, these changes (under alternatives 2 , 3 and 4) would be unlikely to measurably affect
prospects for fisher viability on the Helena NF or in this part of the northern Rockies in general.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would produce the largest reduction in open road mileage on public land: from
340 miles to 185 miles, a decrease of 155 miles in road corridor accessible to firewood cutters.
An additional 13,730 acres would be closed to off-route snowmobile use and roads/ trails
available to snowmobiles would decline modestly from the current 418 miles to 403 miles,
essentially the same as alternative 4. Trapper access to potential fisher habitat would thus
decrease slightly.

Cumulative Effects

The cumulative effects summary is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which identifies
all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and activities that may affect fishers and
fisher habitat components. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF
land with non-Forest inholdings) and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County,
Municipal and BLM). Effects described in this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Past timber harvest in the Divide landscape, has removed mature and old-growth forest capable
of providing primary fisher habitat (in particular, mid/low-elevation riparian forest). Timber
harvest projects that have had this effect, to one degree or another, include: Bison Mountain,
Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Deadman, Strawberry, Corral Gulch,
Buffalo Creek, Sound Wood and Treasure Mountain, among others. Among smaller projects are
the MacDonald Pass ski trail hazard tree project (in productive forest habitat just below the
Divide) and a number of tree removal operations scheduled for campgrounds, picnic areas and
other developed recreational sites (which are unlikely to provide viable fisher habitat).
Primary actions that have locally reduced the effectiveness of potential fisher habitat by
providing access for trappers and firewood cutters include retention of groomed snowmobile
trails roads passing through forested riparian habitat.

Actions that have improved prospects for fishers include: Closure of Roadless Areas to
snowmobile use (Electric Peak, Lazyman Gulch); trail relocation projects that have removed
trails from productive riparian areas to upslope locations (Blackfoot Meadows, CDNST);
establishment of the Statewide OHV Plan, which prohibits riding off established motor routes;
road and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest (Clancy-Unionville, Sound Wood,
Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain) that have expanded blocks of non-motorized habitat.
Recent and ongoing travel planning efforts on adjacent Forests, as well as the Lincoln Ranger
District, could be beneficial to fishers if they provide local safe havens free from motorized
access. Because fishers are capable of traveling some distance, improved habitat conditions on
other Forests could improve fisher populations and subsequent dispersal opportunities to the
Helena National Forest. Conversely, travel management decisions elsewhere could reduce
fisher populations in those areas and reduce the potential for emigration/immigration.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Recent and ongoing private land development (building construction, clearing, thinning,
commercial timber harvest, dead tree salvage) will continue to impact potential fisher habitat,
particularly where it occurs in forested riparian areas. Actions that reduce key habitat
components (large snags and logs, overhead cover) could have an effect.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect fishers to one degree or
another include salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle epidemic which
will remove substantial numbers of large dead trees, some of which could be of use to fishers.
These include the Telegraph Creek and Red Mountain Flume-chessman Reservoir projects
(although neither area contains more than small fragmented patches of potentially suitable
fisher habitat ).

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that could affect fishers
includes: Settlement and associated development of private lands and timber harvest and
removal of large beetle-killed trees.

Summary and Conclusions
Fishers are extremely rare in the Plan Area and differences between alternatives, road miles
open to firewood cutters (who remove key habitat components) and trappers on snowmobiles
(who pose a mortality risk), are insufficient to impact fishers one way or the other.
Alternative 1 would retain 340 miles of open roads on public land and 418 miles of snowmobile
routes. Alternative 2 would maintain 334 miles of open roads on public land and 394 miles of
snowmobile routes. Alternative 3 would maintain 295 miles of open roads on public land and
416 miles of snowmobile routes. Alternative 4 would maintain 304 miles of open roads on
public land and 404 miles of snowmobile routes. Alternative 5 would maintain 185 miles of
open roads on public land and 403 miles of snowmobile routes.

Black-backed Woodpecker
Common Effects of Travel Management

The presence of open roads and motor trails has no direct effect on black-backed woodpecker
habitat. Impacts come indirectly from the loss of dead trees to firewood cutting or to Forest
operations designed to remove hazard trees from along the roads. Since black-backed
woodpeckers are attracted first and foremost to snag arrays created by stand-replacing fire,
roadside snag removal in these environments is the most telling. Woodpecker numbers are
much lower in stands created by other agents, even where dead tree abundance is high.

Region 1 habitat models show only a single patch of primary black-backed woodpecker habitat
in the Divide landscape, namely, the MacDonald Pass burn (170 acres) from 2009. The ongoing
bark beetle onslaught, however, may put the status of black-backed woodpecker habitat in flux.
The rapid expansion of open-canopied stands of dead and dying trees across the landscape may
be creating new habitat opportunities for black-backed woodpeckers. On the other hand, the
strong preference that these woodpeckers show for burned forest snags may mean that the
beetle-killed forest will not be exploited by these woodpeckers. Even if blackbacks do move into
the beetle-kill, it represents a short-term opportunity, likely to last no more than 10 years as the
bark beetles run their course and the woodpeckers’ food supply fades away.
During that time period, even with the likelihood that many snags would be removed by dead
tree salvage operations, the loss of snags along roads to firewood cutting will not be a factor in
determining whether or not black-backed woodpeckers are able to occupy the landscape.
Because of the magnitude of the beetle kill, the fact that the open road corridors will not be
available as habitat will be of no real consequence under any Travel Plan alternative.
Concentrations of dead tree habitat will be abundant and widely distributed, a circumstance
that has not been extant in the Divide landscape since the turn of the 20th century. This may be
a moot point, however, if black-backed woodpeckers continue to spurn the beetle-killed forest.

WILDLIFE - 474

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 maintains the status quo. The abundance of dead trees available as potential black
back-woodpecker habitat is may be diminished wherever firewood cutters can remove snags
from the open road corridors. The degree to which black-backed woodpeckers are actually
present in these areas depends upon the character of the environment created by the ongoing
bark-beetle infestation of pine forests. This environment is currently a work in progress and the
effect of leaving the existing road system in place is speculative with regard to a species that
appears to develop robust populations only in the aftermath of stand-replacing fire.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would reduce open roads on public land by six miles. This represents road corridor
that would no longer be available to firewood cutting and removal of roadside hazard trees.
The degree to which this would affect black-backed woodpeckers (which have yet to put in
appearance in the beetle-killed forest) is highly speculative. It is unlikely that the removal of
nine miles of road corridor from the firewood cutting base would in any measurable way
improve prospects for black-backed woodpeckers.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would reduce open roads on public land by 45 miles. While this would be an
appreciable reduction in the road corridor available to firewood cutters, it is unlikely that it
represents a large enough area of concentrated dead tree habitat to produce a commensurate
increase in local black-backed woodpecker numbers, especially given their strong preference for
burned trees.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would reduce open roads on public land by 36 miles. As with alternatives 2 and 3,
this decrease in the availability of non-burned forest to firewood cutting would not meaningfully
increase habitat opportunity for black-backed woodpeckers.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would reduce open roads on public land by 155 miles, appreciably more than any
other action alternative. Nonetheless, this decrease in the availability of non-burned forest to
firewood cutting would not meaningfully increase habitat opportunity for black-backed
woodpeckers.

Cumulative Effects

This summary is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which identifies past, present and
foreseeable projects and other activities that may affect black-backed woodpeckers and their
habitat components. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land
with non-Forest inholdings), adjacent National Forest lands (Helena NF Lincoln Ranger District;
Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF) and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County,
Municipal and BLM). Effects described in this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

The MacDonald Pass Ski Trails, Forestwide Roadside Hazard Tree Removal and Red Mountain
Flume Chessman Reservoir projects have removed beetle-killed mature trees from several
hundred acres, although black-backed woodpeckers had not been reported in any of these

project sites. The latter two projects are still in progress. Also recently completed are a number
of tree removal operations scheduled for campgrounds, picnic areas and other developed
recreation sites (which are unlikely to provide viable black-backed woodpecker habitat). Fire
management policy aimed at preventing stand replacing fires over several decades has, in the
Divide landscape, resulted in a paucity of black-backed woodpecker habitat. No other Forest
Service policies or actions have had meaningful implications for these woodpeckers.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Timber harvest on private lands has reduced the potential for a scenario where stand replacing
fire would create abundant black-backed woodpecker habitat in those areas.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect black-backed woodpecker
habitat revolve around projected salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle
epidemic which will remove substantial numbers of dead trees. These include the Telegraph
Creek project (which involves both removal of beetle-killed mature trees and the precommercial
thinning of sapling conifers in old clearcuts) and the Tenmile South Helena project (which
involves removing standing dead trees (soon to be downed dead trees) from an extensive area
throughout the upper Tenmile watershed.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land that could affect black-backed woodpeckers is tied to salvage
of dead trees and thinning projects designed to reduce the probability of stand replacing fire.

Summary and Conclusions
Differences between alternatives, in terms of road corridor acreage available to firewood
cutters, would be too small to impact black-backed woodpeckers, which need extensive
concentrations of dead trees to inhabit an area and which have a strong preference for burned
forest rather than beetle-killed trees. Given the acreage of beetle-killed pine outside the road
corridors, the impact on black-backed woodpecker occupancy would be insubstantial.
Alternative 1 would retain current road corridor acreage on public land from which firewood
cutters could remove dead trees that could provide marginal black-backed woodpecker habitat.
Alternative 2 would reduce roads on public land available to firewood cutters by six miles.
Alternative 3 would reduce roads available to firewood cutters on public land by 45 miles.
Alternative 4 would reduce public roads available to firewood cutters by 36 miles. Alternative 5
would reduce public roads available to firewood cutters by 155 miles.

Western Boreal Toad
Common Effects of Travel Management

Primary local risk factors for western toads are those that affect breeding habitat via reduction
in size and quality of riparian areas. Activities that eliminate key vegetation and increase water
turbidity reduce the quality of riparian areas as breeding habitat. Road construction and the
subsequent presence of dirt/gravel roads in riparian areas increase sedimentation in adjacent
aquatic habitats unless mitigation measures are initiated and sustained. Off-route motorized
use in riparian areas can also reduce habitat by degrading vegetation and increasing
sedimentation (Maxell and Hokit 1999).
WILDLIFE - 476

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

While toad populations are highest near riparian areas, adult toads travel some distance away
from breeding sites, moving through a variety of upland habitats. Because they are small, move
slowly and deliberately and are highly dependent on cover, toads find Forest roads to be more
of a barrier than almost any other local wildlife species. In addition to being a deterrent to
efficient movement through the landscape, well-traveled roads are often a source of mortality
for toads and for amphibians and reptiles in general.
Western toads often seek shelter in logs and under other coarse woody debris and removal of
these components from the road corridor, typically by firewood gatherers or by Forest Service
burning operations designed to reduce fuel loading, can reduce local habitat opportunity [see
additional discussion in sections on Riparian Habitats and Snag and Woody Debris].

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 retains the current configuration of roads and motor trails. This leaves 474 miles
of open roads and trails in the Travel Plan Area, 83 miles of which are in riparian habitat
conservation areas (RHCAs). Off-route riding would continue to be restricted by the Statewide
OHV Decision (USFS, USFWS 2001), which limits off-road vehicle use to a 300 feet corridor on
either side of the road for reaching dispersed camping sites and prohibits riding in sensitive
habitats (particularly wet sites). A Forest road system of this magnitude, while a contributing
factor to depressing local western toad populations, represents a relatively minor impact
compared to other decimating factors and sources of habitat degradation (chytrid fungus,
draining and diversion of ponds and streams, water pollution, predatory fish introduction, cattle
at aquatic sites).

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would reduce open route mileage from 474 to 469 miles overall and from 83 to 76
miles in riparian habitat conservation areas. This would incrementally reduce mortality risk for
western toads, reduce the area from which coarse woody debris is likely to be removed by
firewood gatherers and reduce the miles of roadside riparian habitats likely to be disrupted by
motorized use. The result would not be measurable in terms of shifts in local western toad
population viability.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would reduce open route mileage from 474 to 403 miles overall and from 83 to 69
miles in riparian habitat conservation areas. This would incrementally lower mortality risk for
western toads, reduce the area from which coarse woody debris is likely to be removed by
firewood cutters and reduce the miles of roadside riparian habitats likely to be disrupted by
motorized use. The decline in potential impacts, though greater than under alternative 2, would
not be measurable in terms of local western toad population viability.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is similar to alternative 3 in terms of its effect on roads and trails in riparian areas.
It would reduce open route mileage from 474 to 417 miles overall and from 83 to 70 miles in
riparian habitat conservation areas. As with alternative 3, this would incrementally lower
mortality risk for western toads, reduce the area from which coarse woody debris is likely to be
taken for firewood and reduce potential motorized disruption of roadside riparian habitats. The

WILDLIFE - 477

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

decline in potential impacts would not be measurable in terms of local western toad population
viability.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would be most the effective of the action alternatives in tempering the impact of
motor routes on western toads across the Travel Plan Area. It would reduce open route mileage
from 474 to 348 miles overall and from 83 to 65 miles in riparian habitat conservation areas. As
with other action alternatives, alternative 5 would diminish mortality risk for western toads by
vehicles on roads and trails, reduce the area from which coarse woody debris is likely to be
taken for firewood and lower the potential for motorized disruption of roadside riparian
habitats. The decline in potential impacts would not be measurable in terms of local western
toad population viability.

Cumulative Effects

This summary is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which identifies past, present and
reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, along with proposed Travel Management,
that may affect western toads. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena
NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County,
Municipal and BLM). Effects described in this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Recent and ongoing activities on the Helena NF that may negatively affect western toads
include: Timber sales that have created large openings with minimal coarse woody debris (Bison
Mountain, Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Deadman, Strawberry,
Corral Gulch, Buffalo Creek, Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain); retention of grazing allotments on
the Forest, most of which allow cattle some degree of access to aquatic habitats; small mining
operations; large mining operations on and adjacent to the Forest (Montana Tunnels, Luttrell).

Among small/mid-sized projects are the Red Mountain Flume Chessman Reservoir project
(removing dead trees and woody debris from roughly 490 acres), the MacDonald Pass ski trail
hazard tree project (in productive forest habitat with numerous drainage-head wet sites) and a
number of tree removal operations scheduled for campgrounds, picnic areas and other
developed recreation sites (which are unlikely to provide viable western toad habitat).
Actions that have improved prospects for western toads include: Revision of allotment
management plans that have resulted in lower cattle numbers and range improvements aimed
at protecting riparian sites; trail relocation projects that have removed trails from productive
riparian areas to upslope locations (Blackfoot Meadows, CDNST); establishment of the
Statewide OHV Plan, which prohibits riding off established motor routes except for dispersed
camping access; road and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest projects (ClancyUnionville, Sound Wood, Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain); mine site reclamation projects that
have reduced sedimentation and pollution at a number of aquatic sites.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Development of private lands adjacent to the forest and on inholdings within Forest boundaries
has modified riparian and aquatic habitats ( by water diversion, sedimentation, degradation of
vegetation) and subtracted potential breeding habitat for western toads. Timber harvest on
private land has removed forest cover useful to toads, but has often increased the amount of

WILDLIFE - 478

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

coarse woody debris at ground level, a benefit to toads. Cattle grazing on private ranchlands
has led to degradation of riparian/aquatic habitat at many of sites. ATV, trail bike and fourwheel-drive riding in riparian areas disrupts habitat where toad densities are likely to be highest.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that may affect toads to one degree or
another include improvement of the Rimini Road, continued grazing allotment revision and
salvage projects designed to deal with bark beetle infestation that may remove or thin
understory vegetation and woody debris. Prominent among these are the Telegraph Creek
project (which would both remove of beetle-killed mature trees and thin stands of sapling
conifers in old clearcuts), the Tenmile south Helena project (which would remove standing snags
and coarse woody debris from extensive areas of the upper Tenmile Creek drainage and the
area south of Helena) and continuation of the Forestwide Roadside Hazard Tree Removal
Project.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions
Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that may affect western
toads includes: settlement and associated development of private lands (including road
building); timber harvest and removal of beetle-killed trees; continued ATV and other motorized
activity; continued heavy grazing on private ranchlands, including riparian sites.

Summary and Conclusions
Given the relatively minor contribution of Forest roads to mortality factors impacting western
toads, differences in road miles between alternatives would be highly unlikely to show
measurable differences in local toad populations.
Under alternative 1, 83 miles of road would be retained in riparian habitat conservation areas.
Under alternative 2, open road mileage would decline to 76 miles in riparian habitat
conservation areas. Under alternative 3, open road mileage would decline to 69 miles in
riparian habitat conservation areas. Under alternative 4, open road mileage would decline to 70
miles in riparian habitat conservation areas. Under alternative 5, open road mileage in riparian
habitat conservation areas would decline from 83 miles to 65 miles.

Flammulated Owl
Common Effects of Travel Management

Flammulated owls are small raptors, active primarily from dusk to dawn. McCallum (1994)
observes that they appear quite tolerant of humans: In the northern Rockies, they will nest,
roost and forage close to houses and to open roads and well-used trails if habitat structure is
suitable. The mature and old-growth ponderosa pine stands that traditionally provided that
habitat structure in the Divide landscape have been logged particularly heavily since the late
1860s and their relatively low abundance and fragmented dispersion on the landscape are
limiting factors for flammulated owls. In these circumstances, the presence of human activity
along roads and trails in ponderosa stands, though not an ideal set of conditions, appears not to
be a primary determinant of habitat selection. If the basic habitat is there, the owls take
advantage of it.
The impact of roads is indirect in that firewood cutters working the open road corridors are
likely to remove large dead trees that the owls most often use for nesting. Flammulated owls
WILDLIFE - 479

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

will nest in live conifers where pileated woodpeckers have excavated cavities, but large snags
are the primary source of nest holes and in the road corridor, they are ephemeral.
The on-going pine mountain pine beetle epidemic is of particular relevance to flammulated owl
habitat, since mature ponderosa pine forests, particularly the more open-grown stands with
large trees at lower and mid elevations, represent a primary environment for these birds. The
increase in large cavity-prone trees in stands of this structure represents new habitat
opportunities for flammulated owls wherever sufficient live canopy remains. In the open road
corridors, however, the loss of these components is virtually inevitable.
Flammulated owl habitat has been mapped via the Region 1 habitat model, which is designed to
predict environments most optimal to flammulated owl nesting, roosting and foraging. Primary
source data for the model has come from research in westside Forests, notably the Bitterroot,
Lolo and Nez Perce NFs. Field surveys on the Helena NF suggest that, as with several other
species, habitat usage in the drier, more fragmented forests east of the Continental Divide is
more diverse. That is, the owls tend to use combinations of habitat components that are
variations of the more optimal westside arrangements, making use of two or three separate
habitat patches, each with one optimal component, rather than holding out for a single stand
with all components combined. On the Helena NF, flammulated owls have also been observed
taking advantage of mature aspen stands. As a result, the Region 1 model almost certainly
underestimates flammulated owl habitat in the Travel Plan Area. Be that as it may, Table 117
summarizes the relative potential for loss of snags to firewood cutting in modeled flammulated
owl habitat under different alternatives.

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 would have no direct effect on flammulated owls since no new road or trail
construction is part of the proposal and no habitat components would be lost as a result.
Alternative 1 would maintain the status quo and would not increase the potential for indirect
effects resulting from removal of large dead trees that might serve as nesting substrate. Snag
removal by firewood cutters and under the proposed Helena NF hazard tree removal program
will increase in the near future because of the proliferation of dead trees generated by ongoing
bark beetle infestations. This elevated level of activity, however, is not a function of this
alternative.

Effects of Alternative 2
There would be no direct effects on flammulated owls since, as with alternative 1, no new road
or trail construction is a part of this alternative and no key habitat components would be
removed as a consequence. Road closures in alternative 2 would reduce the maximum roadside

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

area available to snag depletion by firewood cutters in flammulated owl habitat by about 385
acres, or from 18 percent to 16 percent of modeled owl habitat.

Effects of Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would have no direct effect on flammulated owls since no new road or trail
construction is part of proposal and no habitat components would be lost as a result. Road
proposals in alternative 3 would reduce the roadside area susceptible to snag depletion by
firewood cutters in flammulated owl habitat by roughly 669 acres compared to current
conditions, from 18 percent to 14 percent of modeled habitat.

Effects of Alternative 4
As with the previous alternatives, alternative 4 would have no direct effect on flammulated owls
since there would be no new road or trail construction and no resulting loss of habitat
components. In terms of its potential for indirect effects on flammulated owl habitat,
alternative 4 is almost identical to alternative 3. It would reduce the roadside area susceptible
to snag depletion by firewood cutting in flammulated owl habitat by about 633 acres compared
to current conditions, from 18 percent to 14 percent of modeled habitat in the Travel Plan Area.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would have no direct effect on flammulated owl habitat since, as with other
alternatives, no new roads or trails would be constructed and no habitat components would be
lost as a result. The area subject to indirect effects on flammulated owls would be the least of
any alternative. The roadside area susceptible to snag depletion by firewood cutting in
flammulated owl habitat would drop from 3,565 acres to 2,110 acres, from 18 percent to 10
percent of modeled habitat in the Travel Plan Area.

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition to
proposed Travel Management, that may affect flammulated owl habitat. The scope of the
analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and
immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County, Municipal and BLM). Effects described in
this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Past timber harvest throughout the Divide landscape, has removed substantial acreages of
mature and old-growth forest in which large-diameter conifer snags were prominent
components. Timber harvest projects that have had this effect in potential flammulated owl
habitat, to one degree or another, include: Mike Renig Gulch–Hahn Creek, Slate Creek,
Deadman, Strawberry, Corral Gulch, Buffalo Creek, Mullan Pass and Treasure Mountain, among
others. Overall, these projects have depleted suitable flammulated owl habitat.
A few recent timber harvest and thinning projects have emphasized retaining large trees in
open-grown stands and allowing them to continue to grow in a forest configurations less likely
to succumb to stand-replacing fire (Sweeney Creek, Tucker-Dry, Clancy-Unionville). Over the
long-term, these projects benefit flammulated owl habitat. The MacDonald Pass Ski Trail Hazard
Tree Removal Project has removed a substantial number of mature trees, but all were dead and
the area is not in flammulated owl habitat. Portions of the Forestwide Roadside Hazard Tree

Removal Project have been in mature ponderosa pine and may have resulted in limited increase
in potential flammulated owl habitat (although most surviving trees will not be ponderosa pine).
None of the ongoing Red Mountain Flume Chessman Reservoir project is in flammulated owl
habitat.
The ongoing Helena NF firewood policy that allows members of the public to take up to 10 cords
of dead wood within reach of Forest roads continues to result in the removal of most large
snags from the road corridors.

Past and Ongoing Actions on Adjacent NonForest Lands

Recent and ongoing private land development (building construction, clearing, thinning,
commercial timber harvest, dead tree salvage) has variable effects. Traditional clearcut logging
and overstory removal eliminate potential habitat for flammulated owls; thinning projects,
many of them aimed at reducing fuel loading for fire protection, are generally beneficial. Some
recent timber harvest on BLM lands (notably in the Sheep Mountain area) have opened up
dense ponderosa pine stands, allowing them to develop in more open formations that will
eventually be suitable for flammulated owls. Portions of the Red Mountain Flume corridor from
which dead trees have been removed on private land are not in flammulated owl habitat.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect flammulated owls to one degree or
another include the salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle epidemic
and that will remove numerous large dead trees, some of which could be of use to flammulated
owls. On the other hand, those projects that retain mature trees in open-grown formations are
likely to benefit the birds over the long-term. The Clancy-Unionville project was originally
designed to achieve this forest formation, but extensive beetle kill has required its prescriptions
be altered to create more open environments with fewer large trees (many of them now dead):
So, this project will be of substantially less benefit than originally intended, at least in the shortterm. Both the Telegraph Creek and Tenmile South Helena projects intend to remove dead
trees from mature forest over several thousand acres, in some cases resulting in open-grown
stands of large residual trees. The bulk of these trees in the upper Telegraph and Tenmile
drainages will be in lodgepole pine dominated forests (not flammulated owl habitat); but many
areas lower in Tenmile Creek and in the region south of Helena are in ponderosa pine/Douglasfir forest and some of these stands have potential as flammulated owl habitat. Since most trees
removed from these stands will be smaller understory trees, the key components of owl habitat
will remain intact and the more open stand structure should improve foraging opportunity.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that could affect
flammulated owl habitat includes settlement and associated development of private lands,
often clearing that involves removal of large trees and clearcut/overstory removal timber
harvest and removal of large beetle-killed dead trees.

Summary and Conclusions
Flammulated owls are not deterred from nesting near open roads. Removal of dead trees from
the road corridor by firewood cutters is unlikely to have any measurable impact on flammulated
owl occupancy of the landscape in any alternative: The area of suitable habitat traversed by

open roads is relatively modest and the number of large potential nesting snags (ponderosa
pine) in the corridor is small.
Alternative 1 would retain 49 miles of open road in potential flammulated owl habitat.
Alternative 2 would reduce open road in potential flammulated owl habitat to about 44 miles.
Alternative 3 would reduce open road in potential flammulated owl habitat to 40 miles.
Alternative 4 would also reduce open road in potential flammulated owl habitat to 40 miles.
Alternative 5 would reduce open road in flammulated owl habitat from 49 miles to 29 miles.

Management Indicator Species
Pileated Woodpecker (Old-Growth Dependent Group)
Common Effects of Travel Management

Direct effects associated with the road/trail system arise almost entirely from the loss of
components used by pileated woodpeckers as a result of road construction. Since road/trail
construction is not part of the Divide Travel Plan, few, if any, direct effects would result.
Another potential direct effect of road construction is habitat fragmentation. Rosenberg and
Raphael (2000) found that pileated woodpeckers are associated with forest edges but are
moderately intolerant of small forest islands. The association of pileated woodpeckers with
edge, however, is based on studies of the juxtaposition of mature forest and clearcuts, not the
narrow strip-edges created by Forest roads. These strips do not really create isolated “islands”
of forest habitat and as a result, the “fragmentation” effect of Forest roads should have little or
no influence on pileated woodpecker habitat use patterns; nor are the road edges likely to be
substantial enough to attract woodpeckers. The effect would be identical for all four
alternatives, since it would apply to both open and closed roads.

Virtually all potential effects emerging from the four proposed alternatives would be indirect, a
result of human use of the road system: Road-generated mortality, displacement of
woodpeckers from roadside habitat and loss of roadside snags to firewood cutting. The
potential for vehicle-generated mortality on Forest roads, from birds being hit by or shot from
vehicles, is extremely low (no such incidents ever having been reported on the Forest). So, I
have discounted this as a meaningful effect.
Research has not demonstrated that pileated woodpeckers avoid otherwise suitable nesting
habitat because of the presence of Forest roads, but intuitively, it seems a real possibility, at
least in areas immediately adjacent to regularly-used roads. In general, foraging woodpeckers
do not appear averse to making use of habitat near open roads if large dead trees are present
there [personal observation]. But none of this has been studied in enough detail to be
quantified. Vehicle traffic, with its associated noise, vibration and visual disruption, is the
primary problem (Forman et al. 2003) and the degree to which pileated woodpeckers may avoid
nesting near roadside habitat is undoubtedly a function of the volume and regularity of vehicle
use.
The primary indirect effect generated by all four action alternatives would result from the loss of
large dead trees in the road corridor to firewood cutting or to Forest Service roadside hazard
tree removal projects. Large diameter dead and dying trees are key habitat components for
pileated woodpeckers in whatever forest configuration they occur. Mountain pine beetles are
in the process of producing numerous large snags within reach of Forest roads throughout

WILDLIFE - 483

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Divide pine forests. The larger snags preferred by pileated woodpeckers for nesting and
roosting (preferably greater than 30 inches diameter-at-breast-height) occur almost entirely in
ponderosa pine stands; they are highly unlikely in lodgepole pine forests. Some may be found in
whitebark pine forests, but few, if any of these stands provide pileated woodpecker habitat or
are traversed by open Forest roads.
Table 118 provides an estimate of the maximum zone available to wood cutters along open
roads in mapped pileated woodpecker habitat. It is an over-estimation of the area susceptible
to regular snag loss, since the pileated woodpecker habitat model used in Table 118 accounts
for several forest types, while only the ponderosa pine segment will be producing significant
numbers of large snags in the near future. As well, in many areas, the actual access zone is
much narrower than 600 feet, because of subirrigated ground, steep slopes and other difficult
terrain. The table does provide a means, however, of roughly quantifying differences between
alternatives as the indirect effects on woodpecker habitat.

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Road proposals in this alternative (which would maintain the current 147 miles of open road in
pileated woodpecker habitat) would create no new opportunities for removal of large snags
from the road corridor. Snag loss to firewood cutting and under the Helena NF hazard tree
removal program will increase in the near future because of the proliferation of dead trees
generated by ongoing bark beetle infestations. No increase, however, would result from
implementation of this alternative.

Effects of Alternative 2
As with alternative 1, alternative 2 would produce no direct effects on pileated woodpeckers as
a result of new road construction, since none is proposed. Edge effects from open and closed
roads would be identical to those under alternative 1 and they would be negligible. Road and
trail proposals in this alternative would reduce the maximum roadside area available to snag
depletion by firewood cutters in pileated woodpecker habitat by about 850 acres.

Effects of Alternative 3
As with alternatives 1 and 2, this alternative would generate no problems for pileated
woodpeckers as a result of new road construction, since none is proposed. Road associated
edge effects would be identical to those under alternatives 1 and 2 and they would be
negligible. Road and trail proposals in alternative 3 would reduce the maximum roadside area
susceptible to snag depletion by firewood cutters in pileated woodpecker habitat by roughly
1,790 acres compared to current conditions.

WILDLIFE - 484

Environmental Impact Statement

Effects of Alternative 4
As with alternatives 1, 2 and 3, alternative 4 would create no problems for pileated
woodpeckers as a result of habitat components being lost to road construction, since none is
proposed. Road associated edge effects would be identical to those under previous alternatives
and they would be negligible. Alternative 4 is similar to alternative 3 in terms of its indirect
effect on potential pileated woodpecker habitat, reducing the roadside area susceptible to snag
depletion from firewood cutting by roughly 1,622 acres compared to current conditions.

Effects of Alternative 5
As with previous alternatives, alternative 5 would not reduce pileated woodpecker habitat via
new road construction, since none is proposed. Edge effects associated with roads (open and
closed) would be the same as in the other four alternatives and they would be negligible.
Alternative 5 would close the most open road and thus would have the least indirect effect on
potential pileated woodpecker habitat, reducing the roadside area susceptible to snag depletion
from firewood cutting by roughly 4,388 acres compared to current conditions.

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition
to proposed Travel Management, that may affect pileated woodpeckers and their habitat
components. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with nonForest inholdings) and immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County, Municipal and
BLM). Effects described in this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Past timber harvest in the Divide landscape, has removed a substantial acreage of mature and
old-growth forest in which large-diameter conifers were prominent components. Timber
harvest projects that have had this effect in pileated woodpecker habitat, to one degree or
another, include: Bison Mountain, Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek,
Deadman, Strawberry, Corral Gulch, Buffalo Creek, Mullan Pass and Treasure Mountain, among
others. Overall, these projects have depleted suitable pileated woodpecker habitat.

A few recent timber harvest and thinning projects have emphasized retaining large trees in
open-grown stands and allowing them to continue to grow in a forest configurations less likely
to succumb to stand-replacing fire (Sweeney Creek, Tucker-Dry). Over the long-term, these
projects benefit pileated woodpecker habitat. The Clancy-Unionville project was originally
designed to achieve this forest formation in a number of mature stands, but extensive beetle kill
has required its prescriptions be altered to create more open environments with fewer large
trees (many of them now dead): So, this project is having a mixed effect. The Forestwide
Roadside Hazard Tree project, the MacDonald Pass Ski Trail Hazard Tree Removal project and
the Red Mountain Flume Chessman Reservoir project have removed substantial numbers of
dead trees, a few of them large enough to accommodate pileated woodpecker nesting and
many large enough to provide foraging substrate.
The ongoing Helena NF firewood policy that allows members of the public to take up to 10 cords
of dead wood within reach of Forest roads continues to result in the removal of most large
snags and intact logs from the road corridors.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect pileated woodpeckers to
one degree or another include salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle
epidemic by removing substantial numbers of large dead trees that could be of use to pileated
woodpeckers. On the other hand, those projects that retain mature trees in open-grown
formations are likely to benefit the birds over the long-term. Most prominent among these are
the proposed Telegraph Creek and Tenmile South Helena projects.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that could affect pileated
woodpeckers includes settlement and associated development of private lands, often clearing
that involves removal of large trees and clearcut/overstory removal timber harvest and removal
of large beetle-killed dead trees.

Summary and Conclusions
Differences between alternatives, in terms of road corridor available to firewood cutting, would
not be large enough to show up as differences in the ability of pileated woodpeckers to occupy
the landscape. Potential nesting trees (ponderosa pine snags greater than 25 inch diameter- atbreast-height) that might be removed are rare in the road corridor and given the proliferation of
beetle-killed trees in pine forests across the landscape, nesting habitat will be less limiting than
in the past regardless of the alternative selected here.
Under alternative 1, open roads available to firewood cutters in pileated woodpecker habitat
would remain at 147 miles. This mileage would decline to 136 miles in alternative 2, 123 miles
in alternative 3, 125 miles in alternative 4 and 87 miles in alternative 5.

Northern Goshawk (Old-Growth Dependent Group)
Common Effects of Travel Management
Direct Effects
Direct effects on goshawk habitat would include removal of mature forest cover that could
prove useful as nesting habitat during road construction. While such habitat loss poses a
peripheral threat to goshawks, most significant impacts derive from large-scale phenomena
such as large commercial logging operations and fire, not road construction. Since no
alternatives in the Divide Travel Plan contemplate new road construction, even this relatively
minor impact does not apply in this case. Human activity associated with road construction in
summer also has potential to displace goshawks from active nests that were adequately
buffered from human intrusion when they were established in the spring.

Indirect Effects
Indirectly, roads negatively impact goshawk habitat through the associated human activity.
Goshawks are sensitive to human presence near nests and can be very aggressive in defending

Environmental Impact Statement

both the nest and the larger area within which newly fledged young are operating, the postfledging family area (PFA). Goshawks nesting in areas near established roads show a tolerance
of existing conditions: primary problems arise from construction of new roads into previously
undisturbed goshawk nesting sites and PFAs, an eventuality not proposed in any of these
alternatives. Opening closed roads to new motorized uses may also create problems for
goshawks nesting in the area and a few such proposals are spread through the action
alternatives. Human presence in potential foraging areas (including a variety of conifer forest
formations, aspen stands and forest/grassland edges) is less problematic. Goshawks have
frequently been observed killing and feeding on prey near roads, dwellings and developed
recreation sites (although they will temporarily abandon the feeding site if humans approach
too closely).
Other indirect effects associated with roads are removal of large snags in the road corridor by
firewood cutters and as is now occurring, by the Helena NF roadside hazard tree crews. Dead
trees provide habitat for cavity nesters, a number of which serve as prey for goshawks.
Reynolds et al. (1991) considered snags to be a primary component of goshawk nesting and
foraging habitat and included them in guidelines for optimal goshawk home ranges.
Table 119 summarizes the maximum potential area susceptible to snag removal along open
roads. The numbers undoubtedly overestimate the potential area for snag loss since much of
the 600 ft roadside corridor is in rough terrain or other country that prohibits firewood cutters
from moving more than a short distance off the road and that also discourages goshawk nesting.
The table does present a mechanism, however, for quantifying and comparing the impacts of
the four different alternatives.

Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Alternative 1 would retain the existing condition. There would be no direct effects on goshawks
since there would be no new road construction tied to implementation of the alternative. As a
result, there would be no increased potential for indirect effects resulting from removal of large
snags. Snag loss to firewood cutting and the proposed Helena NF hazard tree program will
increase in the near future because of the proliferation of dead trees generated by ongoing bark

beetle infestations. This increase, however, would not result from implementation of
alternative 1.

Effects of Alternative 2
There would be no direct effects on goshawks since no new road construction is proposed in
alternative 2. Road proposals in this alternative would reduce the roadside area available to
snag depletion by firewood cutters in goshawk foraging habitat by about 995 acres. In nesting
habitat, the potential snag loss zone increases slightly, by about 15 acres. Alternative 2 would
open currently closed road/trail systems that pass through, at least partly, mature forest habitat
during the goshawk nesting season in the upper Telegraph, Negro Mountain and Slate Lake
areas. On the other hand, it would impose motorized closures on forested road/trail systems in
the Negro Mountain, Sweeney Creek, Priest Pass and Black Mountain areas that could relieve
pressure on nesting goshawks. So, the two sets of actions come close to balancing out.

Effects of Alternative 3
There would be no direct effects on goshawks since alternative 3 promotes no new road
construction. Road closures in alternative 3 would reduce the roadside area susceptible to snag
depletion by firewood cutters in goshawk foraging habitat by about 2,420 acres and in nesting
habitat by about seven acres. Alternative 3 would not introduce motorized use into any
currently closed road/trail system and would therefore not increase potential disturbance of
nesting goshawks. It would close currently open road/trail systems that pass through potential
goshawk nesting habitat in the Negro Mountain, Sweeney Creek, Priest Pass, Black Mountain,
Spotted Dog and Kading areas and thus lower the possibility of motorized disturbance.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would have no direct effects on goshawks as no new road construction is
proposed. With regard to indirect effects, alternative 4 is very similar to alternative 3: Road
closures would reduce the roadside area susceptible to snag depletion from firewood cutting in
goshawk foraging habitat by about 2,327 acres and would retain the current acreage in nesting
habitat. Alternative 4 would impose motorized closures on currently open forested roads and
trails in the Negro Mountain, Sweeney Creek, Priest Pass, Black Mountain and Kading areas
during the goshawk nesting season. It would provide somewhat less relief from potential
disturbance of nesting goshawks than alternative 3; but it would not increase the existing
potential for disturbance in any area.

Effects of Alternative 5
There would be no direct effects on goshawks since alternative 5 promotes no new road
construction. Road closures in alternative 5 would reduce the roadside area susceptible to snag
depletion by firewood cutters in goshawk foraging habitat by about 5,744 acres and in nesting
habitat by about 89 acres. Alternative 5 would sanction motorized use in currently closed
road/motor trail systems in upper Ontario Creek, upper Slate Creek and upper Elliston Creek. It
would close currently open road/trail systems that pass through potential goshawk nesting
habitat in the Negro Mountain, Jericho Mountain, Sweeney Creek, Priest Pass, Sawmill Gulch,
Esmeralda Hill, Greenhorn Mountain, Black Mountain, Spotted Dog and Kading areas. Overall,
alternative 5 would decrease potential for disturbance of nesting goshawks more than any other
alternative.

Cumulative Effects

This summary of cumulative effects is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which
identifies all past, present and reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition
to proposed Travel Management, that may affect goshawks and their habitat. The scope of the
analysis includes the Divide landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and
immediately surrounding lands (private, State, County, Municipal and BLM). Effects described in
this summary are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Past timber harvest in the Divide landscape (mostly by clearcutting), has removed thousands of
acres of mature and old-growth forest over the last 30 years, much of which provided nesting
and foraging habitat for goshawks. Timber harvest projects that have had this effect, to one
degree or another, include: Bison Mountain, Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate
Creek, Deadman, Strawberry, Corral Gulch, Buffalo Creek, Mullan Pass and Treasure Mountain.
For the short- and mid-term, these projects have depleted suitable goshawk habitat.

A few recent timber harvest and thinning projects have emphasized retaining large trees in
open-grown stands and allowing them to continue to grow in a forest configurations less likely
to succumb to stand-replacing fire (Sweeney Creek, Tucker-Dry). These projects eliminate
goshawk nesting habitat but retain foraging habitat. The ongoing Clancy-Unionville project in
the Lump Gulch, Quartz Creek and Buffalo Creek drainages, originally designed to produce opengrown foraging habitat, will no longer be able to achieve this end because of intense insectgenerated tree mortality. This project will now have a mixed effect depending on the
representation of Douglas-fir, which is not susceptible to the pine beetles. Projects designed
primarily to remove dead beetle-killed trees have lowered, somewhat, the suitability of
potential goshawk foraging habitat, but have not influenced nesting stands, as the beetleinduced defoliation has already eliminated nesting potential. These projects include the
Forestwide Roadside Hazard Tree Removal Project., the MacDonald Pass ski trail hazard tree
project and a number of tree removal operations in campgrounds, picnic areas and other
developed recreational sites.
The ongoing Helena NF firewood policy that allows members of the public to take up to 10 cords
of dead wood within reach of Forest roads continues to result in the removal of most large
snags and intact logs from the road corridors.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Recent and ongoing private land development (building construction, clearing, thinning, timber
harvest, dead tree salvage) has variable effects. Traditional clearcut logging and overstory
removal, eliminate potential goshawk habitat; thinning projects, many of them aimed at
reducing fuel loading for fire protection, may retain foraging habitat over the long-term.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect goshawks to one degree
or another include salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle epidemic,
which will remove substantial numbers of large dead trees that could continue as components
of goshawk foraging habitat. The effect, as related to the salvage cutting, will be of short
duration, since the dead trees will fall of their own accord within a few years, reducing the
suitability of the habitat for goshawks. Any of these projects that are able to retain mature
WILDLIFE - 489

Environmental Impact Statement

trees in open-grown formations are likely to retain long-term foraging habitat. Current dead
tree harvest proposals include the Telegraph Creek and the Red Mountain Flume-Chessman
Reservoir projects.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that could affect goshawks
includes continuing timber harvest on private, State and BLM lands, dominated by thinning for
fire protection and salvage of beetle-killed dead trees.

Summary and Conclusions
Effects under all alternatives would be indirect and rather insubstantial, arising from loss of
snags and woody debris in the road corridor to firewood gatherers. This would represent a loss
of habitat structure for potential prey species. Differences between alternatives are insufficient
to be reflected in different levels of local goshawk occupancy.
Alternative 1 would retain 4.1 miles of open road in goshawk nesting habitat and 195 miles in
foraging habitat. Alternative 2 would maintain 4.3 miles of open road in goshawk nesting
habitat and 181 miles in foraging habitat. Alternative 3 would maintain 4.0 miles of open road
in goshawk nesting habitat and 163 miles in foraging habitat. Alternative 4 would maintain 4.1
miles of open road in goshawk nesting habitat and 163 miles in foraging habitat. Alternative 5
would mould maintain 2.9 miles of open road in goshawk nesting habitat and 116 miles in
foraging habitat.

Hairy Woodpecker (Snag-Dependent Species)
Common Effects of Travel Management

Hairy woodpeckers are directly impacted by the road/trail system when new road construction
eliminates key habitat components, namely, dead, dying and other insect-prone trees. Since
none of the Divide Travel Plan alternatives contemplate construction of new motorized routes,
there will be no direct effects from this source.
All effects under proposed alternatives are indirect. Dead trees in the open road corridors will
be lost to firewood cutting and to roadside hazard tree removal by Forest Service crews. Bark
beetle infestations are in the process of producing an abundance of snags within reach of Forest
roads throughout Divide pine forests. For hairy woodpeckers, already relatively common in the
landscape, this is an expansive habitat opportunity throughout all pine forests at all elevations
and these birds are likely to proliferate over the next 15 to 20 years.

Table 120 estimates the acreage of roadside corridors available to firewood cutters in two
delineations of hairy woodpecker habitat: (1) optimal nesting habitat, as estimated by the
Region 1 habitat model and (2) mature forest habitat in general. The Region 1 model presents a
more narrow construct of hairy woodpecker habitat, focusing on mature forest stands
(overstory trees greater than 10 inches diameter-at-breast-height) of sparse/ intermediate
density (less than 50 percent canopy closure) with numerous dead trees (at pre-beetle outbreak
levels). Stands of this sort provide ideal nesting and foraging habitat for hairy woodpeckers.
However, the model appreciably underestimates the reach of suitable hairy woodpecker habitat
in the Divide landscape. In fact, hairy woodpeckers appear in virtually all forested habitats on
the Helena NF other than seedling/sapling stands devoid of residual snags. Although they are
most common in environments with a plethora of dead and dying trees, they are often seen in
stands that appear relatively healthy, as long as enough insect-supporting trees are present.

They also forage in stands dominated by pole-sized trees, although they may be unable to nest
there. As bark beetle infestation continues, much of the general “mature forest habitat” tallied
in Table 120 will convert to “optimal habitat” [the optimal habitat in this table representing prebeetle circumstances].

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
There would be no direct effect on hairy woodpeckers since no new road or trail construction is
proposed in this alternative and no snag habitat would usurped by direct actions connected with
maintaining the status quo.
Road and trail proposals in this alternative (which maintain the status quo) would generate no
new potential for removal of large snags. Snag removal by firewood cutters and under the
proposed Helena NF hazard tree removal program will increase along existing open roads in the
near future because of the proliferation of dead trees generated by the ongoing bark beetle
infestation. This increase, however, will not result from implementation of this alternative.

Effects of Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would generate no direct effects on hairy woodpeckers as no new roads or trails
are proposed. Proposals in this alternative would reduce the roadside area susceptible to snag
depletion by firewood cutting in modeled hairy woodpecker habitat by about 165 acres and in
mature forested habitat in general by about 2,400 acres. This would be an indirect effect.

Effects of Alternative 3
There would be no direct effects on hairy woodpeckers since no new road or trail construction is
proposed in alternative 3. Road and trail proposals in alternative 3 would reduce the current
roadside area susceptible to snag depletion by firewood cutters by about 515 acres in modeled
hairy woodpecker habitat and by about 4,330 acres in mature forest habitat in general.

Effects of Alternative 4
Alternative 4 would generate no direct effects on hairy woodpeckers since no new road or trail
construction is proposed. Reduction in the area susceptible to snag depletion by firewood
cutters would be somewhere between that provided by alternative 2 and alternative 3: A
decline of about 459 acres in modeled hairy woodpecker habitat and about 4,209 acres in

Effects of Alternative 5
There would be no direct effects on hairy woodpeckers since no new road or trail construction is
proposed in alternative 5. Road and trail proposals in alternative 5 would reduce the current
roadside area susceptible to snag depletion by firewood cutters by about 1,259 acres in
modeled hairy woodpecker habitat and by about 9,082 acres in mature forest habitat in general.

Cumulative Effects

This summary is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which identifies past, present and
reasonably foreseeable projects and other activities, in addition to travel management, that may
affect hairy woodpecker habitat components. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide
landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and adjacent lands (private, State,
County, Municipal and BLM). Effects described are common to all alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Timber harvest over the past 30 years, primarily via clearcutting and other regeneration harvest
methods, has removed substantial acreages of hairy woodpecker habitat. Residual snags in
some of these areas have continued to support woodpeckers, but, overall, the habitat quality
has declined. Timber projects that have had this effect include: Bison Mountain, Ontario Creek,
Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate Creek, Deadman, Strawberry, Corral Gulch, Buffalo Creek,
Mullan Pass and Treasure Mountain, among others.

A few recent timber harvest and thinning projects have emphasized retaining large trees, as well
as snags, in open-grown stands and allowing them to continue to grow in forest formations less
likely to succumb to stand-replacing fire (Sweeney Creek, Tucker-Dry). Over the long-term, these
projects benefit hairy woodpeckers. The recent Clancy-Unionville project in the Lump Gulch,
Quartz Creek and Buffalo Creek drainages, originally designed to harvest green trees, is now
focused primarily on removing dead trees. Although much hairy woodpecker habitat will
remain, the result will be considerably less favorable to them than the original pre-beetle vision.
Recent and ongoing activities on the National Forest that have improved prospects for snags
and consequent habitat opportunity for hairy woodpeckers are the road closures associated
with a number of timber harvest projects (Clancy-Unionville, Sound Wood, Mullan Pass,
Treasure Mountain, Lava Mountain), which limit roadside firewood cutting. These projects have
all adhered to Forest Plan standards for retaining snags and replacement snags. In some cases,
decisions not to pursue potential salvage opportunities (Jericho Mountain, Snowshoe Creek,
MacDonald Pass burn) have resulted in retention of large blocks of snags.
A number of projects have removed substantial numbers of beetle killed trees, thus locally
reducing nesting and foraging habitat for hairy woodpeckers. These include the Forestwide
Roadside Hazard Tree Removal project, the Red Mountain Flume Chessman Reservoir project,
the MacDonald Pass Ski Trail Hazard Tree project (in productive forest habitat just below the
Divide) and a number of tree removal operations scheduled for campgrounds, picnic areas and
other developed recreation sites (areas used by hairy woodpeckers).
Recent Carbaryl spraying of campgrounds and other administrative sites (Cromwell Dixon
campground, MacDonald Pass trailhead) has been intended to prevent large trees from dying in
areas of concentrated public use. This enterprise has met with limited success and thus has not
been a major factor in suppressing snag creation.

WILDLIFE - 492

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The ongoing policy of allowing public firewood cutting on the National Forest is the primary
factor driving the removal of most large snags from Forest road corridors. Ongoing efforts by the
Helena NF to limit the potential safety hazard posed by large numbers of dead trees in areas
frequented by the public have accelerated the process of snag loss in road corridors and other
accessible sites. These actions have also reduced the number of snags available to firewood
cutters. Hazard tree removal projects have recently been completed or are going forward at a
number of campgrounds (Cromwell Dixon, Moose Creek, Kading, Park Lake), day-use areas
(Moose Creek, MacDonald Pass), trailheads (MacDonald Pass CDNST), administrative sites
(Moose Creek ranger station, Kading cabin), as well as along open Forest roads.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Recent and ongoing private land development, particularly clearing, thinning, commercial
timber harvest and dead tree salvage has had variable effects. Traditional clearcut logging and
overstory removal, eliminate most habitat components for hairy woodpeckers; thinning
projects, many aimed at reducing fuel loading for fire protection, preserve some habitat, but
generally lower suitability because of the elimination of dead and dying trees.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

The most prominent foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect hairy
woodpeckers to one degree or another are salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing
bark beetle epidemic, removing substantial numbers of dead trees that could be of useful
habitat components. On the other hand, those projects that retain mature trees in open-grown
formations are likely to benefit the woodpeckers over the long-term. Current proposals include
the Telegraph Creek project (which involves both removal of beetle-killed mature trees and the
precommercial thinning of sapling conifers in old clearcuts) and the Tenmile South Helena
project (which involves cutting dead trees, prescribed burning of dead trees, deadfall and
thinning from below in green stands).

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that could affect hairy
woodpeckers includes settlement and associated development of private lands that involves
timber harvest and removal of beetle-killed dead trees.

Summary and Conclusions
The only effects on hairy woodpeckers would be indirect, resulting from removal of dead trees
from the road corridors by firewood cutters. Given the vast acreage of snags being created by
bark beetles across the landscape, losses in the road corridor would be insignificant and
differences between alternatives, in terms of woodpecker numbers, would be undetectable.
Alternative 1 would retain 43 miles of open road in optimal hairy woodpecker habitat and 294
miles in mature forested habitat that the woodpeckers may also use. Alternative 2 would
maintain 41 miles of open road in optimal hairy woodpecker habitat and 260 miles in mature
forested habitat. Alternative 3 would maintain 36 miles of open road in optimal hairy
woodpecker habitat and 233 miles in mature forested habitat. Alternative 4 would maintain 37
miles of open road in optimal hairy woodpecker habitat and 235 miles in mature forested
habitat. Alternative 5 would maintain 26 miles of open road in optimal hairy woodpecker
habitat and 168 miles in mature forest habitat.

Marten (Mature Forest Dependent Species)
Common Effects of Travel Management

Indirectly, roads negatively impact marten habitat by providing access routes for firewood
cutters, who remove snags and logs. Snags and coarse woody debris (stumps, logs and large
woody fragments) provide critical habitat components for marten foraging, resting and denning
(Spencer 1987; Buskirk et al. 1989; Coffin 1994).

Roads also facilitate trapping. Trapping affects marten populations by altering sex and age
structure (disproportionately capturing juveniles and males) and by lowering local population
density (Hodgman et al. 1994). In some drainages marten can be completely eliminated (at
least in the short-term) by persistent trapping. Roads in forested areas increase trapping
pressure on marten and result in higher capture rates in roaded versus unroaded areas.
Thompson (1994) found that the increased impacts of trapping in logged sites as opposed to
unlogged areas were a direct result of the higher road densities generated by logging operations
(and the access provided primarily to trappers on snowmobiles).
Table 121 summarizes miles of road in marten habitat that may contribute to dead tree/log
removal and to trapping, an indirect effect. These are maximum areas: substantial portions of
the 600-feet corridors are actually inaccessible to firewood cutters or are not seen as profitable
locations by trappers.

Comparison of Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1 (Existing Condition)
Maintaining the status quo under alternative 1 would have no direct effect on marten habitat
since there would be no mandate to construct new road. Likewise, there would be no increase
in the potential for indirect effects resulting from removal of large snags. Snag removal in the
road corridors by firewood cutters and under the proposed Helena NF hazard tree removal
program will increase in the near future because of the proliferation of dead trees generated by
ongoing bark beetle infestations. This increase, however, is not a function of this alternative.

Effects of Alternative 2
There would be no direct effects on marten since no new road or trail construction that would
eliminate marten habitat is part of alternative 2. Road and trail proposals in this alternative
would reduce the roadside area available to snag depletion by firewood cutters in marten
habitat by about 2,400 acres.

Effects of Alternative 3
There would be no direct effects on marten since no new road or trail construction is part of this
alternative. Road and trail proposals in alternative 3 would reduce the roadside area susceptible

Environmental Impact Statement

to snag depletion by firewood cutters in marten habitat by about 4,330 acres compared to
current conditions.

Effects of Alternative 4
As with other action alternatives, alternative 4 would generate no direct effects on marten since
it would involve no new road or trail construction. Road and trail proposals in alternative 4
would reduce the roadside area susceptible to snag depletion by firewood cutters in marten
habitat by about 4,210 acres compared to current conditions.

Effects of Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would also generate no direct effects on marten habitat since it would involve no
new road or trail construction. Road and trail proposals in alternative 5 would reduce the
roadside area susceptible to snag depletion by firewood cutters in marten habitat by about
9,080 acres compared to current conditions, substantially more than any other alternative.

Cumulative Effects

This summary is based on the detailed matrix in appendix B, which identifies all past, present
and reasonably foreseeable projects and activities, in addition to proposed Travel Management,
that may affect marten and marten habitat. The scope of the analysis includes the Divide
landscape (Helena NF land with non-Forest inholdings) and immediately surrounding lands
(private, State, County, Municipal and BLM). Effects described here are common to all
alternatives.

Forest Service Past and Ongoing Activities

Past timber harvest throughout the Divide landscape, has removed substantial acreages of
mature and old-growth forest capable of providing primary marten habitat, particularly projects
that have intruded into riparian forest. Timber harvest projects that have had this effect, to one
degree or another, include: Bison Mountain, Ontario Creek, Mike Renig Gulch-Hahn Creek, Slate
Creek, Deadman, Strawberry, Corral Gulch, Buffalo Creek, Sound Wood and Treasure Mountain,
among others.
Primary actions that have locally reduced the effectiveness of potential marten habitat by
providing access for trappers and firewood cutters include retention of groomed snowmobile
trails and roads passing through forested riparian habitat.
Actions that have improved prospects for marten include: Closure of Inventoried Roadless
Areas to snowmobile use (Electric Peak, Lazyman Gulch); trail relocation projects that have
removed trails from productive riparian areas to upslope locations (Blackfoot Meadows,
CDNST); establishment of the Statewide OHV Plan, which prohibits riding off established motor
routes; road and motor trail closures associated with timber harvest projects (Clancy-Unionville,
Sound Wood, Mullan Pass, Treasure Mountain) that have measurably expanded blocks of nonmotorized habitat.
The impact of recent projects to remove dead trees (and future coarse woody debris) from
potential marten habitat is unclear and depends on the degree to which marten are willing to
make use of deadfall accumulations in the absence of overhead canopy. If they use these areas
of open woody debris, then the projects have removed suitable habitat; if not, then the projects
have probably had little effect. These projects include the Roadside Hazard Tree Removal,
MacDonald Pass Ski Trails, Clancy-Unionville and Red Mountain Flume Chessman Reservoir

WILDLIFE - 495

Environmental Impact Statement

projects. Operations that have removed dead trees from developed recreation and
administrative sites have probably had little effect, since they have generally been unsuitable as
marten habitat.

Adjacent Private and Other, Past and Ongoing Actions

Recent and ongoing private land development (building construction, clearing, thinning,
commercial timber harvest, dead tree salvage) will continue to impact potential marten habitat,
particularly where it occurs in forested riparian areas. Actions that reduce key habitat
components, large snags and logs and overhead cover, could have an effect.

Forest Service Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Reasonably foreseeable activities on Helena NF land that could affect marten to one degree or
another include salvage projects designed to deal with the ongoing bark beetle epidemic which,
if implemented, will remove substantial numbers of large dead trees that could be of use to
marten. As noted above, the degree to which such efforts affect marten is dependent upon
how willing the animals are to make use of uncanopied accumulations of coarse woody debris.
Prominent among foreseeable projects are the Telegraph Creek and Tenmile South Helena
projects.
In addition, travel planning efforts underway on adjacent Forests, as well as the Lincoln Ranger
District on the Helena NF, could be beneficial to marten if they provide local sanctuaries free
from motorized access. Because marten are capable of traveling some distance, better habitat
conditions on other Forests could improve marten populations and subsequent dispersal
opportunities to the Helena National Forest. Conversely, travel management decisions
elsewhere could reduce marten populations in those areas and reduce the potential for
emigration/immigration. Travel planning efforts on the Lincoln Ranger District include the
Blackfoot Travel and Blackfoot Winter Travel projects.

Adjacent Private and Other, Reasonably Foreseeable Actions

Future activity on non-Forest land within the cumulative effects area that could affect marten
includes: Settlement and associated development of private lands and timber harvest and
removal of large beetle-killed dead trees.

Summary and Conclusions
Effects on marten stem from removal of snags and woody debris from the road corridor by
firewood cutters and from routes available to trappers on snowmobiles. Given the acreage of
snags being created by bark beetles across the landscape, losses in the road corridor would be
relatively minor and differences between alternatives, in terms of marten numbers, would not
be measurable. Trapper access along established snowmobile routes in marten habitat is much
the same for alternatives 1-4, somewhat less for alternative 5.
Alternative 1 would retain 294 miles of open road in suitable (modeled) marten habitat.
Alternative 2 would maintain 260 miles of open road in suitable marten habitat. Alternative 3
would maintain 233 miles of open road in suitable marten habitat. Alternative 4 would maintain
235 miles of open road in suitable marten habitat. Alternative 5 would reduce open road
mileage in potential marten habitat to 168 miles.

Local Effects in Key Areas
Introduction
Area Selection and Delineation

This section addresses the effects of proposed road and trail management on nine specific sites
in the Divide landscape. Travel management proposals for these areas have generated much
discussion within the Helena NF, between the Forest and the public and between user groups. A
central aspect of the discussion, in many cases, has been the impact of roads and motorized
uses on wildlife and wildlife habitat. The need to accommodate wildlife while allowing for
public access in these “key areas” has driven many of the differences between alternatives.
Proposals for other parts of the Plan Area also differ between alternatives but have generated
less comment and controversy. I have circumscribed key areas by whatever boundaries worked
to pragmatically encompass the reach of the local road and trail systems: administrative
boundaries, section lines, major roads and obvious physical features.

Open Road and Motor Trail Summary

Table 122 summarizes differences between alternatives as to miles of open road and motorized
trail in a number of key local areas. Table 123 then converts the road and trail mileages to
densities. Densities are meant for local comparison among key areas only and not for
determining habitat effectiveness or open road/hiding cover ratios for Forest Plan standards,
which are calculated over larger areas (typically, elk herd units).

Snowmobile Use

With a couple exceptions (most notably Sweeney Creek–Blue Cloud), on-ground snowmobile
use in key habitat areas is the same for all five alternatives. In some areas (Ophir Creek,
Elliston–Slate Creek, Negro Mtn and Ontario–Bison Creek), the categorizations of snowmobile
routes (“designated”, “allowed”, “sanctioned”) vary among alternatives; but the on-ground
pattern of use and the effects generated are essentially the same in all cases. So, I have not
included a detailed accounting of how snowmobile routes in key habitat areas are labeled under
different alternatives. A more comprehensive discussion of snowmobile use patterns and trail
designations can be found in sections that address lynx habitat.

Area Characteristics, Wildlife Issues, Alternative Comparison
Spotted Dog Creek – Baldy Ridge – Kading
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues
This wide-reaching, though often primitive, road/trail network covers the big ridge (Baldy Ridge)
between the Little Blackfoot River road to the east (in the vicinity of Kading campground) and
the upper reaches of Spotted Dog Creek to the west. The segment of the ridge at issue covers
roughly 7,500 acres (down to the drainage bottoms on either side) and supports an established
road/trail network of about 35 miles, in addition to several miles of ephemeral pioneered motor
tracks. The current motor route density 4 (for routes open all or part of the year) is relatively
high at 2.1 mi/mi². Most vehicle traffic is concentrated along the Little Blackfoot River road (a
wide, graded road) around Kading campground on the southeast periphery of the area.
Heaviest use of the road/trail system occurs in the hunting season, although use is often
tempered by inhospitable snow conditions later in the season. Summer use consists of weekend

excursions by ATVs, motor bikes and a few highway vehicles, as well as occasional forays by
grazing permittees, recreational miners, MFWP biologists and Helena NF field personnel.
Baldy Ridge supports extensive dry grassland interspersed with patches of timber, mostly
Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine. More contiguous forest extends down both the east and west
slopes. Broadscale MFWP maps show much of the area as elk “winter range”, a classification
based on elk observations that extend to June 1. In fact, elk have not been observed on the
ridge during the winter in the last three decades for which we have records. Elk typically begin
to move up into the open grasslands in April or early May and remain through the summer and
as much of the fall hunting season as snow depths allow. Since 1995, a series of local wolf packs
that have denned in Spotted Dog Creek have included the Baldy Ridge country as part of their
territories. Likewise, in the last decade, grizzly bears have been reported in this general area,
though rarely and lynx and wolverines have been reported nearby.

Figure 39 - Photo 23. Baldy Ridge

Grassland interspersed with forest along a westward spurs of Baldy Ridge. The primitive fourwheel-drive/OHV route traversing the open grassland here is typical of the Forest road/ motor
trail system on the ridge. This road (#1868) would convert to a motor trail in alternative 2; it
would be closed to wheeled motor vehicles in alternatives 3, 4 and 5.
There is no short, easy route from the Helena area and Highway 12 to the upper reaches of
Baldy Ridge and as a result, human presence has remained relatively spare and fleeting in spite
of high road/trail density. Wildlife objectives are to minimize human disturbance on big game
summer range (including spring calving areas and late summer/early fall rutting sites) and to
retain reasonable security for elk and deer during the hunting season. Maintaining these
characteristics also benefits other species of concern, primarily the large carnivores. The
presence of snowmobiles in winter is not a major concern.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
This alternative would maintain the current network of over 18 miles of open road and seven
miles of motor trail (local open route density equals 2.1 mi/m²). With the exception of a short
section of the Little Blackfoot River Road (#227) on the southeastern flank and portions of Forest
system roads in the Spotted Dog drainage on the west side (#314-j1 and #314-j3), most of the
roads are rough four-wheel-drive routes. The only viable connecting routes from the Spotted
Dog drainage to the west (#314 and #MTR-1868) and along the ridge from the north are closed
from September 1 to May 15, eliminating motorized access from that direction for the entire
hunting season. However, the motor trail system coming up out of the Kading area from the
east provides year-round access for vehicles less than 50 inches wide (although larger fourwheel-drive vehicles sometimes manage to negotiate Trail #501). Most of the area is protected
by a hunting season snowmobile closure. So, between the rough, limited motorized access and
later-season snow conditions, fall elk security in this area is reasonably good and would remain
so with alternative 1.
Primary problems in summer arise from OHVs of all kinds riding off-route across the grasslands
and pioneering new routes through a variety of habitats. While this is not allowed under the
Montana-Dakota Cross-Country Driving regulations (2001), the remoteness of this area makes
enforcement difficult and the situation is likely to continue under alternative 1. In particular,
OHV riders have forged a route that connects the end of road #314-J3 in Spotted Dog with the
road system atop Baldy Ridge. The Spotted Dog road had been gated (and marked as closed
yearlong) until recently, when gates have been left open, allowing the creation of the new usermade trails. Another prominent user-made motor trail extends from the Limburger Springs area
southward to the steep route coming up the Kading Grade (#MTR-502).
The two primary snowmobile routes crossing the area on existing roads and motor trails would
be retained and off-route snowmobiling on those portions of the open ridge not wind-blown
and bare would be allowed after December 1. This use occurs during a period when elk are not
present and bears are not active. Lynx and other winter carnivores may make use of the packed
snowmobile trails, but no negative encounters have been reported and the trails do not appear
to be creating any notable problems for local wildlife.

Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would maintain a local open road/motor trail density of about 1.9 mi/mi²,
somewhat less than alternative 1 and it would make a number of changes in route designations
and seasonal restrictions. The only existing motorized route eliminated would be the trail
running up to the ridgetop from Kading cabin. This would be converted to a foot trail, thereby
eliminating all motorized disturbance on the three mi² southeast slope above the Kading area of
the Little Blackfoot (between trails #MTR-502 and #501).
Several changes apply to the hunting season. Roads in upper Spotted Dog Creek currently
closed during the big game rifle season (#314-J1, #314-J-3) would now be open during that time.
Neither of these routes provides a loop driving opportunity or motorized access to the upper
ridge. All rifle season vehicle access to upper Baldy Ridge would be eliminated under alternative
2: Existing restrictions on roads/trails #MTR-1868, #314 and the #314 connector to the north
would be retained and in addition, the two remaining motor trails coming up from the east side
would be closed to vehicles from October 15 to May 15. In all cases, hunting season vehicle
restrictions would begin on October 15 (just before the big game rifle season), rather than on

WILDLIFE - 501

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

September 1 as with some of the routes now. This would allow ATV and motor bike use to
continue through the fall riding season, although it may interfere with bow hunting opportunity
(beginning September 1) for some hunters. Under alternative 2, the area would be open to
snowmobiles any time snow conditions allow between December 2 and May 15 (although,
typically, snowmobiling conditions deteriorate badly toward the end of March).

Alternative 3
The only local route open to wheeled vehicles that would be retained under this alternative is
the Little Blackfoot River road (#227) north of Kading campground along the eastern edge of the
area. All other motor routes along the Little Blackfoot, on Baldy Ridge and in upper Spotted Dog
Creek would be eliminated or converted to non-motorized uses. The resulting open road/motor
trail density would be 0.1 mi/mi². As in the other three alternatives, existing snowmobile routes
would be retained. But, aside from the snowmobile season (typically early December through
late March), alternative 3 would extend the effective (though not officially designated) reach of
the Electric Peak Roadless area northward across Baldy Ridge for an additional 16 to 17 mi². It
would expand the size of the large elk security area centered in the Roadless Area by roughly
one third. In terms of providing an undisturbed environment for wildland species for much of
the year, this is the most effective of the four alternatives.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3 with regard to motor trails: There would be none. But,
whereas alternative 3 would support only 1.0 mile of open road (along the eastern boundary of
the area, with no motorized access to Baldy Ridge), alternative 4 would provide wheeled
vehicles a driving route up onto the ridge from Spotted Dog Creek via a 6.1 mile segment of
Road #314. The route would be open to wheeled vehicles from mid May to mid October (and
thus closed to them through the big game rifle season and much of the spring). Local open
route density would be 0.7 mi/mi² from late spring though early fall. As with the other
alternatives, the road (along with the ridgetop road) would be open to snowmobiles after
December 1; and while, technically, snowmobiling would be allowed to continue until May 15,
the routes usually become too threadbare for snow machines by the end of March. Baldy Ridge
would thus be devoid of vehicle traffic from late March/early April through mid-May, the key
period when elk and deer are beginning find their way back up to the ridge with spring green-up
and when bears are emerging from hibernation. Alternative 4 is somewhat less effective than
alternative 3 in providing an undisturbed environment for wildlife but considerably more
effective than alternatives 1 and 2.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would drop open road density from the current 1.5 mi/mi² to 0.2 mi/mi², a level
similar to alternative 3 (0.1 mi/mi²). The only roads open to full sized vehicles would be the
Little Blackfoot River Road (#227) to Kading campground and a portion of Road # 314 in Spotted
Dog Creek. The remainder of Road #314 would be converted to motor trail and existing motor
trail #MTR-501 would be retained. This would result in motor trail density (0.7 mi/mi²) smilar to
alternative 1 and would provide motor bikes and ATVs with a route across the ridge from
Spotted Dog Creek to the Little Blackfoot and northward along the ridge toward Irish Mine Hill.
These trails would be open to snowmobiles in winter but would be closed to all vehicles during
the hunting season (Sept. 1 to Dec. 1). Total open route density in summer would be 0.9 mi/mi²,
more than alternative 3, similar to alternative 4 and much less than alternatives 1 and 2.

Divide Travel Plan

This alternative provides for full-sized vehicle access along Baldy Ridge north of Irish Mine Hill,
but allows only ATV and motor bike use south of it. It eliminates all vehicle use south of
Limburger Spring. It also cuts off motorized access along the Little Blackfoot River beyond
Kading campground. The result for wildlife is a zone free from motorized disturbance across this
southern part of Baldy Ridge and a broader non-motorized corridor that connects the ridge with
the Electric Peak Roadless Area to the southeast.

Summary and Conclusions
Alternative 1 would maintain a local open road/motor trail density of about 2.1 mi/mi² in
summer, but with some of these routes closed in hunting season, including the bow season in
September and early October. Existing snowmobile routes would be the same in all alternatives.
Alternative 2 would reduce summer open route density to 1.9 mi/mi². It would also reduce
motorized access to Baldy Ridge during the big game rifle season, although the current bow
season closures would be eliminated.
Compared to alternatives 1 and 2, alternative 3 would dramatically decrease all motorized
access to Baldy Ridge throughout the year (open route density = 0.1 mi/mi²), making it, in
essence, a northward extension of the Electric Peak Roadless Area to the south in spring,
summer and fall.
Alternative 4, with a summer open route density of 0.7 mi/mi² and all routes closed during the
big game rifle season, is closer to alternative 3 than to alternatives 1 and 2.
Alternative 5 eliminates motor routes on Baldy Ridge south of Limburger Spring and converts
most full-sized vehicle routes north of there to motor trails. It thus supports very low open road
density (similar to alternative 3) but fairly high motor trail density (similar to alternative 1).
Wildlife habitat effectiveness would improve with the expansion of the non-motorized area on
the southern part of the ridge next to the Electric Peak Roadless Area Spring and closure of all
motor routes during hunting season.
All five alternatives would contribute to adequate rifle season elk security, but alternative 2
would improve on the status quo and alternatives 3, 4 and 5 more so. Alternative 3 would
provide the best summer habitat effectiveness. Wolves and grizzly bears are sometimes in the
area and alternative 3 would be the best option for insulating these species from human
interference. Alternative 4, with no motor trails and only one ridge road open in summer,
would be very effective in this regard as well, as would alternative 5 with its vehicle-free zone
south of Limburger Spring. Winter snowmobiling should not be a problem for wildlife as long as
current use patterns do not escalate in some unforeseen way.

Negro Mountain
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues
The Negro Mountain road system is bounded by the main stem of the Little Blackfoot River to
the west and northwest, Telegraph Creek to the east and northeast and Treasure Mountain to
the south. Most of the road system is on the Telegraph Creek side of the Negro Mountain
divide. The extensive road network north of Negro Mountain was constructed for the Treasure
Mountain timber sale in the late 1980s and much of it is off-limits to motor vehicles year-round
in order to maintain big game habitat effectiveness and security [as per a 1988 negotiated
appeal settlement]. The remainder of the system to the south and east consists of an
assortment of Forest System roads, open and closed, as well as several user-made routes. This

WILDLIFE - 503

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

adds up to 12.0 miles of Forest system road open at least part of the year and a local open road
density of 1.7 mi/mi². While OHV riders have pioneered a number of transient motor trails
throughout the area, there is only one recognized (numbered) user-made trail (0.7 mile). All
open routes are available to snowmobiles in winter. Most of the road closures in this area are
designed to insulate big game habitat.
Much of the area between the Little Blackfoot River and Telegraph Creek is covered by mature
and early-seral forest, but the Negro Mountain ridge supports a variety of open grassland
habitats ranging from forest openings of a few acres to extensive parks covering hundreds of
acres. Elk migrate up into this cover/forage mosaic in mid-spring, some of them calving here
and a few spending the summer. A number of elk remain in the area through the fall hunting
season, taking advantage of the mosaic of sapling conifers and mature forest around the closed
road system north of Negro Mountain and of thickly forested, vehicle-restricted areas around
Treasure Mountain to the south. Some of these elk may not descend to winter range until well
into December. Elk summer habitat effectiveness and fall security have been primary concerns
in managing this road system at least since the mid 1980s.

Four-wheel-drive roads in open grassland on the Negro Mountain ridge at the junction of Roads
#4100, #1857-B1 and #1857-B3.
More recently, water quality, sedimentation and fish habitat have emerged as key issues.
People have been driving up into the Negro Mountain area for decades to hunt, camp, picnic,
view wildlife, look for minerals and tour the country. Until recently, a through-route was
available from the Little Blackfoot to the Telegraph Creek side via Forest roads #4100 and
#1857-B1 (the Moose Gulch road). Both roads have had problems with persistent erosion on
steep slopes. In 2004, a landowner built a house on an inholding astride the Moose Gulch road
near the top of the gulch, barring vehicle access from Telegraph Creek. Some vehicles continue
to drive up the lower portion of the road, but the route is blocked at about the 1.3 mile mark.
WILDLIFE - 504

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The only other potential access route from the east side, road #1857-A1, is part of the restricted
road system north of Negro Mountain and is closed yearlong to allow for elk security and habitat
effectiveness. Other problems include (1) pioneering of new routes by OHVs; (2) vehicles
fording Ontario Creek and sometimes, the Little Blackfoot River to access road #4100 on the
west side; and (3) some ineffective and confusing, road restrictions toward the south that,
among other things, allow vehicles (via road #1857-D1) into a closed road system in upper
Telegraph Creek.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
Alternative 1 would preserve the arrangement described above, retaining 12.0 miles of open
road, with a local open road density of about 1.7 mi/mi². Of these roads, 5.6 miles are closed
during spring break-up (April 15 to June 1) and the remainder are open yearlong.
The Moose Gulch road (#1857-B1), would continue to generate erosion problems, but the route
now dead-ends at the private inholding atop the gulch and as a result, far fewer vehicles make
use of it than when it was a through-route. Currently, there is no access all the way to Negro
Mountain ridge from Telegraph Creek. The continued yearlong closure on road #1857-A1 and
the network of old timber sale roads to which it connects would maintain a pocket of fall elk
security and summer habitat integrity in the area north of Negro Mountain. Primary problems
remaining would be illegal vehicle use of closed routes, including continued subversion of the
upper Telegraph Creek road closures from roads #1857-D1 and #1857-D2; continued pioneering
of new motor bike/ATV/ four-wheel-drive routes; lack of legal motorized access to the Negro
Mountain ridge from Telegraph Creek; and the need for vehicles to ford Ontario Creek in order
to get to Road #4100 on the west side of the ridge. A groomed snowmobile route crosses the
area from the Little Blackfoot road to upper Telegraph Creek and is available for snowmobiling
from December 1 to October 15 whenever snow depths allow (generally early December
through late March).

Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 16.2 miles of road would be open to vehicles: 12.1 miles would be open
yearlong and 4.1 miles (road # 1857-A1) from May 15 to September 1, resulting in a total open
road density of about 2.2 mi/mi². This is higher than at present. No motor trails would be open
under this alternative.
Alternative 2 would close the eroding Moose Gulch Road (#1857-B1) between its junction with
the Telegraph Creek road and the private inholding on the Negro Mountain ridge. The
landowner has blocked public access at the crest of the ridge so that the road no longer provides
vehicle access to Negro Mountain. To compensate for access lost by this restriction, 3.5 miles of
currently-closed Road #1857-A1 would be opened to vehicles from May 15 to September 1. This
would retain local elk security for the big game rifle season and habitat integrity during early
spring migration, but it would add a degree of motorized disturbance from late spring into early
fall, reducing local elk habitat effectiveness.
In essence, the proposal would close a stream-side route with severe erosion and water quality
problems (#1857-B1) in exchange for opening a dry, upland route (#1857-A1) with negative
implications for big game, albeit with a mid-fall to mid-spring closure. On balance, retention of
fall security (a bulwark against mortality) is more important to elk and deer in this area than
maintaining a local disturbance-free corridor in summer. But, the opening of road #1857-A1
WILDLIFE - 505

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

would redistribute vehicle use in the Negro Mountain area. It would be responsible for most of
the increase in open road mileage in this alternative versus the existing condition (alternative 1).

Figure 43 - Photo 27. Road #1857-A1
Road #1857-A1 as it runs through a grassland park used by foraging elk in spring, early summer
and fall. The currently closed route would be opened as a road in alternatives 2, 3 and 4 and as a
motor trail in alternative 5.

Under alternative 2, road #4100, which ascends the ridge from the west, would eventually
provide legal vehicle access from that direction, but not until a bridge is constructed over the
Little Blackfoot River at the lower end of the road [which would be a future project separate
from the current proposal]. In the meantime, the road technically would be open to vehicles,
but for all practical purposes, would not provide viable access from the Little Blackfoot side.
Most other existing road closures would be retained, with the notable exception of roads
#1857-D1 and #1857-D2, which connect Negro Mountain roads with the currently-closed upper
Telegraph road system. This officially-closed, though often driven, road would become a legally
open route year-round (as would the upper Telegraph system to which it connects), creating an
extensive new loop driving/ riding opportunity and lowering big game security and habitat
effectiveness in that area.
The groomed snowmobile route that traverses the area would be available essentially as it is
now (with the opening date shifting from December 1 to December 2).

Alternative 3
Alternative 3, which in most areas emphasizes non-motorized access, would, in this case,
provide only marginally less open road than the existing condition (11.8 miles vs. 12.0 miles at
present). Like Alternative 2, this option would eliminate vehicle access to Negro Mountain on
the lower Moose Gulch road (#1857-B1) and substitute road #1857-A1 as the open route from
Telegraph Creek (with an October 15 to May 15 closure). But, unlike alternative 2, alternative 3

WILDLIFE - 506

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

proposes retaining the yearlong wheeled vehicle closure on road #1857-D1, which would block
vehicle access from the upper Telegraph Creek road network to the south. Better signing and
physical barriers would be needed to make this closure effective, measures that are not part of
this “open-route/closed-route” proposal and would need to be provided by a separate future
proposal. Unlike alternatives 1 and 2, alternative 3 would also close road #4100, the only viable
access route to Negro Mountain from the Little Blackfoot River side, leaving road #1857-A1 as
the only driving route to the ridge [and between October 15 and May 15 that route also would
be closed as well, excluding wheeled vehicles from the area entirely]. There would be no open
motor trails under alternative 3.
In terms of wildlife cost/benefit, alternative 3 is slightly less conducive to big game habitat
integrity than the existing condition (given potential effects generated by open route #1857-A1),
but more beneficial than alternative 2 (because of the closure on roads #1857-D1 and #1857D2).
As in alternative 2, the local groomed snowmobile route would be open from December 2 to
May 15, as snow conditions allow.

Figure 44 - Photo 28. Forest Road #4100

Forest Road #4100, which ascends the Negro Mtn ridge from the west. The road, which provides
access to Negro Mountain from the west, is now open to all vehicles; but access requires fording
Ontario Creek at the bottom. Under Alternatives 2, 3 and 4, the route would lose its designation
as a Forest System Road until a bridge is constructed across the Little Blackfoot River, thus
avoiding the ford at Ontario Creek. Alternative 5 would convert it to a motor trail.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is a hybrid proposal somewhere between alternatives 2 and 3. Like alternative 2
(and alternative 1), it would allow the #4100 road system coming up from the Little Blackfoot
side to remain open; but like alternative 3 (and alternative 1), it would retain the closure on

WILDLIFE - 507

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

roads #1857-D1 and #1857-D2 connecting to the upper Telegraph system to the south. As with
other action alternatives, road #1857-A1, currently closed for elk security and habitat
effectiveness, would be opened from May 15 to October 15 to compensate for the closure of
the Moose Gulch road (#1857-B1) and thus provide access from the lower Telegraph Creek side.
As in alternative 2, road #4100 from the west would be technically open to vehicles but would
not provide viable access from that direction until a new bridge was constructed over the Little
Blackfoot River sometime in the future. alternative 4 would support 14.5 miles of open road
and no motor trails. Open route density would be 2.0 mi/mi².
As with alternatives 2 and 3, the opening of road #1857-A1 would erode summer habitat
effectiveness for elk in the area north of Negro Mountain, although the rough condition of the
upper half of the route is likely to limit casual use by many highway vehicles.

Alternative 5
Under alternative 5, no roads on the Negro Mountain ridge would be open to full-sized vehicles:
existing open roads would either be closed or converted to motor trails. Open road density
would reduce to 0.2 mi/mi², an artifact of border roads running along the Little Blackfoot River
to the west and Telegraph Creek to the east. Motor trail denisty, on the other hand, would be
the highest of any alternative at 0.7 mi/mi². The trails would be closed to motorized use during
the hunting season (September 1 to December 1). Most would be designated for snowmobile
use in winter. Trails that would be open to motor bikes and ATVs include currently-closed Road
#1857-A1 northeast of Negro Mountain; Road #4100, which connects to the Little Blackfoot
River Road to the west; and Roads #1857, #1857-B1, #1857-B4 and #1857-D1, which connect to
a currently-closed part of the Upper Telegraph road system to the south.
Total open route density in summer would be 2.0 mi/mi², much in the same ball park as the
other four alternatives, which range from 1.6 to 2.2 mi/mi². The primary difference in
alternative 5 is that motorized intrusion into wildlife habitat would come in the form of ATVs
and motor bikes rather than as SUVs and pickup trucks. Hunting season closures would be
pervasive, similar to other action alternatives and substantially greater than at present.
Snowmobile route availability would be similar to other alternatives.

Summary and Conclusions
Alternative 1 would preserve the status quo: Open road density would remain at 1.7 mi/mi²
most of the year, access to the Negro Mountain ridge would be blocked from lower Telegraph
Creek (by the private inholding above Moose Gulch) and road systems to the north and south
would remain off-limits to vehicles so as to promote big game security and habitat effectiveness.
Under Alternative 2, local open road density would increase to 2.2 mi/mi² in summer. Vehicle
access from lower Telegraph Creek would be provided via a currently closed road (#1857-A1) to
the northeast, allowing a loop riding opportunity between the Little Blackfoot and Telegraph
Creek roads. The route would be closed in hunting season to maintain elk security, but summer
habitat effectiveness would decline. Currently closed routes into upper Telegraph Creek to the
south (roads #1857-D2, #1857-D2) would be opened year-round, further lowering local elk
security and habitat effectiveness.
Alternative 3 would maintain open summer road density of 1.6 mi/mi², similar to alternative 1
but through a different combination of open and closed roads. As in alternative2, the currently
closed route to telegraph Creek (#1857-A1) would be open between May 15 and October 15.
But, unlike alternative2, it would maintain the road closures into upper Telegraph Creek to the

Environmental Impact Statement

south (#1857-D2), preserving elk security and habitat effectiveness in that area and it would also
close the main access road from the Little Blackfoot side (#4100).
Alternative 4 , like alternative 3, would open road #1857-A1 northeast of Negro Mountain for
wheeled vehicle access from lower Telegraph Creek from mid-spring to mid-fall and it would
maintain the yearlong closure on roads #1857-D1 and #1857-D2 into upper Telegraph Creek to
the south. But unlike alternative 3, it would allow continued wheeled vehicle access from the
Little Blackfoot drainage via road #4100. Open road density in summer would be 2.0 mi/mi².
Alternative 5 would close several currently open roads on the Negro Mountain ridge and covert
the rest to trails open to ATVs and motor bikes from May 15 to August 31. Trail #1857-A1 would
provide access from the north, #4100 from the west and the #1857-B/D system from the south.
Summer open road density would be 2.0 mi/mi². Much of the system would be open to
snowmobiles in winter.

Upper Telegraph Creek
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

This area, immediately west of upper Telegraph Creek, lies between two other key areas: Negro
Mountain to the northwest and Ontario/Bison Creek to the southwest. Roads in the eastern
half of the area traverse extensive cutting units from the first Treasure Mountain timber sale
(1960s). These units are now clogged with large sapling lodgepole pine that provide good hiding
cover. Most roads in this area are open to motor vehicles year-round. Roads in the western half
of the area pass through a number of more recent clearcuts from the Ontario Creek timber sale
(late 1980s). In order to compensate for loss of cover, these roads were closed as part of the elk
security/habitat effectiveness plan associated with the timber sale. The road restrictions remain
intact, although they are often subverted by vehicles that manage to circumvent barriers, often
via road #1857-D1 coming down from the Negro Mountain area to the north.

In addition to serving as big game habitat in summer and fall, the upper Telegraph area supports
grizzly bears, lynx, wolverines and sometimes, wolves, all in very low numbers. The nonmotorized block between open roads in Telegraph Creek (#1859, #1859-B1, #495-D1) and
Ontario Creek (#123) is too small to serve as a bona-fide elk security area, but there is enough
rugged, forested country in this intermittent refuge to allow a number of elk to elude hunters in
the fall. In addition, a variety of drainage-head habitats across the upper Telegraph Creek
watershed provide a fertile summer environment. The broad bulk of Treasure Mountain itself is
covered with a patchwork of open and closed lodgepole pine forest (with whitebark pine),
dense spruce/fir stands (some approaching old-growth status) and small productive openings
This combination of components provides elk with calving and nursery sites, summer cover and
forage and a measure of hunting season security.
Currently the upper Telegraph region supports 7.7 miles of open Forest system roads. An
additional eight miles of system roads are closed to wheeled vehicles, as are several miles of
non-system roads (most of them old mining roads). Also currently in use are approximately 1.6
miles of user-made motor trails. The longest of these is an unauthorized route pionered over
the top of Treasure Mountain and running between open Road #1857-B3 in the north and
closed Road #1859-D1 to the south. Another 1.5 miles of closed road at the southern end of the
trail is then used to access the main road system from behind the gate on Road # 1859. With
these clandestine motor routes added in, open route density is 1.9 mi/mi². Density is 1.4

mi/mi² when these routes are not included. Primary groomed snowmobile routes follow roads
#495, #1859 and #1857-D1.

Figure 45 - Photo 29. User-Made Motor Trail

User-made motor trail running through beetle-killed lodgepole pine forest across the broad
summit of Treasure Mountain. As of mid-June 2012, the trail had been little used that year and
numerous elk cows and calves were present throughout the area. The bulk of the ATV and trail
bike use comes in July, August and September.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
Alternative 1 would maintain the existing condition described above: Most roads in the east
half of the area would remain open to vehicles yearlong and those in the west half would
remain closed yearlong. Eventually, improved signing and road barriers should allow effective
enforcement of vehicle restrictions, including closure of unauthorized trails, although these
measures are beyond the scope of this planning effort. Local open route density would remain
at 1.9 mi/mi². Snowmobile routes would be available whenever sufficient snow is present
between December 1 and October 15. In this area, snowmobile snow may last into April.

Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would substantially expand the open road network by sanctioning wheeled vehicle
traffic on now-closed roads associated with the Ontario Creek timber sale in the west half of the
area. This includes roads #1859-D4, #1859-E1 and the west half of road #1859, as well as road
#1857-D1, which connects with the Negro Mountain road network to the north. Open roads
would total 13.0 miles (about 5.4 miles more than at present), producing a local open road
density of about 2.2 mi/mi². User-made motor trails would be eliminated. Snowmobile routes
would be open December 2 to May 15.

Figure 46 - Photo 30. Road #1857-D1

Road #1857-D1, which connects the upper Telegraph Creek area with the Negro Mountain area
to the north. The route is currently closed to all wheeled vehicles yearlong and would remain so
under alternatives 3 and 4. It would be open to all vehicles yearlong in alternative 2 and to ATVs
and motor bikes in alternative 5. Here, the route passes through an old clearcut full of large
sapling conifers, one of the most prominent local habitat formations.
The increase in open roads would lower effectiveness of local habitats in the vicinity of Treasure
Mountain for big game animals, as well as for other species wary of motorized activity. It would
also erode local habitat security opportunity for elk during the hunting season, most likely
displacing animals that currently make use of the area into vehicle-restricted refuges to the
south and west.

Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would is somewhat similar to the existing condition (alternative 1) with regard to
wheeled vehicles, maintaining considerably lower road density than alternative 2. Roads open
to wheeled vehicles would total 6.7 miles (a bit less than at present), resulting in a local open
road density of 1.2 mi/mi² (compared to 1.3 mi/mi² under alternative 1 and 2.2 mi/mi² under
alternative 2). All open roads would be available to wheeled vehicles year-round, whenever
snow conditions allowed. Aside from the elimination of a couple short spur road segments and
a user-made motor trail, it is identical to alternative 1, with similar implications for wildlife.
Both alternatives 1 and 3 are more favorable to local wildlife in terms of motorized disturbance
and hunter access than is alternative 2. Snowmobile season would be the same as alternative 2:
December 2 to May 15.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is similar to alternatives 1 and 3. It would maintain 7.5 miles of open road
(yearlong) and no motor trails. Resulting local open route density would be 1.3 mi/mi². In

WILDLIFE - 511

general, most roads in the eastern part of the area would be open to wheeled vehicles yearround, those in the western reaches closed year-round. There would be no open road
connection to the Negro Mountain area to the north other than by the indirect route along Road
#495, which follows the main stem of Telegraph Creek.
As with alternatives 1 and 3, elk security and habitat effectiveness would be good, although
improvements in road closure mechanisms and signing would be required to make vehicle use
patterns operate as intended. Snowmobile use would be the same as in the other three
alternatives.

Figure 47 - Photo 31. Road #1859-E1
Road #1859-E1 passing through stands of beetle-killed lodgepole pine in upper Telegraph Creek.
The road is now closed to wheeled vehicles and would remain so in alternatives 3 and 4. This
western section of the road would be closed in alternative 5 as well, but its eastern end would
serve as part of a motor trail and designated snowmobile route. The entire route would be open
year-round in alternative 2.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would convert currently open Roads #1859 and #1859-B1 to motor trails and
would open parts of currently-closed Roads #1859-E1, #1859-D4 and #185-D4 as motor trails.
These trails would feed into the Negro Mountain trail system to the north. User-made trails,
such as the one over Treasure Mountain would be closed. The net result would be an increase
in motor trail density from 0.6 mi/mi² to 1.2 mi/mi². All motor trails would be closed during the
big game hunting season (Sept. 1 to Dec. 1). No roads would be open to full-sized vehicles in
this region between Telegraph Creek to the east and Ontario/Monarch Creeks to the west.
Accounting for boundary roads along Telegraph, Ontario and Monarch Creeks, open road
density would decrease from 1.3 mi/mi² to 0.5 mi/mi². Total open route density in summer
would be 1.7 mi/mi², which is somewhat less than alternatives 1 and 2 but more than
alternatives 3 and 4.
WILDLIFE - 512

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Summer habitat effectiveness for big game animals, as measured by open motor route
distribution, would be similar to alternatives 2, 3 and 4 in that the western half of the area
would be free from motorized use. Technically, the same is true for alterntive 1 as well, but the
non-motorized pattern is subverted to an extent by unauthorized routes in the Treasure
Mountain area. Alternative 5 presents the only secenario in which the entire area between
Telergraph and Ontario/Monarch Creeks is off-limits to motor vehicles during the hunting
season.

Summary and Conclusions
Alternative 1 would maintain local open route density of 1.9 mi/mi², mostly from open roads in
the eastern half of the area, but partly from unauthorized motor trails in the west. Illegal use of
restricted roads coming in from the Negro Mountain area to the north (esp. #1857-D1) would
also continue to subvert road closures designed to provide for big game security and habitat
effectiveness following timber sales in the 1970s and 1980s.
Under Alternative 2, local open route density would increase to 2.2 mi/mi², a result of opening
5.4 miles of currently-closed roads in the western half of the area to yearlong vehicle use(and
assuming closure of unauthorized routes). This would diminish local fall elk security and
summer habitat effectiveness in the central part of the area, an effect that would most likely be
expressed via displacement of elk further west toward Ontario and Monarch Creeks .
The open road system under Alternative 3 would be similar to the existing condition in its
primary configuration, with local open route density declining to 1.2 mi/mi², mostly from the
closure of short segments of fringe and connector routes, as well as unauthorized motor trails.
Integrity of current road closures in the western half of the area would be dependent on better
signing and physical barriers to reduce illegal motorized use [though such actions are not part of
the current proposal].
Alternative 4 is similar to alternatives 1 and 3 in terms of its road closures and its benefits for
local wildlife habitat effectiveness and security. Local open route density would be 1.3 mi/mi².
As with other alternatives, all wheeled vehicle closures would be yearlong. Snowmobile routes
would be as in the other three alternatives.
Alternative 5 would close all routes between Telegraph and Ontario/Monarch Creeks to fullsized motorized vehicles, converting some routes to motor trails. Summer habitat effectiveness
patterns would be similar to other action alternatives. Open route density during that period
would be 1.7 mi/mi², with use concentrated in the eastern half of the area. Fall big game
security would be the most effective of all alternatives since all trails would be closed to
motorized use September 1 to December 1.

Upper Ontario Creek – Bison Creek
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

This area lies immediately south of the upper Telegraph Creek region and takes in the upper
reaches of Ontario Creek, including the productive Bison Creek drainage. To the west and south,
it abuts country that is either unroaded or in which roads are restricted for wheeled vehicles
year-round. An extensive road network (greater than 12 miles) in the western half of the area,
constructed for the Bison Mountain Timber sale in the 1970s, accounts for most of the closed
road miles.

the process. This route is often deeply rutted and eroded [Figure 48]. It remains on the east
side of Ontario Creek, but ATV and motor bike riders have pioneered a track across the creek so
as to hook into closed Road #4104-A2, the CDNST and the restricted Bison Mountain road
system [Figure 49]. Open road density in the area is low at 0.5 mi/mi² (generated by 4.1 miles
of road open all year).
This area within the curve of the Continental Divide northeast of Bison Mountain encompasses
the headwaters of Bison Creek, Ontario Creek and parts of Monarch and Telegraph Creeks
[Figure 24]. It is heavily forested, but supports a broad mosaic of early and late-seral forests
interspersed with wet meadows, riparian shrub communities and grassland. The structural
diversity, combined with the presence of highly productive sites and relative isolation from
regular motorized disturbance (and human activity in general), afford excellent summer habitat
opportunities for elk, deer, moose, black bears, grizzly bears and a variety of other wildlife
species that thrive under such conditions. As with many areas dominated by mature lodgepole
pine, forests in these drainages have been under attack by mountain pine beetle over the past
few years and standing dead trees have proliferated. Whitebark pine stands have been heavily
impacted as well.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
This option would maintain the current situation described above. Motorized access to Ontario
Creek via road #495-D1, especially the northward extension of the road along the creek, would
continue to depress the habitat potential of local riparian areas for more than a mile. Its direct
effect on the areawide wildlife environment, however, is probably marginal, given the extensive
non-motorized country to the south and west. Indirectly, its impact is more far-reaching
because of the illegal access it provides ATVs and trail bikes, once they cross the creek, to the
old Bison Mountain road prisms and to the Continental Divide Trail (CDNST). Alternative 1
would maintain 4.1 miles of legally open road, 2.1 miles on road #495-D1 and 2.0 miles on the
peripheral roads in Monarch and Telegraph Creeks. Open road density would thus remain at 0.5
mi/mi². There would be no legally open motor trails.
In winter, a groomed snowmobile route (open after November 30) follows road #4104 in
Monarch Creek and crosses the area via roads #1404-A1 and #495-D1, connecting to road #495
in Telegraph Creek. There is no big game winter range or wolverine denning habitat within
reach of the trail and no wildlife problems are evident.

Alternative 2
The primary change proposed in alternative 2 would be to convert 2.2 miles of currently-closed
road #4104-A1 to a motorized trail that would connect Road #495-D1 to Road #4104 in Monarch
Creek (to be open May 15 to October 15). The existing road prism would remain in place but
motorized use would be limited to trail bikes and ATVs. The short user-made route across
Ontario Creek would be sanctioned for motorized use to allow connection with road #495-D1,
thus completing a legal loop route involving roads and trails in Ontario, Monarch and Telegraph
Creeks. The dead-end extension of road #495-D1 northward along the riparian zone beyond this
connection would remain.

Divide Travel Plan

The creation of a motorized through-route across the area is more a problem for wildlife than is
the dead-end road that comes in from the east at present. This arrangement would lead to an
increased flow of motor bikes and ATVs through the area because of the opportunity for a loop
ride. When motorized use is persistent (most often on weekends) undisturbed habitat would be
fragmented into north and south segments, an effect likely to redistribute elk use in the area,
probably toward the south. The same would be true for other uncommon, road-wary species
such as black bears, grizzly bears, wolverine, lynx, mountain lions and so on. The snowmobile
route through the area would be open December 2 to May 15.

Road #495-D1, which provides access to upper Ontario Creek from the east. The road dead-ends
on the east side of Ontario Creek, but some ATV and motor bike riders cross the creek and enter
the closed road system on Bison Mountain. This road would remain open down to the creek
under all alternatives. In alternatives 2, 4 and 5, it would then continue on as a newly authorized
motor trail connecting to Road #4104 in Monarch Creek to the west. In alternatives 1 and 3,
there would be no motor trail connection.

Alternative 3
With regard to wheeled vehicles, alternative 3 is identical to alternative 1 (the existing
condition) retaining road #495-D1 into upper Ontario Creek, including the northward dead-end
extension along the riparian zone and maintaining the closure on road #4104-A1. There would
be no authorized motor trail connection over to Monarch Creek. Opening date of the
snowmobile route would be changed from December 1 to December 2.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 2, converting closed-Road #4104-A1 along upper Ontario
Creek to a motor trail open May 15 to October 15. All other currently closed roads would
remain closed. The current snowmobile route would remain in place, with a one-day shift in the
opening date. Implications for wildlife are the same as in alternative 2.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 is nearly identical to alternatives 2 and 4, converting closed-Road #4104-A1 along
upper Ontario Creek to a motor trail. However, in alternative 5 the route would be open only
from May 15 through August 31, recognizing the hunting season as beginning with the bow
season on September 1. All other currently closed roads would remain closed. The current
snowmobile route would remain in place, with the opening date the same as alternative 4.
Implications for wildlife are the same as in alternatives 2 and 4.

gain access to it and other roads in the closed system via Road #495-D1 to the east. Vehicles ford
Bison Creek from Road #495-D1 and make their way over to the closed system. alternatives 2, 4
and 5 would authorize Road #4104-A1 as a motor trail (May 15 to Aug. 31). The road would
remain closed in alternatives 1 and 3.

Summary and Conclusions
Alternative 1 would retain local open road density at 0.5 mi/mi² in spring, summer and fall.
Most of the extensive road system in upper Ontario and Bison Creeks, built for past timber sales,
would remain gated. It is likely that some illegal motorized use would continue to occur on this
road system. But, in general, big game hunting season security and summer habitat
effectiveness would remain high. There would be no legal motorized trails in this alternative.
Alternative 2 would retain local open road density of at 0.5 mi/mi², but it would open up a
currently closed road along upper Ontario Creek (#4104-A2) as an ATV/bike trail in summer.
This route would bisect the area between upper Telegraph and Monarch Creeks, substantially
elevating wildlife disturbance through these alpine basins in summer. The route would be
closed to vehicles during the big game rifle season, retaining high fall elk security.

Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 2, with the the exception of a one -day shift in the

Alternative 5 is identical to alternative 4, except that the route would close to motorized

Hahn Creek – Flume Gulch – Mike Renig Gulch
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

This area lies between northern Telegraph Creek (just above its confluence with the Little
Blackfoot River) and the Continental Divide to the east. All motorized access is via the Hahn
Creek road (#1856), which winds its way eastward up the Hahn Creek drainage from the
Telegraph Creek road (#495), eventually passing through the headwaters basins of Flume Gulch,
Little Flume Gulch and Mike Renig Gulch just below the Divide.

The road is gated at the 3.7 mile mark near the top of Flume Gulch and motorized use is
restricted beyond this point yearlong. A second gate is located at the north end of the road
system in Mike Renig Gulch to block vehicles from that direction (although public access is
severely limited by private holdings in that area). There are three exceptions to the vehicle
restrictions: (1) Forest Service vehicles are allowed in for occasional resource management
activities (fire suppression, silvicultural operations, weed control, road maintenance); (2)
snowmobiles are permitted on the main road (#1856) and on a short connection to the Divide
from December 1 until the snow base deteriorates; and (3) three private landowners, who have
built part-time residences on an inholding in upper Mike Renig Gulch 2.5 to 3.5 miles behind the
gate, are allowed to drive in between April 1 and November 30 (each has a key to a private lock
on the gate). One of the landowners has been accessing the parcel for over 20 years; the other
two more recently. In winter, the road is not plowed but snowmobile access to the property is
available.
Most landowner intrusion is localized along the main road (#1856) and around the cabins in the
bottom of upper Mike Renig Gulch (although there are occasional reports of incursions into
other areas). While this use does not appear to be displacing wildlife in any meaningful way
[see wildlife field notes for the Telegraph Vegetation Project 2010-2012, HELENA NATIONAL
FOREST Wildlife Files], it has aggravated a number of recreationists, particularly hunters, some
of whom would also like to be able to drive into the gated area and others of whom feel that the
disturbance generated by the landowners impairs their walk-in hunting opportunity. Hikers on
the section of the CDNST that follows the road are also occasionally surprised by vehicles in the
restricted area.
The four drainages in this area were extensively logged in the early 1980s, mostly by
clearcutting. Forest system roads supporting these projects (along with a few routes previously
in place) total over 21 miles. Open roads account for 11.2 miles (producing a local open road
density of 1.2 mi/mi²). The gates on Road #1856 were installed in the early 1980s as wildlife
mitigation. They were designed initially to buffer big game animals on spring/summer/fall
ranges from excessive human interference, thus enhancing both security and habitat
effectiveness. Since then, it has become evident that a number of other prominent species also
benefit from the closure, lynx, wolverines, black bears, mountain lions and beaver among them.

WILDLIFE - 517

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The upper Flume and Little Flume Gulch basins immediately behind the gate support numerous
seeps and springs; and because of poor drainage, the water spreads out into a mosaic of riparian
areas, wet meadows and bogs. Beaver activity, which has waxed and waned over the years, has
created ponds in the basin, further enhancing habitat opportunities for wildlife. Likewise, the
headwaters of Mike Renig Gulch, while more confined, provide highly productive summer
habitat. The north and east slopes of Jericho Mountian, which rise gradually above the
headwaters of the gulch support excellent productive forest habitat with numerous wet sites,
pockets of old-growth and dense cover. Because much of the forest is dominated by Engelmann
spruce and subalpine fir, it has remained largely intact in tht face of the pine beetle outbreak.
The large dead lodgepole pine scattered through these stands is adding a further element of
complexity.

Figure 50 - Photo 34. Wet site in Little Flume Gulch

One of several wet sites amidst sapling-filled clearcuts and mature forest in Little Flume Gulch.
This mix of habitats provides excellent summer habitat for elk, deer, moose, black bears,
snowshoe hares and numerous other wildlife species.
Overall, these upper drainages support roughly a 50/50 mix of mature and early-successional
forest, although Mike Renig Gulch holds more mature forest and Little Flume Gulch more young
regenerating forest. A majority of the old cutting units are now dominated by large sapling
conifers, which in most cases provide good hiding cover for big game animals. This is excellent
summer habitat for moose, elk and deer, as well as black bears, mountain lions, lynx and a wide
variety of smaller mammals and birds.
Over the last eight years, much of the mature forest, wherever lodgepole pine is present, has
become infested with mountain pine beetle and is now dead or dying. This insect outbreak is in
the process of dramatically altering the forest environment throughout the local drainages (and
the Divide landscape in general), transforming much of the mature interior forest to open
canopied early seral habitat clogged with snags and large woody debris.

A view across upper Mike Renig Gulch, showing the mosaic of green sapling-dominated clearcuts
and mature beetle-killed lodgepole pine forest that is now characteristic of most of upper Mike
Renig, Flume and Little Flume Gulches.
Some elk remain in the vicinity of the closed road system during the hunting season, although
most retreat to more rugged, densely forested country further back from the gate (along and
over the Divide and around Jericho Mountain). Many hunters park at the gate and walk into the
basins and up to the Divide during the course of the big game bow season (starting September
1) and rifle season (mid October to late November), as long as snow conditions on the Hahn
Creek road allow. Elk, deer and most moose abandon the upper drainages as snow accumulates
in late fall or early winter.
In the last few years, lynx, wolverines, wolves, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, marten, weasels and
mountain lions have all been tracked through the upper drainages in winter (Wild Things
Unlimited tracking surveys, 2006 to 2013). The snowmobile route through the center of the
area does not appear to be displacing these animals. Snowmobile use levels are low, the activity
is limited to daytime hours and concentrated on weekends and virtually all riding is confined to
the narrow road prism. The route is available to snowmobiles anytime snow conditions are
right, except during the big game rifle season. Most use occurs from mid-December through
mid-March.

Road #1856 near the head of Mike Renig Gulch. The sapling filled clearcuts, such as those in the
foreground, provide foraging habitat for lynx. Lynx and wolverines regularly travel this closed
road system in winter. The road is closed to public wheeled vehicles year-round but is open to
snowmobiles in winter. It would be open during the hunting season in alternative 2.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
Under alternative 1, conditions in this key area would remain as described above. Road #1856
and its spurs would remain gated to wheeled vehicle use by the general public yearlong;
snowmobiles would continue to use the road as an ungroomed trail to access other trails on the
Divide; and the exceptions for the private landowners would remain in place. A diversity of
wildlife would continue to use the productive basins as summer habitat (May to September);
easy walking access for hunters would continue to displace elk to the far reaches of the upper
drainages and to more secure adjacent areas in the fall; and a number of uncommon carnivores
would continue to frequent the area in winter (and presumably in other seasons as well).

Alternative 2
Alternative 2 proposes one significant change from the existing condition: The gate on road
#1856 would be opened from October 15 to December 1 to allow motorized hunter access for
about four miles along the main road during the big game rifle season. Rationale for this
arrangement are that (1) access for the general public, even for only a few weeks, will alleviate
some of the sense of injustice generated by the exclusive access allowed the private landowners
and (2) the area is more important to big game as productive summer habitat than it is as a
hunting season refuge. Be that as it may, this would reduce the security value of certain local
habitats in upper Flume, Little Flume and Mike Renig Gulches and it is likely that any elk that
have used the area for fall refuge in the past would be displaced to more secure areas to the

south and west. The new open route would not come close enough to the elk security area
around Jericho Mountain to reduce the size of that refuge. The dates for use of the snowmobile
route would change from the current December 1 to October 15 to December 2 to May 15.

Alternative 3
Except for a couple minor differences, alternative 3 is essentially the same as alternative 1, the
existing condition. Open road density would be slightly lower due to the closure of the north
end of four-wheel-drive road #1863 on the Continental Divide in the southeast corner of the
area. Dates for snowmobiles would be as in alternative 2 (December 2 to May 15). The area
would continue to serve as prime summer wildlife habitat; human-wary carnivores would
continue to make use of the area in winter; fall elk security in Little Flume and Mike Renig
Gulches would remain intact, though somewhat marginal because of the proximity of open
roads and easy walk-in access.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3: The implications for wildlife of proceeding with this
alternative are the same as for alternative 3 and much the same as for alternative 1.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 is similar to alternatives 1, 3 and 4, in that it retains the closure on road #1856,
restricting motorized use year-round to incidental use by the three landowners with inholdings.
In addition, the closure of dead-end spur roads off the main #1856 route would lower open
route density to 0.7 mi/mi², much the lowest of any alternative. There would be no motor trails
in alternative 5 and Road #1856 would not be designated as a snowmobile route, protecting
winter use by lynx, wolverines and other rare carnivores know to have use the area in the past.

Summary and Conclusions
Alternative 1 would retain local open road density at 1.2 mi/mi² year-round. The two gates that
block public wheeled-vehicle access to upper Little Flume and Mike Renig Gulches would remain
intact, although local landowners would still be allowed access to their inholdings above the
Hahn Creek gate. The main road (#1856) would continue to serve as a snowmobile route in
winter. Wildlife use of these productive drainage-head basins would remain high.
Under Alternative 2, local open road density would remain at 1.2 mi/mi² for most of the year.
But, the gate on the main road in Little Flume Gulch would be opened for the big game rifle
season, allowing motorized access to four miles of currently closed road. It is likely that any elk
in this area at the start of the rifle season would move to more secure sites in adjacent
drainages.
Alternatives 3 and 4 are identical. Under these alternatives, local open road density would
decline slightly to 1.2 mi/mi². With a couple minor exceptions, alternatives 3 and 4 are identical
to alternative 1 and would maintain the same level of wildlife habitat integrity in this key area.
Alternative 5, like alternatives 1, 3 and 4, would maintain the yearlong gate closures for Little
Flume and Mike Renig Gulches. In addition, it would close deadend spur roads off Road #1856,
lowering open route density to 0.7 mi/mi². Road #1856 would not be designated as a
snowmobile route.

Slate Creek – Elliston Creek
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

This habitat block encompasses most of the Slate Creek drainage and the upper half of the
Elliston Creek drainage. The central feature of the upper drainages is Slate Lake, a modest-sized
body of water (of about two acres) at mid-high elevation (precisely 6,000 feet) surrounded by an
extensive wet meadow complex. The headwaters of both drainages originate here, with Elliston
Creek flowing northward and Slate Creek eastward (both eventually ending up in the Little
Blackfoot River). The upper Elliston Creek drainage accommodates a few primitive roads/trails,
none of which are currently open to wheeled motor vehicles but which see a certain amount of
illicit use. The upper drainage is part of an elk security area, the southeastern corner of which
encompasses Slate Lake.
The Slate Creek drainage, on the other hand, was logged in the 1970s and 1980s, mostly by
clearcutting and retains a functional Forest road network created for those projects. Currently,
the western half of the road system toward Slate Lake is closed to vehicle use yearlong, while
the eastern half toward the Little Blackfoot River, with connections to the Elliston area toward
the north, is open year-round. Open roads in the Slate Creek and upper Elliston Creek drainages
cover 4.5 miles, resulting in an open road density of 0.7 mi/mi². Closed Forest roads account for
9.9 miles of the system. There is at least one unauthorized user-made motor trail in the Slate
Lake area, the use of which requires ATV and motor bike riders to circumvent two closure gates.

A groomed snowmobile trail, available December 1 to October 15, follows roads #1871 and
#1871-A1 through the Slate Creek drainage, connecting trails in the Elliston area (to the north)
with those in the Treasure Mountain/ Telegraph Creek area (to the southeast). Both roads are
open to wheeled vehicles year-round (although snow conditions discourage most winter use).
Riparian areas in the upper half of Slate Creek and the wet meadow/forest mosaic around Slate
Lake provide excellent summer habitat for elk, deer, moose, black bears and other species
attracted to productive, high-diversity habitats, including rare carnivores such as lynx,
wolverines and grizzly bears. The absence of legal motorized access and the scarcity of human
presence in general around Slate Lake makes this area particularly attractive to wildland species.
In the fall, a substantial number of elk remain in the Slate Lake/Elliston Creek security area as
long as possible, often through the entire hunting season if not forced out by snow
accumulation. Dense mature forests in the area are currently being opened up by bark beetle
infestation, but the area should continue to provide security by virtue of its distance from open
roads. A few hunters manage to drive into the area illegally via primitive tracks from the south
and by circumventing gates on both the upper and lower Slate Creek roads (#1871 and #1871A1).

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
This alternative would maintain the existing condition. The Elliston Creek/Slate Lake elk security
area would remain more or less intact and summer habitat effectiveness in the Slate Lake area
would remain relatively high. The primary problem for big game species and habitat integrity
for wildlife in general would continue to lie, not with the design of the route restrictions, but
with attempts to enforce them. For several years, ATVs and motor bikes have consistently been
able to pioneer detours around the road barriers in upper Slate Creek (roads #1871 and #1871-

A1) and ride throughout the closed road system and the wet meadows around Slate Lake. The
result is destructive to sensitive habitat and disruptive to local wildlife. As well, motorized
access to these areas during the hunting season subverts the integrity of the elk security area.
Similar incursions occur in upper Elliston Creek. These technical problems, however, are beyond
the scope of the Divide Travel Plan, which focuses only on the issue of which routes will be open
to motorized use and which will be restricted.

Figure 53 - Photo 37. Closure Gate on Road #1871-A1
The often-circumvented yearlong closure gate on Road #1871-A1, the upper Slate Lake Road.
The sapling-dominated clearcuts below the road are typical of much of the Slate Creek area. In
alternatives 2 and 5, this road would be open as a motor trail leading to Slate Lake.

Alternative 2
The principal innovation of alternative 2 is expansion of the open road/trail system into the
western half of the area. The proposal would open up 3.4 miles of currently-closed system road
and user-made trail in the Slate Lake area to provide a legal riding opportunity for ATVs and
motor bikes where they now ride furtively. The new open route would follow roads #1871 and
#1871-A1 behind the two closure gates in upper Slate Creek and a non-system track that
connects the two roads through the Slate Lake meadows. The entire route would be designated
a “motorized trail”, available from May 15 to September 1 and not open to vehicles wider than
50 inches. The on-ground tactics for developing the trail and enforcing compliance with the new
rules would need to be worked out in a later decision (as the trail needs to be moved out of the
meadows and away from the lake, where part of it is submerged in wet years).
In addition to the new routes around Slate Lake, road #314-E1, which comes in to Elliston Creek
from road #314 to the north and west and is now gated year-round, would be open to all
vehicles throughout the year. As a result of these changes, the density of routes open to
wheeled vehicles in the Slate Creek/ Elliston Creek area would rise from the current 0.7 mi/mi²

WILDLIFE - 523

Environmental Impact Statement

to 1.6 mi/mi² between May 16 and September 1 and to 1.1 mi/mi² between September 1 and
May 15.

alternatives 2 and 5.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Consistent presence of ATVs and trail bikes around Slate Lake after May 15 would measurably
lower habitat effectiveness of that productive summer range. Currently, the user-made routes
run through the margins of the Slate Lake meadows, sometimes churning up the wet habitat.
More serious habitat damage, however, is generated by vehicles riding out through the center
of the meadows creating multiple off-route tracks. The potential for this activity would rise as
motorized use increased. The current snowmobile trail would be available for use from
December 2 to May 15.

Alternative 3
This alternative is identical to alternative 1 (the existing condition) with respect to wheeled
vehicles and would have the same effect on the wildlife resource. The open road system would
remain at 4.5 miles. The user-made at Slate Lake would not be sanctioned as a suitable
motorized route. The Slate Lake/ Elliston Creek elk security area would remain intact and the
habitat effectiveness of Slate Lake summer habitat would remain relatively high (assuming that
road restrictions can be effectively enforced). The current snowmobile trail would be available
for use from December 2 to May 15, as in alternative 2.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternatives 1 and 3 in terms of the official status of the road and
motor trail system. Wildlife security and habitat effectiveness would remain basically sound,
although they would continue to be less than optimal with ongoing use of unauthorized motor
routes in upper Elliston Creek and the Slate Lake area. The technical aspects of enforcing these
route closures, which are key to achieving desired condition for wildlife, would not be part of
this segment of the Divide Travel Plan decision and would have to wait on follow-up actions
authorized by a different decision.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 is similar to alternative 2 in that it would open up yearlong closure gates on Roads
#1871 and #1871-A1 and allow these routes to serve as part of a seasonal motor trail (May 15 to
August 31) connected by the currently unauthorized trail through the Slate Lake area. The trail
would need to be relocated to avoid damage to the Slate lake meadows and lakeshore, although
this would have be done via an action seperate from the current proposal. In addition, a new
connection would be created between Road #1871-A1 and currently-closed Road #314-E1 in the
Elliston Creek drainage to produce another new motor trail (this also requiring implementation
through a separate action). This trail would be available from May 15 to August 31. The
resulting summer motor trail density would be 0.9 mi/mi². Total density of all open roads and
motor trails would be 1.5 mi/mi² in summer, which is similar to alternative 2 and more than
twice that of alternatives 1, 3 and 4. Neither of the new motor trails would be a designated
route for snowmobiles in winter.
Because of the presence of motor trails in sensitive areas around Slate Lake and in upper Elliston
Creek, alternative 5 would be the most disruptive of the alternatives in terms of wildlife
displacement from key habitat between May 15 and August 31. Fall big game security would
not be a problem as long as enforcement of travel restrictions is effective.

Summary and Conclusions
Under Alternative 1, local open road density would remain at 0.7 mi/mi² yearlong. While there
are no designated motor trails, user-made routes behind the gates on the Slate Lake and Slate
Creek roads would continue to pick up some illegal use in summer and fall, as would closed and
unauthorized routes in upper Elliston Creek. In spite of this, the upper Slate Creek/ Elliston
WILDLIFE - 525

Creek area would remain a relatively secure, focal area for wildlife year-round, picking up use by
grizzly bears, black bears, mountain lions, elk, deer and moose in spring, summer and fall and by
lynx and wolverines year-round.
Under Alternative 2, local open route density would rise to 1.6 mi/mi² as a result of 3.4 miles of
newly opened motor trail in the Slate Lake area (to be closed during the big game rifle season,
winter and early spring) and 3.0 miles of new yearlong open road in upper Elliston Creek. This
increased activity would periodically displace elk and other animals wary of human activity from
the Slate Lake meadows area in summer and potentially year-round in upper Elliston Creek.
Alternatives 3 and 4 are essentially identical to alternative 1 and maintain the same level of
habitat integrity in the productive habitat region around Slate Lake and in upper Slate and
Elliston Creeks. Effectiveness of the proposed restrictions would be dependent upon improved
enforcement (the details of which are not part of the current proposal).
Alternative 5 is similar to alternative 2 in creating a motor trail through Slate Lake area. It would
also create a new motor trail across upper Elliston Creek, resulting in a summer open route
density of 1.5 mi/mi², similar to alternative 2. These routes would be closed during the big
game hunting season and they would not be designated as snowmobile routes.

Lower Sweeney Creek – Blue Cloud
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

The Sweeney Creek road/trail system covers about 2,000 acres of often rough, bouldery terrain
on the north side of lower Sweeney Creek about seven miles west of Helena. A little of the
system laps over into the Blue Cloud Creek drainage to the northeast. Because of its proximity
to Helena and U.S. Highway 12, it receives considerable recreational use, motorized and nonmotorized. Helena NF system roads are limited to a couple four-wheel-drive tracks totaling
about 1.6 miles: The remaining 11.7 miles consist of ATV/motor bike routes that are also used
by day-hikers, mountain bikers and equestrians. Most routes are user-created and some are illdefined and ephemeral. While snowmobiles are allowed on the trail system, its low elevation
and overall south-facing aspect retards snow accumulation and combined with the rugged
terrain, tends to ward off snowmobilers. Most local snowmobilers park at the lot further up
Sweeney Creek and run up Forest road #335 to Priest Pass and primary sledding areas along the
Divide.

Much of the road/trail system runs through dry ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forest, but parts of it
extend into primary big game winter range to the northwest. This extensive foraging area,
created by fire in the 1950s, now supports some of the most productive bitterbrush and aspen
habitat in the Divide landscape. Mule deer and moose and to a lesser extent, elk, zero in on the
area in winter and early spring, sometimes using adjacent forest for cover. Conifer colonization
is occuring but is not yet a major issue and this remains key winter range.
Because of its proximity to subdivisions, major roads and other human activity, as well as the
density of motorized trails, the lower Sweeney Creek drainage does not provide big game
security or long-term refuge for species wary of human presence. While deer are present in the
area year-round, the primary value of this area is as winter range at a time of year when local
human activity is minimal. Goshawks may also be present in lower Sweeney Creek throughout
the year, as are a variety of other birds and small mammals.

3, 4 and 5, it would be closed to vehicles yearlong.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
Alternative 1 would preserve this status quo. Currently, there are no restrictions as to which of
the user-made routes ATVs, trail bikes and sometimes, four-wheel-drive vehicles may use.
There are over 12 miles of these tracks, some well-etched into the landscape, others poorly
defined, weaving through an area of about four square miles. Resulting motor trail/open road
density is 3.5 mi/mi² , very high.
While white-tailed deer and mule deer may frequent the area throughout the spring, summer
and fall, the bulk of the big game use (elk, moose and deer) occurs during the winter and early
spring and is focused in the browse-rich burned habitat in the northwest part of the area. Most
recreational use occurs in spring, summer and fall and is confined to the road and trail system,
which penetrates only the eastern end of the winter browsing area. As a result, disturbance of
big game animals is relatively light, most of it coming in early spring from antler hunters and
wildlife watchers. Snowmobile use is a potential disruptive factor; but in most years, snow
conditions are too marginal for all but a few reckless individuals. In deep-snow winters, the
winter range can pick up some limited use from snowmobilers who would normally launch
toward the Divide from the nearby Sweeney Creek/Priest Pass road.

Alternative 2
This alternative would retain much of the current motorized use, establishing a system of
designated trails slightly less extensive than the existing network. However, only vehicles less
than 50 inches wide (ATVs and motor bikes) would be allowed on the trails and all vehicles,
including snowmobiles, would be prohibited from October 15 to May 15. Open route density
from mid-spring through mid-fall would drop from 3.5 mi/mi² to 3.2 mi/mi², still quite high. This
level of motorized activity would continue to discourage the more cautious wildlife species (elk,
black bears, etc.) from late spring through early fall. But, the absence of all vehicle disturbances
from mid fall through mid spring would enhance the value of the area as prime winter range. It
may also improve hunting opportunity for hunters on foot.

Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would convert the current trail and road network to non motorized uses all year.
The only open route would be a short segment of the Sweeney Creek road on the southwest
edge of the area. Resulting open route density would be 0.1 mi/mi². The snowmobile closure
from alternative 2 would apply here as well. Conversion to completely non-motorized activity
would reduce the magnitude and intensity of disturbance to wildlife, although human presence,
via hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, hunting, cross-country skiing and so on, would
continue to weigh in. While lessened disturbance levels might make the area more attractive to
some of the more wary species, it is unlikely that any would find long-term habitat security here.
As in alternative 2, potential for human disruption of key winter range functions would be much
less than at present.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3, eliminating all motorized use of trails and four-wheeldrive routes. Open route density would be 0.1 mi/mi² (all from the adjacent Sweeney Creek
road). As with alternative 3, the magnitude and intensity of human disturbance would decline
significantly from current levels, benefiting both local wildlife and non-motorized recreation.

WILDLIFE - 528

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 is identical to alternatives 3 and 4. All motorized use of trails, four-wheel-drive
routes and off-route areas would be prohibited year-round. This would include snowmobiles.
The only motorized use would occur on Road #335, which brushes the southwest border of the
area. As with alternatives 3 and 4, disruption caused by motor vehicles would be all but
eliminated, although human presence from hikers, mountain bikers and equestrians would
remain. Use of the area by wildlife species wary of humans is likely to increase, but not to the
extent that the area would serve as a security refuge for big game animals during the hunting
season.

Summary and Conclusions
Alternative 1 would support a low open road density but would retain a maze of motor trails,
totaling over 12 miles: Open route density would be 3.5 mi/mi² year-round. There would
continue to be no seasonal restrictions: snowmobiles could use the trails when snow was
adequate (although this would remain an uncommon occurrence). The potential for motorized
activity as a disruptive influence on prime big game winter/spring range in the northwestern
end of the area and adjacent slopes beyond would remain in place.
Under Alternative 2, local open trail/road density would drop slightly to 3.2 mi/mi² with the
closure of a few erosive and duplicative trail sections. Trails would be closed to all vehicles,
including snowmobiles, from October 15 to May 15 to improve habitat effectiveness for big
game and other species wary of motorized activity. Since this low-elevation area is important
primarily as big game winter range, the winter and early spring restrictions would result in much
less motorized disturbance to these animals than alternative 1.
Under Alternative 3, open route density would drop dramatically to 0.1 mi/mi². All local trails
would be reserved for non-motorized users yearlong. Big game use would probably not
increase noticeably, as human presence (though non-motorized) would remain high. As in
alternative 2, the intensity of winter range disturbance would remain much lower than in
alternative 1.
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3. Open route density would be 0.1 mi/mi², a result of
the proximity of the Sweeney Creek road. From a wildlife standpoint, it would represent a
substantial improvement over the existing condition.
Alternative 5 is identical to alternatives 3 and 4. All motorized use within the area would be
eliminated, allowing it to provide for non-motorized recreation.

Priest Pass
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

This area between MacDonald and Mullan Passes on the Continental Divide encompasses a
network of roads and trails that converges on Priest Pass and the adjacent area immediately to
the east. The only primary Forest route in the area is Road #335, which comes through Priest
Pass on an east-west trajectory and is a well-used connector between Sweeney Creek east of
the Divide and Dog Creek to the west. Most remaining roads in the area, though carrying Forest
system road numbers, are primitive and rough, some of them difficult even for four-wheel-drive
vehicles. The exception is the modest #355-A1/A2 road network two miles east of the pass,
created for the Porcupine timber sale in the 1970s and still in decent condition, in large measure
because it is gated to public motorized use yearlong.

WILDLIFE - 529

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The Helena Snowmobile Trail map (HELENA NATIONAL FOREST, MFWP, BLM 2003) shows no
groomed or marked trails in the Priest Pass area; but in winter, snowmobilers park at a site in
lower Sweeney Creek and ride Helena NF roads through the pass in order to connect to the
groomed trails at Mullan Pass to the north. The current travel plan allows snowmobile travel on
all open roads in the area.
Priest Pass is a local center of wildlife activity. As a low point on the Continental Divide at the
origins of two drainages, it is a natural crossing point. The drainage-head basins on either side
provide productive habitat, both forested and non-forested. The pass lies at the interface of
extensive mature forest and grassland communities. In addition, the broad ridge just south of
the pass supports old-growth forest overlaying and interspersed with a variety of wet sites, an
environment that is attractive to many species. MFWP seasonal range maps (2004, 2010) show
Priest Pass within the margins of east-side elk winter range. This, however, appears to be an
artifact of using April and May elk locations to help delineate “winter” use. In fact, the area is
summer range for elk, mule deer and moose: They arrive with spring green-up, typically in May
and remain in the high country, often through the hunting season, until driven out by snow.
Grizzly bears, wolves, lynx and wolverines have all been identified along this part of the Divide in
recent years.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
This option preserves the existing condition, as outlined above. Roads #355-A1 and #355-A2
would remain gated to vehicles (for wildlife habitat effectiveness and security). The user-made
route (#U-205) that heads north nearly opposite this gated system would remain in use, as
would road #1846, which diverges northeast from Priest Pass. Also remaining open to
motorized use would be “road” #1802-B2, which follows the Continental Divide National Scenic
Trail (CDNST) route south of the pass. This route is especially steep, tortuous and eroded, but it
would continue to be negotiated by an assortment of ATVs, motor bikes and four-wheel-drive
vehicles. This would remain a problem both for big game security during the hunting season
and habitat integrity in summer. The CDNST north of the pass would remain closed to wheeled
motor vehicles (although it would probably continue to pick up some illegal use). Local open
routes would total 8.9 miles in alternative 1, producing open route density of 1.3 mi/mi².

Figure 59 - Photo 43. Primitive Road #1802-B2

Primitive Road #1802-B2, an old four-wheel-drive route that follows the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail (CDNST) along the Divide ridge and eventually drops down into Priest Pass
from the south. This route would be closed to motorized use under all action alternatives.

Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would eliminate some motorized routes but would open up a currently-restricted
area to motor vehicles during the hunting season. The two primitive motorized tracks coming
through Priest Pass on the CDNST (Road #1802-B2, #335-B1, #335-B2) would be closed to
vehicles yearlong, as would the user-created route heading northward off the Priest Pass road
about two miles east of the pass (#U-205). These restrictions would enhance local big game
security and habitat effectiveness. On the other hand, alternative 2 would open now-gated
roads #335-A1 and #335-A2 to motorized use during the big game rifle season (October 15 to
December 1). While this would provide hunters easy access to new country, it is unlikely to

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

have a real impact on elk security. This area is close to a major Forest road and is heavily
worked by hunters on foot. The influx of vehicles on the newly opened roads is likely to quickly
displace any elk that might be present.
In the end, alternative 2 would maintain 7.7 miles of road open to vehicles at some time of the
year. Local open road density would be 1.1 mi/mi² during the hunting season (slightly less than
at present) and 0.7 mi/mi² the rest of the year. Snowmobile use would be eliminated on route
#1805-E1/#U-205, but otherwise would remain the same.

Alternative 3
Alternative 3 would implement all of the new closures proposed in alternative 2 (routes #1802B2, #335-B2, #U-205) but, like alternative 1, it would retain the yearlong closure for roads #335A1 and #335-A2, resulting in 4.9 miles of local roads open throughout the year. Year-round
open route density would be 0.7 mi/mi² (the same as alternative 2 outside the hunting season).
Snowmobile use would be the same as in alternative 2.

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 3 and would have the same implications for wildlife.
Elimination of 3.8 miles of strategically located primitive roads/trails and retention of the
hunting season closure on Roads #335-A1, A2 would substantially lower the potential for
motorized disturbance of wildlife.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 is nearly identical to alternatives 3 and 4. It maintains the closure on Roads #335A1 and A-2 and eliminates all other motorized routes except for the main route coming through
Priest Pass (Road #335) and the initial 0.4 mile of Road #1846 just east of the pass. Year-round
open route density would be 0.6 mi/mi².

Summary and Conclusions
Under Alternative 1, local open road/motor trail density would remain at 1.3 mi/mi². The
CDNST south of Priest Pass would remain open as a primitive four-wheel-drive road. Illegal use
of closed routes and user-created trails is likely to continue for the time being, complicating
wildlife use of this focal habitat area.
Under Alternative 2, local open route density would decline to 1.1 mi/mi² in all but the big game
rifle season. No motor trails would be retained. Four-wheel-drive roads along the CDNST would
be closed to all vehicle use. These restrictions would improve local habitat effectiveness of the
Priest Pass area in spring, summer and early fall. A short road system two miles east of the pass,
currently gated year-round, would be opened to vehicles during the big game rifle season. This
is not an area frequented by elk in mid-late fall and the change is unlikely to have much effect
on big game security.
Alternatives 3 and 4 are identical. They would establish all of the road and trail closures
proposed in alternative 2 but would also retain the year-round closure on the two miles of gated
road east of the pass. These measures would improve both habitat effectiveness and fall
security for big game and a variety of other species that move through and linger in the Priest
Pass area. Like alternative 2, these alternatives would remove motorized use from the CDNST.
Alternative 5 is identical to alternatives 3 and 4, except that it leaves open only 0.4 mile of Road
#1846 rather than 1.3 miles as in other alternatives.

Black Mountain (North) – Meyers Hill – Ophir Creek
Area Characteristics and Wildlife Issues

This area lies at the northwestern tip of the Divide landscape, just south of the Nevada
Mountain Roadless area on the Lincoln Ranger District and the Little Prickly Pear area closure on
the Helena District (established in 1999). Most of the area around Black Mountain itself is
unroaded and most (though not all) of the roads in the southern half of the area in the Ophir
Creek drainage are closed to wheeled motorized use year-round (although snowmobiles make
use of the gated road systems in winter). Forest road #136, the primary (though often difficult)
connecting route across the Divide in this area, runs along the southern border of the area.

Primary motorized access into the area is via primitive “road” #136-D1, a historic route that
ascends the southeast ridge of Black Mountain from Forest road #136. At its lower end, the first
0.5 mile of the old road, from its junction with road #136 to a worn kellihump and impromptu
parking lot at the edge of the timber, is a designated road for full-sized vehicles. The next two
miles are designated for ATVs and motor bikes. The route once provided vehicle access to the
broad forested summit of Black Mountain, but now, the four-wheel-drive track ends about 0.4
mile below the summit at a point where the CDNST, which has followed the old road to this
point, diverges around the slope to the northeast.

Figure 60 - Photo 44. Forest Road #136-D1
Forest Road #136-D1, which provides legal access for wheeled vehicles to a point about ½ mile
below the summit of Black Mountain. The road is rough, but is driven by four-wheel-drive
vehicles as well as by ATVs and trail bikes. Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 would close off the upper two
miles of the road to motor vehicles. Alternative 5 would close the entire 2.5 miles of the road
from its junction with Road #136.

Some time after 1999, motor bike and ATV users cut out and blazed a trail that follows the
abandoned final 0.4 mile of the road to the top of Black Mountain. From this point, they

WILDLIFE - 533

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

pioneered a new route down the southwest slope and out through unroaded country to private
roads in Georgia Creek, with an alternate route into the closed Forest road system in the North
Fork of Ophir Creek. This illegal route, although not shown on the alternative maps, totals 5.0
miles and has been regularly ridden, mostly by trail bikes. It has been used almost entirely for
recreational riding in summer and not as a motorized access route for hunters in the fall. Most
hunters park at the impromptu parking lot at the 0.5 mile mark of road #136-D1 and hike up the
old road (although the road is technically open to vehicles during the rifle season).

Figure 61 - Photo 45. User-Made Motor Trail Between Black Mountain and Ophir Creek

User-made motor trail, cut out and blazed through unroaded country between the end of Road
#136-D1 on Black Mountain and road systems in Ophir Creek.

The largely unroaded country around Black Mountain is a de facto extension of the Roadless
Area to the northwest and the motorized area closure to the northeast. It is heavily forested,
for the most part and provides spring, summer and fall habitat for elk, deer and moose. It is also
occupied by back bears, grizzly bears, lynx, wolverine, fishers, bobcats, mountain lions and other
species, rare and abundant. In particular, the broad benchland southwest of Black Mountain
provides complex, productive habitat and a secure movement corridor. It supports lodgepole
pine/subalpine fir/whitebark pine/Engelmann spruce old-growth forest as well as a number of
productive wet sites. The area provides refuge for hunted species in the fall (much of it falling
within an extensive elk security area). The user-made motor trail, however, threatens to
subvert summer habitat integrity throughout the area and it holds the potential to undermine
big game security if it begins to pick up motorized use during the hunting season.

Mountain Roadless Area to the northwest. This photo pre-dates the mountain pine beetle
epidemic: Much of the mature green forest seen here on Black Mountain consists of lodgepole
pine and a large proportion of it is now dead.

Effects of Alternatives
Alternative 1: Existing Condition
This alternative would preserve the existing condition. Route #136-D1 would remain open to
highway vehicles for its first 0.5 mile and to ATVs and motor bikes for the next two miles. The
primary problem with this arrangement is that the dead-end trail allows recreational riders to
get well up into the high country but then, does not provide them with a loop route. As a result,
there is a real incentive for some riders to continue along the illegal user-made route over the
top of Black Mountain and out through unroaded country to connecting routes in Ophir Creek
and Georgia Creek. Effective closure of this route has been complicated by its remoteness,
which makes enforcement difficult. This would continue to be the case. With the trail in regular
use, open route density would remain at 1.1 mi/mi².
Current snowmobile use patterns would remain in place, with “allowed” use on all open roads
and “sanctioned” use on most gated roads. The long-standing “play area” on the ridge between
Ophir and Georgia Creeks (Airplane Park) would remain, as no conflicts with big game, lynx,
wolverines, denning bears, or other wildlife have been noted.

Alternative 2
Alternative 2 would retain the first 0.5 mile of the Black Mountain road (#136-D1) as a yearlong
motor route. An existing parking site at the edge of the timber at the 0.5 mark would serve as a
WILDLIFE - 535

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

trailhead for the Black Mountain segment of the CDNST. The remainder of the route would be
closed to all motorized use year-round. With an effective closure on the road at the bottom of
the slope, the likelihood of recreational riders attempting the clandestine loop route over Black
Mountain would be substantially reduced. Likewise, monitoring and enforcement of the closure
would be much simpler. This would improve habitat effectiveness of the key wildlife zone atop
and southwest of Black Mountain. Density of routes available to wheeled vehicles would drop
from the current 1.1 mi/mi² to 0.4 mi/mi², most of the route mileage stemming from border
road #136 and some dead-end roads in Ophir Creek.
The first two miles of Road #136-D1 would be open to snowmobiles, up to the start of the usermade trail. The trail beyond there is steep, narrow and winding, often in dense timber and is
generally unattractive to snowmobiles. Other snowmobile use patterns would remain as they
are now, although usage of the gated road systems in Ophir Creek would be clarified by
specifically designating these routes as snowmobile trails, rather than allowing them to be used
without designation as at present.

Alternative 3
Like alternative 2, alternative 3 would cut off motorized use of road #136-D1 after 0.5 mile,
allowing the remainder of the route to serve as a non-motorized segment of the CDNST and
reducing potential for ATVs and motor bikes to exploit the trail as an illegal loop route through
wildland wildlife habitat. The only difference between these two scenarios is that alternative 3
would close a user-made motor trail that runs around the north side of Meyers Hill, connecting
to road #136 at both ends. The closure would not be enough, however, to drop open route
density below 0.4 mi/mi².

Alternative 4
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 2. It would close two miles of the Black Mountain road
(#136-D1) and close down the user-made Black Mountain-Ophir trail. It would leave open the
0.6 mile user-made trail at Meyers Hill. As in alternative 2, open route density for wheeled
vehicles would be 0.4 mi/mi² year-round. Snowmobile use patterns and trail designations would
be the same as in alternative 2.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 would close down the entire 2.5 mile length of Road #136-D1 to motorized uses,
beginning at its junction with Road #136. It would also close the user-made trail at Meyers Hill
and two dead-end roads runing north from Road #136 in Ophir Creek. Implications for wildlife
on Black Mountain would be essentially the same as in other action alternatives. The only
motorized routes remaining open would be the main through-route (#136) along the southern
border of the area and a short spur (#4045) leading to a dispersed camping site. Open route
density for wheeled vehicles would be 0.2 mi/mi². Road #136 would be a designated
snowmobile route.

Summary and Conclusions
Under Alternative 1, local open route density would remain at 1.2 mi/mi². The Black Mountain
road would remain open to all vehicles for 2.5 miles. There would be no legally open motor
trails, but the user-made trail off the end of the Black Mountain road would remain accessible to
motor bikers. This trail disrupts a key habitat enclave and linkage area for wildlife south of Black
Mountain, including elk, deer, black bears, grizzly bears, mountain lions, wolverines and lynx and
allows motorized access into the closed road system behind the gate in North Fork Ophir Creek.

WILDLIFE - 536

Environmental Impact Statement

Under Alternative 2, local open route density for wheeled vehicles would decline to 0.4 mi/mi².
Closure of the Black Mountain road at the 0.5 mile mark would make access to the illegal motor
trail at its upper end difficult and enforcement of the closure much easier to accomplish. The
result would be improved effectiveness of the key wildlife refugium and linkage zone south of
Black Mountain and of the North Fork Ophir Creek road closure.
Alternative 3 is the same as alternative 2 with the exception of the closure of a user-made route
on the north side of Myers Hill. Open route density for wheeled vehicles would be 0.4 mi/mi².
Alternative 4 is identical to alternative 2 and would provide the same benefits to wildlife that
result from more effective closure of the Black Mountain user-made trail. Retention of the short
user-made motor trail at Meyers Hill would be of little import to wildlife, given its proximity to
main road #136.
Alternative 5 would close the entire length of Black Mountain road (2.5 miles) and all other
motorized routes except for #136 (the main road) and a short road leading to a dispersed
camping site. Overall open route density would be 0.2 mi/mi².

Forestwide Standards

The following tables summarize consistency of the five project alternatives with Helena Forest
Plan wildlife standards [HFP (1986), p. II/17 through II/21]. All alternatives are in compliance
with all Forest Plan standards and guidelines for wildlife.
Table 124 - Forest Plan Standards for Management Indicator Species

Forestwide Management Indicator Species Standards
Populations of wildlife "indicator species" will be monitored to
measure the effect of management activities on representative
wildlife habitats with the objective of ensuring that viable
populations of existing native and desirable non-native plant
and animal species are maintained. See Chapt. IV, part D
Monitoring and Evaluation for specific monitoring
requirements. Indicator species have been identified for those
species groups whose habitat is most likely to be changed by
Forest management activities. The mature tree dependent
group indicator species is the marten; the old growth
dependent group is represented by the pileated woodpecker
and the goshawk; the snag dependent species group is
represented by the hairy woodpecker; the threatened and
endangered species include grizzly bear, gray wolf, bald eagle
and peregrine falcon; commonly hunted indicator species are
elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep.

WILDLIFE - 537

If the standard applies, how is it being met
and where in the project file is the
documentation?
Habitat has been modeled for many of the
MIS for which there are potential effects;
the documentation is in the project file. No
alternatives propose new road or trail
construction: As a result, there is no
habitat modification directly associated
with the Travel Plan. Indirectly, habitat
components in the road corridors, primarily
snags and logs, will be removed by
firewood cutters. This removal is
insufficient to influence local population
structure or regionwide viability. For
species directly influenced by road density
(grizzly bear, elk, mule deer, marten), no
alternative increases density and the four
action alternatives decrease it.

On important summer and winter range, adequate thermal and

potential.
An environmental analysis for project work will include a cover

Subject to hydrologic and other resource constraints, elk
summer range will be maintained at 35 percent or greater
hiding cover and areas of winter range will be maintained at 25
percent or greater thermal cover in drainages or elk herd units.
Implement an aggressive road management program to
maintain or improve big game security. To decide which roads,
trails and areas should be restricted and opened, the Forest will
use the following guidelines developed with the Montana
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP). The Forest
visitor map will document the road management program.
Road management will be implemented to at least maintain big
game habitat capability and hunting opportunity. To provide
for a first week bull elk harvest that does not exceed 40 percent
of the total bull harvest, roads will be managed during the

indicated by heart rot, mistletoe, dead or broken tree tops and
moss.
Five percent of each third order drainage should be managed

drainage is: first, land below 6,000 feet in elevation; second,
riparian zones and mesic drainage heads; and third,
management areas emphasizing wildlife habitat. These areas
will normally be managed on a 240 year rotation and will range
from 10 acres to several hundred acres.
Management areas other than T-1 through T-5 will be the

Table 128: Forest Plan Standards for Snags
Forestwide Snag Standards
To keep an adequate snag resource (standing dead trees)
through the planning horizon, snags should be managed at 70
percent of optimum (average of two snags/acre) within each
third order drainage.

Snag management guidelines need not be applied within a
quarter mile of riparian areas, because riparian standards
should provide for adequate snags.
Larch, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, spruce and subalpine fir, in
that priority, are the preferred species for snags and
replacement trees (live trees left to replace existing snags).
Management areas other than T-1 should be the primary
source for snag management. However, if adequate snags
cannot be found outside of T-1, then the following numbers
and sizes of snags should be retained in cutting units, if
available. In units with snags, keep a minimum of 20 snags and
10 replacement trees per 10 acres, if available. If 20 snags are
not available, then any combination totaling 30 should be left,
by the following diameter-at-breast-height classes:
13 snags and 6 replacement trees from 7 to 11 inches
5 snags and 3 replacement trees from 12 to 19 inches
2 snags and 1 replacement trees 20+ inches
In units, except those of pure lodgepole, without snags keep a
minimum of 30 wind firm trees per 10 acres, if available, by the
following dbh classes:
21 trees from 7 to 11 inches
7 trees from 12 to 19 inches
2 trees from 20+ inches
If wildlife funds are available, a third of the replacement trees
should be girdled or otherwise killed to provide snags, by the
following dbh classes:
7 trees from 7 to 11 inches dbh
2 trees form 12 to 19 inches dbh
1 tree form 20+ inches dbh

FOREST PLAN PROGRAMMATIC AMENDMENT
Public Involvement
The Divide Travel Plan DEIS included a proposal to replace the existing Forest Standard 4a with a new
standard. Public input was solicited on that proposal and used to inform a new amendment which was
also released for public comment prior to the FEIS. The comments received on these efforts and the
Forest’s response, are summarized in appendix D of the FEIS.

Purpose and Need for Amendment
The Helena National Forest Plan (Forest Plan) (USDA 1986) established standards for managing National
Forest Service road systems as a method to maintain or improve big game security 5 during the hunting
season. Under the 1986 Forest Plan, big game security is based on the relationship between open road
densities during big game rifle season and the amount of hiding cover within an elk herd unit (EHU).
Meeting this Forest Plan standard has been problematic for several reasons. The Forest Plan was based
on research conducted for the most part off-Forest in other locations (USDA 1983, p. 10). Much of the
hiding cover research upon which the standard was crafted was conducted in forests that tended to be
more heavily forested than the HELENA NATIONAL FOREST. While several of these studies acknowledge
the more open terrain the further east one goes in Montana, the numeric determinant was primarily
based on west side models.
Furthermore, the original analysis unit was intended to be a “habitat analysis unit” (HAU) that
approximated the home range of elk during the summer-fall period (10 to 40 square miles) (USDA 1978,
p. 21). The HAU scale generally approximated a timber compartment unit (Ibid). Forest Plan Standard
4a provides for an analysis unit that is a “large geographic area, such as a timber sale analysis area, a
5

Big game security in the Forest Plan is defined according to the existing hiding cover to open road density ratio
and is intended to “maintain big game habitat capability and hunting opportunity” (Standard 4a, USDA 1986, p.
II/17). Security in the amendment to the existing Forest Plan Standard 4a is generally defined as “the area that
will, during periods of hunting stress, hold elk because of geography, topography, vegetation, or a combination of
those features” (Lyons and Christensen 1992) and specifically is measured as large blocks > 250 acres in size, > ½
mile from an open motorized route during the hunting season which is defined as 10/15 through 12/1. Security
and vulnerability are often used interchangeably but actually reflect a causal relationship: when security is high
vulnerability tends to be low and vice-versa. Vulnerability is generally described as “a measure of elk susceptibility
to being killed during the hunting season” (Lyons and Christensen 1992). See the section Concept of Elk Security for
more information.

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 543

Divide Travel Plan

third order drainage, or an elk herd unit” (USDA 1986 p. II/18). In the Divide landscape, herd unit sizes
range from 55 to 136 square miles; areas much larger than the original intent. Legal interpretations
have confounded the Forest’s ability to apply Standard 4a at the intended geographic scope. It’s
impractical to apply a standard at an area many times greater in size than the intended scope.
In the twenty nine years since the development of the Forest Plan, a substantial amount of scientific
studies, surveys and other information have been accrued. These studies have suggested other
measures that are also appropriate for measuring big game security and are more closely tied to open
motorized route densities during times of elk stress and increased vulnerability (i.e. hunting season). In
addition, the elk harvest metrics used by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP) to
evaluate and manage elk vulnerability during the hunting season (the reason for providing security) have
evolved, leaving part of the standard as currently written useless because it relies on data methods no
longer available or in practice. As a result, public access is being constrained without the clear benefits
for elk envisioned by the standard.
This programmatic Forest Plan amendment for the Divide Travel Plan project area is needed to more
closely align current science, local conditions and other information with the needs of big game,
particularly elk, which meet the intent of the Forest Plan. The amendment considers the impacts of
open motorized routes on elk security, establishes blocks of secure habitat and can be measured
regardless of changes in hiding cover. While the proposed amendment decouples hiding cover from
security during the hunting season, several Forestwide and Management Area standards remain in place
that govern management of hiding cover.
The assumptions built into the existing (1986) Forestwide Standard 4a (hereafter Standard 4a) have not
proven useful in gauging or guiding management activities under the Forest Plan. Actual elk populations
and trends as monitored over the last twenty nine years simply do not correlate with this existing
standard or its assumptions. Elk numbers have consistently increased during this time period and the
existing standard needs to be revised to address recent elk management challenges.

Background
Overview
Elk serve as a management indicator for hunted species for the Forest (USDA 1986, p. II/17). As such,
the Forest Plan contains Forestwide and Management Area specific goals, objectives and standards. The
Forest Plan also provides a description of the desired future condition which would result from carrying
out planned management practices (Ibid, pp. II/12-14). These big game goals, objectives and standards
were designed to provide habitat on the Forest to support an elk population of 6400 elk by the year
2000 in support of State of Montana goals for harvestable elk (Ibid, p. V/5). There were an estimated
4900 elk on the Forest in 1981 (Ibid, p. V/5).
Many of the factors affecting elk numbers and distribution are beyond the control of National Forest
managers. Examples include hunting regulations/pressure, nonhuman predation, winter kill, disease,
climate change, stochastic events and lack of public access to hunt big game on private land (MFWP and
USDA 2013 p. 3). The intent of Forest Plan goals, objectives and standards are to guide habitat
management on National Forest System lands.
Forest Plan goals, objectives and desired future conditions for wildlife, including big game are:
•
•

Goal: Maintain and improve the habitat over time to support big game and other
wildlife species (USDA 1986, p. II/1).
Objective: To maintain elk habitat capacity, an annual program of habitat improvement
will be implemented (Ibid, p. II/4).

Divide Travel Plan

Desired future condition: By the end of the first decade, wildlife range will be improved
to increase forage production; the wildlife potential on winter range should increase
slightly while the potential on summer range should remain at current [1986] levels. By
the end of the fifth decade, the Forest’s ability to support elk on winter range will
increase, while the ability to support elk on summer range will decrease slightly (Ibid,
pp. II/12-14)

The Forest Plan contains Forestwide big game standards and big game standards specific to the
management areas identified in the Forest Plan. These standards are summarized in the following table
which includes only those management areas within the Divide Travel Plan project area for which a big
game standard is in place.

Forest Service definition - a timber stand which conceals 90 percent or more of a standing elk at 200

MFWP definition - a stand of coniferous trees having a crown closure of greater than 40 percent.

The existing hiding cover to open road density ratio should be determined over a large geographic area,
such as a timber sale analysis area, a third order drainage, or an elk herd unit.”
Big game security, according to this standard, is based on the relationship between the amount of hiding
cover in an EHU and the open road density during big game rifle season. Hiding cover is defined as
either a timber stand which conceals 90 percent or more of a standing elk at 200 feet, which can only be
measured in the field, stand by stand; or as stands of coniferous trees having a crown closure greater
than 40 percent, which can be determined by aerial photo interpretation and satellite imagery 6 (USDA
1986, p. II/18). Under the Forest Plan, either method is acceptable (USDA 1986, p. II/18). Open road
densities include all motorized routes open during the big game rifle season, October 15 through
December 1 and are calculated at 100 percent the length of all public roads and 25 percent the length of
private roads. This relationship is based on research that indicates roads with less use have reduced
impacts to elk (Perry and Overly 1976, Witmer and deCalesta 1985 and Rowland et al. 2000).
The Standard 4a security index is calculated for EHUs that include all lands, public and private, within the
respective EHU. This means that elk security as determined by this index is also a function of road
densities and timber harvest on private lands outside management control of the HELENA NATIONAL
FOREST. Elk may use habitat differently relative to hiding cover and motorized routes on private land
which often has different hunting pressure levels than public land.
Big game security in the Divide Travel Plan project area, as currently measured by Standard 4a, will not
improve in the foreseeable future because hiding cover will decline as trees killed by the ongoing bark
beetle epidemic begin to fall en masse over the next few years. Motorized route density management
on the Forest cannot entirely compensate for this loss of cover, so the standard as currrently written will
remain unmet in some of the EHUs in the project area. At the same time, elk numbers and bull/cow
rations in the project area vary in terms of MFWP’s objectives depending on the respective HD.

6

This analysis utilizes the MDFWP definition of hiding cover – i.e. stands of coniferous trees having a crown closure
greater than 40 percent. The 40 percent canopy cover metric is an acceptable ‘proxy’ for mapping hiding cover as
it is generally assumed that stands with 40 percent canopy cover or greater would in turn provide adequate
screening cover that would hide 90 percent of an elk at 200 feet, the functional definition of hiding cover . This
relationship of canopy cover and stand structure is based on modeling done by Lonner and Cada (1982) and others
that used canopy cover to predict the relationship between hiding cover (as estimated by canopy cover), road
densities and harvest rate the first week of the general hunting season.

Relationship of Forest Plan Standard 4a and Elk Management
Forest Plan Elk Population Goals
Elk numbers have been increasing across the west and in Montana since the early to mid- 1900s.
Statewide, elk numbers have increased from 8,000 in 1922 to 55,000 in 1978 to about 160,000 in 2004
(MFWP 2005, pp. 4-5). Thus, there are no viability concerns for Rocky Mountain elk in Montana or on
the Forest. This is also supported by their global status of “G5’ and the statewide status of ‘S5’ which
are both defined as “common, widespread and abundant…” 7 However, elk remain a management
indicator species on the Forest and are an economically and socially important species, with large public
interest. They continue to provide hunting, wildlife viewing and photography opportunities, as well as
fill the ecological roles associated with having this native species on the landscape. Forest Plan direction
related to big game is in place to ensure that sufficient habitat is available to maintain elk on public land
in order to provide those consumptive and non-consumptive uses (USDA 1986, pp. II/17-18).
The big game standards found in the Helena National Forest Plan are based on state population goals
outlined in The Northern Regional Plan (USDA 1981, pp. 4-16 and B-3). The Montana goals were derived
from the 1978 Montana Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP 1978). Big game
goals and objectives embodied in the Montana plan included maintaining “an available supply of big
game to meet demand for all types of big game oriented recreation while insuring the protection and
perpetuation of all big game species and their ecosystems” (Ibid, p. 3). Statewide goals for elk in
particular included protecting and perpetuating “elk and their habitat and to increase the supply of
available, harvestable elk to meet demands for hunting and non-hunting recreation” (Ibid, p. 35). The
Montana Plan delineated goals and objectives by the respective ‘Fish and Game Regions’, the same
regions in place today.
According to the Northern Regional Plan there were approximately 70,000 elk on the National Forests in
Montana around 1981 (USDA 1981, p. 4-16 Table IV-4). State population goals projected for 1995 were
intended to satisfy the growing demand for hunting and aesthetic purposes. The Nothern Regional Plan
identified desired population goals by State (Ibid, p. 4-17 Table IV-5) and National Forest based on those
statewide goals (Ibid, p. B-3 Table B-3). The disaggregated total for the Helena National Forest was
6,400 by year 2000.
The Helena National Forest is located within several hunting districts identified by MFWP (Figure 63).
The total number of elk that have been observed in these hunting districts through the 2014 aerial
surveys is 14,736 (MFWP aerial survey data). Some of these hunting districts barely overlap with the
Helena National Forest. Discounting those HDs, the total number of elk that have been observed on and
around the Forest is 11,349 – although this is probably an underestimate because elk that occur in the
‘discounted’ HDs do spend some time on the Forest. Nevertheless, the number of elk associated with
the Helena National Forest is well in excess of the 6,400 population target identified in the Helena
National Forest Plan (USDA 1986, p. V/5).
Montana has maintained the longest general elk-hunting season (5-weeks) of all western states; a
tradition that has been in place for several decades. When the Forest Plan was crafted in 1986,
Standard 4a was established to facilitate that longer hunting season while maintaining and/or improving
big game security that would ensure that elk populations post-harvest remained aligned with MFWP
objectives (USDA 1986, pp. 11/17-18 and V/5). At that time, MFWP collected data to determine the

percentage of bulls harvested during the first week of the general big game hunting season, as reflected
in Standard 4a. However, MFWP no longer collects that data. Rather, MFWP now relies on bull to cow
ratios measured through aerial survey trend counts. These trends are used to determine and adjust
harvest regulations that allow MFWP to achieve their elk population objectives (MFWP 2005).

MFWP Elk Management
Elk management during the hunting season focuses on maintaining population numbers well above
viability thresholds, protecting certain sex and age classes from over-harvest, providing public hunting
opportunity and attempting to balance elk distribution across public and private lands. While these
functions are a responsibility of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the Helena National Forest strives to
complement their efforts by managing elk habitat on the National Forest. The Forest Service goal has
been to provide habitat conditions that allow a reasonable number of elk to escape hunters so that
MFWP does not have to reduce the allowable harvest or shorten the hunting season (USDA 1986).
Hunting pressure can affect both elk numbers and distribution and is partially determined by the
hunting regulations (season length and structure – i.e. cow tags, either sex, brow-tined only, spikes,
limited draw, etc.). The current five-week season “permits a diversity of choice [for hunters] with regard
to time, weather conditions, hunter density and area…” (Lonner and Cada 1982 cited in Hillis et al.
1991).
The State of Montana manages elk populations on an Elk Management Unit basis and establishes elk
harvest regulations on a hunting district basis, which are sub-divisions of Elk Management Units (MFWP
2005). Hunting districts are further sub-divided into EHUs, which are the units used by the Helena
National Forest to analyze security under Standard 4a (USDA 1986, p. II/18). Depending upon location,
EHUs contain varying amounts of National Forest System land, which complicates elk security analyses
for National Forest projects and limits the amount of influence management on National Forest System
lands can actually have on overall security within an individual EHU and/or larger management unit. Elk
may use habitat on private land differently where hunting pressure can be much different than that
found on public land.
The Divide Travel Plan project area includes two elk management units (EMU) and their respective
hunting districts (HD) as defined by the state-wide Montana Final Elk Management Plan (MFWP 2005):

(MFWP 2005) for more information and Table 132. There are also inherent differences in habitat
amongst EMUs. Following is a brief synopsis of the factors influencing elk management in the four HDs
within which the Divide Travel Plan project area occurs. (See also the Wildlife Specialist Report and
Biological Evaluation, North American Elk section, for more analysis regarding these HDs.)

Figure 64 - Observed elk in HD 293, 2005-2014.
The black line represents the annual fluctuations in numbers of elk observed; the red line indicates trend.

Hunting District 293
Elk numbers have fluctuated over the past several years in HD 293 (MFWP HD 293 Elk Surveys 20052007, 2009, 2010, 2012-2014) (Figure 64). However, the number of animals observed and calf survival
in the northern half of the HD has noticeably declined in recent years. Much of the decline has been
attributed to rising predation from mountain lions, wolves, black bears and grizzly bears, whose
populations have all burgeoned at the same time, due to a variety of circumstances [J. Kolbe, quoted in
the Helena Independent Record, Feb. 26, 2012]. Other factors, including several years of drought,
changes in vegetation patterns from large fires and hunting quotas over the last decade, may be
contributing to the observed shifts in elk (and deer) population size and structure. But predation
appears to be the primary limiting factor in the northern half of HD 293. Meanwhile, in the south half of
the district (the Avon Valley south of the Ogden Mtn–Dalton Mtn ridge), predation has not been an
obvious problem for big game populations. MFWP objectives for elk populations continue to be met in
the southern half of HD 293.

The black line represents the annual fluctuations in numbers of elk observed; the red line indicates trend.

Hunting District 215
Elk numbers have steadily increased in HD 215 over the last several years while bull/cow ratios have
tended to be erratic (MFWP HD 215 Elk Surveys 2005, 2006, 2009-2014) (Figure 65). The percentage of
mature bulls in the population has decreased which may be an indication of hunting pressure too heavy
for the available security during the hunting season. Calf numbers have also been down in the past two
years; the reason for the drop off in calf production/ survival is unknown but does not appear to be a
result of an increase in predation pressure. A number of wolf packs have centered their activity along
the western edge of the Forest and in the adjacent ranchlands since 1995, but until 2012, calf/cow ratios
remained in the range of 30 to 40 calves/100 cows year after year (and the overall population continued
to increase). With the removal of wolves from the Endangered Species List and the advent of the State
wolf hunting season in 2010, the ability of wolves to impact livestock and big game populations in this
area has been minimal. Wolves attacking livestock have been dispatched quickly and there has been no
evidence of their having built up sufficient strength to measurably affect the local elk population.
Until recently, elk moving off the Forest to the west had been able to settle in a large block of private
ranchland in the Spotted Dog country, which was been off-limits to public hunting. Elk began moving to
this winter range area as early as the start of the bow season in September. The move may be a direct
response to pressure from bow hunters and motorized recreation on the Forest, but it may also reflect
an established pattern of migration down to secure and benign valley habitat regardless of other
circumstances. MFWP felt that the refuge provided by this private land suppressed hunting opportunity
and allowed the elk population to maintain itself well in excess of Motana Elk Management Plan
objectives (although mature bull numbers remained low) (MFWP 2005). In August 2010, the State was
able to purchase most of this land and convert it to a Wildlife Mangement Area. Public hunting is now
allowed, but most of the area is off-limits to motor vehicles, which tempers the effect. In spite of the
change in ownership and management, elk continue to move to this off-Forest area and recent
population trends in HD 215 still hold.

Figure 66 - Observed elk in HD 343, 2005-2014.
The black line represents the annual fluctuations in numbers of elk observed; the red line indicates trend.

Hunting District 343
Elk trend counts in HD 343 have been relatively stable with the exception of 2009 and 2010 (MFWP HD
343 Elk Surveys 2006 to 2014) (Figure 66). Given the absence of a commensurate increase in hunter
success and natural mortality (although mortality due to wolf kills has increased somewhat over the last
decade), or a drop in calf production and survival, MFWP suspects that the lower winter counts
reflected the switch to a less effective survey method and movement of elk off winter range prior to
survey flights rather than a large population decline. The 2014 count however was within objectives.

Hunting District 335
Elk trend counts in HD 335 have also been within population objectives in terms of elk counted during
aerial surveys with the exception of 2009 and 2010 (below objective) and 2012 to 2014 (above
objective) (MFWP HD 335 Elk Surveys 2005-2014) (Figure 67). MFWP believes that the lower counts
were a function of a less effective survey method and of elk having moved off winter range by the time
surveys were conducted [see MFWP HD 335 Elk Surveys for 2010 and 2011]. There was no evidence of a
sudden increase in hunter success, elevated natural mortality, or decreased calf production/survival that
might initiate a downward trend in local elk numbers. MFWP biologists felt that the increase in elk
numbers may have been a function of mild winters, increased travel restrictions in the Clancy-Unionville
area of the Forest and fewer hunting permits for antlerless elk.

The black line represents the annual fluctuations in numbers of elk observed; the red line
indicates trend.

MFWP feels that elk in HD 335 are being impacted by livestock grazing, partly on the Forest, but more so
on privately-owned winter ranges. In addition, MFWP believes that the big Montana Tunnels mine east
of the Forest on Clancy Creek has reduced winter range opportunity for elk (and more so for mule deer)
in the area southwest of Jefferson City east of the Forest boundary. Because native forage is limited, elk
turn to agricultural fields and haystacks stockpiled for winter livestock feed. This, in turn, has led to
ranchers requesting special hunts to trim elk numbers. Elk numbers have been particularly high over the
last three years, in spite of deficient elk security in the Quartz Creek EHU on the Forest. As with some
other local hunting districts, elk are taking advantage of closed private lands off the Forest for security,
allowing the population to expand.

Correlation between Standard 4a and Elk Numbers
Helena Forest Plan standards and guidelines for big game are designed to maintain habitat conditions on
the Forest that help MFWP meet its goals for local elk populations. MFWP’s primary tool in managing
elk is the manipulation of hunting regulations. The Forest Service is able to influence the equation by
managing vegetation (cover and forage) and controlling hunter vehicle access on different parts of the
Forest. In spite of this reasonably well-defined division of responsibility, there remain some challenges
in coordinating management between agencies.
The quality of aerial survey data on which MFWP bases much of its annual population estimates can
vary widely from year to year and from one hunting district to another. This is a function of weather
conditions, snow cover, variable elk movement patterns and inherent viewing difficulty imposed by
topography and vegetation.
The scale of analysis units between MFWP and the Forest also presents some challenges. MFWP sets its
elk population objectives for elk management units (EMUs) and hunting districts (HDs) while the Forest
sets its elk habitat standards at the elk herd unit scale. EMUs and HDs are generally much larger than an
elk herd unit; as such, it’s difficult to correlate population trends at that larger scale to habitat changes
on a smaller scale.
Additionally some population metrics such as overall elk population levels may be as determined outside
of the hunting season as by what happens during the hunting season. For example, body fat condition,

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 556

Environmental Impact Statement

pregnancy rates and recruitment into the population may be determined outside of the hunting season,
but have dramatic effects on populations.
Table 133 summarizes the current status of each EHU in the Divide Travel Plan project area relative to
this index and includes reference to MFWP’s population objectives. There is not a strong correlation
between consistency with Standard 4a for a particular EHU and the actual performance of the elk
population within the relative Hunting District. For example, the Greenhorn EHU, which currently does
not meet Standard 4a, is located within HDs 293, 335 and 343. HD 293 is currently below objectives for
elk numbers and bull/cow ratios while HD 335 and 343 meet both objectives. Yet hiding cover is subpar
relative to Standard 4a in that EHU. Another example includes the Jericho and Little Prickly Pear/Ophir
EHUs both of which are partially located within HD 293. The Jericho EHU meets Standard 4a while the
Little Prickly Pear/Ophir EHU does not. Compliance, or lack thereof, with Standard 4a is not a good
indicator of elk population performance given the patterns of land ownership and other factors affecting
elk security and/or population levels.

Recent Science regarding Elk Management
The Forest Plan direction found in the original Forest Plan is 29 years old and does not reflect the
subsequent 29 years of relevant science and data, changing issues with regards to elk, or changing elk
numbers and distribution. The original Forest Plan standard for measuring elk security in the hunting
season uses an index that combines open road density and hiding cover. While this relationship can be
informative, it does not account for the spatial arrangement and size of unroaded patches, topography
as a mediator of hunter access, the distribution of forage and other factors that influence the ability of
elk to survive the hunting season. Research since the crafting of the Helena Forest Plan emphasizes,
among other factors, the effects of open motorized routes on elk security.
Effects of roads on wildlife have been widely studied for years (Trombulak and Frissell 2000, Switalski
2006, among others). Fahrig and Rytwinski (2009, at page 3) summarized research related to the effects
of roads and traffic on 130 species of wildlife; these studies concluded that roads negatively affect
wildlife, particularly large mammals. Rowland et al. (2004, pp. 2-3) documented similar results with
regards to elk: (1) elk avoid areas near open roads; (2) elk vulnerability to mortality from hunter harvest
increases as open road density increases; and (3) elk exhibit higher levels of stress in areas of higher
road density.
More recently, in A Brief Review of the Scientific Literature on Elk, Roads and Traffic, McCorquodale
(2013) synthesized the published research across a broad geographic range on the effects of roads and
traffic on elk. These studies overwhelmingly concluded that high road densities and traffic negatively
affect elk use and where hunted, elk vulnerability to excessive mortality.
Although the body of scientific literature strongly indicates that road density is the primary factor
influencing elk distribution, cover may be important for bull elk survival during the hunting season.
McCorquodale (2003) found that bull elk in the Cascade Range of Washington tended to select for
mature forests more than cow elk. Unsworth and others (1998) found that in Idaho, cows and bull elk
older than 2 years selected for timbered habitats in roaded areas (~3 mi/mi2) and more open timbered
habitat in non-roaded areas (~0.5 mi/mi2) with older bulls showing the strongest preference for
timbered types. Still, other studies indicate that hiding cover may not be a factor in explaining elk
mortality if hunting pressure overwhelms an otherwise secure landscape (Hayes et al. 2002 at 497,
Weber (1996) as cited in Skovlin et al. 2002 at 552) or if elk exhibit certain behavioral patterns that
affect the probability of being harvested during the hunting season (Ciuti et al. 2012).
Still, forest stands that do not meet the definition of hiding cover may prove to be secure areas for elk
where local conditions of topography, remoteness and environmental barriers impede hunter access.
Conversely, blocks of hiding cover situated in areas with high levels of motorized use may be highly
insecure. Hiding cover has a role to play but it is not necessarily synonymous with security (Lyon and
Canfield 1991; Unsworth and Kuck 1991; Lyon and Christensen 1992; Christensen et al. 1993,
Stubblefield et al. 2006 p. 1068, Montgomery et al. 2013, p. 322, Proffitt et al. 2013).
In summary, the big game security index, as currently formulated, could be difficult to meet throughout
most of and possibly all of, the Divide landscape in the foreseeable future (25-50 years), not necessarily
because of deficiencies in travel management, but because of the natural loss of hiding cover associated
with the mountain pine beetle related tree mortality and because of travel management decisions
outside of the Forest’s jurisdiction. The current standard also has an objective based on elk
management metrics (percent of bull harvest occurring during the first week of the general big game
hunting season) that are no longer being collected by MFWP. Additionally, despite declines in cover, elk
numbers continue to exceed the Forest Plan benchmark (6,400 elk by the year 2000), indicating that the
link between cover on National Forest System lands and elk security, as reflected by stable or increasing

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 560

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

elk populations and/or bull to cow ratios, is not as strong as envisioned when the Forest Plan was
developed. As a result, attempts to implement the current standard are placing impractical constraints
on Forest management and on the ability of the public to use the Forest and may not be having the
effect on elk as it was understood twenty nine years ago.

The Concept of Elk Security Areas
Standard 4a addresses big game security. It was developed in response to concerns about both big
game habitat capabilities as well as hunting opportunity and to address one key factor in overall elk
vulnerability during the hunting season – the proportion of bull elk harvest occurring during the first
week of the (general) hunting season (USDA 1986 at II-17). Elk vulnerability during the hunting season is
defined as “a measure of elk susceptibility to being killed during the hunting season” and is generally
considered to be the opposite of security (Lyon and Christensen 1992, Stalling et al. 2002). It is a
concept that is the sum of many factors including security, hunter opportunity and elk behavior.
Security is defined as “the protection inherent in any situation that allows elk to remain in a defined area
despite an increase in stress or disturbance associated with the hunting season or other human activity”
(Lyon and Christensen 1992, Stalling et al. 2002). Security is the result of a combination of factors that
allow elk to remain in a specific area while under stress from hunting (Christensen et al. 1993). The
components of security may include vegetation, topography, road density, size of vegetation blocks and
hunter density, among others (Lyon and Christensen 1992).
Lonner (1991) outlined three key aspects of elk vulnerability during the hunting season:
•
•
•

Maintaining good habitat security that would protect elk from becoming easy prey
during the hunting season;
Preserving or recovering desired elk population characteristics and distributions in the
face of intensifying land management practices; and
Satisfying the growing demand for quality elk hunting and non-hunting experiences.

Thomas (1991) provided even more detail, stating that elk vulnerability during the hunting season,
particularly of bull elk, during the hunting season, is consistently related to the following factors:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increasing densities of roads open to traffic hunter access and numbers;
Increasing numbers and densities of hunters;
Decreasing amounts of cover;
Fragmentation of cover into smaller patches;
No restrictions on bull harvest – i.e., all antlered animals are legal game;
Setting of open seasons that include the rutting period;
Improving “technology” of hunting including weapons, vehicles, calls and training tools;
and
Longer hunting season;
Relatively gentle terrain;
Increasing number of hunter days.

Although the terms elk security and elk vulnerability during the hunting season are strongly related and
are often used interchangeably, it is important to remember that they are actually inversely related – as
security declines elk vulnerability during the hunting season increases (Stalling et al. 2002 – citing
Youmans 1992).

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 561

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

In the Divide landscape (as on much of the Helena National Forest), elk security during the hunting
season is an important determinant of elk abundance and population structure. While the ability of elk
to survive the hunting season is influenced by a number of environmental circumstances, the status of
the local Forest road system – and subsequent hunter access - is often the key factor (Proffitt et al.
2009). Several studies have documented the effect of roads on elk security, population structure and
hunter success (Edge and Marcum 1991; Leptich and Zager 1991; Unsworth and Kuck 1991; Gratson and
Whitman 2000, Gucinski et al. 2001, Grigg 2007). While most studies demonstrate that open roads
influence elk distribution during the hunting season and that road closures can lower the kill rate in a
given area, at least one study indicates that in certain circumstances road closures do not alter hunter
success (Burbridge and Neff 1976 cited in Gratson and Whitman 2000). In some cases, displacement of
elk from roaded public land into more remote terrain (or to inaccessible private land) early in the
hunting season can serve to depress the kill rate throughout the remainder of the season. Obviously
hunting season and structure can have a direct effect on hunting pressure and the resulting situation for
elk in addition to habitat management.
Since the release of the Helena Forest Plan in 1986, field research in Montana and Idaho has led to the
concept of “elk security areas” as a basis for assessing elk vulnerability during the hunting season. The
degree to which elk are able to survive the fall hunt is seen, in large part, to be a function of the size and
pattern of habitat blocks, amply forested in some cases, to which hunter access is limited. Hillis and
others (1991) developed an analysis procedure (generally referred to as the “Hillis Paradigm”) based on
the availability of large non-linear blocks of habitat (≥250 acres) at least ½ mile from open roads. As a
rule of thumb, Hillis et al. recommended that at least 30 percent of the “hunting season home range”
within a “standardized habitat analysis unit” be held in security areas (Hillis et al. 1991, p. 39). Hillis
cautioned, however, that this set of parameters was designed for densely-forested western Montana elk
habitat and that, particularly for areas further eastward where forest cover may be limited, security
requirements should be evaluated on a site-specific basis and the guidelines adjusted so that the results
make biological sense in a local setting (Hillis et al. 1991, p. 40; Christensen et al. 1993, p. 5). The
underpinnings of this methodology – i.e. elk tend to avoid open motorized routes during the hunting
season - has been well documented in the scientific literature and reinforced through the work of
Unsworth and others (1991, 1993), Rowland and others. (2000, 2005) and Proffitt and others (2013), to
name just a few.
It’s important to keep in mind that the Forest Plan Standard 4a was designed to address MFWP elk
objectives in place at the time of Forest Plan development and to support existing hunting regulations.
These objectives were tallied up to a Forestwide level with the intent to provide habitat sufficient for
6,400 elk. The standard addressed the need for distribution of elk across the landscape by setting the
standard at the herd unit level; however, the objectives were intended to be realized Forestwide.

Alternative Description

Alternative A – No Action Alternative
Alternative A, the No Action Alternative, is the existing Forest Plan Standard. In this case, ‘no action’
means no amendment to the existing Forest Plan. The analysis of effects associated with Alternative A
describes the effects of the current Forest Plan standard. The exact language of the current standard is
as follows:

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 562

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Forestwide Standard 4a (USDA 1986, pp. II/17 – II/18)
Road management will be implemented to at least maintain big game habitat capability and hunting
opportunity. To provide for a first week bull elk harvest that does not exceed 40 percent of the total bull
harvest, roads will be managed during the general big game hunting season to maintain open road
densities with the following limits. (See Table 130)
The existing hiding cover to open road density ratio should be determined over a large geographic area,
such as a timber sale analysis area, a third order drainage, or an elk herd unit.
Alternative A is considered in detail in this analysis (See Comparison of Alternatives, below).

Alternative B
Alternative B was designed to address best science and local knowledge. It also expanded consideration
to all open motorized routes (whereas Alternative A technically only applies to roads as originally
envisioned in the Forest Plan). Alternative B would replace the existing Forest Plan Standard 4a.
The Divide Travel Plan project area encompasses only about three-quarters of the Divide landscape
(portions of the Quartz, Black Mtn – Brooklyn Bridge and Little Prickly Pear – Ophir EHUs falling into
areas covered by previous travel management plans); however, the proposed amendment applies to all
the portions of the herd units within the Forest administrative boundary that overlap with the Divide
Travel Plan project area.
Under the Forest Plan amendment proposed as part of the Divide Travel Plan and applicable to future
projects in the Divide landscape , the “security area” approach replaces the “road density/hiding cover
index” as the Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability of elk to hunting. The amendment
derives from the “Hillis Paradigm” (1991) and adopts specific guidelines for its application from the U.S.
Forest Service and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Collaborative Recommendations for
Big Game Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin,Helena and Lewis and Clark National Forests
(MFWP and USDA Working Group 2013). The exact language of the standard is as follows 8:

Standard
Road management will be implemented to maintain or improve big game security and hunting
opportunity.
Road management will also be implemented to maintain or improve big game intermittent refuge areas.
This standard applies only to the National Forest System lands within those portions of the following elk
herd units that are within the Helena Ranger District, Helena National Forest administrative boundary –
Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge, Greenhorn, Jericho, Little Prickly Pear-Ophir, Quartz Creek and Spotted
Dog-Little Blackfoot.

Note that the standard in its final form will include those security and intermittent refuge area percentages
associated with the alternative selected in the Divide Travel Plan decision.

Other Use: Administrative use for travel on routes that are closed to public motorized use is permitted
subject to existing authorization procedures (i.e. variances approved by line officers are required prior to
use of motorized routes closed to the public).
Temporary reductions associated with management activities in security blocks and intermittent refuge
areas between 9/1 and 12/1 are allowed as long as impacts to elk or elk security are mitigated at the
project level. Temporary reductions will be evaluated and effects analyzed (including cumulative effects)
at the project level and reviewed by a wildlife biologist. It is at this scale and time when project design
features and/or mitigations would be applied to ensure that impacts to elk or elk security during hunting
season are addressed and reduced during implementation of the project. Temporary reductions are
managed at the project scale and at the herd unit (or across herd units where security blocks cross into
one or more herd units) to ensure big game security during the 9/1 to 12/1 hunting season is maintained
or improved over the long term.
Permanent changes (e.g. reduction in overall secure acres) are allowed in elk security areas as long as
the overall percent of elk security in a herd unit does not decrease and a site-specific analysis indicates
that elk are unlikely to be negatively impacted by that change.
Permanent changes are allowed in intermittent refuge areas as long as the overall percent of
intermittent areas in a herd unit does not decrease and a site-specific analysis indicates that elk are
unlikely to be negatively impacted by that change OR if the decrease is due to those acres becoming part
of a security area.

Exceptions to the Standard
Emergency situations are not subject to this standard.

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 564

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Standard Definitions
Security is defined as a proportion of an elk herd unit within the administrative boundary of the Helena
Ranger District that consists of an area of at least 1000 acres in size that is at least ½ mile from a
motorized route open to the public between 9/1 and 12/1. Security blocks are adjusted for constrictions
less than or equal to ½ mile in width. Security is calculated across all ownerships within the
administrative boundary.
Intermittent Refuge Areas are defined as those areas at least 250 acres in size and less than 1000 acres
in size that are greater than or equal to ½ mile from a motorized route open to the public between 9/1
and 12/1. Intermittent Refuge Areas are adjusted for constrictions less than or equal to ½ mile in width.
Intermittent Refuge Areas are calculated across all ownerships within the administrative boundary.
Administrative use for travel on motorized routes is defined as vehicle use associated with management
activities or projects on National Forest land administered by the Forest Service or under authorization of
the Forest Service. Management Activities include but are not limited to, law enforcement, timber
harvest, reforestation, cultural treatments, prescribed fire, watershed restoration, wildlife and fish
habitat improvement, private land access, allotment management activities and mineral exploration and
development that occur on National Forest land administered by the Forest Service or under
authorization of the Forest Service.
Mitigation is defined as design elements and/or constraints applied to project level activities that reduce
project impacts on elk or elk security. Mitigation measures may include but are not limited to one or
more of the following: timing restrictions of activities in security blocks, confining activities to one
security block at a time, completing as much of the preparatory work as possible prior to the hunting
season, reducing the size/acres/intensity/magnitude of the activity, allowing activities that benefit elk
(particularly in management areas with a wildlife emphasis), limiting activities to one season,
temporarily closing roads open to the public to compensate for the activity, etc.
Alternative B also includes cover guidelines as follows:

Guidelines
1. Cover should be distributed in a manner that mimics or approximates a natural range of
variation (NRV). NRV is generally defined as the spatial and temporal variation in ecosystem
characteristics under historic disturbance regimes during a reference period. A reference period
should be sufficiently long to include the full range of variation produced by dominant natural
disturbance regimes. Fire, wind and insect/disease outbreaks are examples of disturbances.
2. Subject to Guideline #1, provide cover, if available, between elk security areas to maintain
habitat connectivity and facilitate seasonal movement. Saddles, low divides and heads of
drainages are examples of important landscape features within which cover should be retained
when possible in order to provide habitat connectivity.
3. Subject to Guideline #1, vegetation management projects should be planned to recruit or
improve cover, where such habitat is limited or not available.
4. Subject to Guideline #1, provide cover, if available, in elk security areas to maintain and/or
improve elk security in areas known to be used by elk or that have the potential to be used by
elk. The upper third of the slope in moderate to large drainages and lower third of slope in
drainage heads are examples of areas that have the potential to be used by elk.
5. Frequent, continuous dense cover, if available, should be provided adjacent to system roads
within and between elk security areas to maintain habitat connectivity and elk security. ‘Dense’

cover may include trees, shrubs and/or topography among other factors and is site-specific in
nature; as such it is purposefully not defined here.
6. Design management activities to avoid reducing hiding cover where recruitment of hiding cover
is an objective.

Guidelines Definitions
Cover is defined as vegetation that provides elk with a means of escape from the threat of predation or
harassment and reduces the chance of detection. Here, the definition of cover may include hiding cover,
screening cover, or concealment cover. Hiding cover is defined in the Helena National Forest Plan as
either (1) vegetation capable of hiding 90 percent of an elk at 200 feet or (2) a standoff coniferous trees
having a crown closure of greater than 40 percent or concealment cover which consists of vegetation
dense enough to aid animals in escaping from predation or harassment. Screening cover may include
conifers and other vegetation that afford longer sight distances then hiding cover but that can obstruct a
clear view toward standing or moving elk. Concealment cover may include small conifers, shrubs,
boulders, or dead fall that can hide calves/fawns and bedded adults and may service to impede hunter
movement. Concealment cover is generally more open than hiding cover.
Habitat connectivity consists of an adequate amount of hiding or screening cover arranged in a way that
allows elk to move around.
System Road is defined as a road that is part of the Forest development transportation system.
Alternative B also includes a goal as follows:

Goal
Maintain or, where opportunities arise, improve big game security in those portions of an elk herd unit
within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District during the 9/1 – 12/1 hunting season
where security is less than 50 percent. Maintain big game security in those portions of an elk herd unit
within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District between 9/1 and 12/1 where security is
greater than or equal to 50 percent.

Discussion
The Forest Plan Standard 4a - Alternative A - was crafted to provide big game security during the hunting
season and largely reflected work by Coggins (1976), Basile and Lonner (1979) and Lyon et al. (1985)
that was based on a focused road building and timber management program on National Forests in
Montana. While this provision remains relevant – i.e. maintaining big game security during the hunting
season - the method by which big game security is measured needs to be updated to reflect more recent
scientific deliberations and to address shortfalls in the application of the current standard, primarily the
fact that the current standard is not a particularly sensitive indicator of changing elk security conditions
(See the Purpose and Need and Background/Overview sections). To that end, Alternative B was
developed to include consideration of recommendations outlined in the U.S. Forest Service and
Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Collaborative Overview and Recommendations for Elk
Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena and Lewis and Clark National Forests (MFWP and
USDA Forest Service 2013).
Alternative B is based on the concept of identifiable security areas. Security areas are intended to
reduce elk vulnerability during the elk hunting season and to provide animals the opportunity to meet
their biological needs without making large range movements (e.g. to private land where hunting is not
allowed or to lower quality habitats) (Lyon and Canfield 1991). This also allows for a more ethical, fair

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 566

Environmental Impact Statement

chase hunting experience and for the hunting public to have the ability and real opportunity to
effectively hunt and harvest a public resource on public lands.
The concept of security areas is embodied by the “Hillis paradigm”, a paper compiled by Hillis et al. in
1991 as part of an elk vulnerability symposium. The basic tenets of security areas under the “Hillis
paradigm” include areas at least ½ mile from an open motorized route and at least 250 acres in size.
The authors cautioned that in some cases, distance from open routes and the size of security area blocks
may need to be increased depending on local conditions. They also recommended that at least 30
percent of an analysis unit be comprised of security areas.
Although Hillis et al. (1991) define security as “non-linear blocks of hiding cover”, they also suggest that
effective security areas may consist of several different cover –types if the block is relatively unfragmented. The studies considered by Hillis et al. were conducted in areas of contiguous forest cover.
In their discussion of security areas, Christensen et al. (1993, pp. 4, 5) speak to the significance of cover
in this equation and note that where cover is ubiquitous, security can be controlled by road
management alone. They recommend that in the more naturally open elk habitat in central Montana
cover considerations should extend beyond the hunting season and therefore be assessed at a
landscape level (See also Edge et al. 1987). Their data suggest that “elk are less selective about the
specific vegetative characteristics of coniferous cover and more responsive to the size of units,
connectiveness with adjacent units and the scale of cover on the landscape” (Lyon and Canfield as cited
in Christensen et al. 1993, p. 5).
In contrast to the Hillis et al. study areas, the landscape on the Helena Ranger District tends to include
both open and closed forested habitat and areas where forests and grasslands are interspersed in a
mosaic pattern. As such, consideration of the quantity and quality of forested cover across the entire
EHU would be better than defining security areas as “blocks of hiding cover”. This would allow for
recognition of those situations where a mosaic of forest and/or open habitats exists, but which
operationally are secure. In addition, recent analyses of elk habitat selection during the hunting season
in Montana (Proffitt et al. 2013) did not show a significant selection for security areas comprised totally
of coniferous cover. In addition, the analysis by Proffitt and others showed that security areas as a
variable in habitat selection during the hunting season are strongly related to the motorized route
variable.
Hillis et al. only speak to “open roads” and “closed roads”. They suggest that hunting pressure is
concentrated along open roads, but that closed roads located within security areas may increase elk
vulnerability by providing walking and shooting lanes. Hayes and others (2002) found that elk mortality
in their study area in Idaho was positively correlated with both open and closed road densities. Basile
and Lonner (1979) reported that when vehicular travel was restricted, hunters spent more time walking,
saw more elk and had greater success which may have been a function of elk staying in the area longer
and in greater numbers due to the travel restrictions. Unsworth and Kuck (1991) noted that road
closures may have varied effects on animal distribution and hunter use and success. They cite to several
studies where road closures allowed elk to remain in more preferred sites for longer periods of time
which in turn affected elk mortality by providing easier access to hunters (Irwin and Peek 1979). This
may be because elk and hunters were more likely to be in the same places – i.e. areas of low open road
densities (Millspaugh et al. 2000).
Still, the bulk of research indicates that elk tend to avoid open motorized routes during the hunting
season (Marcum 1975, Lyon 1979, Irwin and Peek 1983, Unsworth et al. 1991, 1993; Canfield et al. 1999,
Rowland et al. 2000, 2004, 2005; McCorquodale 2013, McCorquodale et al. 2003, Proffitt et al. 2013, to
name just a few). Based on these studies, the Hillis et al. (1991) recommendation to “minimize” closed
roads within security areas has been deemed unnecessary in this definition of elk security.
Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 567

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Hillis et al. (1991) also recommend identifying security areas within the hunting season home range. In
practice on the Helena Ranger District, elk have the potential, depending on weather and other
conditions, to use the entire breadth of elevations within their home range during the big game archery
and general rifle hunting seasons. Therefore, it is not necessary or possible to identify a consistently
“separate” fall use area within an EHU.
Despite these specific recommendations, Hillis et al. emphasize that “strict adherence to the guidelines
should be avoided” (Hillis et al. 1991). To that end, the parameters in Alternative B reflect the broader
collaborations outlined in MFWP and USDA Forest Service (2013).
The Hillis Paradigm was tested on the Bighorn National Forest which has landscape conditions similar to
the eastside of the Helena National Forest but not necessarily within the Divide landscape, which resides
both west and east of the Continental Divide under more favorable growing conditions. The Rocky
Mountain Elk Foundation and Wyoming Game and Fish Department (described in Jellison 1998 and
Wyoming Game and Fish Department 2004) attempted to modify the security parameters identified in
Hillis et al. to include larger forested patches and greater distances from open roads. They found that
few areas met the 30 percent security levels identified in the Hillis Paradigm., most likely due to the
open nature of the landscape. They concluded that the 30 percent recommended threshold may not be
applicable to some landscapes and that other factors need to be considered in determining if an area is
secure (Jellison 1998, p. 5).
In the U.S. Forest Service and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks Collaborative Overview
and Recommendations for Elk Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena and Lewis and Clark
National Forests MFWP biologists advocated for a ‘hunting season’ that included the archery season as
well as the general rifle season when analyzing elk security. They cited a consistent increase in the
number of archery hunters (doubling between 1990 and present) (see also Proffitt et al 2013 and Grigg
2007) and subsequent increased levels of motorized use during the archery season. Through
collaboration with MFWP and review of public comments it was recognized that vehicle traffic
associated with the archery season displaced elk and compromised elk security. MFWP cited a
consistent increase in the number of archery hunters (doubling between 1990 and present) and
subsequent increased levels of motorized use during the archery season. This is supported by recent
studies that documented the effects of archery season on elk movement (Conner et al. 2001, Vieira et
al. 2003) and on elk pregnancy rates (Davidson et al. 2012).
Factors that increase the effectiveness of security areas include large size, plentiful forest cover, minimal
trails and old roadways, rugged terrain and heavy deadfall and so on. All of these factors may influence
the ability of an area to hold elk through the hunting season; through collaboration with MFWP, the key
component was determined to be size. Accordingly, the minimum size of an “elk security area” was set
at 1,000 acres, considerably larger than the 250 acre minimum recommended by Hillis et al. (1991) for
“westside” forests. This is an adjustment for “eastside” cover conditions and it also aligns with the
1,000-acre security area minimum recently established for the Blackfoot Non-Winter Travel Plan Area on
the Lincoln Ranger District just to the north (USFS 2014).
A number of smaller habitat blocks (between 250 and 1,000 acres) that have been classified as security
areas in past analyses are now designated as “intermittent refuge areas”. While most of these areas are
probably too small to hold elk securely throughout the hunting season, they serve as temporary refuges
for hunted animals and in parts of the Divide landscape, they represent the only escape areas available
(Figure 68 to Figure 72). While their acreages are not added into the security area total for a given elk
herd unit, they have been mapped and noted as areas that need to be managed for elk security.

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 568

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

While the new Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment does not require that elk security areas provide a
particular level of hiding cover, it does recognize forest cover as an important component of security
and includes a set of guidelines for managing cover. The guidelines focus on maintaining cover to the
extent practicable where it exists within security areas and in travel lanes between them. Where cover
is not available, the guidelines emphasize managing for its recruitment. Abundant cover is most
valuable in areas known to be frequented by elk: saddles, low divides, drainage-heads, riparian/ wetland
sites and the upper third of slopes in large drainages. These guidelines do not apply to areas where
hiding cover has not been abundant historically because of intrinsic environmental conditions (primarily
in dry grasslands and shrublands and in dry Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine forests).
The guidelines also recognize that forest cover that is not dense enough or tall enough to provide classic
hiding cover may still provide screening or concealment in certain circumstances or otherwise allow
animals to elude hunters.
The goal of the standard is to maintain or improve elk security in herd units where security/refuge areas
occupy less than 50 percent of the unit. Where percent security is greater than 50 percent, the goal is to
keep it above that level. Any decrease in security acreage in herd units that are under 50 percent, would
represent non-compliance with the standard. Herd units would remain in compliance as long as security
acreage holds steady or increases. The 50 percent security area level (considerably higher than the 30
percent recommended by the Hillis group) is based on what has been deemed desirable and achievable
in the Blackfoot landscape just to the north [Blackfoot Non-Winter Travel Plan FEIS, 2014]. For the sake
of consistency, the 50 percent goal has been applied to the Divide landscape as well, although it’s
recognized that, given the entrenched nature of the State, County and Forest road system in the
landscape west of Helena, this percentage is unachievable on all but perhaps two of the 6 Divide herd
units. The fact that herd units are below 50 percent security does not necessarily mean that they are
out of compliance with the standard.
Alternative B would confine the security analysis to that portion of the EHU that occurs within the
Helena National Forest administrative boundary and includes private land within that confine. This
analysis boundary reflects transitional range and in some EHUs the upper edge of winter range and is
biologically meaningful (Edge et al. 1986, Lyon and Christensen 1990, Hillis et al. 1991) for the purposes
of this amendment. The portion of the herd unit within the administrative boundary is that area where
MFWP and the Forest would like to retain elk in the hunting season – i.e. public land open to all hunters
(where the Forest Service has management control and the ability to close roads). By excluding from
the security calculation those portions of the herd units that lie outside the Forest boundary, we have
omitted security provided by private lands on which public hunting is barred and on which elk have been
learning to seek refuge with increasing frequency. MFWP and the Forest feel that relying on these
sanctuaries for security is undesirable since it decreases public hunting opportunity. In addition, the
status of private lands can be in flux over the long term, depending on landowner decisions that may
have little consideration for the welfare of elk. However, for the purposes of analyses and cumulative
effects of past, ongoing and reasonably foreseeable activities, the herd unit will continue to serve as the
basis for those analyses.
Furthermore, current herd units in the Divide landscape are quite large; even the portion of the herd
unit within the administrative boundary tends to be larger than average home range sizes reported for
elk in a variety of studies. Craighead et al. (1973, p. 20) reported an average composite home range of
16 square miles or 10,240 acres in the Madison Range in Montana. Edge et al. (1985) reported home
ranges of approximately 10,900 11,100 acres in western Montana. Unsworth et al. (1998) reported
home ranges of approximately 17,000 acres in Idaho. The portions of the herd units within the
administrative boundary in the Divide landscape range from 21,000 acres to over 60,000 acres (See

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 569

Environmental Impact Statement

Table 137).
Because elk serve as an indicator species and often management for elk serves as a proxy for other big
game species, the retention of other Forestwide and Management Area big game cover standards will
address cover needs of other species.

Three of the six elk herd units (EHUs) in the Divide Travel Plan project area meet Standard 4a under
Alternatives 1 through 4. In Alternative 5, 4 out of six EHUs would meet Standard 4a.

Discussion
Although open road densities decrease in most EHUs under the action alternatives - particularly in
Alternative 5 - as compared to existing conditions (Alternative 1), application of the existing Standard 4a
to the Travel Plan alternatives reveals no change relative to the existing standard except in Alternative 5.
These proposed reductions in hunting season open motorized route access (with consequent benefits
for elk) only result in one of the sub-standard EHUs moving into compliance with Standard 4a (Little
Prickly Pear – Ophir) and only in Alternative 5. This illustrates the concern that the big game security
index, as currently defined in the Forest Plan, is not a particularly sensitive indicator of changing elk

security conditions. For example the Greenhorn EHU will never be able to meet the existing standard as
long as available cover is below the minimum 50 percent threshold. No amount of road management
will improve that condition. Even though all the action alternatives are expected to maintain or improve
existing elk security in each EHU through reductions in open motorized route densities, this
improvement cannot be reflected in the simplistic yes/no results used to report compliance with the
current standard. Furthermore, Alternative A does not provide a measure on how unroaded areas are
distributed within a respective herd unit. Several authors describe the importance of distribution of
large unroaded areas for security (e.g. Lyon et al. 1985, pp. 7-8; Lyon and Canfield 1991, pp. 104-105;
Canfield 1991, pp. 50-51; Christensen et al. 1993 p. 4, 5; McCourquodale 2013, p. 9). Road density data
alone does not address distribution of ‘unroaded’ areas.
The pattern under Standard 4a is that, in spite of shifts in open road density between alternatives, herd
units that currently comply with the standard tend to remain in compliance and those that do not
comply with the standard tend to remain out of compliance. The only exception is the rise to compliance
of the Little Prickly Pear-Ophir EHU under Alternative 5, due to the closure of 52 miles of Forest roads
combined with ample hiding cover (60 percent).
On the other hand, in the Greenhorn EHU, road closures of 47 miles in Alternative 5 are insufficient to
bring the herd unit into compliance with Standard 4a because of hiding cover that remains at 41
percent. The hiding cover/road density index masks this improvement in elk security, simply indicating
that the herd unit remains out of compliance. Likewise, the Spotted Dog–Little Blackfoot EHU is simply
credited with remaining in compliance with the standard, in spite of 40 miles of road closures in
Alternative 5. The Black Mountain–Brooklyn Bridge EHU is also credited with remaining in compliance,
but with no decline in road miles. This herd unit is clearly different from the previous two in terms of elk
security improvement, but the current Forest Plan standard recognizes no difference between them. In
sum, the standard does not accurately indicate to what degree the changes in road density improve or
degrade the habitat situation for elk.
In the analysis of alternatives considered but not carried forward in the Divide Travel Plan (See FEIS,
Chapter 2 and the Alternative Considered but not Carried Forward - Closing All Forest System Routes
during the Hunting Season report), all Forest System open motorized routes were considered closed
during the hunting season in order to determine if the Forest had management discretion over sufficient
route miles for all EHUs to meet Standard 4a. In that scenario, 5 out of 6 EHUs would meet Standard 4a
(compared with 4 out of 6 in Alternative 5, the most aggressive Alternative in terms of road closures
during the hunting season). Although that analysis indicates that it’s possible for the Forest to close
enough roads in the Quartz Creek EHU to achieve compliance with Standard 4a, several of those road
miles over which the Forest has discretion are located outside of the Travel Plan project area and have
already been subject to a travel plan decision (i.e. Clancy Unionville Vegetation Manipulation and Travel
Management Project). The few miles of open roads in Quartz Creek EHU that could be closed as part of
the Divide Travel Plan decision access private land. The Greenhorn EHU would remain out of
compliance with Standard 4a because the Forest simply does not have sufficient road closure discretion.
Even if it were possible to close all of the roads in the project area (several miles of roads are outside of
the Forest Service’s jurisdiction), some of the concerns identified by MFWP in the Montana Final Elk
Management Plan (MFWP 2005) would not be ameliorated especially in those HDs where access to elk
is a management concern.
In a word, the hiding cover/ open road density index, as now formulated, is insensitive to real changes in
elk security and it places impractical constraints on Forest management and on the ability of the public
to use the Forest (even though the allowed use is not detrimental to elk security). The standard will be
impossible to meet throughout most of and possibly all of, the Divide landscape for the foreseeable

future (25 to 50 years), not because of deficiencies in travel management, but because of natural loss of
hiding cover.

Alternative B – (Proposed Alternative)
Security and Intermittent Refuge Areas
Alternative B utilizes the concept of the percentage of an area in security or as an intermittent refuge
area to enumerate the resulting elk security (or intermittent refuge area) differences between the
Travel Plan alternatives. The actual on-the-ground results regarding the Forest’s road management and
the changes in elk security are the same as under Alternative A, only the method of describing those
results has changed.
Table 137 displays total acres and percent of elk security by herd unit for Alternative B. The results
apply only to that portion of the EHU that is within the administrative boundary of the Forest and are
based on blocks greater than or equal to 1000 acres located greater than or equal to ½ mile from
motorized routes that are open during the hunting season (9/1 through 12/1). Table 138 displays the
total acres and percent of intermittent refuge areas by herd unit for Alternative B. As with elk security,
the results apply only to that portion of the EHU that is within the administrative boundary of the Forest
and are based on blocks 250-999 acres in size located greater than or equal to ½ mile from motorized
routes that are open during the hunting season (9/1 through 12/1).
Among the four Travel Plan action alternatives, Alternatives 3, 4 and 5 generally serve to consolidate
security areas into larger contiguous blocks resulting in an increase in total overall acres of security and
a larger average size of security areas as compared to the existing condition (Figure 68 to Figure 72).
In turn, this could reduce bull mortality and subsequently can improve bull: cow ratios ( Leptich and
Zager 1991, p. 129, 130) as well as serve to retain more elk on public land (Wertz et al. 2004).
Security and intermittent refuge areas in all alternatives range from approximately 4500 feet in
elevation to beyond 8000 feet in elevation. This elevational distribution should accommodate seasonal
fluctuations in weather patterns within and between years. There are some areas within the Divide
Travel Plan area that do not have security or intermittent refuge areas (See Figure 68 to Figure 72).
The lack of security in these areas is generally due to past decisions that preclude travel management
options today (i.e. Clancy Unionville Vegetation Manipulation and Travel Management Project).

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 572

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

As can be seen in Table 137 and Table 138, elk security and intermittent refuge areas provide a means of gauging elk security that is sensitive to
changes in open motorized route configuration. This allows a more realistic assessment as to potential impacts of travel management proposals
in different herd units than the current Forest Plan Standard (the Big Game Security index), which shows little to no difference between any of
the alternatives in terms of Forest Plan compliance. The difference between the two methods is largely a function of eliminating hiding cover as
a primary determinant of elk security and focusing on the size and distribution of large habitat blocks to which vehicle access is limited. This is
particularly appropriate in this case, as Travel Plan alternatives deal with changes in open road patterns and generally have no impact on hiding
cover. However, Forest Plan standards remain in place that recognize the importance of elk hiding cover (i.e. Forestwide Big Game Standards 3,
5 and several management area specific standards – See Table 129).

In addition to the cover guidelines, several cover standards remain in place. Of the 13 management
areas in the Divide Travel Plan area, two have a timber emphasis with no associated measurable wildlife
standards (T1 and T5), six have measurable wildlife standards (H1, H2, L2, T3, W1 and W2) and the
remaining MAs are somewhat neutral with regards to wildlife (Table 140).

As shown, 35 percent of the elk security and intermittent refuge areas in Alternative 5 are within
management areas for which there is a measureable cover standard. Twenty-four percent are located
within timber emphasis management areas. Forty-six percent are within MAs that are somewhat
neutral with regards to measurable wildlife standards; however, even these MAs require some wildlife
consideration. For example, standards in MA L-1 provide for the following: “[s]pecific wildlife and
fisheries needs will be identified and considered when developing allotment management plans,
provided the needs are compatible with area goals” (USDA 1986, p. III/11).

Discussion
Alternative B allows for temporary reductions in elk security provided impacts to elk security are
mitigated at the project level. Mitigations include but aren’t limited to one or more of the following:
timing restrictions of activities in security blocks, confining activities to one security block at a time,
completing as much of the preparatory work as possible prior to the hunting season, reducing the
size/acres/intensity/magnitude of the activity, allowing activities that benefit elk (particularly in
management areas with a wildlife emphasis), limiting activities to one season, temporarily closing roads
open to the public to compensate for the activity, etc.
The provision for administrative use of motorized routes that are closed to the public during the hunting
season and the allowance of management activities within security blocks during the hunting season
could result in temporary reductions in elk security regardless of the selected travel plan alternative.
The temporary loss of security associated either with vehicular use on closed routes or activities within
security blocks could result in displacement of elk to non-secure areas which could lead to increased
vulnerability during the hunting season. Elk could also be displaced to private land which could render
management of and access to, elk difficult. Several studies have documented the displacement effects
of management activities on elk (USDA 1978, Edge and Marcum 1985, Lyon et al. 1985, Wertz et al.
2004). However, in several other studies, displacement of elk associated with logging activity tended to
be temporary with some elk returning during nights and weekends when logging activity was suspended
Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 581

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

(Beall 1974 and Edge 1982 as cited in Lyon and Christensen 2002, p. 562). Other research found that
logging activity did not significantly alter elk home range size (Edge et al. 1986). Forest Plan standards
and recommendations remain in place to minimize these impacts to elk during the hunting season.
These include:
•
•

Representatives from the Helena Forest and MFWP will meet annually to review the
existing Travel Plan (USDA 1986, p. II/19);
Montana Cooperative Elk-Logging Study Recommendations, in Appendix C, will be
followed during timber sale and road construction projects (Ibid, p. II/19);
o Disturbance by heavy equipment can be completed in the shortest
possible time (Ibid, Appendix C, p. C/2);
o Logging activity can be confined to a single drainage at a time and all
work completed in the shortest possible time frame (Ibid).

Administrative use of motorized routes closed to the public and allowing management activities during
the hunting season has been in practice – and mitigated at a project level - since the crafting of the
Forest Plan and is consistent with the existing Standard 4a. Meanwhile, elk numbers have increased
steadily since the crafting of the Forest Plan which suggests that displacement associated with this use –
as long as mitigation is in place to minimize this displacement - has not depressed elk numbers.
Remaining standards as well as design features and/or mitigation measures will continue to be applied
at the project level under Alternative B such that displacement of elk is expected to be temporary and
should not compromise the ability of the Forest and MFWP to realize our management goals relative to
elk and elk security.
Several studies found that elk may find more complete security during hunting seasons by moving to
private lands that restrict hunter access or prohibit hunting which limit is MFDWP ability to manage herd
sizes through harvest (Burcham et al. 1999, Proffitt et al. 2013, Haggerty and Travis 2006).
Implementation of Alternative B should reduce elk displacement from public land prior to normal
migration events. This addresses a primary management goal for MFWP: maintaining or enhancing elk
presence on National Forest System lands so that elk are available to the hunting public on public land.
In a study conducted in Oregon, Wertz and others (2004) were able to influence elk migration patterns
through road closures, among other habitat improvements. Elk in that study area had been increasingly
shifting use to private land in part due to lack of security on public land. The authors project that as elk
re-establish their traditional migratory patterns, they may be imprinting their calves to remain on public
land as well. Elk distribution can be affected through road management and establishment of security
areas over time (Rowland et al. 2005 and McCorquodale 2003) in turn providing MFWP the flexibility to
achieve their population objectives. Implementation of Alternative B can also lead to improvements in
bull: cow ratios (Leptich and Zager, p. 129, 130).
Security and intermittent refuge areas, as defined in Alternative B, are based on motorized routes open
to the public between 9/1 and 12/1. The presence of a motorized route closed during this period did
not disqualify an area from being considered a security area or intermittent refuge area. These closed
routes could facilitate hunter access and improve hunter success; likely a function of elk remaining in
the ‘secure’ area longer and in greater numbers (Basile and Lonner 1979, Hillis et al. 1991, Unsworth and
Kuck 1991). However, if security and/or intermittent areas were determined by open and closed
motorized routes, several areas that currently do provide security for elk – or could upon
implementation of the Divide Travel Plan decision - would have been eliminated from consideration.
Also, the Divide Travel Plan decision is an open/closed decision and does not include specific
prescriptions for how roads closed through this decision will be managed. In the future, some roads

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 582

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

may be obliterated; others gated depending on Forestwide and management area standards and goals.
Some of these closed roads in security/intermittent refuge areas may be obliterated in the future.
The cover guidelines, along with remaining hiding cover standards, should ensure that cover is provided
as part of future management activities. The guidelines also provide flexibility to promote forest
regeneration to offset cover losses associated with the mountain pine beetle epidemic. Although a
majority of security and intermittent refuge areas currently contain hiding cover, this condition is
expected to change over the next several years as trees killed by the mountain pine beetle fall (Keen
1955, Mitchell and Preisler 1998, Lewis and Hartley 2006, Page and Jenkins 2007, Klutsch et al. 2009).
How these changes affect elk populations and distribution are uncertain; down trees may impede elk
movement (Saab et al. 2014) while over-story mortality could improve forage opportunities (Stone
1995). Currently, a study is ongoing in the Elkhorn Mountains on the Forest to address this very topic.
These data could be extrapolated Forestwide in similar forested conditions and used to influence
management.
Avoidance of roads is presumed to be a behavioral response conditioned by vehicular traffic. Other
factors, including better hiding cover, can be expected partially to mitigate the negative response by elk.
However, the best method for attaining full use of habitat appears to be effective road closures (Lyon
1983, p. 4).

Cumulative Effects of Other Forest Plan Amendments
Cumulative effects are the impacts on the environment which results from the incremental impact of
the action when added to other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, Federal or
non-Federal. The cumulative effects analysis considers spatial and temporal boundaries, how past
activities have contributed to the existing condition and whether the ecosystem can accommodate
additional effects.
This section addresses cumulative effects in two ways: those associated with site-specific project
amendments and those associated with programmatic amendments. The effects of site-specific project
amendments are limited in time and space; programmatic amendments provide direction that would be
applied to future management activities.

Site-Specific Amendments
Existing Amendments
There are currently 28 Forest Plan amendments of which five have had implications on Big Game
standards. These five are described below.

Amendment #7 Miller Mountain Hard Rock Mineral Exploration Project
This site-specific amendment exempts the Miller Mountain hard rock mineral exploration project (1993)
from Forest Plan Big Game Standards 3 and 4(a). Approximately 590 acres were exempted from these
standards associated with the construction of new roads and drill sites. Most likely, these roads do not
provide hiding cover; however, they remain closed to all use. There were additional closures in Jimmy’s
Gulch, an area adjacent to this 1993 project. The corporation that originally conducted mineral
explorations in the area is no longer active.

Figure 75 - Percent bulls per total elk observed in HD 392, 2005-2014.
The black line indicates trend.

This project is located in MFWP HD 392. Elk trends have been increasing in HD 392 since 2005; percent
of bulls per total observed has also been increasing since 2007 (Figure 74 and Figure 75). The decision
to exempt this project from compliance with Standards 3 and 4a and the subsequent removal of 590
acres of cover does not appear to have negatively impacted elk numbers in this HD. Management
challenges identified for this HD include public access and noxious weeds and not necessarily loss of
cover (MFWP 2005, p. 249).

Amendment #21 Jimtown Project
This site-specific amendment exempted the Jimtown Project (2001) from Standard 4a. The wildlife
analysis concluded that the existing condition was not consistent with this standard. Effects associated
with this project included the removal of approximately three percent of the hiding cover in the Hedges
Mountain herd unit.
This project is also located in MFWP HD 392. The decision to exempt this project from Standard 4a and
the subsequent removal of hiding cover does not appear to have negatively impacted elk numbers in
this HD. This may be due to the fact that management challenges in this HD aren’t necessarily related to
loss of cover but rather to limited public access and noxious weeds.

Amendment #23 Cave Gulch Post-Fire Salvage Project
This site-specific amendment exempted the Cave Gulch Post-Fire Salvage Project from Standard 4a. The
wildlife analysis for this project indicated that the existing condition was not consistent with Standard
4a. This was due in part to the loss of existing hiding cover from the Cave Gulch wildfire. Approximately
0.85 miles of temporary roads were built to implement the salvage sale and were subsequently
decommissioned.
This project is also located in HD 392. As with the Miller Mountain Mine Exploration Project and the
Jimtown Project, the impacts to elk as a result of the removal of hiding cover below Forest Plan
thresholds appear minimal.

Amendment #26 Fuels Reduction and Hazardous Tree Removal Project
This site-specific amendment exempted the Fuels Reduction and Hazardous Tree Removal Project from
Forest Plan Big Game Standards 3 and 4(a). The wildlife analysis for this project concluded that the
existing condition for Forest Plan Standard 3 was not met within 17 of the 27 EHUs for hiding cover and
none of the EHUs met Forest Plan Standard 3 for thermal cover. The existing condition for Forest Plan
Standard 4a was not met within 22 of the 27 EHUs. Implementation of the Decision did not result in any
additional EHUs being below these Forest Plan Standards. The Decision resulted in minimal reductions
of hiding cover within those EHUs where existing conditions were already below Forest Plan Standard 3;
a one percent reduction in two EHUs and less than a one percent reduction in all other EHUs. Twenty
two EHUs did not currently meet Forest Plan Standard 4a. The open road densities however were not a
part of this decision.

The black line indicates trend.

This project occurs within several HDs given that its scope is Forestwide. The trend in elk numbers
continues to increase despite the fact that this decision resulted in several herd units dropping further
below thresholds specified in Forest Plan standards (Figure 76). Management challenges in these HDs
include limited public access, development and loss of cover and security.

Figure 78 - Number of bull elk observed in HD
391 2005-2014.
The black line indicates trend.

This site-specific amendment exempts the Cabin Gulch Vegetation Treatment Project from the Forest Plan
standards for hiding cover on summer range and the open road density standard during the hunting season (Big
Game Standards 3 and 4(a) respectively, USDA 1986, p. II/17). Overall, this project will affect elk habitat to a
limited extent by removing cover within the affected EHUs. Regardless of project implementation, this loss will
occur naturally over the next few years due to extensive tree mortality and natural tree fall from the insect
infestation. In addition, the selected treatments may be beneficial for elk over the current situation, as they could
quicken the regeneration rate of new forests. The analysis concluded that through the life of the project and with
the subsequent recovery of hiding cover over time, elk habitat will remain abundant and well distributed across
the Forest. Approximately 2,313 acres of hiding cover will be removed in the Cabin Creek Herd Unit which is a
reduction of 6 percent from the existing condition. Approximately 190 acres of hiding cover will be removed in the
North Fork Herd Unit which is less than a 1 percent reduction from the existing condition.
The Cabin Gulch Project Decision did not result in any increases in open road density during the hunting season.
However, due to the removal of hiding cover within the Cabin Creek and North Fork EHUs and because both EHUs
are below Forest Plan Standard 4a in the existing condition, the Project Decision does not meet Standard 4a
thresholds. Mitigation measures were included from the Montana Cooperative Elk-Logging Study that will
minimize project-related disturbances.
This project is located in HD 391. It’s currently in the implementation phase. Elk numbers and the number of bull
elk observed have been increasing since 2005 and 2007 respectively (Figure 77 and Figure 78). The
management challenges in this HD include limited public access and noxious weeds; not necessarily reductions in
cover (MFWP 2005, pp. 255-257).

Plan Standard 4a (Ibid p. II/17-18) for both the Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge and Quartz Creek herd units. The
decision to exempt this project from Standard 3 for the Quartz Creek EHU and 4(a) for both Black MountainBrooklyn Bridge and Quart Creek EHU may affect elk to some extent due to the removal of hiding cover from
these EHUs. The project treats approximately 490 acres, removing all dead trees and woody debris from an
approximate 450 foot wide corridor, along the Red Mountain Flume and removing mostly dead trees and woody
debris from a broad swath around Chessman Reservoir and its meadows. All hiding cover within the units,
currently 434 acres (includes 4 acres from Jericho Mountain EHU), has been removed. Approximately 0.5 mile of
low-grade road has been constructed east of Chessman Reservoir and will be obliterated post-project
implementation. Regardless of project implementation, this loss would occur naturally over the next few years
due to extensive tree mortality and natural tree fall associated with the mountain pine beetle infestation.
The Red Mountain Flume/Chessman Reservoir Project does not result in any increases in open road density during
the hunting season. However, due to the removal of hiding cover within the Black Mountain – Brooklyn Bridge
and Quartz Creek EHUs and because both EHUs are below Forest Plan Standard 4a in the existing condition, the
Project Decision does not meet Standard 4a thresholds. Mitigation measures have been included from the
Montana Cooperative Elk-Logging Study that would minimize project-related disturbances.
This project occurs within HD 335. It is currently being implemented. Elk numbers have been increasing since
2005 while the bull/cow ratio has remained relatively static (Figure 80 and Figure 79). Management challenges
in this HD include housing development and mining activity, extensive motorized use and wolf establishment
(MFWP 2005, pp. 190-193).

Tenmile South Vegetation Project
The Tenmile – South Helena Project encompasses approximately 49,500 acres of National Forest System
land west and south of Helena, Montana. The project area is located within the Upper Tenmile
watershed, the primary source of municipal water for the City of Helena and extends east through
Colorado Gulch and the South Hills area of Helena, Montana. The purpose of the project is to maintain
consistent quantity and quality of water within the municipal watershed and improve conditions for
public and firefighter safety across the landscape in the event of a wildfire. In order to achieve this
purpose, there is a need to create a mosaic of vegetation and fuel structure more resilient to
disturbance which would provide for safer, more effective fire suppression actions. Site-specific
amendments to the Forest Plan may be necessary in order to meet the project’s purpose and need.
Possible amendments may be needed for Forest Plan Standards 3, 4a and 6 as well as for those
management area standards listed in below.

Specific design criteria and mitigations would be included in order to minimize effects to elk during
project implementation. These include: restricting public use of temporary roads, prohibiting logging
operations during the first two weeks of the general rifle season to maintain elk habitat capability and
confining logging to a single drainage at a time with all work completed in the shortest time frame
possible.
This project occurs within HD 335. Elk numbers have been increasing since 2005 while the bull/cow
ratio has remained relatively static. Management challenges in this HD include housing development
and mining activity, extensive motorized use and wolf establishment (MFWP 2005, pp. 190-193). See
Figure 80 and Figure 79.

Site-Specific Amendment Analysis
MFWP elk population management focuses on maintaining numbers well above population viability
thresholds, protecting certain sex and age classes from over-harvest, providing public hunting
opportunity and attempting to balance elk distribution across public and private lands. The Forest
Service strives to complement MFWP’s efforts through management of elk habitat on National Forest
System lands. However, within the multiple use mandate of the Forest Service, management for elk is
only one of many considerations on National Forest System lands. Other multiple use considerations
may be favored over elk in order to achieve management area goals of the Forest Plan. If these
consideratons conflict with a Forest Plan standard, the Forest Supervisor may approve an exception to
that standard (USDA 1986, p. II/14). Such has been the case with the site-specific amendments
described here. However, despite these amendments and their associated impacts to cover (thermal
and hiding), bull survival as measured by MFWP, is at objectives across a majority of the Forest (Figure
85). This is not to suggest that cover does not play a role in elk population dynamics. Rather, it
indicates that cover alone may not be a predicator of elk numbers (Lyon and Canfield 1991; Unsworth
and Kuck 1991; Lyon and Christensen 1992; Christensen et al. 1993, Stubblefield et al. 2006 p. 1068,
Montgomery et al. 2013, p. 322, Proffitt et al. 2013).

Total numbers of hunters, elk harvested and bull elk harvested has remained relatively stable in those
HDs that overlap with the Helena National Forest suggesting that the reductions in cover associated with
these site-specific amendments may be so minor as to not influence hunter numbers and harvest
success (Figure 86).

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 591

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

A variety of factors influence elk distribution and abundance in addition to cover management. The lack
of public access to hunt big game on private lands and the resulting differences in relative hunting
pressure can play a major role in elk population dynamics and distribution. Human disturbance and
potential for displacement of big game animals is not restricted to the 5- week rifle season currently in
place in Montana. Because archery hunting has increased significantly in popularity, there has been a
noted shift in some cases of elk moving to private land, as a result of displacement during the archery
season. Human disturbance may also influence elk habitat use and distribution during time periods
outside of the hunting season. In addition, predators (generally mountain lions, wolves and bears) also
influence elk population dynamics and distribution in some areas.
Elk are fairly resilient animals. Ernest Thompson Seton (as cited in RMEF 1997) postulated that 10
million elk lived in North America prior to European settlement. By 1907, there were less than 100,000.
In Montana, elk were widely distributed during the era of exploration. As Montana was ‘settled’, elk
began to decline were completely eliminated from eastern Montana by the early 1900s. Today, elk are
abundant; their ability to withstand near extirpation at the turn of the last century strongly suggests that
they can withstand temporary declines in available cover associated with the site-specific amendments
described herein.

Programmatic Amendments
Existing Amendments
Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD)
The NRLMD was amended to National Forest Plans in Montana and parts of Idaho, Wyoming and Utah in
2007. The NRLMD incorporates management direction that conserves and promotes recovery of Canada
lynx, by reducing or eliminating adverse effects from land management activities on National Forest
System lands, while preserving the overall multiple use direction in existing plans. Some of the NRLMD
standards may benefit elk and other big game by retaining winter snowshoe hare habitat which may
provide cover, reducing disturbance associated with mineral development and reducing habitat
fragmentation (USDA 2007, p. 210)

Proposed Amendments
Blackfoot Non-winter Travel Plan Programmatic Amendment Big Game Standard 4a
The Blackfoot Non-winter Travel Plan is currently in the analysis phase with an anticipated FEIS in the
spring of 2015. As part of this process, the Forest proposes to programmatically amend Forest Plan
Standard 4a to reflect updated research. The FEIS and draft Record of Decision has been released to the
public in 2014. The programmatic amendment associated with the Blackfoot Non-winter Travel Plan is
the same as that for the Divide Travel Plan in terms of security area definition, motorized use, (public
and other) and a goal of improving elk security as opportunities arise. The Blackfoot Non-winter Travel
Plan amendment does not include consideration of intermittent refuge areas or cover. The Blackfoot
Non-winter Travel Plan project area is not as fragmented as the Divide Travel Plan project area so the
inclusion of intermittent refuge areas and/or cover in that programmatic document was deemed
unnecessary. It is anticipated that this amendment would improve our ability to effectively manage elk
habitat during the hunting season defined as 9/1 through 12/1..

Cumulative Effects Conclusions All Amendments
All of the site-specific amendments described above have been or will be site-specific in time and space;
as such, effects to elk cover are transitory. None of the past amendments has resulted in significant

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 592

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

impacts to elk; nor should the proposed site-specific amendments significantly impact elk. Cumulatively,
effects to elk hiding cover from this and other site-specific Forest Plan amendments should not
compromise the Forest's ability to provide habitat potential to meet Forest Plan elk population goals.
Elk will continue to be abundant across the Forest as evidenced by the increases in elk numbers since
the incipience of the Forest Plan.
The past and ongoing programmatic amendments (i.e. NRLMD, Blackfoot Non-winter Travel Plan
Amendment) should improve habitat for elk along with Alternative B. Alternative B would address cover
losses by protecting large blocks of habitat secure from the influences of open motorized routes during
the hunting season and would be beneficial in terms of the Forest’s ability to manage elk habitat.
Alternative A, the existing condition, will continue to lack sufficient flexibility to address long term cover
losses associated with the mountain pine beetle-related tree mortality.
This programmatic amendment will have little cumulative long-term impacts to the long-term
relationship with multiple-use goods and services or have a substantive impact on the land management
plan or its resources when considered with site-specific amendments 7, 21, 23, 24 28 and 29.

Cumulative Effects of Site-Specific and Programmatic Amendments on Elk
The Helena National Forest is located within several hunting districts identified by MFWP (See Figure
63). The total number of elk that have been observed in these hunting districts through the 2014 aerial
surveys is 14,736 (MFWP aerial survey data). Some of these hunting districts barely overlap with the
Helena National Forest. Discounting those HDs, the total number of elk that have been observed on and
around the Forest is 11,349 – although this is probably an underestimate because elk that occur in the
‘discounted’ HDs do spend some time on the Forest. Nevertheless, the number of elk associated with
the Helena National Forest is well in excess of the 6,400 population target identified in the Helena
National Forest Plan (USDA 1986, p. V/5).
Several of the HDs that overlap with the Forest are at population objectives in terms of both number of
elk observed and bull survival post-hunting season (Table 141). Management challenges associated with
those HDs below objectives (i.e. 281, 293) include predation and lack of access to private land where elk
congregate and extensive motorized use. Predation and lack of public access are outside of the Forest’s
influence; extensive motorized use, particularly in HDs 281 and 293 is being addressed by way of the
Blackfoot Non-winter Travel Plan. Management challenges for those HDs above objectives (i.e. 215,
390, 391) also include limited public access.

National Forest Management Act
The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) provides that forest plans may be amended in any
manner, but if the management direction results in a significant change in the plan, additional
procedures must be followed.
In April 2012, the Forest Service adopted new planning regulations at 36 CFR 219, Subpart A and Subpart
B, which replaced the final 2000 land management planning rule (2000 rule) as reinstated in the Code of
Federal Regulations on December 18, 2009 (74 FR 67062). The 2012 rule includes a transition period
during which plan amendments may be initiated under the provisions of the prior planning regulation
for 3 years after May 9, 2012 and may be completed and approved under those provisions. This
amendment is being completed under the provisions of the prior regulations. It is, however, subject to
the objection process in 36 CFR 219 Subpart B (at 219.59(b)).

The 1982 regulations at 219.10(f) require the agency to determine whether or not a proposed
amendment would result in a significant change in the plan. If the change resulting from the proposed
amendment is determined to be significant, the same procedure as that required for development and
approval of a plan shall be followed. If the change resulting from the amendment is determined not to
be significant for the purposes of the planning process, then the agency may implement the amendment
following appropriate public notification and completion of the NEPA procedures.
Forest Service Manual section 1926.5 identifies factors to consider in determining whether an
amendment is significant or non-significant for those plans using planning regulations in place before
November 9, 2000.

Changes to the Land Management Plan That are
Not Significant

Management Standards 3 and 4(a) Exceptions

1. Actions that do not significantly alter the
multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term
land and resource management.

This amendment is consistent with the goals and objectives
of the Forest Plan, including Forestwide goals to maintain and
improve the habitat over time to support big game and other
wildlife species. (USDA 1986, page II/1). The amendment
will provide habitat to support viable populations of elk.
Long term goals and objectives associated with other
resource management such as vegetation management,
grazing and mineral management, are not expected to be
significantly altered as a result of this amendment

2. Adjustments of management area
boundaries of management prescriptions
resulting from further on-site analysis when the
adjustments do not cause significant changes in
the multiple-use goals and objectives for longterm land and resource management.

The amendment does not adjust management area
boundaries or management prescriptions.

3. Minor changes in standards and guidelines.

4. Opportunities for additional projects or
activities that will contribute to achievement of
the management prescription.

5. Actions that significantly alter the multipleuse goals and objectives for long-term land and
resource management.

This amendment does provide for a change in management
standards for big game in the project area. It incorporates
more recent science as well as input from Montana Fish,
Wildlife and Parks, the state wildlife management agency.
The amendment provides a standard that more closely ties to
direct impacts to elk security and is not as tied to vegetation
conditions, which can be affected by many factors, including
those related to climate change stressors.
This amendment will apply to other projects within the
project area. It provides an improved measure of security for
big game and more management opportunities for achieving
management prescriptions.
This amendment would not alter the long-term relationship
between levels of multiple-use goods and services originally
projected in the Forest Plan for wildlife habitat, Allowable
Sale Quantity, or other resource outputs, nor does it have an
important effect on the entire land management plan or
affect land and resources throughout a large portion of the
planning area during the planning period.

Forest Plan Programmatic Amendment - 596

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

This amendment would not alter the long-term relationship between levels of multiple-use goods and
services originally projected in the Forest Plan for wildlife habitat, Allowable Sale Quantity, or other
resource outputs, nor does it have an important effect on the entire land management plan or affect
land and resources throughout a large portion of the planning area during the planning period.
Based on consideration of the four factors identified in the Forest Service Manual, 1926.51 and
considering the Forest Plan in its entirety, amending Standard 4a of the Forest Plan would not be a
significant change under NFMA to the Helena Forest Plan. This amendment is fully consistent with, but
further refines and clarifies the means to achieve, current Forest Plan goals and objectives.
Amending Standard 4a would not affect the Forest’s ability to realize the elk population potential
established in the Forest Plan. When the Forest Plan Record of Decision was signed in 1986, the
selected alternative was E-1. Alternative E-1 established Forestwide elk population potential for
summer and winter range. In 1986, the Forest Plan summer range elk potential was 6,300 elk; the
winter range elk potential was 4,000 elk. By decade 5, summer range elk potential in the Forest Plan
was projected at approximately 6,200 elk and winter range elk potential at 3,200 elk (Forest Plan Record
of Decision page 13, Forest Plan FEIS pages II/56-60). Based on aerial survey data collected by MFWP,
there are at least 10,727 elk that have been observed on and around the Forest, in excess of the 6,400
population target identified in the Helena National Forest Plan (USDA 1986, p. V/5).
Further, this amendment would not preclude the Forest’s ability to achieve the goals and objectives as
outlined in the Forest Plan. The goal, to “maintain and improve the habitat over time to support big
game and other wildlife species” (USDA 1986, p. II/1) is being achieved with the proposed new
amendment as well as through the retention of other existing Forest Plan standards. Our objective, “management will emphasize…the maintenance or enhancement of elk habitat...” (USDA 1986, p. II/4) –
is also being realized for the same reasons.
We would also continue to achieve our objective of “ensuring that viable populations of existing…animal
species are maintained” (USDA 1986, p. II/17). Elk habitat will remain abundant and well distributed
across the Forest. It is anticipated that the Forest will retain security components necessary to maintain
a viable and huntable elk population. However, while habitat (e.g. hiding cover) is important to the long
term viability of elk populations, elk populations – and their viability - are more likely to be controlled by
harvest than by limits in cover (Unsworth et al. 1993, Bender and Miller 1999, Biederbeck et al. 2001,
Conard et al. 2012). However, standards will remain in place that provide for hiding cover
considerations.
Furthermore, implementation of this project and others for which Forest Plan amendments have been
or could be applied, should not impede the ability of the Forest to maintain and/or improve big game
security while providing for an extended hunting season – the intent of Standard 4a. The metrics used
by MFWP to determine if elk objectives are being met indicate that in many cases the hunting districts
that overlap with the Forest are at or above MFWP objectives.

Endangered Species Act
The Endangered Species Act creates an affirmative obligation “…that all federal departments and
agencies should seek to conserve endangered and threatened species” of fish, wildlife and plants.
Implementation of Alternative B, the amendment, would not affect listed or proposed species or critical
habitat.

Environmental Justice
Executive Order 12898 directs federal agencies to identify and address, as appropriate, any
disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on low-income and
minority populations. This plan direction has no effect on low income or minority populations.

Summary and Conclusions
One of the objectives of the Divide Travel Plan is to avoid imposing outdated management direction
contained in the Helena Forest Plan (USDA 1986) on the road and trail system of the Divide landscape.
The argument for doing so with regard to big game security standards has been made in previous
sections. This section condenses those rationale into a more compact format.
The Travel Plan is designed to maintain a road and trail system that provides the public with reasonable
access to the National Forest and allows the Forest Service to manage the landscape with some
efficiency, while, at the same time, buffering as much of the wildlife resource as possible from problems
generated by motor vehicles and disruptive human presence in general. Part of the process of balancing
the need for road access with the security requirements of big game animals entails developing a system
of habitat assessment and management guidance that can accurately depict the security status of elk in
a given area and appropriately address any problems detected. Experience with the Forest Plan over
the last couple decades has led Helena National Forest wildlife biologists to conclude that elk security
standards in the Plan [particularly Standard 4a (USDA 1986, p. II/17 – II/18)] do not accurately reflect the
habitat needs of elk during the hunting season and have required road closures that restrict travel but
often do not improve elk security.
In particular:
•

•

•

Forest Plan Standard 4a (the big game security index) indicates that three of the 6 EHUs
in the Divide landscape are deficient in elk security to the point that they do not meet
the standard.
Despite the fact that three out of 6 EHUs do not meet Forest Plan Standard 4a, elk
numbers have been steadily increasing since the crafting of the Forest Plan in 1986.
Aerial survey data collected by Montana Department Fish, Wildlife and Parks staff
through 2014 indicate that there are at least 11,349 elk within the hunting districts that
cover the Forest. This is well above the 6,400 benchmark identified in the Forest Plan.
MFWP data indicate that elk populations in the Divide landscape are either at or near
population objectives of the Montana Final Elk Management Plan (2005) for the last
several years for most of the HDs; or that management challenges are are only partially
habitat related. That is, elk security is adequate in many HDs. The existing Forest Plan
standard is not an accurate indicator of elk security.

Divide Travel Plan

In spite of the fact that the Travel Plan alternatives close several miles of routes to
vehicle access during the hunting season, the analysis for Standard 4a indicates that
only one EHU shows improvement in elk security over the existing condition.
In one of the six herd units (Greenhorn), not even the closure of all roads managed by
the Forest would be enough to meet Standard 4a. The Helena National Forest is in the
position of never being able to meet Standard 4a in this herd unit in the foreseeable
future (even while elk continue to thrive).
By introducing reasonably measurable criteria as part of the formula for guaging the
level of security needed in a given herd unit, the new standard provides a more realistic
means of guiding travel management on the Forest.

In conclusion, Forest Plan Standard 4a inaccurately depicts the nature of elk security in the Divide
landscape, is insensitive to changing road densities and places unnecessary and impractical constraints
on travel management. Meanwhile, the more recently developed elk security area methodology
provides a reasonably accurate picture of elk security across the landscape, is responsive to proposed
changes in open road patterns and correctly directs management to areas that need further attention.
Although this amendment eliminates cover measurements as part of the determination of elk security, it
does not change other elk or big game related standards relative to the analysis and maintenance of
cover, notably Forestwide Big Game Standards 1, 2, 3 and 5. Big Game Standards 4b thru 4h and 6
regarding road management activities are also still in effect.
“In areas with high hunter densities and general bull seasons, it is unlikely that road closures alone will
reduce bull mortality to acceptable levels. We are not aware of an elk population that is hunted (except
those that are hunted under a very limited number of controlled permits) where it has been shown that
environmental or habitat factors are limiting the male cohorts of the populations. Habitat is definitely
important to the long term viability of elk populations, but we believe that elk populations are more
likely to be controlled by harvest than by limits in cover or forage. In most years, hunters, their efficiency
modified by road density and topography, control elk populations.” (Unsworth et al. 1993)

Monitoring
Forest plan monitoring items will remain in place that will serve as the basis for determining if the
proposed amendment is meeting the Forest’s goals and objectives for big game. These monitoring
items include:
•
•
•
•

C1 - Monitoring of seasonal distribution, movement patterns and density of elk as
determined by ground and aerial observations (USDA 1986, p. IV/7);
C2 - Habitat evaluation to determine habitat preferences by elk (and other big game
species (Ibid, p. IV/7);
C3 - Habitat evaluation to determine effects of land use activities on ungulates (Ibid, p.
IV/7);
C4 – Habitat evaluation to determine impacts of open road densities, livestock grazing
and effects to cover on elk habitat potential (Ibid, p. IV/8)

SENSITIVE PLANTS
Regulatory Framework
The Endangered Species Act (1973) as amended, the National Forest Management Act of 1976
(PL 94-588) and the National Environmental Policy Act (1978) require protection and
consideration of threatened, endangered and other “rare” species.
Threatened and endangered plant species in Region 1 include:
•
•
•
•

Macfarlane’s four-o’clock (Mirabilis macfarlanei);
Spalding’s catchfly (Silene spaldingii);
Water howellia (Howellia aquatilis); and
Western prairie fringed orchid (Platanthera praeclara).

There are no known or suspected populations of these species on the Helena National Forest.
These species will not be discussed further in this report.
Whitebark pine was analyzed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2010 as a candidate for
listing. Their 12-month finding states that whitebark pine as a species is declining based on
synergistic threats from habitat loss (USDI 2011). However, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also
states that the entire range of whitebark pine is not threatened by extinction. U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service determined that whitebark pine federal listing is warranted but precluded,
which currently makes the species a candidate for federal listing. The Region 1 Regional Forester
added whitebark pine to the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species list on December 24, 2011
(USDA 2011). Several threats to whitebark pine were identified by the Fish and Wildlife Service
(USDI 2011), the combination of which has raised concerns about the long-term viability of
whitebark ecosystems.
The Forest Plan for the Helena National Forest (USDA 1986) direction for sensitive plants (II/20)
is as follows:
8. Species of Special Concern
There are habitats on the Forest where the following species of special concern may be
found:
•
•
•
•

Lemhi penstemon (Penstemon lemhiensis);
Howell's gumweed (Grindelia howellia);
Missoula phlox (Phlox missoulensis); and
Cliff toothwort (Cardamine rupicola).

Missoula phlox and cliff toothwort have been located on the Helena National Forest. Other
plants that are termed rare have also been located on the Helena National Forest. They are
Klaus' bladderpod (Lesquerella klausii) and Long-styled thistle (Cirsium longistylum). Two
additional rare plants, Moschatel (Adoxa moschalellina) and lesser rushy mikvetch
(Astragalus connvallarius) are believed to occur on the Helena National Forest but currently
have no occurrence records.
If any of these species are verified on the Forest, appropriate measures, pursuant to Section
7 of the Endanger(ed) Species Act, will be taken.

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 600

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The Forest Plan refers to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Section 7(a)(1) states that
“All other Federal agencies shall…utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this
chapter by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened
species….” Section 7(a)(2) states that “Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such
agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or
threatened or result in the destruction or adverse modification of (its) habitat” (Reel et al. 1989).
Subsequent to the completion of the Forest Plan, the Regional Forester has designated sensitive
plant species for the Region and identified the known and suspected species for each Forest.
Regional office direction in 2011 updated the Forest's sensitive species list. That list still includes
two of the species listed in the Forest Plan, Howell's gumweed and Missoula phlox (now called
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis instead of P. missoulensis). The other species listed in the Forest
Plan are not included in the updated sensitive plants list for the Forest or the Northern Region
and are not included in specific species searches. The 2011 list reflects a change made in
November of 2004, in which the Regional Forester removed long-styled thistle (Cirsium
longistylum) from the sensitive plant list. The Regional Sensitive Species list can be found in the
project file.
A letter from the Regional Foresters of Regions 1, 4 and 6, dated August 7, 1995 (see project
file), further defines the Forest Plan intent with the following: “Loss of individuals or habitat can
be considered significant when the potential effect may be: 1.) Contributing to a trend toward
Federal listing; 2.) Results in a significantly increased risk of loss of viability to a species; or, 3.)
Results in a significantly increased risk of loss of viability to a significant population (stock).”

Assumptions
The following assumptions were used:
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

The sensitive species list and descriptions for the Helena National Forest were used for
the analysis as described in appendix A;
Geospatial information systems combined with habitat information, on the ground
experience and past surveys are useful to screen areas of low probability of species
occurrence;
Reconnaissance of representative habitats is appropriate to determine the presence of
sensitive plant populations;
Known habitats need to be specifically identified and surveyed in the field;
No ground disturbing activities are proposed in this project;
Use of over-snow motorized vehicles would not result in any plant disturbance as the
ground would be covered with snow; and
Roads and motorized trails located on private land and those that are not under Forest
Service management were not considered in this analysis.

Design Features
The following design criteria are applicable for all action alternatives.
For populations known to occur within the project area, a buffer would be established around
each plant population as a no-entry zone for equipment associated with road maintenance. A
100-foot buffer would be established around any known populations where no herbicide
application would occur. The exception for this would be Juncus hallii, which is not affected by

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 601

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

broadleaf herbicides; non-specific herbicides such as Round-up would not be allowed for
application within a 100-foot buffer of Juncus hallii populations.
If any sensitive plant populations are found within road rights-of-way, those areas would be
buffered and protected using design criteria appropriate for the species.
Weed treatment, such as herbicide application, will be consistence with guidance from the
Helena National Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS (2006) such that sensitive plant
populations will be protected.

Monitoring
Continual survey work within potential habitat would occur associated with other projects and
would add to the knowledge base for sensitive plant populations and habitat. This information
would be used to protect new populations as described above.

Information Used
Experience, GIS analysis and information from plant surveys in adjacent areas and specific plant
surveys in high potential habitat were used to determine areas that would be more likely to
support sensitive plant populations.
The Montana Natural Heritage Program (MTNHP) maintains a statewide database for sensitive
species. Data from the Montana Natural Heritage Program were used for known sensitive plant
populations. Ground reconnaissance was conducted by the Helena National Forest ecologist
and trained field crews in representative habitats within the Divide Travel Planning Area.
FIA plot protocol requires identification of sensitive plant species; these data were analyzed for
sensitive plant presence. Botanists were part of data collection crews in the FIA data collection
and were instructed to look for sensitive plants while travelling between plots as well as while
collecting data at plots.
New plant populations have been found and are included in the Forest GIS layer as well as this
analysis.
Past surveys by the Montana Natural Heritage Program (Barton and Crispin 2002; Poole and
Heidel 1993) as well as past surveys by the Helena National Forest ecologist were used to focus
the survey work.
Surveys conducted in conjunction with other projects were used to supplement the knowledge
base for the Divide Travel Planning Area. Potential habitat was identified by selecting land types
that commonly have high or perched water tables, along with slopes of 0 to10 percent to locate
treatment areas that may support habitat for the species that require moist habitats. Potential
wetlands were surveyed by trained field crews who also searched for sensitive plant species.
A University of Montana Master’s study (Nock 2008) was conducted within the Divide Travel
Planning Area that identified potential habitat which was then surveyed for sensitive plants.
Both negative and positive survey information was used from all surveys in the preparation of
this analysis.

Methodology & Scientific Accuracy (40 CFR 1502.15)
The methodology used for this analysis includes best available data from several geospatial
layers using known sensitive plant populations to predict sensitive plant habitat.

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 602

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

General reconnaissance surveys as well as FIA data collection were conducted in the project
area. Botanists were part of the FIA data collection crews and were instructed to search for
sensitive plants while travelling between data points as well as at the data points themselves.
The specific layers used to identify potential sensitive plant populations include the Montana
Natural Heritage Program data on sensitive species, the Helena National Forest Soil Survey
(USDA 2001), habitat types from the Master Vegetation database, experience from past surveys
and field crew surveys in areas identified as potential habitat.
Botrychium crenulatum, Juncus hallii and Schoenoplectus subterminalis, are associated with
wetlands and moist areas. Potential wetlands were modeled using sensitive land types - areas
identified as having wet or moist areas and slopes less than 10 percent. These areas were
intersected with potential habitat and surveyed in 2009 across various project areas. In 2009
focus was on the Telegraph project area which has known populations of Juncus hallii. In 2010,
the Ten Mile area and MacDonald pass areas were surveyed, using a potential wetlands GIS
layer developed by the Forest hydrologist (see project file). A species list associated with each
wetland is available in the project file. Numerous populations of Juncus hallii were found during
field surveys in 2009 across the Forest; 10 populations were within the Divide Travel Planning
Area. No other species associated with moist to wet habitats were found during these surveys.
In 2012, an additional Juncus hallii population was located within the project area.
Schoenoplectus subterminalis is known from the Indian Meadows Research Natural Area on the
Lincoln Ranger District. The species was not found during riparian surveys using Pacific INFISH
Biological Opinion (PIBO) protocols in sample sites across the Forest, or in wetland surveys
across various project areas. Plot locations for negative survey locations for these species are
maintained in GIS databases as well as the wetlands data referred to above.
Botrychium paradoxum and Phlox kelseyi var missoulensis are associated with non-forest
habitats. The R1-VMAP product (USDA 2009) was used to identify non-forested areas within
major grazing allotments within the project area (i.e. Little Blackfoot and North Divide
allotments). Plot data was collected throughout these allotments by field crews trained to
identify sensitive plant species. FIA and FIA grid intensification data points have not discovered
any populations of these species to date. Numerous negative survey data (other than FIA data)
is maintained in GIS databases. The Montana Natural Heritage Program database identifies 10
areas of Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis on the Helena National Forest. Two of those populations
of Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis were located on the Forest in 2008 by the Forest Ecologist and
Regional Botanist and three additional populations were found in 2009 while the Forest was
validating a model which predicts sensitive plant habitat (Nock 2008; Bicker field surveys 2009).
One additional population was found in 2008 and verified in 2011 by the Forest Ecologist (see
project file, Olsen notes). Two additional populations were located in 2014. In total eight
populations occur in the Divide Travel Plan Area. Details for field survey protocols and areas that
were searched can be found in the project file.
Cypripedium parviflorum is found in fens, damp mossy woods, seepage areas and moist forestmeadow ecotones in valleys and lower elevations in the mountains. This species had been
identified in the Montana Natural Heritage Program database as being present in the Mount
Helena area, but has never been relocated. The Montana Natural Heritage Program botanist has
determined that the location was likely in error (see project file). Habitat for the species is
limited in the project area. Numerous negative survey data (other than FIA data) is maintained
in GIS databases. The species has not been located on the Forest to date.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Numerous surveys and inventories have been conducted in the Divide Travel Plan area over the
past 20-years or more: FIA grid intensification plots are a systematic placement of intensive
inventory plots where data collectors are instructed to search for and identify sensitive plant
species (see project file for detailed information on FIA data collection procedures); roadside
surveys associated with noxious weed infestations (Barton and Crispin 2002), project level
reconnaissance by Forest Service field crews; riparian study plots; field survey crew inventories
(Little Blackfoot and North Divide Allotments). Negative survey information is used in
identifying potential habitat and as well as to help identify areas that do not support sensitive
plant habitat. A list of past projects in the Divide Travel Plan area can be found in the cumulative
effects table appendix B.
A literature review has been completed of available information on sensitive plant species,
habitat and disturbance process effects on flora. (Barton and Crispin 2002; Chadde et al. 1998;
Cooper et al. 2005; Hurd et al. 1994; Keane at al. 2012; Mack et al. 2000; Montana Natural

Reel et al. 1989; Tomback et al. 2001)

Sensitive Plants, Affected Environment
Introduction
Sensitive species in the Northern Region of the Forest Service are those plant and animal species
identified by the Regional Forester for which population viability is a concern. Viability concern
is evidenced by: 1.) substantial current or predicted downward trends in population numbers or
density and/or 2.) substantial current or predicted downward trends in habitat capability that
would reduce a species’ existing distribution (Reel et al. 1989).
The Helena National Forest has known or suspected occurrences of 21 species of sensitive
plants. A complete list of these species and a description of associated habitat can be found in
Table 143. The likelihood of occurrence of a given species within the project area and status is
listed below.
The species listed as “possible” are those species whose habitat is potentially included in the
project area. The remaining species do not have habitat that would be directly impacted by
these activities, due to the type of habitat or geographic location in which the plants occur.
The species that are specifically addressed in this analysis are those identified as possible in the
project area (indicated in bold in Table 143).

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Botrychium crenulatum has not been found to-date on the Helena National Forest. This species
has been found on the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, immediately adjacent in the
Occidental Plateau area. The habitat for this species is moist to wet areas, similar habitat to that
of Juncus hallii. This species is searched for in all wetland and riparian surveys but has not been
found to-date.
Botrychium paradoxum is known from two populations on the Helena National Forest, one
population is known within the Divide Travel Plan project area. The population is near a
motorized trail in the Irish Mine Hill area in an open rough fescue grassland area. This species
has been found in sagebrush/rough fescue shrublands and rough fescue grasslands on the
Helena National Forest.
Cypripedium parviflorum has not been found to-date on the Forest. An unverified record of this
species from the Mount Helena area has been determined to be unfounded (see project file).
Habitat for this species includes fens, moist woods and seepage areas in the lower mountain
areas. Limited habitat exists in the project area due to the low elevation that this species
occupies, along with the moist habitat requirements.
Juncus hallii is known to occur at several locations on the Helena National Forest. In the Divide
project area, Hall’s rush is documented at 18 locations, including sites discovered in 2009 and
2012 during project surveys. The populations are associated with the headwaters of Ontario and
Clemmer gulches, above Sally Anne Creek, in Sure Thing swamps, one location in the
headwaters of Tenmile Creek and a population near Chessman reservoir. This species typically
occurs in moist grasslands and sedge meadows (Poole and Heidel 1993). The Helena populations
are on the edge of more moist riparian or wetland areas, similar to the habitat for Botrychium
crenulatum. Many negative surveys were found during wetland identifications. The populations
tend to be small and isolated; it is likely that many populations could exist, particularly in the
area where other known populations are concentrated. The species has not been found to date
west of the Little Blackfoot River or north of Highway 12 in the project area.
Although widespread across the mountainous portions of southwest and central Montana,
Juncus hallii is rare. Threats and potential negative impacts to most known occurrences appear
to be minimal and the species is likely tolerant of some levels of disturbance (MTNHP 2013). The
Montana Natural Heritage Program has recently removed Hall’s rush from their Species of
Concern list, its status re-determined as low-risk, low priority due to its occurrence in at least 15
subwatersheds.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis has eight known populations within the analysis area. Two large
populations, north and south of the highway on MacDonald pass, one population in the Austin
Creek area, one population near Baldy Ridge, one small population on FS Trail 501 (Kading
cabin); one east of Larabee Gulch road; one between the top of Kading Grade (FS Trail 501) and
the Fred Burr road, 1868; one on either side of FS Road 708-E3 (Snowshoe Creek). Several of
the populations are near motorized travel-ways. The MacDonald Pass site is adjacent to noxious
weeds. The other populations do not currently have noxious weeds immediately adjacent to the
populations. This species could occur in other areas of rough fescue grasslands within the
project area. Negative survey information is available in the project file.
Pinus albicaulis occurs in higher elevations throughout the Helena National Forest. Within the
project area, whitebark pine is present on subalpine fir climax habitat types. This landscape
does not contain the elevations and sites where whitebark pine would be a tree-line dominant.
It is a minor and often understory component in sites dominated by lodgepole pine and/or

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 607

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

subalpine fir and Engelmann spruce. In the Divide Travel Plan Project area, whitebark pine
occurs on at least 1,102 acres. Numerous route segments, ranging from 0 to 0.3 miles and
totaling 18.8 miles intersect whitebark pine stands (see project file).
Whitebark pine is a keystone species because of its various roles in supporting community
diversity and a foundation species for its roles in promoting community development and
stability (Keane et al 2012). Whitebark pine forests are declining across most of their range in
North America because of the combined effects of mountain pine beetle outbreaks, fire
exclusion policies and white pine blister rust. It can be promoted by removing competing
conifers and creating suitable sites for regeneration.
“The decline of whitebark pine comes from a synergism of natural and human-driven
causes. Periodic, massive outbreaks of mountain pine beetle, killing mature whitebark
pines, have been exacerbated by suppression of natural fires. A major reduction in highelevation fires since the early 1900’s has led to successional replacement of whitebark
pine on more productive sites in the part of its range where it otherwise should be
abundant…White pine blister rust is killing whitebark pine trees in the intermountain
region, coastal ranges and Canadian Rocky Mountains and rangewide mortality is
expected within one to several decades.” (Tomback et al 2001, p. 13)
Whitebark pine is dependent on fire to maintain dominance and vigor. It is shade intolerant and
susceptible to mountain pine beetle and the exotic disease white pine blister rust. The success
of mountain pine beetle and white pine blister rust has been exacerbated by drought. See the
Forested Habitats of Special Concern report, in the project record, for more detailed
descriptions of these mortality agents and the ecology of whitebark pine. On the Helena
National Forest, there is whitebark pine mortality from insects and disease and evidence for the
decline of this species is supported by recent Aerial Detection Survey reports and other
whitebark pine monitoring. Again, see the Forested Habitats of Special Concern, in the project
record, report for further details.
Keane and others (2012) published A Range-Wide Restoration Strategy for Whitebark Pine
(Pinus albicaulis), providing a comprehensive strategy for whitebark restoration. The strategy
contains four principles:
1.

2.
3.
4.

Promote rust resistance, by a) supporting selective breeding programs to develop
and deploy blister-rust resistant whitebark; b) facilitating and accelerating natural
selection for rust resistant trees by reducing competition, providing openings for
natural seed dispersal and seedling survival; and c) planting seedlings from trees
known to have some level of resistance.
Conserve genetic diversity, by collecting and archiving seeds and growing and
planting genetically diverse seedlings.
Saving seed sources, by protecting mature seed-producing resistant whitebark pine
trees so that apparent rust-resistant seeds can be harvested in the future; and
Employing restoration treatments, by considering whitebark pine areas that are in
decline for restoration treatments, including limiting the spread of blister rust, using
fire to encourage regeneration, implementing silvicultural cuttings to reduce
competition and increase vigor and reduce likelihood of mountain pine beetle
attacks, planting rust-resistant seedlings to accelerate the effects of selection and
promoting natural regeneration and diverse age-class structures to maintain

ecosystem function and reduce landscape level beetle hazard and to provide large
populations for selection for rust resistance.
Recommended actions relative to these principles include assessments, planning, reducing
disturbance impacts, gathering seeds, growing seedlings, protecting seed sources, implementing
treatments, planting seedlings, monitoring activities and conducting research (Keane et al.
2012).
Polygonum douglasii ssp. austiniae is known from loose talus slopes in the Big Belts Mountains
on the Helena National Forest. There are no known populations within the project area. Other
occurrences are documented by the Montana Natural Heritage Program near the project area.
This species may exist within the project area in talus slopes, other sparsely vegetated areas and
potentially along roads.
Schoenoplectus subterminalis is known from the Indian Meadows Research Natural Area on the
Helena National Forest. There are no known populations within the project area. This species
occurs in very wet sites on the edges of ponds, bogs and open water.
All species on the sensitive species list are searched for in any sensitive plant surveys.
Numerous past vegetation data collection efforts by Forest personnel and Montana Natural
Heritage Program staff have failed to discover any sensitive plant populations in the project
area. Forest Inventory Analysis Intensified Grid data collection that occurred on a grid across the
entire Divide Travel Plan area in 2007 and 2008 did not identify any sensitive plant populations.

Species Unlikely To Be Present
As stated above, all species on the sensitive plant list are searched for during field surveys. The
species discussed below that are followed with * have been found on or very near the Helena
National Forest. Habitats for all species are described in appendix D of the sensitive species
specialist report in the project record.
Astragalus lackschewitzii, Drosera anglica*, Drosera linearis*, Epipactis gigantean, Oxytropis
podocarpa and Veratrum californicum all have specialized habitat that does not occur in the
analysis area. These species will not be included in the effects analysis as the specialized
habitats are not known to occur.
Amerorchis rotundifolia, Aquilegia brevistyla, Cypripedium passerinum, Goodyera repens,
Grindelia howellii, Saxifraga tempestiva and Thalictrum alpinum are unlikely to occur due to
geographic separation from known habitats. These species have not been found on the Helena
National Forest to date. Habitat for these species potentially exists in the analysis area.
These species will not be analyzed further.

Sensitive Plants, Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to All Alternatives

A direct effect of motorized travel would be the constant exposure of weed seeds to the rightsof-way of motorized travel-ways, specifically those areas with a sensitive plant population.
Noxious weeds can out-compete most native plants for nutrients, water and sunlight. The
spread of noxious weeds has a very adverse potential impact on sensitive plant populations
forestwide (Mack 2000; Pauchard et al 2003). If these species are left unchecked it is likely that
noxious weeds would occupy sensitive plant populations, especially those close to motorized
SENSITIVE PLANTS - 609

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

routes in drier habitats. The Helena National Forest requires weed-seed-free feed for stock
users; this limits the exposure of noxious weeds seeds in non-motorized areas. Bicycles can carry
weed seeds, but is much less likely to carry weed seed or plant parts any distance. Animals (both
domestic and wild) can carry noxious weed seeds in their coats (Campbell and Gibson 2001;
Myers et al. 2004). An indirect effect of weed infestations in the rights-of-ways would be that
the entire project area would be exposed to weed introduction and transfer by motorized
vehicles (Trunkle and Fay 1991) and to a lesser extent, bicycles and other non-motorized travel.
The increased weed presence would pose a threat to sensitive plants and their habitat
throughout the travel plan area.
In addition to spreading weeds, vehicles that travel off established routes have the potential to
directly harm sensitive plant populations by driving in or near the populations.
The presence of humans in the forest increases the risk of man-caused wildfire, which would be
an indirect impact. The potential exists for wildfire to have a short term detrimental effect on
sensitive plant habitats, but no long-term effects in most cases. However, there has been a
dramatic increase of severe wildfires in the ponderosa pine type in recent decades where fuels
have built up due to fire suppression (Agee and Skinner 2005). In these habitats there is
potential for long-term damage to sensitive plant habitats (Menges and Dolan 1998;
Pendergrass et al. 1999). Plant response to fire is a result of the interaction between severity of
the fire and the individual plant species’ inherent resistance to injury and ability to recover
(Brown et al. 2000). Mortality of herbaceous species is more dependent on the length of time
plants are exposed to high heat, determined by the amount of duff and woody fuel consumed
by the fire, than flame length and fire intensity (Armour et al. 1984). The effect of wildfire on
sensitive plant habitats therefore would depend on the surface fuel conditions. The longer fuels
build up on the forest floor, the greater the potential damage to sensitive plant habitats.
Wildland fires also risk enhancing non-native plant invasions if severe fires damage the native
vegetation. Canada thistle, bull thistle, knapweeds, Dalmation toadflax and cheatgrass have
been shown to increase following wildfire (Harrod and Reichard 2002). Noxious weeds are a
serious threat to sensitive plant habitats. Wildland fires can also exacerbate non-native plant
invasions if native vegetation is damaged by severe fire. Studies in interior ponderosa pine
forests have shown that Canada thistle, bull thistle, knapweeds, Dalmation toadflax and
cheatgrass increase after fire (Jacobs and Sheley 2003; Keeley 2006).
The spread of noxious weeds can have an adverse impact on sensitive plant populations
whether or not a fire occurs. Noxious weeds dominate plant communities and tend to form
monocultures which negatively impact native biological diversity. This weed competition to
individual plants and plant communities can result in loss of species diversity and sensitive
native plants. If noxious weeds are left unchecked, they can out-compete sensitive plant
populations, especially those close to motorized routes in drier habitats. Herbicide application
would have variable effects on sensitive plant populations. Broadleaf herbicides (i.e. 2,4-D or
Tordon) could adversely impact Botrychium crenulatum, Botrychium paradoxum, Cypripedium
parviflorum, Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensi, Pinus albicaulis and Polygonum douglasii ssp.
austiniae with the exception of herbicides that are specifically designed to harm plant families,
such Asteraceae, the aster family. Grass-like species, Juncus hallii and Schoenoplectus
subterminalis, would not be harmed by herbicides designed to kill broadleaf plants. These
species would, however, be harmed by herbicides that are “non-specific” and kill both broadleaf
and grass-like species. An example of this type of herbicide is Round-up. The Helena National
Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS provides guidance for proper weed treatment (USDA 2006)

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 610

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

and provides guidance for appropriate herbicides to be used. Herbicide application used to
control noxious weeds would adversely affect sensitive plant populations as described above
unless sensitive plant populations were protected.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives

The effects common to all alternatives would apply to all action alternatives.

Alternative 1, No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
There are numerous travel-ways that have known sensitive plant populations. Alternative 1 has
the highest amount of motorized travel-ways of all the alternatives.
Botrychium crenulatum has not been found to date on the Helena National Forest. This species
is associated with wetland habitats. This species was not found to-date in field surveys of the
area nor in FIA grid intensification which conducted in the project area. Wetlands, seeps and
springs would be protected from ground disturbance in the design criteria for this project.
Botrychium paradoxum is known from two populations on the Helena National Forest, of which
one was in the Divide Travel Plan area. The habitat for this species on the Helena National Forest
is open grassland and open grassland/sagebrush. The population is adjacent to the junction of
existing travel-ways as shown in Table 144.
Cypripedium parviflorum has not been found on the Helena National Forest. Its habitat is fens,
which are limited in extent within the project area. The habitat also includes damp mossy
woods, seepage areas and moist forest-meadow ecotones in valleys and lower elevations in the
mountains. These habitats are extremely limited in the project area.
Juncus hallii is known from several locations on the Helena National Forest. In the Divide project
area, Hall’s rush is documented in 18 locations, including sites discovered in 2009 and 2012
during project surveys. Of those, five populations of this species are known to exist within or
very close to road rights-of-way within the Divide Travel Plan area. The roads are shown in Table
145 by alternative.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis is known to occur on eight locations within road rights-of-way in
the project area as shown in Table 146.
Pinus albicaulis occurs in higher elevations throughout the Forest. In the Divide Travel Plan area,
whitebark pine is present on subalpine fir climax habitat types. This landscape does not contain
the elevations and sites where whitebark pine would be dominant. In the project area,
whitebark pine occurs on approximately 1,102 acres, identified from stand exam data,
silvicultural diagnoses and anecdotal evidence. Routes with proposed travel changes bisecting
whitebark pine stands are located in the vicinity of Bison Mountain, Treasure Mountain,
Josephine area, Bullion Parks, Luttrell Peak, upper Banner Creek, Chessman Reservoir and Ward
Gulch.
Polygonum douglasii ssp. austiniae has not been found on the Forest. The species has the
potential to exist in the project area on talus slopes, sparsely vegetated areas or along roads.
Schoenoplectus subterminalis is known only from the Indian Meadows Research Natural Area
and only in true fens. This species is associated with wetland habitats and fens which are limited

on the Forest. This species was not found in field surveys of potential wetlands in the area nor in
FIA grid intensification.

Conclusion
Overall, Alternative 1 has the lowest restriction of any alternative. This would be slightly less
restrictive than alternative 2 and substantially less restrictive than alternatives 3, 4 or 5.
Motorized wheeled vehicles would have the potential to introduce noxious weed seeds and
spread noxious weeds at a higher rate than over-snow vehicles or non-motorized means of
travel (Trunkle and Fay 2001).
Botrychium paradoxum populations: Alternative 1 would have a similar impact as alternative 2,
in that both alternatives leave the routes where Botrychium paradoxum is found open to
motorized use.
Juncus hallii populations: Alternative 1 closes 1859-E1 year-round, but leaves the other roads
open. Overall this alternative has potential for adverse impacts to the populations, although
road 1859-E1 is close to the populations and closing this route would benefit the populations.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis populations: Alternative 1 would have the most potential impact
to Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis by leaving all routes with populations open to wheeled
motorized vehicles.
Pinus albicaulis populations: Alternative 1 closes or limits travel to over-snow vehicles on seven
routes. Overall, this alternative provides some protection to the known populations by closing
three roads yearlong and limiting travel to over-snow on the remaining four routes.
Alternative 1 provides the least restrictions to motorized wheeled vehicles. This alternative
would have the highest direct impact on sensitive plant populations by leaving the above roads
and trails open. This alternative would also have the most potential for indirect impacts on the
populations due to the potential for introduction and spread of noxious weed seeds.
Design criteria would be applied to protect populations from ground disturbance activities
and/or herbicide application by implementing a 100-foot buffer around known or discovered
populations.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
There are no irreversible/irretrievable commitments that would affect sensitive plants under
this alternative as known populations would be protected from ground disturbance associated
with road maintenance or the use of herbicides.

Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects analysis area is the Helena National Forest, as effects on plant
populations throughout the Forest are considered in determining potential impacts to the
overall population. Cumulative effects described here for the apply for the all five alternatives.
Cumulative effects from the list of projects noted in the appendix B would be minimal. The
projects that have occurred since 1993 have all had field surveys to determine whether sensitive
plant populations would be impacted by those actions. Where sensitive plant populations were
found, populations were appropriately buffered from treatment. The actions listed in appendix
B could impact individuals or habitat but will not likely contribute to a trend toward Federal
listing or cause a loss of viability to the populations or species.

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 612

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Past activities may have caused minor impacts to sensitive plants or their habitats. The effects of
past activities are reflected in the existing condition of the current sensitive plant populations.
Particularly for those sensitive species related to disturbance (moonworts, whitebark pine, some
habitats for Austin knotweed), these past actions likely resulted in mixed effects (possible
damage or loss of individuals, but improvement of habitat conditions in some affected areas).
Present/ongoing activities that could be contributing to cumulative effects are also described in
appendix B. There are only minor effects to sensitive plant habitats resulting from ongoing
activities, with a low probability of impacting individuals.
Reasonably foreseeable activities that could affect sensitive plants or their habitats are also
addressed in appendix B and the major activities and expected effects are summarized below:
For the reasonably foreseeable future, the following projects have been reviewed; Telegraph
Vegetation Project, Tenmile South Helena Project, Grassy Mountain Vegetation Project,
Stonewall Vegetation Management Project and Blackfoot NonWinter Travel Plan.
Telegraph Vegetation Project. This project would treat approximately 6,300 acres with a
combination of pre-commercial thinning, timber harvest and prescribed fire. Up to six miles of
new temporary road would be built. There are known populations of Pinus albicaulis and Juncus
hallii within the project area. Those populations have been identified and design criteria
appropriate for each species would protect populations.
Tenmile South Helena Project: This project would conduct fuel treatments for the purposes of
maintaining consistent water quantity and quality within Helena's municipal watershed and
improving conditions for public and firefighters safety across the landscape in the event of a
wildfire. There are known populations of Pinus albicaulis and Juncus hallii in the project area.
Surveys will be conducted prior to any ground disturbance. Design criteria would be
implemented as appropriate to protect any sensitive plant populations found.
Grassy Mountain Vegetation Project. This project would treat approximately 3,900 acres with a
combination of prescribed fire and timber harvest. Up to one-half mile of new temporary road
would be built. Intensive vegetation data collection in the project area was completed in 2006.
No sensitive plant populations were found during those surveys or previous surveys. If any
populations are found at any time they will be protected from ground disturbance or herbicide
application.
Stonewall Vegetation Management Project: This project would treat approximately 8,500 acres
with a combination of pre-commercial thinning, timber harvest and prescribed fire. Up to five
miles of new temporary road would be built. Field surveys of the proposed units and temporary
roads were completed in 2009. There are known populations of Pinus albicaulis in the project
area. Design criteria would protect all known sensitive plant populations as appropriate. If
additional sensitive plant populations are found at any time, they would be protected from
ground disturbance or herbicide application.
Blackfoot NonWinter Travel Plan: This decision would be to determine what roads would be
open to motorized traffic. The decision would also include prescriptions for closing routes which
would include ground disturbance. There are known sensitive plant populations of Drosera
anglica, Drosera linearis, Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis, Pinus albicaulis and Schoenoplectus
subterminalis within the project area that could potentially be affected. These populations have
been identified in the sensitive plant analysis and would be protected from ground disturbing

activities and herbicide application. Design criteria and monitoring would protect any sensitive
plant populations found.
Surveys are currently occurring or have been completed for reasonably foreseeable actions. If
populations have been/are found, they will be protected from ground disturbance or herbicide
application. For more information, please see the Cumulative Effects in appendix B to this
report.

Alternative 2
Direct and Indirect Effects
The routes affecting known sensitive plant populations are shown under alternative 1. The
impacts associated with alternative 2 are fewer than the impacts associated with alternative 1.
Overall, alternative 2 would only eliminate wheeled motorized use on approximately 132 miles
of the travel-ways in the Divide Travel plan area. This would be slightly more restrictive than
alternative 1, but substantially less restrictive than alternatives 3, 4 or 5. Motorized wheeled
vehicles would have the potential to introduce noxious weed seeds and spread noxious weeds
at a higher rate than over-snow vehicles or non-motorized means of travel (Trunkle and Fay
2001).

Conclusion
Botrychium paradoxum populations: Alternative 2 would have a similar impact as alternative 1,
in that both alternatives leave the routes where Botrychium paradoxum is found open to
motorized use.
Juncus hallii populations: Alternative 2 would limit road 1863 to over-snow, but would leave the
other roads open. This alternative is likely have the most potential impact to the species, as the
populations are closer to road 1859-E1 than to road 1863.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis populations: Alternative 2 is likely to have the potential for
impact (similar to alternative 1) to Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis by leaving all routes open to
wheeled motorized vehicles.
Pinus albicaulis populations: Alternative 2 provides some protection to populations by closing
three roads yearlong and limiting travel to over-snow on the remaining four routes.
This alternative would have a lower indirect impact on the populations, as compared to
alternative 1, in relation to the potential for introduction and spread of noxious weed seeds
throughout the travel plan area.
Design criteria would be applied to this alternative to protect populations from ground
disturbance or herbicide application within a 100-foot buffer as appropriate.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
There are no irreversible/irretrievable commitments that would affect sensitive plants under
this alternative as known populations would be protected from ground disturbance associated
with road maintenance or the use of herbicides.

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 614

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Cumulative Effects
Please see the cumulative effects section under alternative 1 for a description of projects. Under
alternative 2, the cumulative effects would likely be minimal as known plant populations would
be protected.
Surveys are currently occurring or have been completed for reasonably foreseeable actions. If
populations have been or are found, they will be protected from ground disturbance and
herbicide application. For more information, please see the Cumulative Effects appendix for the
sensitive species specialist report.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
The routes affecting known sensitive plant populations are shown under alternative 1.
Alternatives 3 and 4 would impose less impact by restricting the use of motorized vehicles more
than alternatives 1 or 2, although alternative 5 is the most restrictive. Alternative 3 would be
most beneficial to Botrychium paradoxum as compared to other alternatives. Alternative 3 and
4 both provide similar benefit to Juncus hallii, only slightly better than alternative 5. Alternative
3 would be slightly less beneficial to Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis as compared to alternatives
4 and 5, but more beneficial than alternatives 1 or 2.
Overall, alternative 3 would restrict motorized use on approximately199 miles of the travel-ways
in the project area. This would be less restrictive then alternative 5, but would provide better
long-term protection of sensitive plants by limiting potential exposure to noxious weed
infestations than alternatives 1 or 2.

Conclusion
Botrychium paradoxum populations: Alternative 3 would provide the most protection to this
species by closing both motorized routes year-round. This is the only alternative that closes
both routes.
Juncus hallii populations: Alternatives 3 and 4 provide the best protection for the plant
populations, by limiting all of the roads, affecting this population, except 1859-B1 to over-snow,
when minimal damage would be done.
Pinus albicaulis: Alternative 3 provides some protection to this species as it limits travel to oversnow vehicles on six routes as does alternative 4.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis populations: Alternative 3 would provide protection for known
populations by closing four of the five routes motorized vehicles either totally, or allows only
over-snow vehicles.
This alternative would have a substantially lower potential for indirect impact on the
populations as compared to alternatives 1 and 2 with regards to the introduction and spread of
noxious weed seeds throughout the travel plan area because motorized vehicle use would be
restricted.
Design criteria would be applied to this alternative to protect populations from ground
disturbance or herbicide application within a 100-foot buffer as appropriate.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
There are no irreversible/irretrievable commitments that would affect sensitive plants under
this alternative as known populations would be protected from ground disturbance associated
with road maintenance or the use of herbicides.

Cumulative Effects
Please see the cumulative effects section under alternative 1 for a description of projects. Under
alternative 3, the cumulative effects would likely be minimal as no known plant populations
would be affected.

Alternative 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
The routes affecting known sensitive plant populations are shown under alternative 1.
Alternatives 3 and 4 would impose less impact by restricting the use of motorized vehicles more
than alternatives 1 or 2, although alternative 5 is the most restrictive. Alternatives 4 and 5 are
the most beneficial to Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis as compared to alternatives 1, 2 and 3.
Alternative 4 is slightly less beneficial to Botrychium paradoxum as compared to Alternative 3.
Overall, alternative 4 would restrict motorized use on approximately 187 miles of the travelways in the project area. This would be slightly less restrictive then alternative 3 but would
provide better long-term protection of sensitive plants by limiting potential exposure to noxious
weed infestations than alternatives 1 or 2.

Conclusion
Botrychium paradoxum populations: Alternative 4 would provide slightly less than alternative 3
protection by closing one of the routes that affect this population to motorized wheeled
vehicles year-round.
Juncus hallii populations: Alternatives 3 and 4 provide the best protection for the plant
populations, by limiting all of the roads with the exception of 1859-B1, which is open to oversnow vehicles, when minimal damage would be done to the plant species.
Pinus albicaulis populations: Alternative 4 provides some protection to this species as it limits
travel to over-snow vehicles on six routes as does Alternative 3.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis populations: Alternative 4 and 5 provide the best protection for
this species as they close all five open routes with populations.
This alternative would have a substantially lower potential for indirect impact on the
populations as compared to alternatives 1 and 2 with the lower potential for introduction and
spread of noxious weed seeds throughout the travel plan area because motorized vehicle use
would be restricted.
Design criteria would be applied to this alternative to protect populations from ground
disturbance or herbicide application within a 100-foot buffer as appropriate.

Cumulative Effects
Please see the cumulative effects section under alternative 1 for a description of projects. Under
alternative 4, the cumulative effects would likely be minimal as no known plant populations

Alternative 5

The routes affecting known sensitive plant populations are shown under alternative 1.
Alternative 5 is the most restrictive alternative, but along with alternatives 3 and 4, impose the
least impact by restricting the use of motorized vehicles more than alternatives 1 and 2.
Alternative 5 is most beneficial to Pinus albicaulis. Alternative 5 provided similar benefit to Phlox
kelseyi var. missoulensis as compared to alternative 4.
Overall, alternative 5 would restrict motorized use on approximately 250 miles of the travelways in the project area. This would be the most restrictive alternative and would provide the
most long-term protection of sensitive plants by limiting potential exposure to noxious weed
infestations.

Conclusion
Botrychium paradoxum populations: Alternative 5 provides limited protection to this species by
limiting travel to vehicles less than 50 inches in width on routes that affect the population.
Juncus hallii populations: Alternatives 3 and 4 provide slightly better protection than alternative
5 for the plant populations, by limiting all of the roads with the exception of 1859-B1, which is
open to over-snow, when minimal damage would be done.
Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis populations: Alternatives 4 and 5 provide the best protection for
this species as it would close all five open routes with known populations.
Pinus albicualis: Alternative 5 provides the best protection for this species by closing or limiting
travel to over-snow on ten routes.
This alternative would have a substantially lower potential for indirect impacts on the
populations as compared to alternatives 1 and 2 with the lower potential for introduction and
spread of noxious weed seeds throughout the travel plan area because motorized vehicle use
would be restricted.
Design criteria would be applied to this alternative to protect populations from ground

Conclusions
Alternative 1, No Action, would have the highest potential impact on sensitive plants by having
the least restriction on motorized wheeled vehicles.
Overall, alternatives 3, 4 and 5 would have the lowest level of potential to affect sensitive plant
populations by restricting motorized wheeled vehicle use, with alternative 4 or 5 providing the
most benefit to Phlox kelseyi var. missoulensis and alternative 3 being more beneficial to
Botrychium paradoxum. Alternatives 3 and 4 both offer similar benefit to Juncus hallii, which is
only slightly better than alternative 5. Alternative 5 would be most beneficial to Pinus albicaulis.
Alternative 2 would have more potential for adverse effects than alternatives 3, 4, or 5, but
somewhat less impact than alternative 1. With the design criteria and proposed mitigation, the
action alternatives may impact individuals, but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability to any of the populations present.
Overall, alternative 5 would eliminate wheeled motorized use on approximately 250 miles of the
travel-ways in the Divide Travel Planning Area and would be the most restrictive alternative.
Alternative 4 would be slightly less restrictive than alternative 3; closing approximately 187
miles to wheeled motorized use compared to approximately 199 miles, but would provide
better long-term protection of sensitive plants by limiting potential exposure to noxious weed
infestations than alternative 1 and 2. Alternative 2 differs very little from alternative 1 in the
respect that it would only eliminate wheeled motorized use on approximately four miles.

Sensitive Plants Biological Evaluation
SPECIES- Botrychium crenulatum
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects of Proposed Actions
This species is known from the Beaverhead-Deerlodge Forest, immediately adjacent to the
Helena National Forest. This species is associated with wetland habitats. This species was not
found in field surveys of the area nor in FIA grid intensification which included the project area.
Wetlands, seeps and springs would be protected from ground disturbance in the design criteria
for this project. Should any populations be found, a buffer would be established around each
plant population as a no-entry zone for equipment associated with road maintenance. This
species would be impacted by broadleaf herbicides. Should any populations be found, a 100foot buffer would be established around any populations and would become a no herbicide
zone. See cumulative effects section under alternative 1 and the cumulative effects appendix to
the sensitive species specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability because the design criteria described above would protect potential
habitat.

Alternative 3 would provide the best protection for this population as no motorized vehicles
would travel the routes during the growing season. Alternatives 1 and 2 would have the most
potential impact as both routes would be open to motorized traffic. Alternative 4 would provide
some protection by closing trail 501 year-round.
A buffer would be established around each plant population as a no-entry zone for equipment
associated with road maintenance. This species would be impacted by broadleaf herbicides. A
100-foot buffer around the known populations would be a no herbicide zone. See cumulative
effects section under alternative 1 and the cumulative effects appendix to the sensitive species
specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability. The existing routes have been in place for many years and the
population has not been impacted. As long as the routes do not change location, direct impacts
to the population are unlikely. Indirect impacts due to noxious weeds would be more likely with
alternatives 1, 2 or 4. Alternative 3 would provide the best protection to this population.
Implementation of appropriate design criteria would provide additional protection to the
population from herbicides.

SPECIES- Cypripedium parviflorum:

This species has not been found on the Helena National Forest. The habitat is fens, which are
limited in extent on the forest. The habitat also includes damp mossy woods, seepage areas and
moist forest-meadow ecotones in valleys and lower elevations in the mountains. These habitats
would be protected by design criteria that limit ground disturbance in wet habitats.
If any populations are found in the future, a buffer would be established around each plant
population as a no-entry zone for equipment associated with road maintenance. This species

would be impacted by broadleaf herbicides. A 100-foot buffer around the known populations
would be a no herbicide zone. See cumulative effects section under alternative 1 and the

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability. Design criteria as described above would protect potential habitat.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Alternatives 3 and 4 provide the best protection for the plant populations, by limiting all of the
roads except 1859-B1 to over-snow, when minimal damage would be done. Alternative 1 closes
1859-E1 year-round, but leaves the other roads open. Overall alternative 1 has potential for
adverse impacts to the populations, although road 1859-E1 is close to the populations and
closing this route would benefit the populations. Alternative 2 would limit road 1863 to oversnow, but would leave the other roads open. Alternative 2 would have the most potential to
impact the species, as the populations are closer to road 1859-E1 than to road 1863.
Ground disturbance would be the most likely direct impact to these populations. Wetlands,
seeps and springs would be protected from ground disturbance in the design criteria for this
project. A buffer would be established around each plant population as a no-entry zone for
equipment associated with road maintenance. This species would not be impacted by broadleaf
herbicides. Non-specific herbicides such as Roundup would damage the population. A 100-foot
buffer around the known populations would be a no herbicide zone if non-specific herbicides
were applied. See cumulative effects section under alternative 1 and the cumulative effects
appendix to the sensitive species specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability. The populations are all some distance from the road prisms and are
within wet areas. This species would not be impacted by most herbicides. The design criteria
associated with the project would protect the populations from disturbance. Road
maintenance in this area would be designed to protect the populations.

Alternatives 4 and 5 close a total of five routes to motorized vehicles either totally or only
allows over-snow vehicles which is one more road than the other alternatives. The additional
route that is closed (road 1802-C1) is near a large population and would provide additional
protection although there are open roads near the population. Alternative 3 closes or limits
travel to over-snow vehicles on four routes. Alternatives 1 and 2 would have essentially the
same (and the most) potential impact to this species by leaving all routes open to wheeled
motorized vehicles.

SENSITIVE PLANTS - 622

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

The greatest danger to this species would be from noxious weed infestations, herbicide
application or ground disturbance. A buffer would be established around each plant population
as a no-entry zone for equipment associated with road maintenance. This species would be
impacted by broadleaf herbicides. A 100-foot buffer around the known populations would be a
no herbicide zone, unless site-specific exceptions were made by the Forest Ecologist. See
cumulative effects section under alternative 1 and the cumulative effects appendix to the
sensitive species specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but is not likely to result in a loss of viability, nor cause a
trend toward Federal listing. Alternatives 4 and 5 provide the best protection for populations,
followed by alternative 3. Alternatives 1 and 2 would have the most potential impact to the
populations by leaving routes open. The design criteria associated with the project would
protect the populations from disturbance and damage from herbicides in the road rights-of-way
under all alternatives.

SPECIES- Pinus albicaulis
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects of Proposed Actions
Pinus albicaulis occurs in higher elevations throughout the Helena National Forest. In the Divide
Travel Plan area, whitebark pine is present on subalpine fir climax habitat types. This landscape
does not contain the elevations and sites where whitebark pine would be dominant. In the
Divide Travel Plan area, whitebark pine occurs on approximately 1,102 acres, identified from
stand exam data, silvicultural diagnoses and anecdotal evidence. Routes with proposed travel
changes bisecting whitebark pine stands are located in the vicinity of Bison Mountain, Treasure
Mountain, Josephine area, Bullion Parks, Luttrell Peak, upper Banner Creek, Chessman Reservoir
and Ward Gulch.

Divide Travel Plan

Alternative 5 would provide the best protection for this species because it closes a total of 10
routes to motorized vehicles either totally or only allows over-snow vehicles which is more than
the other alternatives. Alternatives 3 and 4 limit travel to over-snow vehicles on six routes.
Alternative 1 closes or limits travel to over-snow vehicles on five routes. Alternative 2 only limits
travel to over-snow vehicles on four routes and therefore would have the most potential impact
to this species.
Live individuals would be retained where they occur and damage to this species or potential
habitat would be limited as no additional tread is proposed in any of the alternatives. The
greatest danger to this species would be from herbicide application or ground disturbance. A
buffer would be established around each plant population as a no-entry zone for equipment
associated with road maintenance. A 100-foot buffer around known populations would be
implemented as a no herbicide zone, unless site-specific exceptions were made by the Forest
Ecologist. See cumulative effects section under alternative 1 and the cumulative effects
appendix to the sensitive species specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability because the design criteria described above would protect individuals
and potential habitat.

SPECIES- Polygonum douglasii ssp. austiniae
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects of Proposed Actions
This species is known to exist on Bureau of Land Management lands west of Highway 141,
immediately adjacent to the Helena National Forest. This species is known to occur on gravelly,
often shale-derived soil of open slopes and banks in the montane zone. Should any populations
be found, a buffer would be established around each plant population as a no-entry zone for
equipment associated with road maintenance. This species would be impacted by broadleaf
herbicides. Should any populations be found, a 100-foot buffer would be established around any
populations and would then become a no herbicide zone. See cumulative effects section under
alternative 1 and the cumulative effects appendix to the sensitive species specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but is not likely to result in a loss of viability, nor cause a
trend toward Federal listing. The design mitigations as described above would protect
individuals and habitat.

SPECIES- Schoenoplectus subterminalis
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects of Proposed Actions
This species is known from the Indian Meadows Research Natural Area in the northern portion
of the Forest in true fens. This species is associated with wetland habitats and fens which are
limited on the Forest. This species was not found in field surveys of potential wetlands in the
area nor in FIA grid intensification conducted within the project area. Wetlands, seeps and
springs would be protected from ground disturbance in the design criteria for this project.
Should any populations be found, a buffer would be established around each plant population
as a no-entry zone for equipment associated with road maintenance. This species would not be
impacted by broadleaf herbicides. Non-specific herbicides such as Roundup would damage the

non-specific herbicides. See cumulative effects section under alternative 1 and the cumulative
effects appendix to the sensitive species specialist report.

Determination
The decision may impact individuals but would not contribute toward a trend for Federal
listing or loss of viability because the design criteria as described above would protect potential
habitat.

Forest Plan Consistency
The Forest Plan direction for sensitive plants (USDA 1986, II/20) refers to the Endangered
Species Act and pertains only to listed species, none of which occur on the Helena National
Forest. Therefore, this direction is not applicable at this time. Subsequent guidance from the
Regional Office provides direction regarding sensitive plants and their habitats with which the
project as proposed is consistent.

NOXIOUS WEEDS
Regulatory Framework
The Plant Protection Act defines a noxious weed as “any plant or plant product that can directly
or indirectly injure or cause damage to crops (including nursery stock or plant products),
livestock, poultry, or other interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, the natural resources of
the United States, the public health, or the environment” (7 USC 104 § 7702, 2000). Montana
also has a Weed Control Act (7 Montana Code 22 §§ 2101 et seq., 2003) and while Montana
laws do not apply to federal lands, section 2814 of the Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974, as
amended (7 USC 61 § 2814, 1990) 9 requires that federal land management agencies “complete
and implement cooperative agreements with state agencies regarding the management of
undesirable plant species on federal lands under the agency’s jurisdiction and establish
integrated management systems to control or contain undesirable plant species targeted under
cooperative agreements.”
The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (PL 94-588) under 36 CFR 219.10(b) states:
Sustaining ecological systems. The overall goal of the ecological element of sustainability is to
provide a framework to contribute to sustain native ecological systems by providing ecological
conditions to support diversity of native plant and animal species in the plan area. This will
satisfy the statutory requirement to provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based
on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use
objectives (16 U.S.C. 1604(g)(3)(B)). Procedures developed pursuant to 219.1(c) for sustaining
ecological systems must be consistent with the following:
1. Ecosystem diversity. Ecosystem diversity is the primary means by which a plan
contributes to sustaining ecological systems. Plan components must establish a
framework to provide the characteristics of ecosystem diversity in the plan area.
2. Species diversity. If the Responsible Official determines that provisions in plan
components, in addition to those required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are
needed to provide appropriate ecological conditions for specific threatened and
endangered species, species-of-concern and species-of-interest, then the plan must

NOXIOUS WEEDS - 627

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

include additional provisions for these species, consistent with the limits of agency
authorities, the capability of the plan area and overall multiple-use objectives.
The Federal Noxious Weed Act of 1974 (7 USC 2801 et seq.; 88 Stat. 2148) provides for the
control and management of non-indigenous weeds that injure or have the potential to injure
the interests of agriculture and commerce, wildlife resources, or the public health. The act
requires that each federal agency develop a management program to control undesirable plants
on federal lands under the agency's jurisdiction; establish and adequately fund the program;
implement cooperative agreements with state agencies to coordinate management of
undesirable plants on federal lands; and establish integrated management systems to control
undesirable plants targeted under cooperative agreements. A federal agency is not required to
carry out management programs on federal lands unless similar programs are being
implemented on state or private lands in the same area.
Executive Order 13112 directs federal agencies to respond to invasive species that threaten
terrestrial and aquatic resources of the National Forest System (NFS) and to collaborate with
Federal, State and local partners to address invasive species that can spread from adjacent
lands.
The Forest Service (forest) adopted new guidelines for invasive species management in 2011 in
the form of a new Forest Service Manual (FSM) 2900. FSM 2900 was issued in order to comply
with EO 13112 and address adverse impacts from invasive species. FSM 2900 is also intended to
ensure, as a matter of policy, that all forest management activities are designed to minimize or
eliminate the possibility of establishment or spread of invasive species on NFS lands, or to
adjacent areas.
FSM 2080 Supplement R1 2000-2001-1 (USDA 2001) provided prevention and control measures
for resource groups. The supplement is no longer in use as result of the new FSM 2900.
However, similar prevention and control measures as those outlined in FSM 2080 (R1 20002001-1) will be carried forward into a new regional supplement to FSM 2900.
The Helena National Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS (USDA 2006) provides environmental
standards and guidelines for control and management of noxious weeds, specifically the use and
effects of herbicide application.
The Montana Weed Control Act was established in 1948 to protect Montana from destructive
noxious weeds. This act, amended in 1991, established a set of criteria for the control and
management of noxious weeds in Montana. Noxious weeds are defined by this act as being any
exotic plant species that may render land unfit for agriculture, forestry, livestock, wildlife or
other beneficial uses or that may harm native plant communities (Grubb et al 2003). The State
of Montana maintains a Noxious Weed List for the State and individual counties may add
species at the country level as noxious that are not considered noxious at the State level. The
State list, with the appropriate county additions, as of December 2013 was used to identify
noxious species for this analysis. These lists are available in the project file.

Assumptions
The following assumptions were used:
•

The analyses and decisions made in the record of decision for the Helena National
Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS are incorporated in noxious weed analysis and
management on the Helena National Forest. This includes all environmental protection
measures. The environmental protection measures are as follows:

NOXIOUS WEEDS - 628

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Any soil disturbing activity with mechanized equipment has the potential to increase
noxious weed invasion or spread.
It is anticipated that weeds would continue to spread at a rate of approximately 8 to 12
percent on an annual basis (USDA 1998), without disturbance. The rate of spread could
increase in areas affected by ground disturbing activities.
Herbicide use in accordance with the requirements specified in the Helena National
Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS (USDA 2006) is appropriate for noxious weed
management on infested lands.
The Forest noxious weed treatment program would continue to treat approximately 30
percent of the weeds within the project area annually, regardless of whether the project
occurs or not.

The paragraphs below define mapped weed acres and weed treatment acres as used in this
report.
Mapped Weed Acres: Mapped acres are reflected by polygons within which there is at least 1
percent noxious weed cover. There are weeds outside those polygons that are too scattered to
map, or are infestations that have not been discovered yet. The mapped acres are taken from
the layer containing invasive plant information, in the Helena National Forest geographical
information systems (GIS) database.
Weed Treatment Acres: Weed treatment acres for the purposes of this report are assumed to
be the total polygon acres described above.

Design Elements
FSM 2900 requires that all forest management activities are designed to minimize or eliminate
the possibility of establishment or spread of invasive species on National Forest System lands, or
to adjacent areas. The following best management practices are intended to satisfy that
requirement and were designed to minimize the spread of existing invasive plants and prevent
the colonization of new invasive plants within the project area.

Roads – Required Objectives and Associated Practices
1. Incorporate weed prevention into road layout, design and alternative evaluation.
Environmental analysis for road construction and reconstruction would include a weed
risk assessment.
2. Remove the seed source that could be picked up by passing vehicles and limit seed
transport in new and reconstruction areas.
a. Remove all mud, dirt and plant parts from all off road equipment before moving
into project area. Cleaning must occur off National Forest lands. This does not
apply to service vehicles that would stay on the roadway, traveling frequently in
and out of the project area.
b. Landings, skid trails and other areas of disturbance resulting from logging
activities would be monitored for weed infestations.
c. Clean all equipment prior to leaving the project site, if operating in areas
infested with new invaders as determined by the forest weed specialist.
Reference Contract Provision C/CT 6.626.

NOXIOUS WEEDS - 629

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

3. Re-establish vegetation on bare ground due to construction and reconstruction activity
to minimize weed spread.
a. Revegetate all disturbed soil, except the travel way on surfaced roads, in a
manner that optimizes plant establishment for that specific site, unless ongoing
disturbance at the site would prevent weed establishment. Use native material
where appropriate and available. Use a seed mix that includes fast, early season
species to provide quick, dense revegetation. To avoid weed contaminated
seed, each lot must be tested by a certified seed laboratory against the State
noxious weed lists and documentation of the seed inspection test needs to be
provided.
b. Use local seeding guidelines for detailed procedures and appropriate mixes. Use
native material where appropriate and available. Revegetation may include
planting, seeding, fertilization and weed-free mulching as indicated by local
prescriptions.
c. Monitor and evaluate success of revegetation in relation to project plan. Repeat
as indicated by local prescriptions.
4. Minimize the movement of existing and new weed species caused by moving infested
gravel and fill material. The borrow pit would not be used if new invaders, defined by
the forest weed specialist, are found on site.
5. Minimize sources of weed seed in areas not yet revegetated. If straw is used for road
stabilization and erosion control, it must be certified weed-free or weed-seed free.
6. Minimize roadside sources of weed seed that could be transported to other areas during
maintenance.
a. Look for priority weed species during road maintenance and report back to
district weed specialist.
b. Do not blade roads or pull ditches where new invaders are found.
c. Maintain desirable roadside vegetation. If desirable vegetation is removed
during blading or other ground disturbing activities, area must be revegetated
according to section (3) (a), (b), (c) above.
d. Straw used for road stabilization and erosion control would be certified weedfree or weed-seed-free.
7. Reduce weed establishment in road obliteration/reclamation projects. Revegetate
according to section (3) (a), (b), (c) above.

Information Used
A geodatabase contains numerous geospatial layers that provide the data used in this analysis.
This geodatabase is available in the project file. The layers include known locations of weed

reconnaissance of the project area and experience including vegetation monitoring from past
vegetation treatments on the Helena National Forest. Literature review has been completed of
available information on noxious weed species, habitat and the effects of disturbance on flora.
Various datasets were combined using a geographic information system. The data was then
analyzed and reviewed to assist in understanding the relationships and effects of travel routes
on weeds and other flora as well as influences from physical characteristics across the project
area such as landforms and landtypes.
Data used to generate statistics and information regarding existing condition and affected
environment were provided by the Helena National Forest GIS department in the form of a
geodatabase and based on inventories completed in field in the project area in 2003, 2009,
2010, 2011 and 2012. All raw numbers and calculations can be found in the project file.
Numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number and nearest percent.
The geographic analysis area for this proposal is defined as the project boundary. The
cumulative effects section extends beyond the project boundary. The project area is used as the
spatial boundary for direct and indirect effects. Bounding for the analysis of cumulative effects
of past, present and foreseeable future actions is also the project area. Past actions are
considered as part of the existing condition and future effects are considered for 10 years into
the future, which allows an adequate length of time to record vegetative changes relevant to
the purpose of this project. Effects associated with various actions are based on literature,
known weed infestations and specialist experience.

Noxious Weeds, Affected Environment
Analysis Area
The Divide Travel Plan analysis area was used as the analysis area for this project. A 100-foot
wide buffer was applied to all routes within the project area. This includes 1,751 acres and was
used as the analysis area for direct effects. Natural Resources Conservation Service 6th code
Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs) that had roads with noxious weed infestations within the buffer
were used for the affected environment discussion and the pesticide delivery analysis.
Weeds have been expanding on the Helena National Forest for many years. A variety of factors
has contributed to the spread of noxious weeds. According to inventory data compiled in 2011
in support of this analysis, there are over 23,000 acres of mapped noxious weed infestations on
the Helena National Forest and over 5,600 infested acres are in the Divide landscape, which
includes the project area. Noxious weeds are invasive by definition and are able to spread when
there are no natural enemies, pathogens, or ungulate grazing to keep them in check. The spread
of weeds is favored by wildfire and ground disturbance of any kind. More use by the public has
occurred across the Helena National Forest in the past few years due in part to increased OHV
use, recreation displacement from wildfire areas and travel plan closure areas, which place
more pressure on the remaining open areas.
Various methods of weed control are used. Herbicide application is the most common form of
control used in the project area. This analysis tiers to the Helena National Forest Weed
Treatment Project FEIS (USDA 2006) which provides environmental requirements and guidelines
regarding noxious weed treatment and herbicide effects. The Forest treats approximately onethird of the mapped weeds on an annual basis under the normal weed treatment program. The
areas scheduled for treatment in a given year are a combination of: acres associated with
projects with ground disturbing activities; travel and recreation corridors; and re-treatment of

existing infestations. Effectiveness monitoring is used to prioritize the roads and polygons that
need re-treatment.
There are over 23,000 acres of mapped noxious weed infestations on the Helena National
Forest. There is an ongoing effort to accurately map the extent of weeds as new infestations
start every year and old infestations often expand. The following table reflects the mapped
infestations as of 2011 using the dominant noxious weed species in the infested area. Many
populations have more than one noxious species present.

The above table shows large differences between landscape areas in terms of both primary
weed species and acres infested. Dalmation toadflax is a major concern in the Big Belts, while it
is of less, although increasing, concern in the Blackfoot area. Spotted knapweed is a dominant
weed species across all areas. Roadsides are an area commonly infested with noxious weeds.
Roads have high weed infestations due to several reasons: vehicles carry weed seeds, which are
dispersed along travel ways; roads are disturbed by maintenance activities on a regular basis,
which provides a ready seedbed for weed seeds, both the seeds dispersed by vehicles and those

that are carried on the wind or by animals and birds; human use is concentrated along roadsides
which increases the exposure of these areas to noxious weed seed dispersal (Lonsdale 1999;
Pauchard et al. 2003).
Although herbicide application has been the primary noxious weed treatment method,
numerous biological control insectories have been established across the Forest. The Forest
generally treats approximately 3,900 acres of weeds annually (averaging 2007 through 2009 as
typical years). Table 149 shows insect releases made Forestwide from 2005–2008.

to treat weeds.

Current Condition with Planning Area and Buffered Roads

Within the Divide Travel Plan analysis area, approximately 3,178 acres are currently infested
with noxious weeds. The majority of these areas were infested from light (less than 5 percent)
to high (50 percent canopy cover of weeds). This represents approximately 14 percent of the
mapped noxious weed infestations on the Forest. The areas affected by this project are all along
roadsides and as described above, these areas are susceptible to noxious weed infestation.

The following table shows the miles of motorized routes and non-motorized routes within the

There are eight State of Montana noxious weed species of primary concern in terms of
level of infestation in the treatment area: spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa),
Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula),), oxeye daisy
(Leucanthemum vulgare), Dalmation toadflax (Linaria dalmatica), common toadflax
(Linaria vulgare), Orange hawkweed (Hieracium aurantiacum) and sulfur cinquefoil
(Potentilla recta). Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), although not listed as a noxious weed
in the state of Montana, is considered a “regulated plant” by the State and is a species
of concern on the Helena National Forest.
Many infested areas have more than one weed species present; Table 151 shows the
predominant species in the project area. Other common noxious weeds associated with
the “primary” weeds shown above include butter and eggs (Linaria vulgaris). In addition,
a given infestation may have more than one of the primary weed species present. For
example, spotted knapweed may be the primary mapped species, but Canada thistle is
often present as well. Details on additional species in a given infestation are available in
the GIS layer available in the project file.
Spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) has the largest extent of infestation within
the project area. The species occurs along roadsides and throughout south facing areas
of past harvest, as well as in the natural grasslands. Spotted knapweed thrives in open
areas, with forest canopies of less than 20 percent closure. Spotted knapweed spreads
almost entirely by prolific seed production (Zouhar 2001a). This species has also been
shown to have allelopathic properties, secreting toxins that suppress the growth of
other plants, although resource competition is just as effective in its ability to dominate
areas (Zouhar 2001a).
Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) has been mapped on a smaller area as compared to
spotted knapweed. This species spreads primarily by adventitious root buds that may
form new adventitious shoots can develop along the root at any location (Zouhar
2001b). Canada thistle is present in much of the project area, generally associated with
roadside disturbance or harvest disturbance. Its habitat is restricted to open areas of
less than 10 percent canopy closure.
Orange hawkweed (Hieracium aurantiacum) is one of the most dangerous weeds in the
project area (Stone 2010), although it is known only at one location. Orange hawkweed
forms a monoculture by establishing a dense mat of plants, lowers biodiversity and
reduces the forage value of grasslands for grazing animals. This plant is a successful
competitor, crowding out native, pasture and range species (Prather et al. 2003).
Hawkweed species are allelopathic (Murphy and Aarssen 1995). It hybridizes freely with
native and non-native hawkweeds (Rinella and Sheley 2002).
Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) is found in limited acreage within the project area. Leafy
spurge generally grows in clumps, producing stems up to 3 feet tall from caudices,
rhizomes and roots. It has an extensive underground rhizome and root system. Roots
can penetrate into the soil as far as 15 to 30 feet. Leafy spurge can rapidly invade
disturbed sites by establishing from seed and by sprouting from existing roots and root
crowns. Once established, leafy spurge tends to expand and persist (Simonin 2000;
Gucker 2010).
Sulfur cinquefoil (Potentilla recta) has limited mapped acreage. Populations in North
America are commonly associated with roadsides, vegetation disturbance, abandoned
agricultural fields and "waste areas." Sulfur cinquefoil can also invade native plant
NOXIOUS WEEDS - 635

Environmental Impact Statement

communities that are far from any apparent human disturbance and is now common in
natural grasslands and shrubby areas (Zouhar 2003c).
Oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare also known as Chrysanthemum leucanthemum) is
found along numerous roads and trails in the Divide landscape, although its mapped
acreage is limited. Besides reproducing vegetatively along a rhizome, oxeye daisy is a
prolific seed (achene) producer (Olson and Wallander 1999). Oxeye daisy reduces plant
species diversity in infested areas. Grazing by cattle in infested areas intensifies its
spread because they avoid the plant. Consequently, it forms dense populations. Oxeye
daisy has the potential of increasing soil erosion because bare soil is more prominent in
areas where high densities occur. Cultivation destroys oxeye daisy’s shallow root system
without difficulty (Mitich 2000). This plant can become noxious and is capable of taking
over and modifying natural areas, pasture and rangeland and may increase soil erosion
compared to native plant communities (Olson and Wallander 1999).
Dalmation toadflax (Linaria dalmatica) has a limited mapped acreage in the project
area. Toadflax has been shown to readily establish on open and disturbed sites where
competition from other plants is reduced (Zouhar 2003b). Dalmatian toadflax seeds may
be dispersed by cattle, deer and other browsing animals and the seeds can remain
viable after passing through the gastrointestinal tracts of cattle and possibly deer. This
species can also expand vegetatively by the formation of adventitious shoots from both
the tap and lateral roots (Zouhar 2003b). There is serious risk of infestation from
Dalmation toadflax, even though current infestation levels are thought to be very low.
Weeds are expected to increase in level of infestation and acres infested overall in the
project area in spite of the efforts of herbicide application for control. Weed seeds are
stored in the upper soil layers and will germinate over several years. This species is
difficult to control.
Common yellow toadflax, or butter and eggs, (Linaria vulgaris) infestations may be
included in the Dalmation toadflax mapped acreage for this project area. The two
species have similar characteristics. Butter and eggs has been shown to readily establish
on open and disturbed sites where competition from other plants is reduced (Zouhar
2003b). The seeds may be dispersed by water, ants, birds and rodents, but existing
infestations of butter and eggs appear to expand mainly by vegetative reproduction
rather than by seed (Pauchard et al. 2003; Zouhar 2003b). There is serious risk of
infestation from yellow toadflax even though current infestation levels are thought to
be very low.
Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is a serious weed that competes with native vegetation
and fuels wildfires (Young et al 1987). Cheatgrass is listed as a regulated species on the
Montana State Noxious Weed list and has not been mapped on the Helena National
Forest. It is established along numerous roadsides and other areas of disturbance in
Montana. Cheatgrass spread rapidly through sagebrush ranges following World War II
and has been expanding its range ever since. Disturbance by spring grazing or even
rodent activity is sufficient to perpetuate cheatgrass reproduction (Zouhar 2003a).
Cheatgrass is highly adaptable and has increased on lands around the Helena National
Forest over the past 30 years.

Effects Common to All Alternatives

The Forest treats approximately one-third of its mapped weeds on an annual basis
under its normal weed treatment program; therefore, one-third, or 525 of the 1,751
acres of weeds along travel routes, would be treated annually. Herbicide treatment of
these acres would have an average cost of about $51 per acre for easily accessible sites
(≤200 feet of a road and on slopes <40 percent) and $65 per acre for areas with more
difficult terrain (>200 feet from a road and on slopes >40 percent). The cost of biocontrol is included in these prices. An average cost of $58/acre is used to calculate costs.
Appendix A of the noxious weed specialist report outlines the weed control costs by
method of treatment and can be found in the project file.
Table 153 displays treatment type and cost to treat one-third of the acres in the project
area. This table does not include the cost of monitoring. This cost is not included in

Noxious weed infestations adversely affect native fauna and flora and present the
greatest large-scale threat to native ecosystems that exist in the nation’s wild lands
today (DiTomaso 2000; Lodge and Shrader-Frechette 2003; Lonsdale 1999; Mack et al
2001; Pauchard et al 2003). Noxious weeds can create monocultures if they are not
controlled with herbicides or effective biocontrol. At high infestation levels (canopy
cover of ≥25 percent), noxious weeds can cause a loss of native plant diversity,
reduction of wildlife habitat and forage, increase in erosion and depletion of soil
moisture and nutrient levels (DiTomaso 2000). These effects are common to all
alternatives and would vary depending on the level of infestation. The loss of plant
biodiversity, soil productivity and foraging values are great (Pauchard et al., 2003;
Zouhar 2001a, 2001b, 2002a, 2002b, 2003a, 2003b, 2003c; Gucker 2009, 2010; Stone
2010).
Current weed management activities would continue under all alternatives. Chemical
weed treatments would be used in areas accessible to ground spraying equipment.
Roadside infestations would be treated on a scheduled basis. Bio-control would be used
in areas where the biological agents have optimal conditions for survival and expansion.
In riparian areas, biological control would be emphasized where conditions for insect
establishment are met.
Public access for recreation, firewood collection and private property access would
continue along roadsides. Also, forest users would be free to use all existing dispersed
recreation sites and other open areas, except during spring break-up when the road
surfaces are over saturated with moisture. The ground disturbance associated with
these activities would likely increase weed infestations where bare soil is exposed. The
NOXIOUS WEEDS - 637

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

area immediately adjacent to the roads would continue to be the most vulnerable to
weed infestation due to several factors: weed seed from vehicles would be likely to
detach along the roadsides; these areas are disturbed when roadsides are bladed with
heavy machinery; and weed seed can be on the machinery or in the soil that is spread
along the maintained area. The exposure to new weed infestations to road and trail
routes is high due to constant delivery of weed seed from vehicles, humans and animals.
The more vehicles that travel the routes, the higher the exposure to noxious weed seed
spread.
Weeds could be expected to increase by an estimated 8 to 12 percent (USDA 1998). The
most susceptible forest habitat types would be dry habitat types that have existing
infestations of noxious weeds due to the natural openness of such forest types.
Spotted knapweed, cheatgrass and Canada thistle may spread rapidly with ground
disturbance and will spread at a slower rate without disturbance (Young et al 1987;
Zouhar 2001a, 2001b, 2003b). Dalmatian toadflax, leafy spurge and sulfur cinquefoil
spread readily without ground disturbance and spread very rapidly with disturbance
(Simonin 2000; Zouhar 2003b, 2003c; Gucker 2010). Dalmatian toadflax is of primary
concern across the project area due to the amount of infestation and difficulty of
control whether or not additional ground disturbance occurs. Leafy spurge is also a
concern due to difficulty of control (USDA 2006).
New weed infestations would occur under all alternatives, particularly along roadsides
and areas of disturbance (Lonsdale 1999). The Helena National Forest Weed Treatment
Project FEIS (USDA 2006) provides guidance and environmental requirements for weed
control activities that would be applied to this area under any alternative. The forest
currently uses herbicides to treat approximately 30 percent of infestations annually.
There is also a bio-control program on the forest that has been successful in establishing
insectories.
The data on response of weeds and changes in weed ecology due to climate change are
limited. Weeds are genetically diverse and if resources such as light, water, nutrients, or
carbon dioxide change within the environment, it is more likely there may be an
expansion of weeds. However, very little is known regarding the impact of climate
change on the reproductive success of invasive weeds and the potential consequences
for their management (Ziska 2006).
Native plant diversity would be impacted by infestations of non-native plants, especially
noxious weeds. Noxious weeds dominate plant communities and tend to form
monocultures that negatively impact native biological diversity. This weed competition
to individual plants and plant communities can result in loss of species diversity and
sensitive native plants. Native grasses used for domestic livestock and wild ungulates
have been particularly susceptible to impacts from weeds (Beck 2001).
A review of the mechanisms underlying exotic plant invasions by Levine and others
(2003) revealed that although numerous studies have been done examining the effects
of invasives on community structure and diversity, few studies have examined the
underlying processes (e.g. competition, allelopathy, production of flammable biomass,
nutrient cycling) that cause the impact. It is well understood that community
biodiversity decreases with exotic plant invasion, but the results of changes to soil
community diversity, resource allocation and soil water availability, for example, have
not been examined (Levine et al. 2003).
NOXIOUS WEEDS - 638

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Evans et al. (2001) found that cheatgrass invasion can significantly alter nutrient cycling
through differences in litter quality and quantity. However, the consequences of altered
nitrogen availability for community structure are poorly demonstrated and highly
variable (Levine et al. 2003).
Studies of impacts to natural fire processes strongly support the expectation that
invader impacts on disturbance regimes (ecosystem process) can strongly and possibly
irreversibly affect community structure (Levine et al. 2003). Dramatic alterations of fire
frequency in historic shrublands that are now dominated by cheatgrass have been
demonstrated (Ehrenfeld et al. 2001). Other cases of exotic grass and shrub impacts
include increasing fuel resulting in greater flame lengths, higher temperatures and
greater heat release. In most cases, the specific ecophysiological reasons for greater
biomass production have not been identified. The effects of cheatgrass strongly support
the prediction that invaders affecting disturbance processes have the greatest potential
to create large impacts on ecosystems (Vitousek 1990).
Allelopathy is a biological phenomenon by which one organism produces bio-chemicals
that influence the growth, survival and reproduction of other plants. Ridenour and
Calloway (2001) showed that spotted knapweed reduced the root growth of Idaho
fescue by 50 percent, demonstrating an adverse allelopathic effect. Additional studies
on the effect of arbuscular mycorrhizae on interactions of spotted knapweed and Idaho
fescue roots showed an enhancement of the competitive ability of spotted knapweed
but direct effects of mycorrhizae were weak (Marler et al. 1999). Unanswered questions
in the ecosystem impacts literature include the degree to which the documented
impacts result simply from the addition of new functional traits brought in by the
invader, or alternatively, the reduction or elimination of native species (Mack et al.
2001).
The use of herbicides may have positive or negative impacts on native plant diversity.
Rice et al. (1997) found in a detailed comparison of plant community composition over
an eight year period that plots treated with Tordon®, Transline® and Curtail® were more
similar to the potential natural communities than the no-spray controls (Mueggler and
Stewart 1980). On the other hand, Ortega and Pearson (In Review) found that side
effects of weed management can vary as a function of local site conditions (Shea et al
2005). Side effects of management actions include: reducing vigor or abundance of
native or desirable species, inhibiting overall productivity or diversity, shifting
community structure and function and altering physical conditions (D’Antonio et al
2004; Hulme 2006; Louda et al 1997). Therefore, effective weed management requires
weighing the success of control measures (e.g., impacts on target weeds and recovery of
native species) against the side effects of management actions. This necessitates a
thorough understanding of how management tools interact with non-target system
components as well as the target weed (Ortega and Pearson, In Review).
The Helena National Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS (USDA 2006) provides
guidance and environmental requirements for weed control and treatment activities,
which would be applied to the project area in any alternative. All personnel using
herbicides are appropriately certified by the State of Montana and knowledgeable as to
the environmental guidelines and requirements of the Helena National Forest Weed
Treatment Project FEIS (USDA 2006).

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives

While the spread of noxious weeds would continue under all alternatives, the rate of
spread could potentially be faster in areas proposed to change from non-motorized use
to open for motorized use. Weed management would continue as in the past with the
addition of management in areas that have ground disturbance associated with this
project. Areas of ground disturbance would be monitored for weed infestations and
treated as appropriate, in accordance with the Helena National Forest Weed Treatment
Project FEIS (USDA 2006) and best management practices designed to minimize the
spread of existing invasive plants and prevent the colonization of new invasive plants
within the project area and the Helena National Forest. Chemical weed treatments
would be the primary treatment method along roadside areas as those areas are
accessible to ground spraying equipment. Bio-control would be used in areas where the
biological agents had optimal conditions for survival and expansion. In riparian areas,
biological control would be emphasized where conditions for insect establishment are
met. The effect of all treatment methods would be to control and contain existing and
new infestations related to open roads and trails.
Noxious weed infestations are introduced and spread through most ground disturbing
activities (Young et al. 1987; Lonsdale 1999; Zouhar 2001a, 2002b, 2003b; King County
2007). Vehicles that travel the National Forest road and trail system provide a source of
weed seed as well as a chronic disturbance along those corridors. Some weeds, such as
Dalmation toadflax, leafy spurge, houndstongue and sulfur cinquefoil spread readily
without ground disturbance and spread very rapidly with disturbance (Zouhar 2002b;
Zouhar 2003b; Zouhar 2003c). Weed control efforts in the form of herbicide treatment
and biological control provide beneficial effects undertaken over time to control existing
and new infestations.
For the purpose of calculating potential risk of weed infestation in the treatment areas,
moderate risk is equated to approximately 10 percent soil surface disturbance of the
potential acres affected and high risk is equated to 100 percent soil surface disturbance
of the acres affected.

The Helena National Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS (USDA 2006) identified several
6th code HUCs in which herbicide application would be limited based on the amount of
herbicide applied, the location of the application, the streamflow and HUC area. The
estimates of the amount to be applied if all acres were treated are shown by HUC in
appendix B of the noxious weed specialist report (see project file). The rationale for that
determination is from the coarse filter calculation to estimate possible concentrations of
herbicide in stream waters, shown in appendix C of the noxious weed specialist report
(see project file). No HUCs would exceed the limit identified through modeling. Please
refer to the fisheries specialist report for the effects and limits to herbicide application.

Cumulative Effects
The cumulative effects area for noxious weeds is the Divide Travel Plan project area
(155,000 acres). Cumulative effects are addressed under each of the alternatives. The
cumulative effects that are described include ongoing actions that are assumed to have
effects beginning shortly after implementation of the action. These impacts are
anticipated to continue into the reasonably foreseeable future. Effects associated with
various actions are based on literature, known weed infestations and professional
experience.

Past activities have contributed to the previously described affected environment and
would be accounted for in the most recent weed inventory data.
Ongoing activities include, but are not limited to: roadside hazard tree reduction
implementation (491 miles); fuels reduction project (Chessman Reservoir); timber
harvest on private lands and other private land activities; noxious weed treatment on
National Forest System lands; livestock grazing allotments; and small mining operations.
For a full list of past, present and reasonably foreseeable activities refer to appendix B.

Alternative 1, No Action
Direct and Indirect Effects
No additional ground disturbance beyond that described in “Effects Common to All
Alternatives” would occur under this alternative. Weeds would continue to spread at a
rate of approximately 8 to 12 percent per year. Treatment of the currently mapped
noxious weeds within roadside areas would average about $58.00 per acre; excluding
monitoring costs.
Under this alternative, there are approximately 1,155 acres of noxious weed associated
with motorized routes, 495 acres of noxious weeds associated with non-motorized
routes and 101 acres of weeds associated with the Continental Divide National Scenic

be found in the project file.
Generally, any given roadside is treated with Tordon every two to three years rather
than annually. Using the average annual treatment cost of $58 per acre and assuming
one-third of the infestations would likely be treated, the existing condition 525 acres
would be treated at a total cost of $30,450 for alternative 1.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
The effects of noxious weed infestations are adverse to native fauna and flora and
present the greatest large-scale threat to native ecosystems that exist in the Nation’s
wildlands today (Lonsdale 1999; DiTomaso 2000; Mack et al. 2001; Lodge and ShraderFrechette 2003; Pauchard et al. 2003). At high infestation levels, these effects are
adverse due to the loss of native plant diversity, reduction of wildlife habitat and forage,
increase in erosion and depletion of soil moisture and nutrient levels (DiTomaso 2000).
These effects are common to all alternatives due to the effects of noxious weeds
whether ground disturbance occurs or not. If noxious weed populations are not
controlled, these effects could be irreversible.
This alternative has the highest potential for adverse effects, due to the number of acres
of current infestation along a 100-foot of routes (1,155) and the percentage of
motorized routes (57).

Cumulative Effects
The existing condition reflects the effect of past disturbances as well as the effect of
noxious weed control efforts. Please refer to the cumulative effects table in appendix B
for a specific descriptions of the past, present and foreseeable activities.
Ongoing activities: Weed expansion would continue to occur under the alternative 1 in
association with ongoing activities at a rate of approximately 8 to 12 percent per year
(USDA 1998). Ground disturbance associated with the following projects would likely
cause noxious weed expansion in the cumulative effects area:
•

•

Grazing Allotments – in areas where cattle congregate such as salt grounds.
Disturbed soil in these areas would be susceptible to weed infestation. Grazing
allotments are monitored annually and noxious weed infestations are treated as
part of the forestwide noxious weed treatment program.
Roadside Hazard Tree Removal – this project includes approximately 491 miles
of harvest along existing roads in the project area in the short-term. Noxious
weed treatment (herbicide) is required on all harvest units before and after
harvest.

Divide Travel Plan

Fuels Reduction Project (Chessman Reservoir) – this project includes harvest
around the Chessman Reservoir.
Private Land Tree Activities – Tree removal would be expected to continue as
trees continue to die due to the mountain pine beetle. Ground disturbance
associated with road construction and logging operations would likely cause
noxious weed population expansion in the cumulative effects area. Private land
operations are governed by Montana state law to control noxious weed
populations.
Mining operations – there are numerous small mining operations ongoing. All
plans of operations require weed treatment of all ground disturbances.
Forest Noxious Weed Treatment Program – the herbicide treatment is primarily
along roads and in patches that are accessible to mechanized equipment (ATVs,
UTVs) and/or by hand, biological (insects), goats/sheep and aerial spraying.
Areas for treatment are as identified in the EIS/ROD and continually being
updated and treated as new infestations are located. The program would
continue to treat approximately 30 percent of the weeds within the project
area.

There are no other foreseeable actions that would have cumulative effects with this
alternative.

Alternative 2
Direct and Indirect Effects
No additional ground disturbance beyond that described in “Effects Common to All
Alternatives” would occur under this alternative. Weeds would continue to spread at a
rate of approximately 8 to 12 percent per year. Treatment of the currently mapped
noxious weeds within roadside areas would average about $58.00 per acre; this does
not include costs for any monitoring activities.
Under this alternative there are approximately 833 acres of noxious weed associated
with motorized routes, 817 acres of noxious weeds associated with non-motorized
routes and 101 acres of weeds associated with the Continental Divide Scenic Trail. A
spreadsheet showing the weeds on a given route as well as a map can be found in the
project file.
Generally, a given roadside is treated with Tordon every two to three years rather than
annually. Using the average annual treatment cost of $58 per acre and assuming onethird of the infestations would likely be treated, for the existing condition 525 acres
would be treated at a total cost of $30,450.
The following table shows the estimated costs within the project area (100-foot road

The cost of treatment for this alternative would be essentially the same as the existing
condition also known as the alternative 1. The overall weed acreage within the project
area would not be affected in the short-term. With fewer miles of motorized routes in
particular, the acres of weeds inside the buffer would be reduced. Over time, this would
mean less exposure to weed seed and disturbance. This alternative would have similar
but lower impacts in terms of noxious weeds as compared to the alternative 1.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
Please refer to alternative 1 for Irreversible/Irretrievable commitments. This alternative
has the second least potential for adverse effects, due to the number of acres of
infestation along a 100-foot buffer of motorized routes (833) and the percentage
motorized routes (56).

Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects under alternative 2 would be similar to those identified under
alternative 1. There would be fewer infested acres along motorized routes and fewer
motorized routes associated with alternative 2. As a result some effects would be
expected to be less with this alternative as compared to alternative 1.
There are no additional ongoing or foreseeable actions that would have cumulative
effects with this alternative beyond those described under alternative 1.

Under this alternative, there are approximately 853 acres of noxious weed associated
with motorized routes, 797 acres of noxious weeds associated with non-motorized
routes and 101 acres of weeds associated with the Continental Divide Scenic trail. A

Alternative 3 has the lowest number of miles of motorized routes as compared to the
existing condition and the other three action alternatives. As a result, it would have the
lowest number of noxious weeds associated with motorized routes. This alternative
would have the lowest impacts of the four alternatives in terms of noxious weed
infestations and potential for future noxious weed spread. This is due to the fact that
fewer roads would remain open to motorized use. At local scales, non-native invasive
species richness and abundance are generally highest in and around disturbed patches,
corridors and edges such as riparian corridors and transportation corridors (BenningerTruax et al. 1992; Gelbard and Belnap 2003; Larson 2003). Buckley et al. (2003) found
that main forest routes (among others) serve as primary conduits for entry of
introduced species into the interior of managed stands. Fewer roads open to motorized
use would avoid a perpetuation in disturbance associated with motorized use as well as
reduce the potential for the introduction of noxious weed seeds.

Irreversible/Irretrievable Commitments
Please refer to alternative 1 for irreversible/irretrievable commitments. This alternative
has the least potential for adverse effects, due to the number of acres of infestation
along a 100-foot of motorized routes (853) and the percentage motorized routes (31).

Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects under alternative 3 would be similar to those identified under
alternative 1. There would be fewer infested acres along motorized routes and fewer
motorized routes associated with alternative 3, so some effects would be expected to
be less with this alternative as compared to alternative 1.
There are no other additional ongoing or foreseeable actions that would have
cumulative effects with this alternative beyond those described under alternative 1.

Alternative 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
No additional ground disturbance beyond that described in “Effects Common to All

noxious weeds within roadside areas would average about $58.00 per acre; this does
not include monitoring costs.
Under this alternative there are approximately 1,070 acres of noxious weed associated
with motorized routes, 580 acres of noxious weeds associated with non-motorized
routes and 101 acres of weeds associated with the Continental Divide Scenic Trail. A

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Alternative 5 has the third lowest amount of noxious weed infested acres within a 100foot route buffer of motorized routes and the highest management cost for noxious
weed control when comparing all alternatives. The increased cost of noxious weed
management is due to the greater cost per acre for treatment along non-motorized
routes ($51 vs. $65). Though alternative 5 has the greatest cost, it is the least likely of
developing new weed infestations due to motorized vehicles spreading weed seeds and
the possibility of ground disturbance which increases the vulnerablity of an area to
weed invasion. Reducing the likelihood of new infestations reduces long-term impacts
to native flora.

Forest Plan Consistency

The Helena National Forest Plan includes forestwide management direction that is
applicable to noxious weeds as follows:
Noxious Weeds:
•

•

•

Implement an integrated weed control program in cooperation with the state of
Montana and county weed boards to confine present infestations and prevent
establishing new areas of noxious weeds. Noxious weeds are listed in the
Montana Weed Law and designated by county weed boards.
Integrated Pest Management, which uses chemical, biological and mechanical
methods, will be the principal control method(s). Spot herbicide treatment of
identified weeds will be emphasized. Biological control methods will be
considered as they become available.
Funding for weed control on disturbance sites will be provided by the resource
which causes the disturbance.

The alternatives and weed management strategies provided in this FEIS are consistent
with the aforementioned forestwide management direction. There are no specific
management area standards for noxious weed management in the Forest Plan due to
the fact that the management direction for noxious weeds provided above apply to all
areas within the Helena National Forest. This document tiers to the Helena National
Forest Weed Treatment Project FEIS and subsequent Record of Decision which
prescribes specific guidance for noxious weed management on the Helena National
Forest.

ECONOMICS
Regulatory Framework
The preparation of NEPA documents is guided by CEQ regulations for implementing
NEPA (40 CFR 1500-1508). NEPA requires that consequences to the human
environment be analyzed and disclosed. The extent to which these environmental
factors are analyzed and discussed is related to the nature of public comments received
during scoping. NEPA does not require a monetary benefit-cost analysis (40 CFR
1502.23).

Assumptions
In general, economic effects associated with any change in management vary mainly by
the total amount of spending and by the type of activity, but it cannot be generalized
that motorized or non-motorized activities contribute more or less to the local economy

Information Used
Economic information used to describe the affected environment is compiled from
various primary government sources. There is no new data collected specifically for this
analysis. Existing county-level and national forest-level data is used to describe trends in
the regional economy. County economic profiles are available from the Economic Profile
System (EPS), which compiles and digests primary population and economic data from a
variety of government sources into a report. Recent EPS reports, which include data up
to 2010, provide a recent description of the population, employment and income
composition of the counties comprising the economic impact area for the Divide Travel
Plan area. The recent economic conditions vary for the five counties that have land in
the project area. Highlights of the EPS reports are presented below to describe the
economies that may be impacted by the Divide Travel Plan decision. As a result of the
small number of firms in area counties, employment and income figures were not
available for some sectors of the economy due to disclosure restrictions.
Wildland dependency data, based on the percent of total labor income (employee
compensation and proprietor income) earned in five resource areas, is obtained from

Gebert and Odell (2006). In these calculations the portion of labor income earned in
economic sectors associated with each of five resource areas have been calculated for
1993 and 2003. Although these numbers cannot support thorough trend analysis, as
they are only two snapshots in time, they do provide some important information.

Methodology and Scientific Accuracy
National Travel Management Rule Benefit Cost Analysis
When the travel management rule was developed, the Forest Service considered the
consequences in a qualitative cost benefit analysis. The following text and Table 167 are
extracted from that analysis.
“The benefits and costs of the final rule are described qualitatively because the rule is
procedural. Actual transportation decisions will be made at the local level with public
input and appropriate environmental analysis and documentation. Neither the costs
nor benefits are readily quantifiable and thus this analysis discusses the costs and
benefits to the extent information is available (see Table 167). The benefits of the final
rule include gains to users, the agency and the environment. Sustainable, reliable, highquality public access to National Forest System lands will lead to enhanced recreation
opportunities for visitors. In addition, both users and the agency will benefit from
improved public communication, more effective law enforcement and improved travel
management planning. Other benefits include reduced environmental damage and a
more consistent and defensible travel planning framework. The costs of the final rule
include reductions in unconstrained cross-country motor vehicle use for those that
value this activity and short-term agency planning costs as many national forests launch
travel planning efforts following adoption of the rule.”

Analysis Area
The analysis area for the environmental impact statement includes Deerlodge, Silver
Bow, Jefferson, Lewis and Clark and Powell counties in Montana. Access management
activities within the project area have the potential to mainly impact the economic
conditions of the communities in these counties.
Modeling of economic impacts using input/output analysis is often conducted to
estimate the expected changes in the contribution of jobs and labor income to local
economies following management decisions. In order to model changes to jobs and
income, expectations for changes in forest visitation are needed. Due to a dearth of
recreation impact monitoring data from similar travel planning decisions, no recreation
visitation impacts are provided for the Divide area. In lieu of this information, response

coefficients are sometimes derived. Response coefficients, which are reported here
based on changes in the final demand for certain activities, indicate the number of full
and part-time jobs and dollars of labor income per thousand national forest party trips
per activity type. However, due to the fact that national visitor use monitoring, NVUM,
data represents all activity on each national forest and is not broken down to describe
just the Divide Travel Plan area and the uncertainty regarding recreational visitation
changes/displacement that may occur following travel management decisions and an
economic impact analysis was not conducted for this assessment. Instead the analysis
focuses on recent economic dependency data, provides response coefficients and
professional judgment regarding the likely change in the contribution of the National
Forest System lands in the project area to the five-county economic impact area.
The combination of small towns and rural settings, along with people from a wide
variety of backgrounds, provide a diverse social environment for the geographical region
around the Helena Ranger District of the Helena National Forest. Local residents pursue
a wide variety of life-styles, but many share a common theme, an orientation to the
outdoors and natural resources. This is reflected in both vocational and recreational
pursuits including employment in agricultural, logging and milling and mining
operations, outfitter and guide businesses, hiking, hunting, fishing, camping and many
other recreational activities.
Timber harvest and processing, mining, tourism and agricultural industries are
important to the economy of local areas. Despite the common concern for and some
dependence on natural resources within the local communities, social attitudes vary
widely with respect to public land management. Local residents hold a broad spectrum
of perspectives and preferences ranging from complete preservation to maximum
development and recreational utilization of natural resources.
The key economic factors evaluated in this analysis include population, employment,
income, economic diversity and natural resources dependency.

Population
Perhaps the most important attribute of any economy is the community of people who
contribute to production, services, trade and consumption. The five counties in the
economic impact area have had different population experiences since the 1970s,
where only three of the counties saw overall positive population growth during this 35year period. All impact area counties did experience median age increases during the
last decade.

Deerlodge
From 1970 to 2010, the population of Deerlodge County decreased by 6,380 people, a
41 percent decrease, with roughly a decade of sharp decline, followed by two decades
of slow decline. As an average annual rate, this represents a decrease of 1.6 percent.
Total population in 2010 was 9,270 people, down 2 percent from 9,409 in 2000. The
population has also gotten older since 2000. The 2010 median age was 46.2 years, up
from 42.3 years in 2000, a 9 percent increase. In 2010, the largest age category was 15
to 19 years olds (1,025 people or 11 percent of the total). The 2009 population density
in Deerlodge County was 12 people/square mile (US Census Bureau, Population Division,
Table 1, 2000 to 2009). Population centers in this county include Anaconda (county
seat), Galen, the eastern portion of Georgetown Lake, Opportunity and Warm Springs.

Silver Bow
From 1970 to 2010, the population of Silver Bow County decreased by 7,919 people, a
19 percent decrease, with a long decline from the mid-1970s through 1990 and another
shorter period of decline since year 2000. As an average annual rate, this represents a
decrease of 0.5 percent. At 34,233, this county had the second highest year 2010
population in the Divide Travel Plan economic impact area. The population has also
gotten older since 2000. The median age was up 2.9 years, from 38.9 years in 2000 to
41.8 in 2010. The largest age category was 50 to 54 year olds (2,730 people or 8 percent
of the total). The 2009 population density in Silver Bow County was high compared to
neighbors at 46 people/square mile (US Census Bureau, Population Division, Table 1,
2000 to 2009). Population centers in this county include Butte (county seat), Ramsay,
Rocker and Walkerville.

Jefferson
From 1970 to 2010, the population of Jefferson County increased by 6,131 people, a 116
percent increase, with undulating growth from the early 1970s through the mid-1980s
and more consistent growth afterwards. As an average annual rate, this represented an
increase of 3 percent. This lead to a, year 2010, population of 11,419 for this county.
This was 1,367 more people or roughly 14 percent growth since 2000. The population
has also gotten older since 2000. The median age was up 5.4 years, from 40.2 years in
2000 to 45.6 in 2010. The largest age category was 50 to 59 year olds (1,271 people or
12 percent of the total). Even after rapid population growth during the previous 30
years, the 2009 population density in Jefferson County was only 7 people/square mile.
(US Census Bureau, Population Division, Table 1, 2000 to 2009). Population centers in
this county include Basin, Boulder (county seat), Cardwell, Clancy, Jefferson City,
Montana City and Whitehall.

Lewis and Clark
From 1970 to 2010, the population of Lewis and Clark County increased by 30,149
people, which was a 90 percent increase. This also represented the largest absolute
increase in population for any Divide Travel Plan economic impact area county. With
consistent growth from the early 1970s through the 2010, the average annual increase
was 2.2 percent. At 63,604 people, this county had the highest year 2010 population in
the Divide Travel Plan economic impact area. This included 7,718 additional residents or
roughly 14 percent growth since 2000. The population in Lewis and Clark County also
got older since 2000. The median age was up 2.7 years, from 38 years in 2000 to 40.7
years in 2010. The largest age category that year was 50 to 54 year olds (55,261 people
or 8.6 percent of the total). The 2009 population density in Lewis and Clark County was
18 people/square mile ( US Census Bureau, Population Division, Table 1, 2000 to 2009).
Population centers in this county include Augusta, Austin, Canyon Creek, Canyon Ferry,
Craig, East Helena, Fort Harrison, Helena (county seat), Lincoln, Marysville, Unionville
and Wolf Creek.

Powell
From 1970 to 2010, the population of Powell County increased by 365 people, the
average annual 5 percent increase obscures a sporadic population experience. Rapid
population growth during the early 1970s was nearly mirrored by population loss of the
same magnitude starting in the early 1980s. The 35-year low occurred around 1990
before climbing through the 1990s. There were 172 fewer residents or roughly 2

percent loss since 2000; this lead to a year 2010 population of 7,031 for this county.
Around the turn of the century, the county population fell for several years before again
starting to climb in recent years. The population in Powell County has also gotten older
since 2000, where the median age was up 4.8 years, from 39.7 years in 2000 to 44.5
years in 2010. The largest age category was 45 to 49 year olds (710 people or 10 percent
of the total). The 2009 population density in Powell County was 3 people/square mile
(US Census Bureau, Population Division, Table 1, 2000 to 2009), the lowest in the five
county area. Population centers in this county include Avon, Deer Lodge (county seat),
Dempsey, Elliston, Garrison, Helmville and Ovando.

Economic Impact Area
In aggregate, from 1970 to 2010, the population of these five counties increased by
22,346 people, however this figure obscures the dynamic population experience. The
period started with positive growth from the early 1970s through 1976, before starting
a 15 year slide until 1990. Afterwards population growth remained positive in all years
except 2001 and 2002, translating to an overall average annual increase of 0.5 percent.
In sum, these counties have a year 2010 population of 125,584. There were 8,463
additional residents or roughly 7 percent growth since 2000. The population in all five
counties has also gotten older since 2000, where median ages increased across the
board. As a percentage, Jefferson County increased the most, at 13.4 percent from 40.2
to 45.6. Deerlodge County had the highest median age of 46.2 years old, while Lewis
and Clark County had the lowest at 40.7. The 2000 population density in the five-county
area was 13 people/square mile (BEA REIS 2005, Table CA30 and US Census 1990 and
2000).

Employment
Changes to access through travel management have the potential to slightly impact the
existing configuration of employment across numerous economic sectors that support
tourism and recreation in the five counties which is why it is described here. Information
available in EPS helps portray the recent employment situation in these counties, which
serves as part of the backdrop for travel planning. Providing services employs the
greatest portion (6 percent) of people across the five-county area and the service sector
grew rapidly in recent decades in most counties. Government employment was also
high (21 percent) across the economic impact area, whereas goods producing jobs
employed only 11 percent of workers.

Deerlodge
Over the period 1970 to 2005, roughly 1,875 jobs were lost in Deerlodge County. Not
surprisingly, indexed job growth in Montana (204 percent) and the nation (191 percent)
outpaced job growth of this county (70 percent) for the period. The majority of job
growth between 1970 and 2005, 84 percent of all new jobs, was in proprietor
employment (people who work for themselves). In 1970, proprietors represented 8.4
percent of total employment; this had changed significantly by 2010 when they
represented 25.4 percent. For wage and salary jobs, the employment category whose
share of the total gained the most was services and professional, which went from 35.2
percent in 1970 to 63.4 percent in 2000. The employment sector that decreased the
most was manufacturing (including forest products) which fell from 26.7 percent during
1977 to only 3.2 percent during 1997. Farm employment actually increased from 1.7
percent in 1970 to 4.2 percent in 2005 (BEA REIS 2005).

Firms of various sizes operate in Deerlodge County. As a share of the total, the size
category that with the most firms between 1977 and 2005 was 1 to 4 employees. The
category that grew the fastest was 10 to 19 employees. In 2005, 93 percent of firms had
fewer than 20 employees, although at least one firm had between 250 and 499
employees (Census County Business Patterns).
In 2010, the unemployment rate was 8.0 percent, compared to 6.8 percent in the state.
In 2011, the monthly unemployment rate varied from a low of 7.2 percent in October to
a high of 9.1 percent in February (Local Area Unemployment Statistics, Bureau of Labor
Statistics), indicating approximately a 2 percent increase of the seasonal unemployment
rate between fall and winter months.

Silver Bow
Over the period 1970 to 2005, despite overall population losses, roughly 3,691 jobs
were added in Silver Bow County. Although this represented 122 percent of indexed
growth for the county, it was outpaced by Montana (204 percent) and the nation (191
percent) for the period. The majority of job growth between 1970 and 2005, 53 percent
of all new jobs, was in wage and salary employment (people who work for someone
else). For wage and salary jobs, the employment category whose share of the number of
establishments gained the most was services, which went from 35.1 percent in 1970 to
40.0 percent in 2000. The employment sector that decreased the number of
establishments most was mining, which fell from 20.5 percent during 1977 to 2.0
percent during 2000. Farm employment increased slightly from 1.1 percent in 1970 to
1.7 percent in 2005 (BEA REIS 2005).
In 1970, proprietors represented 12.4 percent of total employment; this had changed
significantly by 2010 when they represented 19.5 percent. However, employment of
wage and salary earners contributed 63 percent of new employment between 1995 and
2005.
Firms of various sizes operate in Silver Bow County. As a share of the total, the size
category that had the largest number of firms and the one that grew the most between
1977 and 2005 had 5 to 9 employees. In 2005, 88 percent of firms had fewer than 20
employees, although at least one firm had between 500 to 999 employees (Census
County Business Patterns).
In 2011, the unemployment rate was 6.3 percent, compared to 6.8 percent in the state.
In 2011, the monthly unemployment rate varied from a low of 5.7 percent in October to

Economic Impact Area
In aggregate, over the period 1970 to 2005, growth of 30,594 jobs in the five county
area, representing an indexed increase of 169 percent from 1970 to 2005, was slightly
slower than the state (204 percent) and the nation (191 percent). This is likely partially
a function of the large loss of population during the 1980s. During this 35-year period,
the majority of job growth, 63 percent of new jobs, was in wage and salary positions.
For wage and salary jobs, the employment category whose share of the total
employment that gained the most was services and professional, which went from 55.8
percent in 1977 to 64.8 percent in 2000. In 1970, proprietors represented 13.5 percent
of total employment; by 2005, they represented 23.2 percent of all jobs (BEA REIS
2005). Farm employment increased slightly between 1977 and 2000, up from 2.9
percent to 3.3 percent.
Wage and salary employment (people who work for someone else) contributed 58
percent of new employment between 1995 and 2005. The growth in the number of
operating firms and the available data on jobs by sector for the economic impact area
suggest that for wage earners in the services, construction and retail sectors appear to
explain much of the remaining job growth in the five county area. In all, during 2005,
roughly 5,200 jobs were goods producing jobs, 33,800 were service providing and
13,300 jobs were government jobs. However, in 2005 it was government and
government enterprises, which accounted for 20 percent of total employment. This was
down from 25 percent during 1970 (BEA REIS 2005).
Most firms operating in the five-county area are small in size. During 2000, the size
category that had the greatest number of firms was 1 to 4 employees, the category that
grew the most was between 1990 and 2000, had 10 to 19 employees. In 2005, 89
percent of firms had fewer than 20 employees. The largest size firms in the five-county
area had 500 to 999 employees (Census County Business Patterns).

In 2011, the unemployment rate was 5.9 percent, compared to 6.8 percent in the state.
The monthly unemployment varied from a low of 5.3 percent in October to a high of 6.6
percent in January (Local Area Unemployment Statistics, Bureau of Labor Statistics). This
information for 2011 shows a clear trend of a 1 to 4 percent increase in the seasonal
unemployment rate between fall and winter months, in every county.

Income
Personal income and per capita income are often used to proxy standard of living. Not
surprisingly, Silver Bow and Lewis and Clark Counties, with large populations outpaced
more sparsely populated rural counties in total personal income growth during the last
40 years. Jefferson County’s rapid increase in population and employment also pushed
up total personal income. All counties saw an increase in the portion of income from
non-labor sources, which have increased by roughly 10 to 20 percent in all five counties,
since 1970. Per capita personal income rates have climbed for all counties, with
increases ranging from 55 to 122 percent for the five individual counties and averaging
80 percent across the economic impact area. Although per capita personal income for
all of the counties was below the national average, this can be explained by the fact that
non-metro per capita personal income is almost always lower than metro per capita
personal income and this higher income reflects the lower costs associated with living in
rural areas versus metro areas which represent a large portion of the national average.
Although average real earnings per job for the five-county area were slightly higher
during 2010 than during 1970, they fell through the 1980s and early 1990s before
recovering slowly during the late 1990s and early 2000s. At $32,345, average annual
wages providing services were lower across the five-county area than average goods
producing wages ($48,306) and government wages ($48,055).

Deerlodge
From 1970 to 2010, annual total personal income in Deerlodge County increased $11
million in real ($2010) terms. The average annual real growth rate was 0.1 percent. The
income category whose share of the total gained the most was non-labor income, which
went from 24 percent in 1970 to 48 percent in 2010. Between 1970 and 2010, non-labor
sources grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent, outpacing labor sources which fell at a 0.7
percent rate. Of the new income, 48 percent was from non-labor sources. The labor
income category whose share of the total shrank the most was manufacturing, which
went from 33.7 percent in 1970 to 3.8 percent in 2010. In 2005, welfare represented 7.0
percent of transfer payments and 2.0 percent of total personal income. This was up
slightly from 1970 and up slightly from 1980 (BEA REIS 2005 Table CA35).
Even though total personal income fell, since population decreased rapidly during the
last few decades, per capita personal income (PCPI), adjusted for inflation, rose from
$17,485 in 1970 to $30,638 in 2010. After this 75 percent growth during the 40-year
period, the 2010 per capita personal income in Deerlodge County ($30,638), was lower
than the state ($36,160).
Average earnings per job, adjusted for inflation, fell from $37,361 in 1970 to $32,783 in
2010. In 2010, average earnings per job in Deerlodge County at $32,783, were less than
the state ($38,690). In 2011, government jobs paid the highest wages at $51,140 and
services related jobs paid the lowest at $26,088. Conversely the highest numbers of
jobs were services related with 1,956 and government jobs had the fewest at 87 jobs.

Silver Bow
From 1970 to 2010, annual total personal income in Silver Bow County increased $447
million in real ($2010) terms. The average annual real growth rate was 1.3 percent. The
income category, whose share of the total gained the most, was non-labor income,
which went from 28.2 percent in 1970 to 41.0 percent in 2010, with even higher
percentages than this reported between the early 1980s and 2010. In those 40 years,
non-labor sources grew at an average annual rate of 1.0 percent, outpacing labor
sources which grew at a 0.6 percent average annual rate. The labor income category
whose share of the total shrank the most was mining, which went from 31.3 percent in
1970 to 5.2 percent in 2010. Of the new income in that period, 55.5 percent was from
non-labor sources. In 2005, 61 percent of transfer payments were from age-related
sources (retirement, disability, insurance payments and Medicare). That year, welfare
represented 8.5 percent of transfer payments and 1.6 percent of total personal income.
This was up slightly from 1970 and up slightly from 1980 (BEA REIS 2005 Table CA35).
Per capita personal income (PCPI), adjusted for inflation, rose from $20,146 in 1970 to
$37,866 in 2010. After this 88 percent growth during the 40-year period, the 2010 per
capita personal income in Silver Bow County ($37,866) was higher than the state
($36,160).
Average earnings per job, adjusted for inflation, increased from $40,866 in 1970 to
$44,386 in 2010. In 2010, average earnings per job in Silver Bow County at $40,386
were higher than the state ($38,690). In 2010, mining jobs paid the highest wages at
$99,971 and leisure and hospitality jobs paid the lowest at $13,049. The highest
numbers of jobs were trade, transportation and utilities with 3,460 and agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting jobs had the fewest at 19 jobs. The second highest paying

between the mid-1980’s and 2008. In those 40 years, non-labor sources grew at an
average annual rate of 15 percent, outpacing labor sources which grew at a 7.7 percent
rate. The labor income category whose share of the total shrank the most was
government, which went from 48.6 percent in 1970 to 19.5 percent in 2000. Of the new
income in that period, 30.5 percent was from non-labor sources. In 2005, 58 percent of
transfer payments were from age-related sources (retirement, disability, insurance
payments and Medicare). That year, welfare represented 6.4 percent of transfer
payments and less than 1 percent of total personal income. This was up from 1970 and
down from 1980 (BEA REIS 2005 Table CA35).
Per capita personal income (PCPI), adjusted for inflation, rose from $17,072 in 1970 to
$37,891 in 2010. After this 122 percent growth during the 40-year period, the 2010 per

capita personal income in Jefferson County ($37,894) was slightly higher than the state
($36,160).
Average earnings per job, adjusted for inflation, fell from $31,627 in 1970 to $29,879 in
2010. In 2010, average earnings per job in Jefferson at $29,879 were less than the state
($38,690). During the 35-year period, average wage and salary disbursements grew at
an average annual rate of 0.6 percent (adjusted for inflation), whereas average nonfarm proprietors' income fell annually by 2.1 percent. In 2011, natural resources and
mining jobs paid the highest wages at $65,734 and leisure and hospitality jobs paid the
lowest at $10,018. The highest numbers of jobs were in trade, transportation and
utilities with 290 and information jobs had the fewest at 9 jobs. The second highest
paying jobs were in federal government at $41,928. The second highest numbers of
jobs were in education and health services at 290.

Lewis and Clark
From 1970 to 2010, annual total personal income in Lewis and Clark County increased
$826 million in real ($2010) terms. The average annual real growth rate was 5.1 percent,
faster than the state and national rates. The income category whose share of the total
gained the most was non-labor income, which went from 23 percent in 1970 to 36
percent in 2010, with even higher percentages than this between the early 1980s and
2010. In those 40 years, non-labor sources grew at an average annual rate of 9.2
percent, outpacing labor sources which grew at a 3.9 percent rate. The labor income
category whose share of the total shrank the most was transportation and public
utilities, which went from 9.6 percent in 1970 to 5.4 percent in 2010. Of the new income
in that period, 44 percent was from non-labor sources. In 2005, 60 percent of transfer
payments were from age-related sources (retirement, disability, insurance payments
and Medicare). That year, welfare represented 7.6 percent of transfer payments and 1.1
percent of total personal income. This was up slightly from 1970 and down slightly from
1980 (BEA REIS 2005 Table CA35).
Per capita personal income (PCPI), adjusted for inflation, rose from $24,695 in 1970 to
$39,445 in 2010. After this 60 percent growth during the 40-year period, the 2010 per
capita personal income in Lewis and Clark County ($39,445) was higher than the state
($36,160).
Average earnings per job, adjusted for inflation, increased from $40,049 in 1970 to
$44,198 in 2010. In 2010, average earnings per job in Lewis and Clark County at $44,198
were greater than the state ($38,690). During the 40-year period, average wage and
salary disbursements fell at an average annual rate of 2.0 percent (adjusted for
inflation), whereas average non-farm proprietors' income grew annually by 2.0 percent.
In 2011, federal government jobs paid the highest wages at $64,977 and leisure and
hospitality jobs paid the lowest at $13,462. The highest numbers of jobs were in state
government with 6,537 and agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting jobs had the
fewest at 160 jobs. The second highest paying jobs were in mining at $62,992. The
second highest numbers of jobs were in education and health services at $4,735.

Powell
From 1970 to 2010, annual total personal income in Powell County increased $73.5
million in real ($2010) terms. The average annual real growth rate of 1.6 percent was
slower than the state and national rates. The income category whose share of the total
gained the most was non-labor income, which went from 30 percent in 1970 to 46

percent in 2010, with even higher percentages than this between the late 1970s and
2005. In those 40 years, non-labor sources grew at an average annual rate of 3.9
percent, outpacing labor sources which grew at a 0.6 percent rate. The labor income
category whose share of the total shrank the most was mining, which went from 17.9
percent in 1990 to 5.3 percent in 2000. Of the new income in the 1970 to 2005 period,
62 percent was from non-labor sources. In 2005, 57 percent of transfer payments were
from age-related sources (retirement, disability, insurance payments and Medicare).
That year, welfare represented 7.2 percent of transfer payments and 1.6 percent of
total personal income. This was up slightly from 1970 and up slightly from 1980 (BEA
REIS 2005 Table CA35).
Per capita personal income (PCPI), adjusted for inflation, rose from $17,277 in 1970 to
$26,835 in 2010. After this 55 percent growth during the 40-year period, the 2010 per
capita personal income in Powell County ($26,835 was substantially lower than the state
($36,160).
Average earnings per job, adjusted for inflation, increased slightly from $32,496 in 1970
to $32,923 in 2010. In 2010, average earnings per job in Powell County at $32,923 were
less than the state ($38,690). In 2011, federal government jobs paid the highest wages
at $57,269 and leisure and hospitality jobs paid the lowest at $16,302. The highest
numbers of jobs were in trade, transportation and utilities with 886 and financial
activities jobs had the fewest at 53 jobs. The second highest paying jobs were
professional and business services at $35,684. The second highest numbers of jobs
were in leisure and hospitality at 273.

Economic Impact Area
From 1970 to 2010, annual total personal income for the economic impact area
increased $2.55 billion in real ($2010) terms. The average annual real growth rate of 3.0
percent was higher than the state and national rates. The income category whose share
of the total gained the most was non-labor income, which went from 26 percent in 1970
to 38 percent in 2010, with even higher percentages than this between the early 1980s
and 2005. In those 40 years, non-labor sources grew at an average annual rate of 2.7
percent, outpacing labor sources which grew at a 1.5 percent rate. The labor income
category whose share of the total shrank the most was manufacturing (including forest
products), which went from 10.3 percent in 1970 to 4.6 percent in 2010. Of the new
income in that period, 44.4 percent was from non-labor sources. In 2005, 60 percent of
transfer payments were from age-related sources (retirement, disability, insurance
payments and Medicare). That year, welfare represented 7.7 percent of transfer
payments and 1.3 percent of total personal income. This was up slightly from 1970 and
up slightly from 1980 (BEA REIS 2005 Table CA35).
Per capita personal income (PCPI), adjusted for inflation, rose from $20,873 in 1970 to
$37,515 in 2010. After this 80 percent growth during the 40-year period, the 2010 per
capita personal income in the economic impact area ($37,515) was higher than the state
($36,160).
Average earnings per job, adjusted for inflation, increased from $39,182 in 1970 to
$42,101 in 2010. In 2010, average earnings per job in the economic impact area at
$42,101 were higher than the state ($38,690). During the 40-year period, average wage
and salary disbursements fell at an average annual rate of 1.1 percent (adjusted for
inflation), whereas average non-farm proprietors' income grew annually by 2.4 percent.
In 2011, mining jobs paid the highest wages at $85,342 and leisure and hospitality jobs

paid the lowest at $13,283. The highest numbers of jobs were in trade, transportation
and utilities with 9,362 and agriculture, forestry, fishing & hunting jobs had the fewest
at 290 jobs. The second highest paying jobs were in natural resources at $66,960. The
second highest numbers of jobs were in leisure and hospitality at $8,995.

Economic Diversity and Natural Resource Dependency
One measure of economic success and resilience is economic diversity, or the lack of
specialization. Some communities that are heavily reliant on only a few industries are
economically vulnerable to disruptions. The EPS Economic Diversity Index documents
one measure of specialization based on employment data from the 2000 Census. For
this index, the number of employees in each two-digit industry is first divided by the
total number of employees in the county. This fraction is then squared for the given
industry. Results for all industries in the county are then summed. This means that the
more even the distribution of employees across all possible industries the smaller the
score; where small scores imply greater diversity and large scores imply specialization.
Listed from least to most specialized, Silver Bow County scored 177, Jefferson County
scored 264, Lewis and Clark County scored 276, Deerlodge County scored 403 and
Powell County scored 421 (versus a median of 961 for all 3, 209 US counties). The main
reasons Deerlodge County is more specialized than peer counties is overspecialization in
both the healthcare and social service and the accommodation and food services
sectors, in addition to under representation of the manufacturing (5.1 compared to 14.1
percent for the US) and the professional, scientific and technical services. Powell County
shares similar economic characteristics and is far more reliant on the agriculture,
forestry, fishing and hunting sector (14.4 percent compared to 1.5 percent) and the
public administration sector (17.6 percent compared to 4.8 percent).
Collectively, these five counties scored 187. In general, the economic impact area is far
less reliant on manufacturing (only 4 percent compared to 14.1 percent) and more
reliant on public administration (13 percent compared to 4.8 percent) relative to the US.
The economic impact area is slightly more reliant than the US on both the health care
and social assistance (13.5 percent compared to 11.2 percent) and the accommodation
and food services (8.0 percent compared to 6.1 percent) sectors.
Wildland dependency data (Gebert and Odell 2006), based on the percentage of total
labor income (employee compensation and proprietor income) earned in five resource
areas (timber, mining, grazing, recreation and wildlife and federal wildland related
employment), is available in Table 168 for the five analysis area counties. The portion of
labor income earned in economic sectors associated with each resource area was
calculated for 1993 and 2003, as was the change that decade. Although these numbers
cannot support thorough trend analysis, as they are only two snapshots in time, they do
provide some important information.

For example, Jefferson County was the 9th most wildland dependent county in Montana
in 2003, with nearly half (46.8 percent) of labor income earned in sectors primarily or
indirectly supportive of the five resource areas. Jefferson County was also the fourth
most mining dependent Montana county that year, even after the percentage of direct
dependency on mining had actually decreased by nearly 9 percent since 1993. Powell
County was the next most wildland dependent county of the group during 2003. In that
county, timber in addition to recreation and wildlife comprised the majority of the
primary wildland dependence. Mining was Silver Bow County’s greatest share of primary
dependence during 2003, which was down roughly 2 percent from 1993. Deerlodge
County was the most dependent on Federal Wildland Management (2.2 percent) of the
five counties, during 2003, after mining’s share of primary dependence fell from the
1993 level. And although mining was also the highest category of primary wildland
dependence (1.5 percent) for Lewis and Clark County, it was one of the least wildland
dependent counties in the state during 2003, after primary dependence on each of the
resource categories fell from 1993 levels.

The OHV User Community
A recent report estimated that national participation rates in OHV sports may have
peaked during 2003 and those US residents over 16 years of age who rode OHVs
averaged roughly 28 days per year of motorized recreation between 2005 and 2007. In
Montana, between 1999 and 2007, an estimated 28.7 percent of residents 16 years and
older (the 95 percent confidence interval was 25.2 to 32.2 percent) participated in offECONOMICS - 665

Environmental Impact Statement

highway vehicle recreation. This ranked Montana residents 6th among all states for the
participation rate and amounted to approximately 219,000 participants, who
collectively represent roughly half of one percent of all US participants (Cordell et al
2008). Cordell et al (2008) described some OHV user demographics by region:
“The West had the highest OHV participation rate (28 percent) of all the regions
especially among young people where more than 40 percent under age 30 were OHV
users. This was more than two-and-a-half times the rate of people over age 50 (15
percent). Males living in the West were more likely to participate just as in the other
regions, but in this region, the female rate of 23 percent was considerably higher than
the female rate in other regions. American Indians (32 percent) and Whites (31 percent)
led participation among racial and ethnic groups, but Hispanics in the West (24 percent)
participated at a much higher rate than Hispanics in the two eastern regions and also at
a rate higher than the Midwest Hispanic rate. All but the lowest income category
participated at 20 percent or higher. People in all income groups between $25,000 and
$150,000 participated at more than a 30 percent rate. Similarly, all education classes,
but post-graduates, participated at more than 25 percent. Still, post-graduates in the
West participated at considerably higher rates than their counterparts elsewhere in the
country. More than one in three non-metropolitan residents participated in OHV
recreation as compared with about one in four metropolitan residents saying they
participated in OHV recreation.”(Cordell et al. 2008, p.29)
“Interestingly, the West, which led all regions with 28 percent of people 16 and older
participating, had the next-to-smallest average annual days of OHV use with 23.2 days
for participants, ahead of only the Pacific. Differences by age group were slight, but the
highest average was for the 51 years and older age group. That was not true for either
of the eastern regions or the Midwest. Male activity days were about six days higher
than for females, however, data were not sufficient to estimate days by all income
classes. High school graduates (26.1) and people with bachelor’s degrees (23.7) led other
educational attainment groups by a slender margin. Another interesting result for this
region is the large difference in average days by non-metropolitan residents (35.3)
compared to metropolitan dwellers (19.1). This is probably an indication of the
convenient and ready access to OHV opportunities on public land in the rural West.”
(Cordell et al. 2008, p.36)
Cordell et al. (2008) also compared participation rates between OHV users and the
general public based on responses to the national survey on recreation and the
environment (NSRE). They describe participation rates for each of the 47 outdoor
recreation activities across five OHV user segments and the general public. What they
found is that, “As a whole, OHV users are more active in every single recreation activity
relative to the general U.S. population age 16 and older. For some activities, OHV users
participate at more than twice the national rate. In particular, OHV users were about
three times more likely to participate in the three types of hunting–big game, small
game and migratory bird–than was the general public.” (Cordell et al. 2008, p.41)
The National Survey on Research and Environment research described above estimates
recreation occurring statewide on all land ownerships. Another statistically valid
recreation study, National Visitor Use Monitoring, conducted by the Forest Service
estimates participation rates and spending for various activities specifically on the
Helena National Forest. The NVUM numbers indicate that during fiscal year 2003, 9.0
percent of Helena National Forest visitors participated in off-highway vehicle (OHV)

recreation, 27.3 percent participated in driving for pleasure and 2.6 percent participated
in snowmobiling. These percentages are all smaller than the following activities with the
highest participation rates, viewing natural features (48 percent), viewing wildlife (47.5
percent), hiking walking/hiking (39.5 percent), relaxing (36.0 percent) and hunting (30.1
percent). When visitors were asked to claim a primary activity, 2.4 percent claimed OHV
use, 1.1 percent claimed driving for pleasure and 0.9 percent claimed snowmobiling. In
general, spending by all Helena National Forest visitors was below the average for
visitors to all national forests.

Economics, Environmental Consequences
Introduction
The assessment of economic impacts attempts to identify potential effects that Forest
Service travel planning may have on local, county and regional economic systems. In
particular, this analysis is used to address the questions:
1) Would changes in the management of the National Forest for
recreation and the amount of change in the motorized/nonmotorized designation of Forest roads and trails be large enough or
significant enough to cause measurable economic changes?
2) Is the economy of the local area diverse enough and robust enough
that the proposed changes will be insignificant or will they be felt in
very specific segments of the local economy?
A short description of each alternative and how it might impact the economy is
provided. When looking at potential impacts, consider the total (direct, indirect and
induced) response coefficients for economic impacts associated with any increase or
decrease of 1,000 party trips for each activity presented in Table 169.
All Forest Service employment and programs generally contribute roughly one to three
percent of the jobs and income in the economic impact areas of the Northern Region
(Montana and Northern Idaho national forests). The small change in type and quantity
of use in the Divide Travel Plan area would likely do little to affect county-level
economic indicators (i.e., total employment, total personal income, average annual
unemployment rate, wildland dependency) for the five-county area. However, impacts
that do occur may be felt strongly by a few vendors and service providers. The 2003
county percentages of economic dependence on recreation and wildlife (ranging from 0
to 5.5 percent) may decline slightly in the short-term. This could be considered a normal
part of the shifts in economic dependence, typical among highly natural resource
dependent counties. Curtailment of motorized activity in multiple locations across the
Northern Region could cumulatively have stronger long-term impacts on jobs and
income than is expected from each individual travel plan decision alone.

Effects Common to All Action Alternatives
Economic Response Coefficients by Activity Type
Table 169 displays the estimated employment and labor income response coefficients

(employment and labor income per 1,000 party trips) for local and non-local motorized
and non-motorized activities. The response coefficients indicate the number of full and

Environmental Impact Statement

part-time jobs and dollars of labor income per 1,000 party trips by activity type. The
response coefficients are useful in:
1. understanding the economic effects tied to a given use level;
2. understanding projected employment effects for various use scenarios
described in other sections of this NEPA documentation; and
3. understanding the differences in employment effects by activity type.
All job response coefficients per 1,000 additional or fewer party trips are in the range of
0.3 to 3.6 jobs. Although there are small differences between activity types, there are
roughly one to three national forest visits for each party visit. As shown in Table 169,
the economic responses tied to local visitation are generally lower than for non-local
visitation. This is a result of local visitors spending less per visit in comparison to nonlocal visitors. Additionally, economic responses vary widely by activity type. Based on
response coefficients, the strongest employment effect modeled is tied to non-local
overnight snowmobiling, followed closely by non-local overnight cross-country skiing.
However, the fiscal year 2003 National Visitor Use Monitoring data for the Helena
National Forest shows very little snowmobiling or cross country skiing. There are only
roughly 30 non-local cross country day trips, 92 non-local overnight trips and roughly
168 non-local overnight snowmobiling party trips each year, where the visitors are using
the Helena National Forest. Of the local day response coefficients, snowmobiling
provides the highest response coefficients, followed by local OHV/other motorized day
use and then by local day horseback riding, fishing, hunting, cross country skiing, all
other activities, nature related, driving for pleasure and hiking/walking and bicycling. In
general, economic effects associated with any change in management vary mainly by
the total amount of spending and by the type of activity, but it cannot be generalized
that motorized or non-motorized activities contribute more or less to the local economy
on a per visit basis because the number of visits per party group also vary across
activities.

Effects Common to Alternatives 2 and 3

The potential recreational displacement noted in the recreation section of this
document may impact individual vendors and service providers in the analysis area
economy. However, detailed quantified speculation of changes to tourism and
recreation visitation in the five economic impact area counties would be required to
estimate the direct and multiplier (indirect and induced) economic impacts. This data is
not available. Some substitute recreation and travel opportunities persist inside and
near the analysis area suggesting that any changes to the miles of roads and trails
affected by the decision will have minimal impact on the overall economy of these five
counties. Although the lands affected by the Divide Travel Management decision are
only a small part of the recreation and tourism in these counties (compared with
abundant boating, hiking, outfitting, hunting and fishing opportunities in areas like the

River, the southern portion of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, the Elkhorns, the
Flint Creek Range, Homestake Pass, Great Divide Ski Area and other nooks of the Divide
country), these lands have been increasingly difficult to access due to recent loss of
public land access via private lands. The exact economic impacts of travel management
decisions would be hard to isolate from other cumulative effects of similar land
management and travel planning efforts occurring in this portion of Montana.

Since no changes would occur, the current economic contribution from all summer and
winter recreation is expected to persist into the future under this alternative.

•

2 fewer miles of roads would be open to highway legal vehicles, with no
restrictions;
74 fewer miles of roads would be closed to motorized vehicle yearlong including
over-snow motorized vehicles;
11 fewer miles of trails would be open to vehicles 50 inches or less in width, no
restrictions;
112 additional miles of roads would be closed to wheeled vehicles yearlong,
open to over-snow motorized vehicles December 2nd to May 15th;
2 additional mile of trails would be closed to motorized vehicles yearlong; and
6 miles of non-system roads would be closed to motorized vehicles yearlong.

Specifically, this alternative would change the trail management in Sweeny Creek where
the designated trail system would be open from May 16th to October 14th for vehicles
less than 50 inches in width and would be closed to over-snow motorized vehicles
except on open or designated routes. In the Limburger Spring/Kading/Elliston area, the
connection between Road 314 and 1870 would be open to motorized use May 16th to
October 14th and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd
to May 15th. Road 314-J3 would be open October 15th to December 1st and would be
open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Road 314-J1
would be open yearlong to motorized vehicles with no seasonal restrictions. Trails 501,
MTR’s 503, 502, 1868 and road 1871-002 would be open to wheeled vehicles less than
50 inches in width from May 16th to October 14th and would be open to over-snow
motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Near Negro Mountain, Road
1857-A1 would be open from May 16th to October 14th and would be open to oversnow motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. In the Ontario Creek
drainage – A connection for vehicles less than 50 inches in width would be open from
the 495-D1 road to the 4104-A1 road from May 16th to October 14th and would be
open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. A portion of
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail – Roads 1802-B2, 335-B2 and 136-D1 would
be closed to wheeled vehicles and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles from
December 2nd to May 15th. Regarding big game rifle season access, Roads 335-A1 & A2,
1856 and 314-J3 would be open to motorized use October 15th to December 1st.

Divide Travel Plan

Regarding winter use – additional winter closures are proposed in the Sweeny Creek and
Hahn Creek areas, as well as lower elevation west facing slopes Clarks Canyon north to
Threemile Creek. Those areas that remain open would be open to over-snow motorized
vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. This alternative for the most part does away
with the concept of having roads closed to over-snow motorized use in areas that would
be open for that use.
In general, these changes are not expected to cause noticeable negative economic
impacts, which could occur through reductions below current contributions that
motorized recreation make to the economic impact area. However, the few small
changes could generate some additional non-motorized opportunities and possibly
some new positive economic recreation impacts associated with increased nonmotorized recreation in the impact area resulting from new closures to motorized use.

Alternative 3

Major changes under Alternative 3, would be:
•
•
•
•
•
•

24 fewer miles of roads open would be to highway legal vehicles, with no
restrictions;
64 fewer miles of roads would be closed to motorized vehicle yearlong including
over-snow motorized vehicles;
No miles (12 fewer miles) of trails would be open to vehicles 50 inches or less in
width, no seasonal restrictions;
156 additional miles of roads would be closed to wheeled vehicles yearlong,
open to over-snow motorized vehicles December 2nd to May 15th;
19 additional miles of trails would be closed to motorized vehicles yearlong; and
7 miles of non-system roads would be closed to motorized use yearlong.

Specifically, this alternative would change management in Sweeny Creek by closing
existing routes yearlong to motorized vehicles, including over-snow motorized vehicles
except on open or designated routes. It would close Limburger Spring/Kading – Little
Blackfoot Road (RD 227) just past the Kading Campground and 227-E1 would be closed
to wheeled motorized use yearlong and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles
from December 2nd to May 15th. Road 314 would be closed yearlong to wheeled
vehicles past the gate in Section 7 and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles
from December 2nd to May 15th. Roads 314-J1 and J3 would also be closed yearlong to
wheeled vehicles and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December
2nd to May 15th. Trails 501, MTR’s 503, 502 and 1868 and road 1871-002 would be
closed yearlong to wheeled vehicles and would be open to over-snow motorized
vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Negro Mountain – 1857 D2 and 1859 D4 and
E1 would also be closed and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles from
December 2nd to May 15th. In the Ontario Creek drainage – The connection from 495D1 and 4104-A1 would be closed to wheeled vehicles and would be open to over-snow
motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Regarding big game rifle season
access – Routes 335-A1 and A2, 1856 and 314-J3 would be closed yearlong to wheeled
vehicles and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles from December 2nd to
May 15th. A portion of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, roads 1802-B2, 335B2 and 136-D1 would be closed to wheeled vehicles and would be open to over-snow
motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th.

Divide Travel Plan

Regarding winter use – That area of the Divide south of MacDonald Pass to
approximately the Hahn Creek Road would be closed to motorized over-snow travel.
There would also be winter closures in the Sweeny Creek and Hahn Creek areas, as well
as lower elevation west facing slopes Clarks Canyon north to Threemile Creek. Those
areas that remain open have a season of December 2nd to May 15th for over-snow travel.
In general, these changes could cause some negative economic impacts, by reducing
current contributions that motorized recreation currently make to the economic impact
area. On the other hand, there would be some additional non-motorized opportunities
and possible new positive economic recreation impacts associated with increased nonmotorized recreation in the impact area resulting from new closures to motorized use.

Alternative 4

Major changes under Alternative 4, would be:
•
•
•
•
•
•

21 fewer miles of roads open would be to highway legal vehicles, with no
restrictions;
60 fewer miles of roads would be closed to motorized vehicle yearlong including
over-snow motorized vehicles;
No miles (16 fewer miles) of trails would be open to vehicles 50 inches or less in
width, no seasonal restrictions;
139 additional miles of roads would be closed to wheeled vehicles yearlong,
open to over-snow motorized vehicles December 2nd to May 15th;
20 additional miles of trails would be closed to motorized vehicles yearlong; and
6 miles of non-system roads would be closed to motorized use yearlong.

Specifically, this alternative would change management in Sweeny Creek by closing
existing routes yearlong to motorized vehicles, including over-snow motorized vehicles
except on open or designated routes. It would close Limburger Spring/Kading – Little
Blackfoot Road (RD 227) just past the Kading Campground and 227-E1 would become a
non-motorized trail. Road 314 would be open yearlong to wheeled vehicles past the
gate in Section 7 from May 16th to October 14th and open to over-snow motorized
vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Roads 314-J1 and J3 would also be closed
yearlong to wheeled motorized vehicles and would be open to over-snow motorized
vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Trails 501, MTR’s 503, 502, 1868 and road
1871-002 would be closed yearlong to wheeled vehicles and would be open to oversnow motorized vehicles from December 2nd to May 15th. Negro Mountain – 1857 D2
and 1859 D4 and E1 would also be closed. In the Ontario Creek drainage - 495-D1 would
be open to wheeled vehicles yearlong, including over-snow motorized vehicles once
stream crossings are improved. Road 4104-A1 would be open to wheeled motorized
vehicles 50 inches or less in width from May 16th to October 14th. Regarding big game
rifle season access – Routes 335-A1 and A2 would be open to highway legal vehicles
from October 15th to December 1st and would be open to over-snow vehicles from
December 2nd to May 15th. Routes 1856 from the gate and 314-J3 would be closed
yearlong to wheeled vehicles and would be open to over-snow motorized vehicles from
December 2nd to May 15th. A portion of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail,
roads 1802-B2, 335-B2, 1802 and 136-D1 would be closed to wheeled vehicles.
Regarding winter use – That area of the Divide Travel Planning Area south of MacDonald
Pass to approximately the Hahn Creek Road would be closed to motorized over-snow

travel. There would also be winter closures in the Sweeny Creek and Hahn Creek areas,
as well as lower elevation west facing slopes Clarks Canyon north to Threemile Creek.
Those areas that remain open have a season of December 2nd to May 15th for oversnow travel.
Alternative 4 would permit wheeled motorized vehicle travel within 300 feet of
designated system routes, including roads and trails (unless signed otherwise) as long
as:
1) No new permanent routes are created by this activity;
2) No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resource occurs;
3) Travel off-route does not cross streams; and
4) Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.
This small change could maintain motorized use in some areas, as people use motorized
vehicles to facilitate many other activities (e.g. berry picking, fishing, fire wood
gathering, etc.) moderating any negative economic impacts associated with curtailment
of motorized recreation opportunities.
In general, these changes could cause some negative economic impacts, by reducing
current contributions that motorized recreation currently make to the economic impact
area. On the other hand, there would be some additional non-motorized opportunities
and possible new positive economic recreation impacts associated with increased nonmotorized recreation in the impact area resulting from new closures to motorized use.

Alternative 5

This alternative is designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities and reduce
the short spur and redundant parallel routes. It also improves big game security and
addresses resource concerns relative to erosion and sedimentation from roads and
stream crossings. Consideration was given to further align the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with National Standards. If this alternative is selected, the
wheeled motorized vehicle routes and areas would be identified on a map as part of the
record of decision for this travel plan. In addition, a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM)
would be produced and available to the public for this planning area.
Major changes under Alternative 5, would be:
•
•
•

•
•

127 fewer miles of roads open would be to highway legal vehicles, with no
restrictions;
25 fewer miles of roads would be closed to motorized vehicle yearlong including
over-snow motorized vehicles;
8 fewer miles of roads open to highway legal vehicles December 2nd to October
14th (02-Res), open to over-snow motorized vehicles December 2nd to October
14th;
4 fewer miles roads open to highway legal vehicles May 16th to December 1st,

vehicles;
14.5 more miles of CDNST (old trail) proposed to be re-routed; and
4.2 more miles of proposed non-motorized trail in an area that allows oversnow motorized use.

Design Features Specific to Alternative 5:
Seasonal Trail (route) Dates
All motorized trails with seasonal use open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches and
less in width would be open from May 16th to August 31st with the exception of the
Lava Mountain connector trail # 4009-A1 which would be open from May 16th to
October 14th. There are approximately 14.5 miles of motorized trails that would have
no seasonal restrictions.

Kading-Limburger Springs Area
National Forest System Route (NFSR) #227 would remain open to Kading Campground.
Beyond Kading Campground, NFSR #227-E1 would become part of non-motorized trail
329. The trailhead parking area on NFSR #227 past Kading Campground where the route
would change to non-motorized use would be expanded to accommodate day use
vehicles and horse trailers. Motorized Trail #501 would remain open to motorized
vehicles of 50 inches and less in width from May 16th to August 31st. Motorized Trails
#502, #503 and #504 in the Kading/Limburger Springs area would be closed to wheeled
motorized use yearlong.
Over-snow motorized travel would be allowed in areas north and west of NFSR #227
from December 2nd to May 15th. Refer to the alternative 5 map for more detailed oversnow motorized travel in this area.

ECONOMICS - 674

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Sweeny Creek Area
With exception of the Priest Pass Road, all routes in the Sweeny Creek area would be
closed yearlong to motorized use including over-snow vehicles.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
NFSR #136-D1 would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles yearlong. Approximately,
one mile of the CDNST trail located north of NFSR #136 and just south and east of
Meyers Hill, would be rerouted and designated as a non-motorized section of the
CDNST. Refer to the CDNST map for information on motorized and non-motorized
segments of the CDNST.

Larabee Crossing and Golden Anchor Crossing – Little Blackfoot Area
The crossing at Larabee (227-D1) would be closed to wheeled motorized travel. In
addition, a foot/stock bridge would be constructed to connect to the non-motorized
Larabee Trail #359. A trailhead would be designated nearby on NFSR #227.
The stream crossing located on Golden Anchor NFSR #4100 is currently a ford crossing.
This alternative would replace the ford crossing with a bridge, bottomless culvert or
structure installed to accommodate wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width and
less and over-snow motorized vehicles. The ford would remain open until the structure
is in place or two years from the start of the implementation phase of this project,
whichever is less. If a structure is not installed during this timeframe, the ford crossing
would be closed to vehicle travel until a structure is in place. The area beyond this
crossing would remain open to wheeled vehicles 50 inches in width and less in addition
to over-snow motorized vehicles.

Unauthorized Routes
Alternative 5 would designate approximately 1.4 miles of identified unauthorized routes
to be added to the Forest Transportation System. All routes, including unauthorized
routes, not identified or included in this alternative, as well as any future created routes,
would be considered closed and would be physically closed without additional NEPA.

Parking
Parking would be limited up to 30 feet from the edge of a designated route.
Access to Dispersed Campsites up to 70 feet from a designated route
Parking and motor vehicle use associated with dispersed camping would be limited to
no more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route as long as:
•
•
•
•
•

No new permanent routes are created by this activity;
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources (i.e., damage to live
trees and shrubs, rutting and eroding of stream banks or bare soil);
Travel off-route does not cross streams;
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas; and
Vehicles travel to dispersed campsites would be limited to no closer than 30
feet of a stream or body of live water.

Access to Dispersed Campsites further than 70 feet from a designated route
Dispersed campsites located more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route that
are identified on the alternative 5 map would remain open for dispersed camping and

parking associated with dispersed camping. The five items identified under the access to
dispersed campsites up to 70 feet from a designated route section are applicable for this
as well.

Other Features
NFSR #314 would be open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches in width and less
from May 16th to August 31st, past the gate in Section 7.
NFSRs #314-J1 and #314-J3 would be closed yearlong to motorized travel.
NFSR #1870 and NFSR #1871-A2 are currently closed yearlong; however, alternative 5
would open them to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches and less in width from May
16th to August 31st. This route would connect to NFSR #1871 to create a loop trail. The
road spurs within this area that dead-end would be closed yearlong to wheeled
motorized vehicles. NFSR #1868 would be closed to wheeled motorized use yearlong
Two fords on NFSR # 495-D1 would remain open to motorized vehicles to provide access
to motorized Trail 4101-A1 which will be open to vehicles 50 inches and less in width
from May 16th to August 31st.
Approximately ½ mile of NFSR #1805-A1 (accessed from NFSR #1805) would be open to
wheeled highway legal vehicles from May 16th to October 14th; a motorized vehicle
trailhead would be developed at this location where it would connect to a one-mile loop
trail open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50 inches and less in width from May 16th
through October 14th.
In general, these changes could cause some positive and some negative economic
impacts, by adding seasonal restrictions to some motorized activities while making some
areas more attractive for loop riding and over-the-snow activities. It is harder to predict
the impact to current contributions that motorized recreation currently make than it is
to predict impacts from non-motorized activities, where there would likely be some
additional opportunities and possible new positive economic recreation impacts
associated with increased non-motorized recreation in the impact area resulting from
new closures to motorized use.

Cumulative Effects

Cumulative Effects in the Divide Travel Plan area include past, present and reasonably
foreseeable actions. The cumulative effects analysis area boundary for the unroaded
analysis is the same as the project area boundary.
Roads and trails are being proposed for opening/closing, along with timing restrictions.
None of the actions are ground disturbing. As described below, the effects would be
common to all of the action alternatives.
Direct effects expected by alternative are described above and would potentially impact
the economic contributions from various types of recreation and place explorationists
and miners under different amounts of additional administrative burden required in
prospecting, exploration and small scale mining activities. However, cumulatively, these
effects are expected to be small.

Recreational Opportunities
To address resource damage problems and user conflicts, and to transition to access
networks that are affordable to maintain, travel planning on other national forest

system lands and Department of Interior lands is changing the amount and type of
opportunities for motorized use. Although many jurisdictions are reducing overall
motorized access mileages, many are attempting to offer improved loop routes and
provide desirable terrain to access. Non-motorized use is expected to increase in many
areas and motorized use is expected to decrease. The combination of changes in
opportunities and the effects from the Divide Travel Plan area may change the
composition of the recreating public and the contributions that motorized and nonmotorized users make to local economies.

Livestock grazing
Cattle grazing provides jobs and other economic benefits to the economic impact area.
This would have a beneficial cumulative effect.

Noxious Weed Treatments
Noxious weed treatment would provide jobs and other economic benefits to the
economic impact area. Additionally, it would restrict noxious weeds from out-competing
native vegetation, which would prevent loss of cattle forage. Without noxious weed
management, grazing permittees may incur costs to provide supplemental feed.
Noxious weed treatment would have a beneficial cumulative effect.

Road and Trail Maintenance
Road maintenance would provide jobs and other economic benefits, including payments
for gasoline and food, to the economic impact area. The Forest Service utilizes private
contractors to perform maintenance activities such as road blading, cleaning ditches and
culverts, and installing culverts. Contractors are also used for trail maintenance,
construction, and reconstruction. These activities would have a beneficial cumulative
effect.

Hazard Tree Removal and Private Timber Harvest
Hazard tree removal and private timber harvest, thinning, and hauling would contribute
to the economic impact area by providing direct jobs and other economic contributions,
including payments for lodging (for non-local contractors), gasoline, food, meals, and
other items to the economic impact area. These activities would have beneficial
cumulative effects. Similarly, tree planting, pre-commercial thinning, and collection of
other forest products would also provide jobs and other economic benefits to the
economic impact area.

Private Roads/Special Use Permit Roads
Recreational users and those engaging in mining related activity would contribute to the
economic impact area by providing jobs and other economic benefits including
payments for lodging (for non-local clients), gasoline, food, meals, and other items. This
would have a beneficial cumulative effect. The limited use of crushed stone and
construction sand and gravel from the Forest would provide jobs and other economic
benefits to the economic impact area. This would have a beneficial cumulative effect.

Conclusions
In general, the economic impact area profiled in this section appears fairly healthy with
positive population growth during the 1990s, increases in employment and real
personal income and substantial increases in per capita personal income during the
period from 1970 to 2005. All counties have winter unemployment rates roughly twice

that of the annual low, occurring in September or October. Change is a constant in many
areas, especially those dependent on natural resources. Undulations in both the labor
and the growing portion of non-labor income may generate some instability for many of
the economic indicators used to proxy economic well-being. The influence of the global
economic recession will be difficult to discern from any changes caused by travel
management when using some of these variables. The community in this economic
impact area is certainly getting older and National Survey of Recreation and
Environment OHV research indicates this may lead to lower participation rates, but
greater days of use per year for users as people age. Trends, like growth in service
sector employment and income found in these counties, are shared by most peer
counties across the Rocky Mountain west. These growth trends are largely driven by
population growth of both permanent and seasonal residents and therefore changes in
travel management in the Divide Travel Plan area are unlikely to have a noticeable
impact on economic indicators for the five-county economic impact area. Even though
changes in use attributable to the alternatives outlined in the recreation report are
difficult to estimate, even large changes in use would have little effect on the overall
economy of the five-county area. Although a few vendors and service providers may be
impacted based on site-specific changes to wheeled and snow machine recreation
opportunities, substitute recreation and motorized travel opportunities within a short
drive would likely moderate the negative impacts to many of these businesses and
travel management changes may promote additional business opportunities in the long
term.

Environmental Justice and Civil Rights

None of the alternatives restrict or alter opportunities for subsistence hunting and
fishing by Native American tribes. Tribes holding treaty rights for hunting and fishing on
the Helena National Forest are included on the project mailing list and have the
opportunity to provide comments on this project.

The data suggests that any changes to the miles of roads and trails affected by the decision will
have minimal impact on the overall economy of these five counties. Implementation of any of
the action alternatives would not likely adversely affect minority or low-income populations.

foreseeable future throughout all of a significant portion of its range and
one that has been designated as a threatened species in the Federal
Register by the Secretary of the Interior.

Trailhead

The parking, signing, and other facilities available at terminus of a trail.

Turbidity

Sediment or foreign particles stirred up or suspended in water.

Unauthorized Routes

A road or trail that is not a forest road or trail or a temporary road or trail
and that is not included in a forest transportation atlas (36 CFR 212.1).
This includes user-created trails.

User-created Routes

Any route currently not managed as a component of the forest
transportation system. These include off-road vehicle tracks which have
not been designated and managed as a trail, and which may or may not be

legal under the 2001 Tri-State Off-Highway Vehicle Decision. They also
include travel ways abandoned from the forest transportation system, but
still exist on the ground and continue to receive use by the public. For this
project user-created route, unclassified and unauthorized routes are used
interchangeably.
Viewshed

A total landscape as seen from a particular viewpoint.

Visual Quality Objectives
(VQOs)

The degree of acceptable alteration of the characteristic landscape.

Visual Resource

The composite of basic terrain, geologic features, water features,
vegetative patterns, and land use effects that typify a land unit and
influence the visual appeal the unit may have for visitors.

Watershed

The total area above a given point on a stream that contributes water to
the flow at that point.

Wilderness Character

Wilderness character attributes are: Natural Integrity, Apparent
Naturalness, Outstanding Opportunities for Solitude, and Opportunities
for Primitive, Unconfined Recreation. These features were evaluated using
capability analyses as conducted in 1978 using the Wilderness Attribute
Rating (WAR) System and in 2005 using the Area Capability Assessment
(ACA) Process. These analysis techniques rate wilderness character
attributes as identified by the 1964 Wilderness Act.

Appendix A. Forestwide Standards, Forest Plan Consistency, and Management Area Direction
This appendix contains two tables. The first table displays the forestwide standards and forest plan consistency as it relates to this project.
Appendices referenced in the ‘Standard’ column on the left refer to the appendices for the Helena National Forest Plan. The second table
displays the management area direction for the project.

Table 1 - Forestwide Standards and Forest Plan Consistency
Standard

If Standard applies, how is standard being met

Recreation
1. New campgrounds and other developed recreation facilities, such as boat ramps or
picnic areas, will generally not be constructed. Continue to maintain existing developed
sites, but emphasize providing dispersed recreation opportunities. Removal of existing
sites may be necessary, in some cases, due to site deterioration or excessive
maintenance cost.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The
resulting travel decision would not authorize any new developed
recreation facilities.

2. Encourage ski-touring trail development by locating and marking additional trails and
by encouraging the private sector to develop trails.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal.

3. Complete a Recreation Opportunity Guide (ROG) for each Ranger District, to make
recreation opportunities more visible to the public.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal.

4. A specific Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) route will not be identified
prior to approval of the comprehensive plan being prepared by the Forest Service and the
Secretary of Agriculture's Advisory Council. Once the comprehensive plan is approved,
the management direction will be incorporated further in this plan. Based on the
Comprehensive Plan, a more detailed analysis will be completed to show trail segments,
objectives and specific route locations. The legislation authorizing the CDNST specifically
intended that the trail would not adversely affect or preclude the application of normal
management practices on lands adjacent to or within the trail corridor (both public and
private). It is not the intent of the legislation that a separate "management plan" be
developed for the CDNST, but to provide for the development and management of the
trail as a management practice which is integrated into the overall prescription for the
land through which the trail passes.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. New
CDT routes are not proposed under this project. The resulting
travel decision would only designate the type of use allowed on the
CDT.

5. Emphasize "Pack-In Pack-Out" use in dispersed recreation areas and in wilderness to
reduce resource impacts and management costs.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal.

6. Provide information to users of remote areas and wilderness about potential conflicts
with humans and bears and proper camping methods to avoid such conflicts.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal.

7. Outfitter and guide use will generally be maintained at a level determined from the
highest 2 years of actual use experienced during the period l979 through l983.
Application for additional or new use will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with
consideration of resource limitations and public need.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal.

Visuals
1. A visual quality objective (VQO) is stated for each management area. These visual
quality objectives provide the guidelines for altering the landscape. Portions of each
management area may have a more or less restrictive VQO. Appendix B lists roads,
trails, campgrounds, etc., that are within sensitive viewing areas. The VQO for these
areas is noted in Appendix B. The VQO's for the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
will be the same as the Management Areas through which the trail passes.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The
resulting travel plan decision is an administrative action and does
not authorize new route construction.

Cultural Resources
1. The Forest will undertake a systematic program of cultural resource inventory,
evaluation, and preservation aimed at the enhancement and protection of significant
cultural resource values, as prescribed for Federal Agencies by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act and 36 CFR 800. Cultural resource sites evaluated as
significant will be preserved in place whenever possible. When such resources are
threatened by project development, an effort to avoid or minimize adverse impact by
project redesign will be made. When avoidance is judged by the Forest Supervisor to be
imprudent or infeasible, the values of the site will be conserved through proper scientific
excavation, recordation, analysis, and reporting. An inventory survey for cultural
resources will be made for all significant ground-disturbing activities. Forest inventory
efforts will be focused in three areas including: a. Areas where specific project activities,
such as timber sales, road developments, range improvements, or mineral development
activities, result in significant ground disturbance. b. Large areas where substantial
development impact is anticipated, such as oil- and gas-planning areas. c. Areas where
formal archaeological surveys may provide management data that are broadly applicable
to ecologically similar areas and which will facilitate the development of predictive models
capable of addressing issues of cultural site density, distribution, and significance. The
Forest will encourage scientific research by privately funded universities as a means of
acquiring additional inventory and interpretive data. Such projects will be coordinated with
the State Historic Preservation Officer and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
Cultural resource site information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of
Information Act. Following Forest Supervisor written approval, site location data may be
released on a need-to-know basis to consultants, universities, or museums. Discovered
cultural resources will be evaluated in relation to published Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation (ACHP) criteria for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places.

Completed National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 process
for the Divide Travel Plan project- inventory, evaluation of
significance, evaluation of project effect, State Historic Preservation
Office and Tribal consultation. Particular consideration given to
cultural resources listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

If Standard applies, how is standard being met

Cultural resource sites determined eligible will be nominated to the National Register.
The Forest will coordinate cultural resource issues and concerns with the appropriate
Native American groups to ensure that Forest management activities are not detrimental
to the protection and preservation of Native American religious and cultural sites, treaty
rights, and religious and cultural practices. The Forest will enhance and interpret
significant cultural sites for the education and enjoyment of the public when such
development will not degrade the cultural property or conflict with other resource
considerations. Known significant cultural resource sites on the Forest will be protected
from inadvertent or intentional damage or destruction. Portions of the Lewis and Clark
National Historic Trail are on the Helena Forest. Some interpretive signing has been
placed along the trail. Normal management practices can still access land adjacent to or
within the trail corridor, however, project activities will be conducted to minimize
disturbance to the cultural site.
Wildlife and Fish Indicator Species
1. Populations of wildlife "indicator species" will be monitored to measure the effect of
management activities on representative wildlife habitats with the objective of ensuring
that viable populations of existing native and desirable non-native plant and animal
species are maintained. See Chapter IV, part D Monitoring and Evaluation for specific
monitoring requirements. Indicator species have been identified for those species groups
whose habitat is most likely to be changed by Forest management activities. The mature
tree dependent group indicator species is the marten; the old growth dependent group is
represented by the pileated woodpecker and the goshawks; the snag dependent species
group is represented by the hairy woodpecker; the threatened and endangered species
include grizzly bear, gray wolf, bald eagle and peregrine falcon; commonly hunted
indicator species are elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep; fish indicator species is the
cutthroat trout.

Habitat has been modeled for many of the MIS for which there are
potential effects; the documentation is in the project file. No
alternatives propose new road or trail construction: As a result,
there is no habitat modification directly associated with the Travel
Plan. Indirectly, habitat components in the road corridors—
primarily snag and logs—would be removed by firewood cutters.
This removal is insufficient to influence local population structure or
region-wide viability. For species directly influenced by road density
(grizzly bear, elk, mule deer, marten), no alternative increases
density, and the 3 action alternatives decrease it.
The MIS standard for fish applies. Westslope cutthroat trout habitat
has been altered as a function of existing high risk roads and
crossings as documented in the fisheries report. Fish habitat will
be maintained because this effort results in no ground disturbance
activities as a result to administratively open or close roads.
Monitoring of fish populations will not occur. Monitoring of fine
sediments in streams will be accomplished as part of Forest-wide
intra-gravel sediment monitoring using McNeil core samplers
(Information included in the Forest Annual Monitoring Report).

Big Game
Big Game 1. On important summer and winter range, adequate thermal and hiding
cover will be maintained to support the habitat potential.

Not applicable: thermal and hiding cover habitat are not affected
under any alternative.

2. An environmental analysis for project work will include a cover analysis. The cover

3. Subject to hydrologic and other resource constraints, elk summer range will be
maintained at 35 percent or greater hiding cover and areas of winter range will be

security. To decide which roads, trails, and areas should be restricted and opened, the
Forest will use the following guidelines developed with the Montana Department of Fish,
Wildlife, and Parks (MDFWP). The Forest visitor map will document the road
management program.
4a. Road management will be implemented to at least maintain big game habitat
capability and hunting opportunity. To provide for a first week bull elk harvest that does
not exceed 40 percent of the total bull harvest, roads will be managed during the general
big game hunting season to maintain open road densities with the following limits.

The existing hiding cover to open road density ratio should be determined over a large
geographic area, such as a timber sale analysis area, a third order drainage, or an elk
herd unit.
4b. Elk calving grounds and nursery areas will be closed to motorized vehicles during
peak use by elk. Calving is usually in late May through mid-June and nursery areas are
used in late June through July.

No new road closures specifically target elk calving areas, but
some calving sites will benefit from the closures that focus on
productive areas known to be important in multiple ways to big
game. MFWP has not indicated a need for new closures to protect

discussed in detail in Local Effects in Key Areas.
Roads designated as “crossing routes” through winter range to
facilitate access to areas outside winter range will remain stable
under all alternatives. A number of existing snowmobile routes
intrude into the upper reaches of winter range: These routes do not
increase under any alternative. See Environmental Consequences:
Elk Winter Range.
Signing is not a part of this phase of travel planning (which is
concerned only with the rationale and decisions to open or close
roads).

4e. Roads that will be closed will be signed during construction or reconstruction telling
the closure date and the reason for closure.

Signing is not a part of this phase of travel planning.

4f. Enforcement is a shared responsibility. Enforcement needs will be coordinated with
the MDFWP.

The need for enforcement has been discussed with MFWP. The
details of enforcement are not part of this phase of travel planning.

4g. Opened Forest roads will normally have a designed speed of less than 15 miles per
hour. Exact design speeds will be determined through project planning. Loop roads are
not recommended and will be avoided in most cases.

Alternative 1 preserves existing loop routes. Alternatives 2, 3, and
4 close some loop routes. Speed limit designations are not part of
this phase of travel planning.

4h. The Forest Road Management Program will be developed in conjunction with
MDFWP and interested groups or individuals. The Road Management Program will
contain the specific seasonal and yearlong road, trail, and area restrictions and will be
based on the goals and objectives of the management areas in Chapter III of the Forest
Plan.

Meetings have been held with MFWP over a period of years during
Travel Plan Development. More will be held to discuss specific
details of the current proposals. Meeting notes in the project file.

9. Occupied bighorn sheep and mountain goat range will be protected during resource
activities. Project plans for livestock, timber, or other resource development will include
stipulations to avoid or mitigate impacts on their range. Conflicts between livestock and
these wildlife species will be resolved in favor of the big game.

Not applicable: No proposals to affect or modify habitat in occupied
bighorn sheep and mountain goat range.

10. Moose habitat will be managed to provide adequate browse species diversity and
quantity to support current moose populations.

Not applicable: No habitat will be modified.

Threatened and Endangered (T&E) Species
1. A biological evaluation will be written for all projects that have potential to impact any
T&E species or its habitat. All evaluations will address each projects potential to
adversely modify a listed species habitat or behavior. If an adverse impact is determined,
mitigation measures will be developed to avoid any adverse modification of a listed
species habitat or behavior. If all possible mitigation measures do not result in a no effect
determination, then informal and/or formal consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service will be initiated.

The analysis of TES species in the Wildlife Specialist’s Report
serves as the Biological Evaluation for this travel planning effort. A
separate Biological Assessment of T&E species will be prepared
and submitted to the USFWS for consultation.
A biological evaluation will be completed for sensitive westslope
cutthroat trout and pearlshell mussels, and a bull trout biological
assessment will be prepared and submitted to the USFWS.
Because of adverse baseline conditions to listed species habitat
(cumulative effects), formal consultation with the U.S., Fish &
Wildlife Service via a bull trout biological assessment will be
initiated.

2. Grizzly bear -- Apply the guidelines in Appendix D to the Management Situation 1 and
2 (referred to essential and occupied prior to 1984) grizzly bear habitat on the Forest (see
map in Appendix D).
Initiate field studies in undesignated areas known to be used by grizzlies, to determine if
the areas should be designated as grizzly habitat. Until sufficient evidence is available to
determine the status of these areas, manage them according to Appendix E, Grizzly
Management Guidelines Outside of Recovery Areas.

Guidelines in Forest Plan Appendix D are for Recovery zones and
do not apply to the Travel Plan Area. Guidelines in Appendix E,
which do apply to this area, have been used. Discussion is in the
Wildlife Specialist’s Report under sections on Grizzly Bear and in
the Biological Assessment.

3. In occupied grizzly habitat, to minimize man-caused mortality the open road density
will not exceed the 1980 density of 0.55 miles per square mile, which was determined to
have little effect on habitat capability.

The “Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone” is a modified version of
“occupied grizzly habitat” outside a Recovery Zone not
contemplated by the Forest Plan. Unweighted road density in the
Distribution Zone is 1.8 mi/mi². There is no Forest Plan “occupied
habitat” in the Travel Plan Area. See the discussion under
Environmental Consequences: Grizzly Bear.
Not applicable to this effort.

4. Research activity on grizzly bears or their habitat will be reviewed by the Research
Subcommittee of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee.

and neither is affected in any measurable way by Travel Plan
alternatives. See discussion under Sensitive Species.

6. Gray Wolf -- With the USFWS and MDFWP, investigate reported gray wolf
observations to confirm or deny gray wolf presence. If presence of gray wolf is confirmed,
determine if the habitat is necessary for the wolf’s recovery. If the habitat is necessary,
coordinate with the MDFWP and the USFWS to implement the Wolf Recovery Plan. See
Appendix D for gray wolf habitat map.

The wolf is no longer listed as a threatened or an endangered
species. Effects on wolves and communications with the USFWS
and MFWP are discussed in sections on the Wolf under Sensitive
Species.

7. No known threatened or endangered plants are on the Helena National Forest.

This standard is being met. There are no known threatened or
endangered plants on the HNF.

8. Species of Special Concern
There are habitats on the Forest where the following species of special concern may be
found (Plant Species of Special Concern, USDA-FS, l980) Lemhi penstemon (Penstemon
lemhiensis), Howell's gumweed (Grindelia howellii), Missoula phlox (Phlox missoulensis),
Cliff toothwort (Cardamine rupicola). Missoula phlox and cliff toothwort have been
located on the Helena Forest.
Other Plants that are termed rare have also been located on the Helena Forest. They are
Klaus’ bladderpod (Lesquerella plausii) and Long-styled thistle (Cirsium longistylum). Two
additional rare plants, Moschatel (Adoxa moschalellina) and Lesser rushy milkvetch
(Astragalus connvallarius) are believed to occur on the Helena Forest but currently have
no occurrence records.
If any of these species are verified on the Helena Forest, appropriate measures, pursuant
to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, will be taken.

If populations have been/are found, they would be protected from
ground disturbance or herbicide application. As directed by the
Forest Plan, if any of the species of special concern are verified,
appropriate measures would be taken.

Old Growth
An old growth stand is generally characterized by a high level of standing and down,
dead and rotting woody material; two or more levels of tree canopies and a high degree
of decadence indicated by heart rot, mistletoe, dead or broken tree tops, and moss.
Five percent of each third order drainage should be managed for old growth. The priority
for old growth acres within each drainage is: first, land below 6000 feet in elevation;
second, riparian zones and mesic drainage heads; and third, management areas
emphasizing wildlife habitat. These areas will normally be managed on a 240 year
rotation and will range from 10 acres to several hundred acres.
Management areas other than T-1 through T-5 will be the primary source for old growth.
However, if adequate old growth area cannot be achieved then the T management areas
will be considered to meet old growth objectives.

These guidelines are not applicable to this travel planning effort.

Snags
1. To keep an adequate snag resource (standing dead trees) through the planning
horizon, snags should be managed at 70 percent of optimum (average of two snags/acre)
within each third order drainage.

2. Snag management guidelines need not be applied within a quarter mile of riparian
areas, because riparian standards should provide for adequate snags.

The effects of travel management on dead trees are discussed in
detail in sections on Snags and MIS and TES species dependent
on snags and logs. Since no new roads or trails would be
constructed, all effects will be indirect, stemming from the access
that open roads give to firewood cuttters and magnified currently by
the ongoing bark beetle epidemic.
See sections addressing Riparian Habitats for a discussion of snag
management in riparian areas.

3. Larch, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, spruce, and subalpine fir, in that priority, are the
preferred species for snags and replacement trees (live trees left to replace existing
snags).

Not applicable to travel management

4. Management areas other than T-1 should be the primary source for snag
management. However, if adequate snags cannot be found outside of T-1, then the
following numbers and sizes of snags should be retained in cutting units, if available.
A. In units with snags, keep a minimum of 20 snags and 10 replacement trees per 10
acres, if available. If 20 snags are not available, then any combination totaling 30 should
be left, by the following dbh classes:
13 snags and 6 replacement trees from 7-11 inches
5 snags and 3 replacement trees from 12-19 inches
2 snags and 1 replacement trees 20+ inches
B. In units--except those of pure lodgepole--without snags keep a minimum of 30 wind
firm trees per 10 acres, if available, by the following dbh classes:
21 trees from 7-11 inches
7 trees from 12-19 inches
2 trees from 20+ inches
If wildlife funds are available, a third of the replacement trees should be girdled or
otherwise killed to provide snags, by the following dbh classes:
7 trees from 7-11 inches dbh
2 trees from 12-19 inches dbh
1 tree from 20+ inches dbh

See sections on Snags for a discussion of how travel management
is likely to indirectly affect snag distribution. These guidelines are
essentially inapplicable to this travel planning effort.

Fisheries
1. Maintain quality water and habitat for fish by coordinating Forest activities and by direct
habitat improvement (see Forest Wide Standards for riparian).

Standard applies. Although current fish habitat conditions have
been compromised to various degrees by the current road system,
this decision would help maintain habitat by closing up to 52% of

high risk roads and 48% of open stream crossings. Through close
coordination with fisheries, three high risk fords would be closed to
motorized traffic until approved bridge or similar bottomless
crossings could be installed.

2. Instream activities should allow for maximum protection of spring and fall spawning
habitats.

Standard applies. Several cumulative (present and foreseeable
future) actions on roads and existing crossings identified under the
roads analysis are designed to improve and stabilize road drainage
to minimize risk of sediment delivery into the stream system.

3. Structures installed within streams supporting fisheries will be designed to allow
upstream fish movement, especially to spawning areas.

Standard applies. Seven crossing structures west of the Divide are
funded for upgrades to replace undersized culverts and allow for
aquatic species passage as it relates to cumulative actions. All
work within streams is closely coordinated with fisheries and the
state to ensure spawning habitats become accessible and are not
adversely affected by sediment.

1. Riparian condition within livestock allotments will be mapped and become part of the
Allotment Management Plan.

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel
plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize
grazing or allotment management plans.

2. Where analysis shows range resource damage, the cause will be identified and
corrective action will be initiated through an allotment management plan.

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel
plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize

plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize
grazing or allotment management plans.

4. Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be used to minimize livestock damage to
lakeside soils, stream sides, and other fragile areas.

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel
plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize
grazing or allotment management plans.

5. Allotment management plans will specify the utilization standards of key plant species
needed to protect the soil and water quality. Allowable forage utilization of these plants
should be based on local range conditions, soil stability, and known individual plant
requirements. The guides for allowable utilization of key species, by condition classes,
are in the Range Management Handbook (FSH 2209.21).

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel
plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize
grazing or allotment management plans.

6. Allotment Management Plans will be developed using the interdisciplinary process.

3. Funding for weed control on disturbed sites will be provided by the resource which
causes the disturbance.

This standard is applicable to project implementation.

Revegetation
1. Seeding will be done in a timely manner on disturbed areas, to prevent erosion and to
achieve best re-vegetation results.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The
resulting travel plan decision is an administrative action and does
not authorize any ground disturbance.

2. Seeding mixtures of native plants (naturally occurring) should be used, if practical, in
all re-vegetation projects greater than two acres. On smaller disturbances, the
responsible official may authorize the use of exotic species.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The
resulting travel plan decision is an administrative action and does

Timber
1. Silvicultural examinations and prescriptions will be required before any timber
manipulation or silvicultural treatment takes place. Exceptions include cutting of trees that
block vision along roads, cutting hazard trees, clearing right-of-way, clearing for mineral
development, minor and incidental amounts of free use, and cutting personal firewood.
Final determination of what silvicultural system will be used for a particular project will be
made by a certified silviculturist after an on-the-ground site analysis. This site specific
analysis will determine the appropriate even or un-even age silvicultural system that best
meets the goals and objectives of the management area. Standards for applying all
silvicultural systems, as well as supporting research references are in the Northern
Region guide (June 10, 1983). In addition, broad guidelines are found in Appendix H and
M. Even aged management methods will be used only where it is determined to be
appropriate to meet objectives. Clearcutting will be used only where it is the optimum
method.

5. A feasibility analysis of each sale over one million board feet will be made to assure
that it has been designed with the most cost-effective measure possible in keeping with
environmental concerns. This analysis will examine strategic items in the sale design
process to assure consideration of economic impacts of these items on the sale value. A
cash flow analysis will be done to determine the viability of the sale with current market
conditions. If anticipated costs are higher than predicted high bids, consider the following:
a. Defer the sale until economic conditions would indicate receiving higher bids.
b. Proceed to sell the timber and provide proper documentation that benefits, other than
immediate monetary return from the timber, are of importance.

Water, Soil, and Air - Municipal Watershed Guidance
1. Municipal watersheds will be managed under multiple-use concepts and direction.
Management area guidelines will identify permissible land uses, restrictions on land uses,
and special measures required to ensure a high quality and quantity municipal water
supply. Presently, there are two municipal watersheds on the Forest, Tenmile and
McClellan.

The proposed travel plan is consistent with multiple-use concepts
and direction. The proposed travel plan does not specifically
address water quality concerns in the Tenmile Creek watershed.
The proposed travel plan does not specifically address
management actions that might reduce the impact of road sediment
to water quality, as this decision only dictates the open-or-closed
status of the routes in the planning area.

2. Design and implementation of projects within the watershed will be guided by FSM
2542.12, as well as specific management area standards and guidelines.

The proposed travel plan does not specifically address
management actions that might reduce the impact of road sediment
to water quality, as this decision only dictates the open-or-closed
status of the routes in the planning area.

3. An environmental analysis will be prepared in coordination with the concerned
municipality and the State Water Quality Bureau for each new project proposed within the
municipal watershed which could potentially result in degradation of water quality.

This standard does not apply, as the decision does not authorize
any new ground-disturbing activities and would not directly result in
any additional degradation of water quality beyond current levels.

4. Each project implemented in the municipal watersheds will have a designated Forest
Service representative responsible for maintenance of water quality within appropriate
state standards. Each contractor will designate a representative, who will normally be at
the project site, with the authority to take whatever action necessary to remedy any
situation which might result in violation of state water quality standards.

This standard does not apply, as the decision does not authorize
any new ground-disturbing activities and would not directly result in
any additional degradation of water quality beyond current levels.

5. Plans and specifications for projects proposed for municipal watersheds will be

reasons stated in number 3 above.

5. The Forest Service will attempt to inform non-Federal landowners and land developers
adjacent to the Forest of the management direction on the Forest land.

Non-federal landowners within and adjacent to the Forest have
been included in the scoping effort of the Divide Travel Plan
analysis and will they be kept informed throughout the process.

6. Adjacent private lands will not preclude multiple use management of lands
administered by the Forest Service. But management of Forest Service land will be
modified where appropriate and necessary to complement land uses on adjacent nonFederal property.

Existing access across the Forest to adjacent non-federal lands will
be maintained when there is no reasonable alternative access
across other lands through the Divide Travel Plan analysis.

7. When an environmental analysis for a proposed Forest project indicates that activities
on adjacent land will require Forest Service management activities to be restricted to
protect soil, water, and wildlife resources, the necessary restrictions will be determined. If
no activity on Forest land is possible, the desired management will be scheduled for later
decades when sufficient recovery has occurred on adjacent lands to permit the proposed
activities on Forest Service land to continue. Exceptions to this policy will be considered
on a case-by-case basis, when deferring management would result in adverse impacts to
other Forest resources.

This is not applicable to the Divide Travel Plan analysis.

Landownership Adjustment
1. A landownership adjustment schedule for the Helena Forest will be developed using
the following criteria:
a. The priority for acquisition will be for lands with assessed high wildlife, recreation,
and watershed values. Acquisition may entail purchase or donation of fee simple or
partial interests, such as conservation and scenic easements, or exchange
procedures.
b. Emphasize acquisition of land and interests in land to allow access to all Helena
National Forest lands.
c. Emphasize acquisition of trailhead facilities and trail rights-of-ways, especially to
wilderness and dispersed recreation areas.
d. Consider disposal of tracts where past patenting has resulted in isolated, intermingled
National Forest ownerships, such as at York, Rimini, and Unionville.

The Lands/Rights-of-Way Background Report contains an inventory
of rights-of-way interests to pursue, by priority, with the objective
being to improve access to Helena National Forest lands.

not authorize any maintenance to administrative facilities.

2. Construct new administrative facilities to replace existing structures that are no longer
cost effective to maintain or expand or are inadequate to serve the needs of resource
management.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The
resulting travel plan decision is an administrative action and does
not authorize any construction or expansion of facilities or
structures.

Roads
1. Road construction and reconstruction will be the minimum density, cost, and standard
necessary for the intended need, user safety, and resource protection.

1. None of the Alternatives involve road construction or
reconstruction

2. Forest development roads will not be constructed without an approved Area
Transportation Analysis. Other road construction will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.

2. None of the Alternatives involve road construction or
reconstruction

3. Forest Specialists representing soils, watershed, and fisheries shall identify potential
soil erosion, water quality and fisheries problems and provide input to the development of
road design standards. Mitigating measures which will be considered in developing these
standards include but not limited to:
a. Reestablishing vegetation on exposed soils.
b. Protecting the road surface through surface stabilization techniques such as dust oil or
gravel, especially on decomposed granitic soils.
c. Preventing downslope movement of sediment with the use of slash windrows below
the fill slopes near stream crossings, baled straw in ditches and catch basins at culvert
inlets.
d. Reducing soil disturbance in or near streams by diverting clear water around culvert
installation sites, especially in important fisheries streams.
e. Controlling the concentration of water flow by insloping, outsloping and using minimum
grades at stream crossings.

3. No construction or reconstruction would be done as part of any
alternative. Maintenance would continue as part of all alternatives.

4. Short term local roads will be used for one time road access needs.

4. No new construction would be done as part of any alternatives

5. Coordinate transportation planning and road management with State and local
agencies and owners of intermingled land.

5. The Forest is in the process of obtaining the necessary
easements or already has them in place. Obtaining easements is
outside the scope of this project.

Where roads are closed, appropriate measures would be taken to
ensure proper drainage is maintained. In future decisions, the level
and type of road decommissioning would be considered.

Road Management
1. The Helena National Forest will generally be open to vehicles except for roads, trails,
or areas which may be restricted. (See Forest Visitor Map for specific information.) The
Forest Road Management Program will be used to review, evaluate, and implement the

goals and standards of the management areas in the Forest Plan with regard to road,
trail, and area wide motorized vehicle use.

over-snow motorized use.

2. Road management decisions will be based on user needs, public safety, resource
protection, and economics. Most existing roads will be left open. But most new roads will
be closed, at least during critical periods for big game.
The criteria to be used for road, trail, or area restrictions are as follows:
a. Safety - Restrictions may be necessary to provide for safety of Forest users.
b. Resource Protection - Unacceptable damage to soils, watershed, fish, wildlife, or
historical/archaeological sites will be mitigated by road restrictions or other road
management actions as necessary. Restrictions for wildlife reasons will be coordinated
with the MDFWP.
c. Economics - Restrictions will be considered if maintenance costs exceed benefits.
d. Conflicting Use - Conflicts between user groups (especially motorized vs. nonmotorized) may require restrictions.
e. Facility Protection - Restrictions may be necessary to prevent damage to
administrative sites, special use facilities, or other improvements.
f. Public Support - Public concern may necessitate restricting or opening some roads,
trails, or areas.
g. Management Objectives - Road management will be used to achieve land
management objectives.

2. a. There would not be any significant changes to user safety.
The major changes would involve opening roads up to access by
over-snow motorized vehicles. Since these roads are currently
closed to other types of motorized use there is would not be any
change to safety. (Motorized Mixed use routes for non-street legal
vehicles would be evaluated on a case by case basis.)
b. There would be a reduction of damage to soils in alternatives 2,
3 and 4 resulting from the additional road closures.
c. There would not be any significant changes to economics in any
of the alternatives
d. Conflicts between user groups would be evaluated on a case by
case basis
e. Facility Protection - Not applicable
f. Public Support-There may be concerns generated by increasing
over-snow vehicle access to certain areas.
g. Management Objectives-All four alternatives address this issue
by continuing to provide strong stewardship of the land while
allowing the public to access forest land.

3. The travel restrictions will be reviewed annually and revised as necessary to meet the
goals and objectives of the Forest Plan.

3. Travel Restriction will be evaluated annually

4. Enforcement of the Road Management Program will be a high priority. Weekend
patrolling, signing, gating, obliterating unnecessary roads, and public education will be
used to improve enforcement. Enforcement will be coordinated with the MDFWP and
other State and local agencies.

4. Initially increased enforcement activity would be necessary to
educate the public regarding the road restrictions for each of the
alternatives.
Upon completion of this phase of the travel planning effort would
result in a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM). Production of a MVUM
would occur annually and would assist in educating the public on
travel within the Divide Travel Planning Area.

Road Maintenance
1. Roads will be maintained in accordance with direction provided in FSH 7709.15
(Transportation System Maintenance Handbook) and will be at a level commensurate
with the need for the following operational objectives: resource protection, road
investment protection, user safety, user comfort, and travel efficiency.

1. Maintenance dollars are dispersed annually based on evaluation
and needs. Annual road maintenance funding is limited and is
insufficient to cover the entire amount of road maintenance required
to a suitable standard. As a result, the Forest maintains roads
based on Forest-wide priorities taking areas in need of resource

Management Standards

If Standard applies, how is standard being met

Management Area M-1 (183,500 acres)
Description: These areas are non-forest and forested land where timber
management and range or wildlife habitat improvements are currently
uneconomical or environmentally infeasible. The area is scattered throughout
the Forest and is found at all elevations and slopes ranging from 10 percent to
over 60 percent. The parcels range in size from 20 to 500 acres.

Management Goal - Maintain the present condition with minimal investment
for resource activities, while protecting the basic soil, water, and wildlife
resources.

Recreation - Dispersed recreation can be supported by constructing trails,
trailhead facilities, and sanitation facilities.

The resulting travel decision would comply with this standard.

Visual - Because of the lack of activity, the general visual quality objective
(VQO) is retention. Less restrictive VQOs may be considered on a case-bycase basis, if project level planning on an adjacent management area affects
a M-1 management area. [See Forest Landscape Management Book, Vol. 2
(Ag. Hdbk. No. 462) for definitions of VQOs and how they are applied.]

The resulting travel decision would comply with this standard.

Wildlife and Fisheries - Management practices to maintain or improve
wildlife habitat will be permitted where necessary to meet the objectives of
adjacent management areas.

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel plan decision
is an administrative action.

Range - Livestock use may remain at the 1983 level if the area is within
existing allotments. Maintain range improvements and build new
improvements, if they are needed to facilitate management of adjacent areas.

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel plan decision
is an administrative action and does not authorize grazing or allotment
management plans.

Timber - Timber harvest, such as salvage and firewood removal, may occur
where access exists. Slash created by any management practice will be
disposed of in a manner consistent with the management area goals.
Forested lands are classified as unsuitable for timber management.

harvest, depending on habitat group, physical site conditions, and silvicultural
objectives. Pre-commercial thinning and intermediate harvest may occur where
needed as determined by silvicultural objectives and project planning.
(Appendices H and M provide broad guidelines for various habitat groups.)
As a minimum, a cutover area will not be considered an opening when: (1) a
new forest stand is established and certified as stocked, and (2) vegetative
conditions reach the point where harvest of additional timber can occur and the
combined area can still meet watershed management objectives.
Prescribed burning or other techniques may be used for slash disposal, site
preparation, silvicultural, and livestock objectives. In habitat groups where fire is
not a useful treatment tool, lopping and scattering, yarding un-merchantable
material (YUM), or other methods will be used to reduce fuel accumulations and
prepare sites for regeneration.
Project level planning will provide for stand regeneration within five years of
final harvest.
Even-aged stands will be scheduled for final regeneration harvest when they
generally have reached the culmination of mean annual increment (CMAI) of
growth. Exceptions include thinning or other stand improvement measures,
salvage or sanitation harvest, management for experimental or research
purposes and to meet other resource objectives. CMAI for primary species on
the Helena National Forest is shown in Appendix H.

levels develop and control is necessary, the control method should minimize
impacts on the big game summer range values.
The appropriate fire suppression response ranges from control to confinement
in this management area depending upon location, expected fire behavior,
and other decision criteria related to values at risk. These decision criteria are
stated in the Fire Management Direction in Appendix R.
Prescribed fire with planned ignitions will be used in this management area,

Riparian –See Forest-Wide Standards for grazing in riparian.
Management Area P3 (32,900 acres)
Description This management area includes the Electric Peak Roadless Area
recommended by the Helena National Forest for Congressional designation
as wilderness. This recommendation is a preliminary administrative
recommendation that will receive further review and possible modification by
the Chief of the Forest Service, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the
President of the United States. Final decisions on wilderness designation
have been reserved by the Congress to itself.

Management Goals - Manage the recommended wilderness additions to
protect the wilderness characteristics and to the extent possible allow existing
uses, pending Congressional classification.

Recreation - Visitor use may be restricted to prevent loss of solitude or
unacceptable depreciation of the wilderness qualities.
The limits of acceptable change (LAC) process may be used to determine if
management actions are necessary to preserve natural environments and
provide wilderness experiences

The resulting travel decision will comply with this standard.

Management Standards

If Standard applies, how is standard being met

Visual - Management practices will follow the guidelines for the preservation
VQO.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal.

Wilderness - If recommended Big Log addition receives wilderness
classification, wilderness management direction will be the same as for the
rest of the Gates of the Mountains, in Management Area P-2
Existing structures will be retained. If major rehabilitation or maintenance is
needed, an assessment of the continued need and cultural significance will be
completed.

This standard is not applicable to the project, as Big Log and the Gates of the
Mountains Wilderness are located outside of the planning area. This decision
is an administrative action and does not alter any existing structures in any
way.

Wildlife and Fisheries - Wildlife habitat improvement projects will conform to
Forest Service Wilderness Policy (FSM 2320).
Fish stocking will conform to Forest Service wilderness policy. Stocking can
continue in lakes where there is a history of such activity.

Relative to fisheries, fish stocking would not be affected by the travel plan
project, and would continue in lakes under the direction of the Montana
Department of Fish, Wildlife & Parks.

Range -Natural vegetative composition will be maintained. All existing range
allotments may be maintained and managed in accordance with wilderness
values.
Existing livestock management improvements may be maintained.
Additional structural improvements may be built only when necessary to
maintain the wilderness values.

This standard is not applicable to this project. The resulting travel plan decision
is an administrative action and does not authorize grazing or allotment
management plans.

Timber -Timber harvest is not permitted. The management area is classified
as unsuitable for timber management.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The resulting
travel plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize any
timber harvest or ground disturbance.

Water and Soils - See Forest-Wide Standards.
Minerals - Areas recommended for wilderness, Electric Peak and Mount
Baldy, that currently have oil and gas leases will be managed under the
stipulation of the lease until the lease expires. Applications for further oil and
gas leasing will be accepted but not processed until the wilderness
classification has been determined.

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The resulting
travel plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize any new
mineral oil and gas leases. Mount Baldy is located outside of the planning
area.

Lands -This management area is an exclusion area for utility corridors (See
Appendix P).

This standard is not applicable to the Divide Travel Proposal. The resulting
travel plan decision is an administrative action and does not authorize any
additional, or changes to, utility corridors.

Facilities - Facilities and structures may be constructed to ensure the
protection of the wilderness resource and safety of users. However, facilities
may not be constructed solely to provide convenience to users.

Protection - Areas will be evaluated periodically for significant insect and
disease problems, such as mountain pine beetle. Endemic levels of insects
and most disease agents that do not normally pose threats to adjacent lands
will be accepted as naturally occurring. Control measure would be initiated
only as a last resort if epidemics do not subside naturally and continue to
threaten lands outside the proposed wilderness.
Fire Management Direction in Appendix R will be implemented that permits
unplanned ignitions to burn when within prescription, to perpetuate the natural
plant and animal diversity. Suppression actions need to be compatible with
wilderness management objectives
The appropriate fire suppression response ranges from control to confinement

Appendix B. Cumulative Effects

The area to be analyzed in a cumulative effects analysis is usually not limited to the project
area, and it varies with the resource or species being analyzed. Each resource will have
different “boundaries” for its effects analysis. Quantified, detailed information regarding
effects, leading to specific reasoned conclusions can be found in the cumulative effects section
of each specialist report located in the project record. The following tables of past, present,
and reasonably foreseeable projects have been used by the interdisciplinary team members in
determining the cumulative effects for their respective resource. Each resource specialist has
determined which of the following activities are applicable to their analysis, depending on their
cumulative effects boundary. Some resource reports may mention a project that is missing
from this table, however the “hard look” for analysis purposes has been taken.

Table 4 displays the Past Activities which have influenced the existing condition. Table 5
displays the Current and Ongoing Activities. These projects are in the implementation phase.
Table 6 displays the Reasonably Foreseeable Activities. The projects in Table B3 are still in the
planning phase, which means there is potential for change due to public input, changed

Improve road way from the junction with Hwy 12 to the junction with the Chessman Reservoir
intersection, just over 6 miles in length. Improvements would include replacement of three bridges and
associated railings, bridge drainage improvements, upgrading road signs, re-alignment of road
segments, and paving.
Approximately 6,335 acres are proposed for treatment. About 1,867 acres would be pre-commercial
thinned (15-40 year old stands). The remaining acres are mature stands with high MPB mortality,
which would be treated with chainsaws, prescribed fire, masticators, feller-bunchers, and cable logging
equipment. Primary prescription would be regeneration harvest. About 7 miles on new roads and 5
miles of reconstructed roads are needed. Post treatment may include about 3,800 acres of under-burn,
site prep burn, broadcast burn, jackpot burn, and hand pile & burn.
Baxendale Fire Dept.is proposing to pour a concrete slab and construct a 3 bay fire station to store
firefighting equipment and to utilize existing underground tanks for the filling of fire engines during
suppression activities.
The purpose of the project is to maintain consistent quantity and quality of water within the municipal
watershed and improve conditions for public and firefighter safety across the landscape in the event of
a wildfire. Approximately 25,027 acres are proposed for treatment (24,020 on NFS Lands and 1,007 on
BLM Lands) which would include a combination of commercial harvest of trees, non-commercial
vegetation treatments and prescribed fire.
Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF. Purpose is to achieve Forest Plan Goals including Timber management,
Aquatic Improvement, Wildlife Habitat improvement. Proposed activities include timber salvage,
commercial thinning, sediment reduction, fish passage, road and trail decommissioning. Project
includes 2,038 acres of commercial harvest, 340 acres of commercial thinning and commercial harvest,
and 162 acres of commercial thinning.
It is reasonably foreseeable that the Divide Travel Plan area will see continued interest in mineral
activity, which will precipitate the submission of Plan of Operations proposals to the HNF, likely at
similar activity scales and rates experienced presently.

Wildlife Analysis Approach

The following table describes how each wildlife parameter is addressed. Some of the
parameters have been described in the main body of the in the Wildlife Report, while others
are either assumed to be unaffected by travel management or are assumed to be addressed
under other parameters. The table, below, provides the rationale for the level of analysis
applied to each wildlife parameter.

Table 7 - Wildlife Analysis Approach
Wildlife Parameter

Discussion: Rationale for Analysis

Habitat Components and Processes
Fragmentation
The Continental Divide region of the Helena NF is an inherently
fragmented landscape of alternating grasslands and forest with riparian
areas serving as focal habitats. These patterns are constantly shifting
as a result of natural processes and human enterprisies: natural
succession, fire, insect outbreaks, climate shifts, timber harvest,
livestock grazing, human settlement, water diversion and impoundment,
road building. Roads are one component that can fragment the
landscape for certain species and alter patterns of habitat use,
movement, and general behavior patterns for many others. The
character and intensity of road impacts will depend on the species in
question, the nature of local habitats, and the kinds of roads involved.
Roads generally have less of a fragmentation effect on species with
larger home ranges and more mobility. Diminutive species with small
home ranges and limited mobility generally are more susceptible to
fragmentation effects created by roads. Traffic volume on any segment
of the road system is key to its influence on habitat effectiveness. The
Wildlife Specialist Report addresses fragmentation and the potential
effects of proposed road closures
Habitat Loss
The presence of roads on the landscape amounts to a direct loss of
wildlife habitat. Although a majority of Forest roads are narrow (often
12 feet or less), and the sinuous strips of the ground they occupy
represent a relatively minor depletion of habitat, others are broad and
flanked by roadside environments in which original habitat is
substantially altered. Even where roads have been closed to all
motorized uses, functional habitat is usually slow to return, given the
hard-packed substrate and frequent use of roadbeds as travelways by
wildlife, livestock, and humans on foot.

Edge Effects

Roads also provide access for firewood gathering, which results in a
loss of habitat for species that use woody debris or snags for any
portion of their life cycle. Roads provide avenues for spread of exotic
species—most often noxious weeds—that may eventually result in loss
of productive habitat. These topics are discussed in the Wildlife
Specialist Report.
Roads produce edge effects. Edge effects may extend up to 200
meters into a forest for a major road with a broad, cleared corridor,
altering biological communities and ecological processes throughout
that zone. In other cases, primitive roads may be so enveloped by
surrounding forest or grassland that edge effects are virtually nonexistent. For more ample roadways in forest environments, edge zones
tend to be drier and less shady than interior forests and tend to favor
shade-intolerant plants. Edge-adapted species (including many

terrestrial game species) benefit from increases in edge whereas
species dependent on true interior habitat may be unable to maintain
their populations in landscapes where edge is abundant. The Wildlife
Specialist Report discusses edge effects in terms of current conditions
and the evolution of edges in road corridors closed to motorized uses.
Riparian habitats have been altered from historic conditions by mining,
livestock grazing, road construction, stream diversion, impoundment,
and decline of the beaver. These are habitats that, because of their
elevated levels of productivity and biotic diversity, tend to focus wildlife
activity regardless of surrounding habitat structure. Forested riparian
sites amidst surrounding grassland/shrubland supply cover and food for
a variety of resident species (as well as for migrating birds in the fall)
and they serve as movement corridors for forest species. Riparian
habitats are important also as reproductive areas for amphibians. Many
roads follow stream corridors, resulting in direct loss of habitat, stream
sedimentation, and displacement of wildlife species. As well, streams
are often desirable places to camp, leading to trampling of vegetation,
soil compaction, and disruption of local wildlife habitat use. The Wildlife
Specialist Report addresses effects on riparian habitats.
The Divide has always been an inherently fragmented landscape of
alternating grasslands, forests, and local riparian sites. Historically,
however, habitats were sufficiently linked by direct connection or
proximity that species specialized for one habitat or another (marten or
goshawks, for example) were able to move across the landscape.
Shifts in habitat patch size and connectivity were generated by fire,
insect outbreaks, and other natural phenomena. Since the 1860’s,
mining, roads, and other long-term human-generated features on the
landscape have created rigid movement barriers and impacted riparian
areas. These features have reduced the size of habitat patches in
which wildlife species are able to operate free from human interference
and thus have impeded the ability of a number of species to move
through the landscape. The role of roads and trails in this process is
analyzed in the Wildlife Specialist Report.
Until recently, large snags and logs have been relatively uncommon
over much of the Divide landscape because of the relatively
young/middle-aged forest structure (80-120 years old) produced by
th
th
widespread logging and fires in the late 19 and early 20 centuries.
Exceptions have been in pockets of advanced mature and old-growth
forest unaffected by historic fire and logging, a few drainagers subject to
winter kill in the late 1980’s (Jericho Mtn, upper Snowshoe Crk, upper
Telegraph Crk), and a couple relatively recent mid-sized fires (Breatrap,
MacDonald Pass). Numbers of snags and logs have now increased
dramatically across the Travel Plan Area as a result of the mountain
pine beetle epidemic. Most mortality is occurring in mature lodgeople
and ponderosa pine, but whitebark and limber pine are affected as well.
The Wildlife Specialist Report addresses this topic.
Noxious weeds impact wildlife by reducing habitat availability where the
weeds successfully outcompete native vegetation. The Noxious Weeds
Section in the EIS analyzes the effects of the various alternatives on
noxious weeds. Weeds are discussed in the Wildlife Specialist Report
only as they relate tangentially to other habitat components and
processes (elk winter range, ATV off-trail use, livestock grazing, etc.).
Several wildlife species utilize unique features such as cliffs, caves, and
talus slopes. These features are not analyzed as separate topics in the
Wildlife Specialist Report. Rather, they are discussed in accounts of
the species that use them [wolverine denning habitat, for example].

Migratory Birds

Appendix C. Wildlife Additions - 132

Environmental Impact Statement

Wildlife Parameter
Migratory Landbirds and
Shorebirds

Divide Travel Plan

Discussion: Rationale for Analysis
Forest Service management direction since 2000 has been to analyze
the role of individual resource management projects in protecting,
enhancing, or threatenening populations of migratory landbirds and
shorebirds and their habitats. Roads and motor trails can affect local
bird populations by altering suitable habitat in road and trail corridors
and by funneling human disturbance into sensitive habitat areas.
Rather than generalizing as to potential effects on migratory birds as a
single group or looking at several hundred individual species, a majority
of which are little affected by the Forest road and trail network,the
Wildlife Specialist Report focuses on 19 migratory bird species of
special concern (as designated by the USFWS and MFWP). The
analysis considers the likelihood of the species actually nesting in the
road or motor trail corridor and the degree to which vehicles and other
human activities in the corridor might affect the birds under each project
alternative. Data for species assessments has come from the scientific
literature supplemented by field observation in the Plan Area.

Big Game
Elk

The elk is a key species on the Helena NF—as an object of public
fascination and scrutiny and as a management indicator for other big
game species that depend on the same diverse habitat spectrum. Elk
make use of a variety of habitats and habitat components, and
volumnous research into their use of the landscape provides insights
into habitat used by numerous other species.
The Forest Plan identifies the components of elk habitat that need to be
addressed with regard to travel planning—namely, open road patterns
during the hunting season; hiding cover on summer range; thermal
cover, roads, and snowmobile routes on winter range. Thermal and
hiding cover are not key elements of this analysis, which focuses on the
influence of motorized routes. Elk are known to respond to road density
on summer range (not a Forest Plan standard) and to the distribution
pattern of open roads that provide hunter access in the fall (which is a
Forest Plan standard). These aspects are addressed by habitat
effectiveness and elk security area analyses. Elk and elk habitat are
dissected at length in the Wildlife Specialist Report, and this analysis is
carried forward into the EIS. Additional discussion applicable to elk can
be found throughout the Specialist Report, in particular, in sections on
Connectivity and Fragmentation and Key Local Areas.

Mule Deer

Elk population parameters are measured annually by MFWP via winter
range aerial cenuses, hunter check stations, hunter surveys, and a
variety of field studies.
The mule deer is an adaptable and resilient species. In recent decades
population numbers have moved up and down in roughly 20 year
cycles. Low points occurred in the 1970s and mid 1990s. As of 2014,
populations were once again in decline throughout much of Montana.
Nonetheless, mule deer remain widespread and common in the Divide
landscape and adjacent non-Forest lands. Because of shifting
abundances in the mule deer population, it behooves the Helena NF to
monitor and manage mule deer habitat with some attention to detail.
These efforts compliment population monitoring by MFWP.
Like elk, mule deer serve as a Forest Plan indicator for big game
habitat. Aside from this designation, however, the Forest Plan provides
little specific management direction for deer. The Plan assumes that
management for elk will take care of the needs of deer. While mule
deer exhibit behavior and habitat use patterns somewhat different from
those of elk, many key habitat components (productive foraging areas,
hiding cover, riparian sites, road density, human-free areas) are
important to both. Consequently, effects analyses for elk are assumed

Appendix C. Wildlife Additions - 133

Environmental Impact Statement

Wildlife Parameter

Moose

Divide Travel Plan

Discussion: Rationale for Analysis
to be valid for elucidating potential effects of Travel Plan alternatives on
mule deer as well. These analyses, along with additional discussion
relevant to mule deer, are presented in the Wildlife Specialist Report.
The Shiras moose is native to Montana, although it now appears to
th
inhabit many areas where it was not observed in the 19 century. As of
the 1990s moose had moved as far south as northern Utah and
Colorado. Lately, however, moose populations have been receding
noticeably in parts of Montana (and elsewhere across the country).
Moose are found throughout the Divide landscape, but they are
uncommon—a function of their solitary nature coupled with spotty
distribution of key habitat around which they focus their activity.
Although they move through nearly all types of mountainous habitats,
moose seek out productive riparian and subirrigated habitats as
foraging sites and spend a large portion of their time there. They will
feed on submerged aquatic plants and tall forbs in summer but, above
all, they are browsers on tall and mid-sized shrubs.

Bighorn Sheep

Whitetail Deer

Other Hunted and Trapped
Species

The Forest Plan addresses the importance of riparian shrub
communities to moose and directs that these habitats be monitored and
preserved. There are, however, no anticipated effects on the quantity
or diversity of browse available to moose as a result of actions
proposed by Travel Plan alternatives. Moose vary in their tolerance of
human activity associated with open roads: some give road corridors a
wide berth during daylight hours, while others seem little bothered by
them. Primary effects of travel management arise from (1) decrease in
habitat effectiveness for individuals averse to open roads and motor
trails and (2) susceptibility of other moose to poaching or accidental
shooting because of their tendency to select foraging sites without
regard to the presence of open roads. Discussion of site-specific
effects of travel routes on riparian habitat and vulnerability of elk to
hunting apply to moose as well.
Bighorn sheep are have not been identified as resident in the Divide
th
landscape since the early 20 century. The wild sheep, once common,
fell victim to early market and subsistence hunting and to disease
introduced with dometic sheep. MFWP currently has no plans for
reintroduction of bighorn sheep in this area. Consequently, they will not
be analyzed further for this project.
As with mule deer, white-tailed deer population numbers tend to cycle
periodically; and as with mule deer, their populations are currently in
decline in much of the state. A large percentage of whitetail habitat is at
lower elevation in riparian areas and valleylands, and thus these deer
are much less common on the National Forest than mule deer.
Analyses of Elk, Mule Deer, and Riparian Habitats serve as surrogates
for effects of travel management on whitetail deer.
Mountain lion and black bear hunting are unique enterprises, each of
which requires an individual approach different from what works for elk
and deer. But in the end, these species are affected by the Forest road
and trail network in much the same way as are elk—and the analysis of
roads for elk security applies to them as well. See also, the discussion
of grizzly bears, road density, and unroaded habitat enclaves.

For a discussion of the interrelationship of motor routes and trapping,
see the sections pertaining to forest carnivores—specifically, wolverine,
fisher, and marten.
Threatened, Endangered, and Proposed Species
Grizzly Bear
In 2002, the northern half of the Divide landscape (and the Travel Plan
Area) was classified as a “Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone”—a region
outside of the NCDE Recovery Zone in which grizzlies were known to
be consistently present. In 2013, the southern half of the landscape

Appendix C. Wildlife Additions - 134

Environmental Impact Statement

Discussion: Rationale for Analysis
was added to the Distribution Zone as well. The resident grizzly bear
population in the Distribution Zone appears to be very small, and the
bears are seldom observed.
The USFWS feels that the primary management elements with potential
to adversely impact grizzlies in the Distribution Zone are livestock
grazing, sanitation (trash, food storage), and human access
management (primarily roads and trails). Of these, access management
is directly relevant to travel planning.

Canada Lynx

Wolverine

Sensitive Species
Wolf

With regard to access management, the Helena NF gauges effects on
grizzly bears throughout this area according to the Interagency Grizzly
Bear Committee (IGBC) Guidelines (1986). We have used IGBC
“Management Situation 5” as the most appropriate guide and have
focused on the linkage zone function of the Divide landscape. To this
end, we have looked at open road densities and the size and
distribution of unroaded habitat refugia (areas larger than 2,500 acres
with all boundaries more than 0.3 miles from open roads or motor trails)
to estimate the relative impacts of alternatives.
Effects on lynx are assessed according to standards and guidelines in
the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (NRLMD) (2007)—
now a part of the Forest Plan. Of the 8 guidelines and standards that
deal with roads and motor trails, only two are relevant to Travel Plan
alternatives, since no new roads are proposed and the few new
authorized motor trails would follow existing motor routes. The
applicable guidelines address snowmobile routes and the potential for
creating access trails for lynx competitors through snow compaction.
The assessment thus concerns itself primarily with the mileage and
distribution of snowmobile routes under different alternatives and with
the potential for snowmobile play areas in lynx habitat. The NRLMD
does not address open road densities or the size and distribution of
unroaded habitat refugia in a quantitative manner with regard to lynx.
So while I have taken these factors into account, I have done so only by
refering to quantitative assessments in sections for Grizzly Bears, Elk,
and Connectivity.
Wolverines are known to occupy the Travel Plan Area—a conclusion
derived from (1) systematic tracking and DNA analysis over the last 5
years and (2) earlier observations and tracking surveys. In 2013, the
USFWS proposed listing the wolverine as a threatened species under
the Endangered Species Act. Rationale followed from the methodical
shrinking of snowpack in high elevation basins where wolverines
establish natal dens. Related to this, human access to these areas via
snowmobile and all-terrain vehicles in winter or early spring could
disturb dening female wolverines and young at these key sites. Roads
and trails (especially snowmobile trails) increase vulnerability of local
wolverine populations by reducing the scope of suitable habitat and
increasing the chance of negative encounters with humans. The size of
roadless refuges and the extent to which snowmobile routes probe into
potential wolverine natal denning areas are used to gauge impacts. The
analysis is presented in the main body of the Widlife Specialist Report.
Wolf packs have occupied the Divide landscape and areas adjacent to it
in the valleys and foothills since 1995: 5 packs were known to have
been present in this immediate area between 1995 and 2007. Since
then, several new packs have formed within reach of the Travel Plan
Area, but all have been removed or greatly reduced by USDA Wildlife
Services because of their propensity for preying on domestic livestock.
A number of wolves have been observed in or near the Plan Area in the
last couple years (2010-2014), but evidence of pack formation has been
inconclusive. The USFWS and MFWP have monitored all of the known

Discussion: Rationale for Analysis
Divide packs intensively, and the movements and actions of these
wolves have been well documented. Helena NF biologists have
monitored their presence on National Forest lands, particularly with
regard to their activity on grazing allotments.

Fisher

Black-backed Woodpecker

Western Boreal Toad

Peregrine Falcon

Bald Eagle

In this analysis, potential effects of travel planning on wolves are
assessed in terms of parameters outlined in the Wolf Recovery Plan
(1987) and the Montana Wolf Conservation and Management Plan
(2003): Road density, unroaded habitat blocks, and the potential for
human disturbance of denning and rendezvous sites.
Fisher are possibly present in the Plan Area—though in very low
numbers. Impacts are measured in terms of open road density in
modeled fisher habitat—both as an indicator of access available to
trappers on snowmobiles in winter and the area from which firewood
cutters can remove large snags (important habitat components for
fishers). The analysis is presented in the main body of the Widlife
Specialist Report.
There has been little habitat capable of sustaining local black-backed
woodpecker populations in the Divide landscape in the past century.
The last large fires that created an abundance of suitable dead-tree
th
th
habitat occurred in the late 19 and early 20 centuries. The
MacDonald Pass fire in 2009 and the Beartrap Gulch fire in the 1960’s
created a few hundred acres of local habitat, but these were isolated
events. Black-backed woodpeckers were reported in the MacDonald
Pass burn in 2010 and 2011. Ongoing bark beetle infestations are
creating an abundance of dead tree habitat across the landscape. While
this plethora of new snags is proving to be a boon for several
woodpecker species (hairy, downy, pileated; flickers) it does not appear
to be attracting black-backed woodpeckers as would fire-generated
snag arrays. Any effects of travel management will be indirect and
measured in terms of roadside corridor available to firewood cutters.
The analysis is in the main body of the Widlife Specialist Report.
Recreational impacts, including road and trail development and OHV
use, affect boreal toads to a degree. Certain roads serve as travel
impediments, and the toads are more susceptible to mortality from
vehicles than are most mammals and birds. While boreal toads range
through a variety of upland habitats, they concentrate around
riparian/aquatic breeding sites. Potential effects, therefore, are
assessed primarily in terms of road miles in Riparian Habitat
Conservation Areas (RHCAs). The analysis is found in the main body of
the Widlife Specialist Report.
Falcon eyries are located on high cliffs, often near water. Peregrine
th
falcons were extirpated from the Divide landscape in the mid 20
century, and no new occupied eyries have been located in the
landscape since the falcons have become re-established in and around
the Helena NF (almost entirely in the Big Belt Range) in the early
1990’s. No quantitative analysis is needed at this point.
No active bald eagle nests have been located on HNF lands in the
Divide landscape since the rejuvination of local eagle populations over
the last 3 decades. All known nests near the landscape are in the Little
Blackfoot drainage on private land to the west. Most resident eagles on
the Forest are located along the Missouri River in the Big Belt Range
and along the Big Blackfoot River. No quantitative analysis has been
done here.

Discussion: Rationale for Analysis
Flammulated owls utilize open park-like conifer forests, especially
ponderosa pine. They require an adequate forage base of large insects
and a large snag component. Potential habitat does exist in the Divide
landscape, and the birds are known to be present—primarily along the
Mount Helena Ridge outside the Travel Plan Area. Effects on these
owls are assessed in terms of the likelihood of snag removal along
roads by firewood cutters in modeled flammulated owl habitat. This
discussion is presented in the main body of the Widlife Report.
Key components for these bats are caves, mine openings, and a variety
of smaller rock cavities. There is a possibility that they are present in
the Divide landscape, but none have been found to date. The potential
for any of the proposed Travel Plan alternatives generating effects
relevant to big-eared bats is scant, and so they are not analyzed in the
Wildlife Specialist Report.
Leopard frogs have not been found in or near the Divide landscape
since the early 1990’s, and it is likely that they have been extirpated
from the area. The analysis of roads in riparian areas done for the
western toad will suffice to quantify any potential impacts on leopard
frogs, should they be present.
Harlequin ducks have never been identified on the Helena NF in the
Divide landscape, although they have been reported, rarely, in transit
further west on the lower Little Blackfoot River. No analysis was done
for harlequin ducks.
The northern bog lemming has not been identified in the Divide
landscape. Nor have we identified any blocks of suitable habitat
(sphagnum bogland) large enough to support them. Analyses
addressing riparian habitats and other riparian-dependent species will
suffice for this species.
The Columbian sharp-tailed grouse is not present in the Plan Area and
was not analyzed.
The pileated woodpecker is identified as an old growth-dependent MIS
in the Forest Plan. Throughout the Divide landscape, however, pileated
woodpeckers are usually found in non-old-growth habitat, with large
nesting trees (>30” dbh) being the key habitat component. Availability
of insect-prone feeding substrate (typically dead or dying trees) is also
important. Observation of pileated woodpeckers is usually fortuitous.
The location of observations (of the woodpeckers, by sight or sound,
and of their characteristic excavations in trees) are noted and mapped.
Observations of pileated woodpeckers are increasing in the Divide
landscape as dead trees produced by the mountain pine beetle
outbreak continue to proliferate. Pileated woodpecker habitat is
analyzed in the main body of the Wildlife Specialist Report.
The Forest Plan designates the goshawk as an indicator of old-growth
forest, although it is more often found in non-old-growth habitats on the
the Helena NF. Goshawks maintain large home ranges and make use
of a variety of habitats within them. They are most commonly
associated with mature forest, and they require closed-canopied mature
stands for nesting and successfully fledging young. There are a number
of known nest sites and territories within the Plan Area. Motorized and
non-motorized use can affect nesting goshawks if the activity is too
close to a nest site.
Known goshawk nesting teritories are monitored in the field each year,
and active nests are checked as many times as needed to determine
nesting success. New territories are monitored whenever they are
identified. Because goshawks move to new nest sites each year, we are
not able to locate all active nests in a given year, but the presence of
goshawks on a territory can usually be verified. The mountain pine

beetle outbreak has dramatically affected the configuration of goshawk
habitat within the Plan Area (and across the Forest as a whole). The
goshawk is analyzed in the main body of the Wildlife Specialist Report.
The hairy woodpecker is identified as a snag dependent MIS in the
Forest Plan. Hairy woodpeckers are relatively common throughout a
variety of habitats in the project area, and their numbers are increasing
noticeably in forest stands killed by the mountain pine beetles. They
are further analyzed in the main body of the Wildlife Specialist Report.
The marten is an indicator for the quality of large continuous blocks of
mature cover. Marten use mature/ old-growth spruce/fir and lodgepole
pine stands for denning. Stumps and downed logs are critical
components. Fragmentation of coniferous cover through historical and
recent logging and roading has reduced habitat suitability, and trapping
has reduced marten numbers directly. Ongoing bark beetle infestation
may have mixed implications for marten—increasing the availability of
large snags and logs but reducing the availability of mature forest
overstory. Effects of travel management on marten are analyzed in the
main text of the Wildlife Specialist Report. The primary habitat
parameter is the availability of mature forest with abundant coarse
woody debris. Field observation of marten comes from winter tracking
surveys, observation during general wildlife surveys, and annual survey
work by MFWP.
The hunted species group is summarized above under Big Game.
The listing and classification of this group has changed since its
designation in the Forest Plan in 1986. Most of the group has been
delisted and is now covered in the section on Sensitive Species (bald
eagle, peregrine falcon, wolf). One species (grizzly bear) remains listed
and is included in the section on Threatened and Endangered Species
above. The Canada lynx, which is now listed as a threatened species,
was not included in the original Forest Plan grouping.
Effects of recreation that are facilitated by road and trail use are
described in the Wildlife Specialist Report under the respective species
for which effects may be relevant.
Disruption and displacement associated with road and trail use are
described in the Wildlife Specialist Report under the respective species
for which effects may be present.
Direct mortality associated with roads is described in the Wildlife

Movement of Elk within Seasonal Home Ranges

The following table summarizes distances moved by elk within seasonal home ranges as reported in
a number of different field studies. The average of these distances provides a rough indication as
to how far elk anchored to National Forest land (for bedding sites, shelter, or escape cover) are
likely to move out beyond Forest boundaries during the course of normal daily foraging activity and
still be able to return to the Forest on a regular basis. This, in turn, provides rationale for
delineating the bounds of National Forest elk herd units off the Forest. Off-Forest use on this order
applies primarily to elk on winter range, when they are most likely to be centering activity in low
elevation foothills and valleys.

Population Viability Assessment
The status of wildlife populations (as we currently understand their distribution on the Helena
National Forest) and wildlife habitats are examined in this section in order to address Forest Plan
and Agency requirements that: (1) “viable populations of existing native and desirable non-native
plant and animal species are maintained” (Forest Plan II/17) and (2) management activities do not
cause a trend towards ESA listing for species that have been identified as sensitive by the Forest
Service in in USFS Region 1.

Summary of Population Viability Status
Forest Service Region 1 defines a viable species as “consisting of self-sustaining populations that are
well distributed throughout the species range.” Self-sustaining populations are “sufficiently large,
and have sufficient genetic diversity to display the array of life history strategies and forms that will
provide for their persistence and adaptability in the planning area over time” (Samson 2006).
Table 10 summarizes the type of data available for each MIS and sensitive species known to be
regularly present or, in the case of the fisher, potentially present in the Divide Travel Plan Area.
Discussion of other sensitive species not included in the following table can be found in the main
body of the Wildlife Specialist Report and Biological Evaluation.

“•” indicates which sources of information were used for each species determination.

Viability ratings for elk and mule deer are based on annual tallies of individuals in the field, usually
by MDFWP. Extensive data on suitable habitat is also available for elk and mule deer, through
Forest-wide habitat modeling and systematic field surveys. Ratings for goshawk and hairy
woodpecker are based on wide-ranging, but less complete, population surveys in the field. This
information is sufficient to indicate the general magnitude and distribution of populations in the
project area and throughout the Forest Plan area. Availability of suitable habitat has been
estimated through Forest-wide habitat models, systematic habitat surveys, or both.

Appendix C. Wildlife Additions - 143

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Ratings for marten and pileated woodpecker are more problematic. Population information comes
primarily through tallies and mapping of fortuitous and, occasionally, targeted field observations.
This demonstrates that the species continue to inhabit the planning area, if not the project area,
and it provides a rough indication of how they are distributed. But it is a crude estimator of
viability. On the other hand, Forest-wide habitat models and general field surveys provide a basis
for assessing habitat sufficiency.
Based on discussion in the Northern Region Viability Protocol (Samson 1997), a review of the
Northern Region Viability Committee Report (Samson 1997), and Habitat Estimates for Maintaining
Viable Populations (Samson 2006), the following qualitative rating system was applied to
populations and habitats of management indicator and sensitive species as a means of assessing
population viability (Table 11).

The ratings in Table 12, which follows, apply to potential habitat for the Helena NF as a whole. In
many cases, the Divide Travel Plan Area contributes to maintaining viability of these populations
but is not sufficient in and of itself to encompass or support a self-contained viable population or
subpopulation. This conclusion comes from research reported in the scientific literature and field
observations as to how population size and structure of different species in the Plan Area fit the
estimates of what is needed for the species to maintain viability. Given the lack of quantitative
data, it is not possible to define a precise timeframe for probability of persistence. But, in general,
it is intended to apply to the long term: the probability that the population would persist for 50 to
100 years within the Helena National Forest Plan Area (Samson 1997).

5

Elk populations on the Helena NF are robust.
Habitat is ubiquitous. These conclusions follow from
detailed annual population monitoring by MFWP and
extensive habitat surveys by the Helena NF. Local
barriers to elk movement are common, but no
substantial blocks of elk habitat are isolated. In spite
of local habitat problems, elevated predation in
some areas, and persistent hunting pressure in
others, long-term viability of elk populations is not a
concern.

5

Mule deer are widely distributed across the Helena
NF and surrounding areas. Habitat is ubiquitous.
Local impediments to free movement are common,
but no substantial blocks of mule deer habitat are
isolated. Mule deer often move easily through and
inhabit areas of human settlement. Deer
populations have cycled up and down over 10-20
year periods for a variety of reasons, but they have
never declined to a point where population viability
has been at risk. In spite of local habitat problems,
predation, and hunting pressure, long-term viability
of mule deer populations is not a concern.

4

Primary marten habitat with mature trees and
abundant coarse woody debris is patchy but widely
distributed in the Travel Plan Area and across the
Helena NF. Habitat is most abundant on the Lincoln
RD. It is increasing as forests age in areas not
affected by mountain pine beetle (mature Douglasfir, subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce forest). Primary
habitat is interconnected by forested travel habitat.
Impact of the beetle outbreak is uncertain, as it
subtracts mature forest canopy but increases coarse
woody debris. Marten are widely distributed, but
numbers are unknown. Prospects for long-term
viability are good, as long as trapping pressure does
not substantially exceed present levels.

4

Mountain pine beetle is reducing habitat—
particularly nesting sites—over extensive areas
across the Helena NF. Field surveys indicate that
goshawks remain widespread; though nesting
success may have decreased. Goshawks are
capable of nesting in a variety of mature forest
configurations and are adapting to changing forest
conditions. Enough suitable nesting habitat will
remain to support viable populations; but reduction
and fragmentation of habitat may lower population in
the mid-term. As mature forest habitats regenerate,
goshawk populations will return to previous levels.

2

Pileated woodpeckers are uncommon but
persistently present in the Divide landscape. Field
observation suggests that they have increased with
the pine beetle infestation. The presence of large
nesting/roosting trees is the key to their persistence.
This habitat component while not overly abundant is
common enough across the Forest to ensure the
long term viability of pileated woodpeckers.

Hairy woodpeckers are common and well distributed
in all forest habitats with insect-supporting trees and
cavity potential on the Helena NF. Populations have
increased with the pine beetle outbreak. Potential
for suitable habitat persistence and woodpecker
population viability over the long term is excellent.

3

Black-backed woodpeckers occur across the Forest
in burned areas. Potential for suitable habitat over
the long term is dependent upon fire frequency and
intensity and the retention of standing dead trees for
5-7 years after the fire. These woodpeckers do not
appear to be making use of the proliferating beetlekilled forests. Though local populations fluctuate
dramatically over time, the inevitability of future fires
ensures long-term viability throughout the region.

3

Flammulated owls are present across the Helena NF
in low numbers, mostly in mature ponderosa pine
and Douglas-fir stands. Suitable habitat is localized
and patchy, but widespread. Habitat in the Plan
Area has declined over the last century from timber
harvest of large trees, suppression of low-intensity
understory fires, and, most recently, mountain pine
beetle mortality in ponderosa pine stands. Sufficient
habitat will remain to sustain a small but viable
Forest-wide population.

4

Boreal toads require aquatic/wetland habitat for
breeding—sites that are inherently fragmented on
the landscape. Adults range widely through upland
habitats, allowing interaction between population
subgroups. While populations have declined from
historic levels, local populations in the Divide
landscape have proven persistent. They have not
succumbed to chytrid fungus or other maladies that
have decimated other amphibians. Retention of
healthy aquatic breeding habitat is the key to
viability.

4

The wolverine population on the Helena NF is small
but persistent, with the animals ranging through a
wide variety of habitats in all 4 Forest landscapes. A
small number of wolverines have been documented
in the Divide landscape over the past few years.
Habitat changes wrought by mountain pine beetles,
fire, and forest management are unlikely to suppress
the ability of wolverines to persist across the Forest.
Travel planning over 2 decades has increased the
acreage of non-motorized habitat available to
wolverines. Primary limiting factors are trapping
mortality and loss of high elevation, snowbound
denning habitat due to global warming. At present,
such factors on the Helena NF are insufficient to
threaten the region-wide viability of wolverines.

The Divide landscape lies on the fringe of historic
fisher range. Primary habitat is limited and patchy,
concentrated primarily in mature riparian spruce-fir
forests, habitats mostly unaffected by the pine beetle
outbreak. Primary habitats are interconnected by
forested travel habitat, although much of this is
beetle-impacted forest. Fishers are rare in the Divide
Travel Plan area; but the adjacent Lincoln RD
supports more suitable habitat and what appears to
be a viable subpopulation of fishers. The population
will continue to be focused in and to persist in this
part of the Helena NF.

4

The wolf population in and around different parts of
the Helena NF is variable and always in a state of
flux. Wolves are not habitat-limited. They are highly
opportunistic and can rapidly build local populations.
They are now limited almost entirely by humaninduced mortality in the form of legal hunting,
trapping, and predator control operations, as well as
by unauthorized shooting and a variety of accidents.
Wolf populations in the Blackfoot landscape (Lincoln
RD) are particularly robust, and in combination with
those of other predators, have suppressed big game
populations in that area. Wolves regularly move
through the Divide landscape, but persistence of
packs has been limited by their focus on private
ranchland where they are vulnerable to control
actions. Long-term viability is almost entirely a
function of the pattern of human-caused mortality,
much of which can be readily manipulated.

Samson (2005; 2006), in A Conservation Assessment of the Northern Goshawk, Black-backed
Woodpecker, Flammulated Owl, and Pileated Woodpecker in the Northern Region and USDA Forest
Service Habitat Estimates For Maintaining Viable Populations of the Northern Goshawk, Blackbacked Woodpecker, Flammulated Owl, Pileated Woodpecker, American Marten, and Fisher
(Samson 2005; Samson 2006) summarizes the status of viability for goshawks, black-backed
woodpeckers, flammulated owls, pileated woodpeckers, and marten.
The five species considered in this analysis are ‘secure’ or ‘apparently secure’ in terms of persistence
(NatureServe 2011).
Below (and not above) a threshold of 20 to 30 percent of habitat amounts, effects of fragmentation (i.e.,
patch size and isolation) are suggested to have a negative impact on species persistence. Effects of
habitat fragmentation on birds are described to be less in the western United States in comparison to
those reported in seminal and numerous studies in the Midwest and east.
No indication exists that forested ecosystems in the Northern Region have reached the 20 to 30 percent
threshold of historic. Forested systems in the Northern Region are more extensive than in historic
(approximately 1800) times (Hessburg and Agee 2003; Hessburg et al. 2005).
Comparison of habitat required for a species-specific minimum viable population to that available
indicates well-distributed habitat in far excess to that needed, given the natural distribution of species
and their habitats as mapped by the Montana Natural Heritage Program, Idaho Birdnet, and the scientific
literature.
Regionwide habitat modeling for the marten is restricted by the unavailability of sample-based
information on coarse woody debris and the variability evident in marten habitat use. Site-specific

models for marten may need to be adjusted to include resting site and nest site information (based on
point observation data) which may or may not influence habitat amount estimates.

Habitat Analysis and Conclusions

Samson (2006) (updated USDA 2008) identifies critical thresholds needed to maintain population
viability for selected species within the Northern Region of the Forest Service. Estimates derived
from the Helena National Forest Intensified Grid Summary Database (June 2013) indicate that
habitat for these selected species exceeds the critical thresholds identified by Samson. The models
used to generate estimates are based on Samson (2005, 2006) and USDA (2008).

This table gives a sense of the factors important to maintaining viability some of the MIS and
sensitive species in the Divide landscape that are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss. At present,
the primary factor influencing the viability and quality of habitat for these species is the mountain
pine beetle outbreak, which has killed lodgepole and ponderosa pine trees over hundreds of
thousands of acres on the Forest. Long-term population viability for these species will be
determined by their ability to adapt to the new habitat configurations and to maintain a persistent,
if somewhat modest presence, in Helena NF landscapes until forests recover their former structure.
Divide Travel Plan alternatives will influence viability of these and most other species listed in Table
13 only in a minimal and peripheral way.
Viability for wolverine, elk and mule deer, hairy woodpeckers, Townsend’s big-eared bats, boreal
toads, and wolves also appears sound although critical thresholds have not been identified. Elk and
mule deer habitat is abundant and well-distributed across the Forest and viability is largely
determined through hunting quotas, which are outside the scope of this project. Except for some
specific denning-related requirements, wolves and wolverines are opportunistic and habitat
generalists, and are little affected by beetle generated changes. Shifts in motorized access under
different Travel Plan alternatives may influence habitat use patterns and vulnerability to human
presence in different parts of the landscape. But most changes under action alternatives would
reduce the potential for human interference and none would be substantial enough to influence
population viability.
4

Samson (2006) critical habitat thresholds for goshawks and pileated woodpeckers does not distinguish between
nesting or foraging habitat but rather provides total habitat estimates based on the respective species’ needs at the
home range scale which includes both nesting and foraging habitat.
5
Estimates of black-backed woodpecker habitat are based on the 2009 condition survey reports from aerial insect
survey data for mountain pine beetle (Gibson 2009). There are approximately 585,557 acres infested by mountain
pine beetle in 2009 on the Helena National Forest. As of 2010, mountain pine beetle infestations in the project
area are slightly down from 2009, indicating that the outbreak has likely reached its peak. Estimates also include
acres burned by wildfires on the Helena National Forest between 2001 and 2010; this is approximately 130,459
acres. Samson’s (2006) habitat estimates include both insect and fire-created habitats. There figures most likely
underestimate the available habitat as described by Samson (2006) since additional wildfires have occurred since
2010 as well as increased tree mortality associated with the mountain pine beetle.

Appendix C. Wildlife Additions - 148

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Hairy woodpeckers use burned areas such as those required by black-backed woodpeckers, but
they also inhabit a wide variety of other environments with dead, dying, or other insect-prone
trees. Given the widespread availability of foraging and nesting substrate generated by the
mountain pine beetle outbreak, habitat for hairy woodpeckers will be overly abundant across the
forest for several years and populations have increased accordingly. The woodpeckers would not
be measurably affected by travel management. See the Wildlife Specialist Report and Biological
Evaluation for a more in-depth discussion on the species that may occur in the Plan Area.

Biological Evaluation Summary
Biological Evaluations are documented Forest Service reviews of the potential effects of proposed
actions on threatened, endangered, and sensitive (TES) species (FSM Ch. 2670, Amend. 2600-20051). These species groups are designated and managed under two different authorities.
“Threatened” and “endangered” species (as well as those “proposed” as such) are listed under the
Endangered Species Act (1973) and are overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).
“Sensitive” species are a matter of Forest Service policy: They are designated by Regional Foresters
based on population viability concerns—which may be evidenced by significant downward trends in
population numbers, population density, or habitat capability (FSM Ch. 2670, Amend. 2600-2005-1,
p. 12).
The biological evaluation of terrestrial wildlife species for the Red Mountain Flume Chessman
Reservoir project occurs piecemeal throughout the body of this report wherever the different
species of concern are addressed. These include two threatened species (lynx and grizzly bear),
one proposed species (wolverine), and 13 sensitive species. Table 14, below, summarizes the key
aspects of the evaluation.

Species

Category

Status

listed
threatened

A small number of grizzlies range through and inhabit the Divide landscape.
Observations of bears and encounters between bears and humans are
uncommon. Enough back-country, non-motorized habitat is available to
support a small sub-population of bears over the long term. All action
alternatives would increase non-motorized habitat to one degree or another.

listed
threatened

Lynx are known to be resident in the Divide landscape—having been
systematically tracked both north and south of Highway 12. Numbers are
very low and, to date, no evidence of breeding has been noted. The bulk of
the foraging habitat used by these animals has been in early seral conifer
stands rather than in older multi-storied forest. Travel Plan alternatives
would have no effect on lynx foraging or denning opportunity. All action
alternatives would increase the acreage of non-motorized habitat—reducing
potential for encountering humans and access for trappers.

sensitive

Wolverines are known to inhabit the project area in very low numbers. They
range widely through a variety of habitats. In winter they often frequent the
same mix of early seral and mature forest as lynx. No active natal denning
sites have been identified and no breeding noted. All action alternatives
would reduce the potential for encounters with humans to one degree or
another. None would affect potential natal denning areas.

Gray Wolf

sensitive

Wolves pass through the Divide landscape regularly. Since 1995, several
packs have been active in and around the landscape, most having reduced
or removed after preying on local livestock. Currently no packs are known
to be active in the landscape. Travel Plan action alternatives would reduce
potential for negative encounters with humans to varying degrees.

Fisher

sensitive

Fishers have been reported in the Divide landscape only on rare occasions,
and only one report has been verified in the last 20 years. Key habitat is
limited and patchy. None of the Travel Plan alternatives would affect it.

Townsend’s Bigeared Bat

sensitive

Big-eared bats have not been identified in the Divide landscape. Travel Plan
alternatives would have no effect on key habitat components for these bats
or on the bats themselves should they be present.

Status

sensitive

Northern bog lemmings have not been identified in the Divide landscape.
Primary habitat (sphagnum bog mat) is rare and highly fragmented. Travel
Plan alternatives would have no effect on it.

sensitive

Bighorn sheep are not present in the Divide landscape. Potential habitat is
somewhat fragmented, but sufficient to support a small population should
the sheep be reintroduced or migrate in naturally in the future. Travel Plan
action alternatives would do nothing to erode this potential.

sensitive

Black-backed woodpeckers focus on aggregations of fire-killed trees. They
have not been identified in stands impacted by mountain pine beetle, such
as those that now dominate broad areas of the landscape. Travel
management as proposed in action alternatives would have no direct or
indirect effects on these woodpeckers.

Flammulated Owl

sensitive

Flammulated owls nest and forage in open-grown stands of large ponderosa
pine. Some of these stands have been impacted by the pine beetle
outbreak, but none of them would be directly affected by Travel Plan
alternatives. Given the rarity of suitable flam habitat in the road corridors,
any indirect effects from roadside firewood cutting would be minor.

Peregrine Falcon

sensitive

Peregrine falcons have never been documented nesting in the Divide
landscape. Travel management proposals would have no effect on ther
ability to do so in the future..

Bald Eagle

sensitive

Bald eagles fly over and occasionally stop off in the Divide landscape—
perching in large trees, most often near aquatic habitats. No nests have
been identified. Travel Plan alternatives would have no effect on bald
eagles or their key habitat components.

Harlequin Duck

sensitive

Harlequin ducks have never been identified in the divide landscape.
Marginal habitat exists in parts of the upper Little Blackfoot but, so far, it has
been unoccupied. Travel Plan alternatives would have no effect on it.

Boreal Toad

sensitive

Boreal toads breed in aquatic habitats across the landscape. Adults range
widely through the uplands. Although populations have declined from
historic levels, they seem to be holding up well in this area. Travel Plan
action alternatives would reduce road mileage in riparian habitat
conservation areas and reduce motorized stream crossings. This should be
of benefit to the toads, although the result would not be substantial enough
to measurably improve population viability.

Leopard Frog

sensitive

Leopard frogs have not been identified in the Divide landscape in nearly 25
years and it is highly unlikely that they are still present. Travel Plan action
alternatives would reduce road mileage in key aquatic and riparian habitat.

Plains Spadefoot
Toad

sensitive

On the Helena NF, the plains spadefoot has identified only in a small pocket
of the northern Big Belt Range. Given their habitat preferences, it is highly
unlikely that they are present anywhere in the Divide landscape.

Northern Bog
Lemming

Bighorn Sheep

Black-backed
Woodpecker

Table 15, following, presents the determination of “effects” (for T&E species) and “impacts” (for
sensitive species). For most species, the various Travel Plan alternatives would have no measurable
effect or impact, either because the species are basically not influenced by roads or motor trails or
because they are not present in the Travel Plan Area (or present so fleetingly that any effects would
be imperceptible). For 5 species, an “effect” or an “impact” is expected—although in all cases
these influences are relatively small and would not measurably alter population viability, for better
or worse. In a majority of cases, the overall effects of the action alternatives, all of which whittle
down the current road and trail system, would be beneficial.

Hello,
I very much enjoy using the Helena National Forest. I'm primarily a Summer guest,
but who knows, someday I may want to use the Forest for snowmobiling or
whatever motorized use is still legal at that time. I'm also a taxpaying Montana
native, a member of the Blue Ribbon Coalition and I own numerous motorized
vehicles that I have paid all the fees and taxes that have been asked of me, in
return for legal access to my public lands. I very much consider myself an
environmentalist, and I do not consider my motorized use an environmental
hazard.
It almost goes without saying really.. I consider it my right to enjoy this land.
Additionally, the presence of motorized users is a service to the others who own or
manage the land as well, because we are usually the first ones on these trails in the
opening days of Spring and we clear them for all users after us. Not to mention that
when someone becomes lost or injured, -including reporting injured cattle and
wildlife, and fires-, it is the ATV/motorized users who come to the rescue or make

first reports on something gone wrong in the forest...

Response to Comments

I also consider us 'the police' out there; simply by being The Ones out in these
remote areas, I/we are able to observe and basically 'police' these remote areas
that almost never are patrolled by any 'Officials'. There is no way all this land in
Montana and inside the Divide Travel Plan Boundary can be patrolled to the
satisfaction of those who demand even more limits on motorized access. I myself
am out there every Summer, all Summer long, -all over this Divide Travel Plan area,
(and further), for over 10 years...- and I/we have never seen so much as one Forest
Ranger/Officer on these roads or trails inside the Divide Travel Plan! This is not an
exaggeration either.
That leaves us to believe the Forest knows that they don't need to be more present
out there because there's almost no environmental damage or crime happening
out there that is associated with motorized users. There is far more environmental
damage caused by mining, cattle and equestrian uses; for example, survey the
condition of a trail after 4-6 horses go through, and look at the same trail after 4-6
ATVs/dirtbikes go through and you will see who causes erosion on trails. Horses
and Cattle are terrible hazards to land and water! Motorized users find it quite
ironic, and maddening, that the FS, et.al. seem to support these uses, while at the
same time asking motorized users to use less and less of the public land. Generally,
we abide by the date restrictions on certain trails because we don't want to do
damage to OUR trails.

(5-1) Thank you for your comment.

I/we rarely even see another person or vehicle, who is not a rancher moving their
cattle, in the Helena National Forest either, and this is even on weekends. And that
includes other motorized users...and deer, elk, bears, cougars, and hikers are very
few and far in between as well..... The proposed roads and trails -including the
'user made' ones that we have now in the Divide Plan are not getting overused nor
abused. There is very little use..-by ANYONE- .. It would truly be a poor investment

as well as inappropriate management- to put more time and money in limiting
access that does not require limits. In fact, based on the points I raised, I would ask
that even more motorized access was permitted: (5-1)
-Trails that are through-routes, as opposed to dead-ends that need to be re-used in
order to get back, need to be found and allowed for motorized users. One of those
being the minor creek crossing at Mary Ann Creek. That is an important ATV
connection route that basically connects Rimini to Elliston. (5-2a)
-Another road I see is closed yearlong in the Alternative 1 (No Action), but needs to
be open at least from June15-Oct15 is 227C, which connects Kading Road to the
ridge above, without causing ATV traffic on the paved Kading rd (227). (5-2b)
-Another system of interest is up Clark Canyon (4005- 05) (unauthorized
roads)..Most of these are well established roads, not made by 'users' but instead
made many years ago by road building equipment.. I would like to see these be
open yearlong, as they are already well established and are not an environmentally
risky type of terrain (no swamps or water crossings, etc.).(5-2c)
- Due to the now very limited availability to motorized travel in the upper Little
Blackfoot area, a through-type ATV route that goes from Kading Campground to
Cliff Mountain and back around would spread out use and provide some access for
motorized users. This does not appear to be an environmentally sensitive area, its
well outside the Spotted Dog WMA, and the Forest is already allowing some
motorized use in the Kading Grade. I understand this area is being considered for
other uses and I would like to put a word in for motorized users to have authorized
access to this area. It does get some ATV use now and has for decades. It would be
nice to have an authorized route provided, to minimize rogue routes in a couple
undefined areas. In addition, a THROUGH ROUTE back to Kading would be ideal to
minimize wear on the trail system. Trail 329 (Blackfoot Meadows), would be ideal
to complete a through-route for motorized users. "Multi-use" and even "one-way
only" travel for 'Cliff Mountain Loop' motorists restrictions could be implemented ,
in the same way it works well in the L&C National Forest in the Little Belts. This is
fair use for all, and I would ask that the Forest consider employing this more often

-And finally, a short 'wish list' of roads and trails I would like to use if they were
open(again):
+ 1811,off 136 Rd.
+ 136-007
+ 708-A1--to connect Snowshoe Cr. Rd. to Ophir Cr. Rd.
+708-G1(5-2e)
Needless to say, I support Alternative 1(No Action), along with NEW ADDITIONS to
the motorized trails in the Helena National Forest. I think we should make
motorized travel in the HNF equally supported as equestrians, hikers and mountain
bikers. Please consider my comments and keep HNF OPEN to motorized uses.

Good morning,
I am against any further restrictions in the Helena National forest or any other for
that matter. I have lived in Montana all my 61 plus years and have been thru road
closures before. Is it the ultimate goal of this agency to view our property from the
highway? The land in your trust isn’t logged, access is already limited and the
liberal groups(that get grant monies from the feds sue, to stop every
project)dictate the direction the Forest Service is headed. There are more elk now
than their have been in the last 50 years in fact in a lot of areas the populations are
so high they cause damage to the very forests you claim to protect. Road closures
will increase pressure on other areas that remain open causing problems in those
areas just like the last time road closures were implemented. I don’t even know
why you have comment periods your mind is already made up, this pretty much in
a nut shell is why a vast majority of people in the USA do not trust the federal
government. The land belongs to the public and we should have access to the land

I am a resident of Elliston Mt. I am very much against road or trail closure on the
divide trail plan!
I have lived in Montana all my life and believe that the huge amount of road
closures, newly designated wilderness areas in recent years are pushed through by
non-residents. You are also closing more areas in the Lincoln area! No
consideration is ever seriously given for older or disabled residents.
I can assure you that most everyone I know in this area do not trust your studies
justifying closures. We have been lied to many times. Most locals do not express
their feelings because we feel you are going to do what you want regardless.

Re: Sweeny Creek and Divide Travel Plan Comments for the project record
Dear Sir/Madam,
The CTVA Sweeny Creek Work Group has met and developed the following
recommendations and proposals for the Sweeny Creek project area:
I. Our club is willing to volunteer effort to improve and maintain the Sweeny Creek
area and also collaborative efforts with other groups that wish to cooperate. (10-1)
2. Move parking lot up the road and combine with snowmobile parking. Add OHV
route from parking lot to lead into riding area. Kiosk for both summer and winter
travel plan.(10-2a)
3. 10 p.m. closure for Sweeny Creek area to eliminate night time partying and
allow law enforcement to patrol the area and enforce. (10-2b)
4. Designated camping area on USFS near fence line on route off Baxendale Road
in Section 23. (10-2c)
5. Retain existing and historic routes as identified on the attached CTVA Sweeny
Creek Alternative map. (10-3)
6. Route closure and loss due to lack of maintenance by the Forest Service is not

(10-2a) Collocation of the parking lots was considered however
several other resource issues remain in the Sweeny Creek area.
(10-2b) Day use only is a management tool that can be
considered, when other means to address resource damage and
safety concerns occurring, aren’t successful.
(10-2c) There is no access across private connecting Sweeny
Creek to Baxendale road.

Plan area owes much of its existence to the early cultural history

acceptable being that there is no travel plan in effect. Maintenance can and will be
addressed using grants and volunteer efforts.
7. We would like to adopt as a project the reopening of the route by the cabin in
the far eastern quadrant and the addition of an extension of the northwest route
to connect to the Priest Pass road. These projects will be addressed using grants
and volunteer effort.
8. We are open to relocating the most southern route that transverses the
seasonal riparian area for more sustainable routes. (10-4)
9. We recommend researching and identifying all historical sites such as but not
limited to; quarries, mines, homesteads, cabins, and timber operations to preserve
access to these historic features. Very little of this type of sites have been
preserved in the Helena National Forest. EPA work and time has removed many of
them. The legacy of the pioneers, early settlers, and miners are being removed
from the landscape. (10-5) We recommend that interpretative facilities be
provided for future generations by construction a kiosk at parking lots and
installing trail direction/mileage and destination signs. (10-6)
10. We are extremely concerned that the claimed benefits to the natural
environmental are not all that real and come at a significant cost to the human
environment which are very real.

of this region. Upon its formation, the Forest Service simply
preempted existing historic travel routes- parts of which had
antecedents in American Indian trails. By this process, a variety
of historic cultural resources (i.e. mines, homesteads, timber
camps, trapper cabins, log flumes) to which these roads were
intimately connected also came into federal ownership at the
turn of the 20th Century. In addition the Helena Ranger District
has a recreational and administrative travel system which
includes trails and roads that are considered cultural resources
and/or potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. The 1939 Helena National Forest Visitor Map is
the map we currently use to determine the baseline age of trails
and roads across the forest. The “existing and historic routes”
on your attached CTVA Sweeny Creek Alternative map do not
appear on the 1939, 1959 or 1969 Helena National Forest Visitor
map; therefore we do not consider them historic routes or
cultural resource

The CTVA Sweeny Creek Work Group recommends the following points be
adequately incorporated in the Divide Travel Plan:
1. We encourage collaborative efforts that will produce use for historical,
traditional, and environmental use for elderly, handicapped and disabled persons
and veterans including persons with age related physical limitations.
2. We are motorized multiple-use recreationists that acquire/provide funding and
provide volunteers to build and maintain motorized routes.
3. Routes that can be reasonably evaluated for closure are parallel, have unsafe
and/or non removable obstacles, or those that are high maintenance and/or are
erosion prone (10-7).

(10-5) The Helena National Forest currently manages 945 known
cultural resources, of those, 238 cultural resources represents
quarries, mines, homesteads, etc. The Helena National Forest
also has 14 Historic Mining District that cover large landscape
which include multiply associated features, such as building
ruins, adits, shafts, ditches, roads, and trash piles. Of those 945
cultural resources, 7 sites are listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (3 of them are on the Helena Ranger District),
839 sites have not received eligibility determination, therefor
they are treated as Eligible. Forty-eight sites have been

4. Route closure/loss due to lack of maintenance by the Forest Service is not
acceptable in that there is no travel plan in effect. These can and will be addressed
in grants and volunteer efforts. We have a strong track record with both.
5. OHV visitors carry shovels and chainsaws and will help to maintain the trails and
keep them open from beetle-killed downfall. If motorized recreationists are
removed, then the closed motorized routes will eventually be lost to everyone
because motorized recreationists are the only one to carry and use chainsaws. We
invest a lot of our time with the clearing of beetle killed trees. (10-8)
6. Motorized route closures due to sign damage/theft, garbage, damage to riparian
areas is not an acceptable or justifiable cause. These can and will be addressed in
grants and our volunteer efforts. Motorized users cannot justifiably be singled out
as the sole culprits.
7. In all travel plans; routes should include turn outs for safe passage and vista turn
outs for scenic viewing and rest areas. (10-9)
8. Collaborative efforts should be used to research, identify, and preserve history.
9. All aspects of prior history, mining, timber and traditional routes should be
developed, studied and preserved for future generations for historic knowledge.
These must be done prior to travel decisions or the selected alternative must use
the map with our proposal because it accomplishes the same as the
aforementioned. (10-10)
10. Route closures cause loss of all prior history use. The Continental Divide Trail is
an interactive part of history that must be inclusive in all trail decisions to preserve,
protect and to mitigate further loss. Visual or other loss by non-use due to route
closure is not acceptable. (10-11)
11. OHVs are growing in popularity (see registration trends). Additional routes are
needed to address future motorized growth. (10-12)
We would be happy to further explain our proposal and to meet with you to work
out details.

determined Eligible for listing, but have not been formally listed
and 51 sites have been determine Not Eligible for listing in the
National Register.
A total of 181 cultural resources are identified within or
adjacent to roads and trails in the Divide Travel Plan area. These
cultural resources were discovered and documented as a result
of prior cultural resource reconnaissance and project inventory
in the travel plan area.. On-the-ground inventory of each road
and trail affected by the proposed Divide Travel Plan has not
been undertaken because the Forest Service is considering only
whether a road or trail will remain open or closed in this land
use decision. Specific road closure methods, and their effects,
will be the subject of separate environmental analyses. NHPA
Section 106 compliance survey will be completed then, as
necessary, for roads and trails proposed for obliteration. The
proposed motorized route closures would be beneficial to
cultural resources by preventing easy vehicle access to sensitive
cultural resources which helps to abate vandalism and artifact
theft. For example, historic mining buildings accessible by
motorized routes located in the planning area have been
dismantled to obtain antique wood for various decorative uses
such as in home remodeling and picture frames. Mining
equipment, such as ore carts and old equipment parts, have
found new homes as lawn and landscaping ornaments.
Prehistoric and historic properties are a non-renewable
resource. They represent a resource base that cannot be
replenished. For this reason several federal laws and
regulations have been established that require federal agencies
to identify, monitor, protect, and preserve cultural resources

process, all undertakings would be identified and addressed,
and any necessary mitigation measures incorporated into the
project design or other appropriate heritage resources
agreement. The goal is to avoid, minimize, or mitigate impacts
to significant cultural properties.
Since the late 1970s, cultural resource inventories have
preceded all ground-disturbing Forest Service projects on the
Helena National Forest, including vegetation treatments,
livestock grazing, restoration, and recreation development. The
majority of the cultural resources described in this travel plan
analysis were discovered as a result of these compliance
inventories. In fact, many archaeological sites were found
because they were exposed in old road and trail beds. In most
cases, project boundaries and treatments would be
reconfigured to avoid impacting significant cultural resources so
they could be preserved and the effect of these actions on
cultural resources would be relatively minor.
All forest actions require NHPA compliance and consultation
therefore the effects on cultural resources would be mitigated
through project redesign and/or avoidance. Roads and trails
have been constructed through archaeological and historic sites
over a period of many years. Regardless of alternative, road use
has the potential to degrade cultural resources, particularly
prehistoric archaeological sites.

To: Helena District Ranger
My whole life I have loved the outdoors and it’s my passion to hike, climb, hunt
and fish every chance I get. With private land being locked up at an alarming rate I
would ask why is our public land being locked up at an equally alarming rate? We
already have millions and millions of wilderness and road less areas more than
anyone can see in a life time so why do we need more! Now that I’m getting older
I’m beginning to feel decimated against because I don’t have the physical ability or
finical means to ride horse back to enjoy these areas where roads are being closed!
So I would ask: Why does every new travel plan result in more and road closures?
(11-1) Please stop making it more difficult to enjoy our public land!

Introduction to Comments for DEIS and Programmatic Amendment for Divide
Travel Plan
3/23/14
Although if there was a process to vote for an alternative, I would vote for
Alternative 1. Since Alternative 2 is the USFS proposed alternative, I will work with
it to establish my comments. The proposed plan attempts to increase elk security
and habitat by limiting motorized access and human activities. In the Summaries
and Conclusions section, there exists a statement there are approximately 4300
more elk in the hunting districts since 1986 (pages 37 and 38). The elk, seem to be
doing fine in numbers with current conditions even though they do not strictly
adhere to a USDA, USFS, and MFWP promulgated standard. It is possible that elk
herds larger than those present will result in increased conflicts with adjacent
private land owners in future years. Another concern is elk die offs caused by lack
of food or weather conditions which are not allowed for in a perceived standard.
My reasons for keeping roads open to travel by highway vehicles are the following:
1. Access to HNF is needed for a growing aging population who cannot afford
specialized vehicles to access their national forest. This includes elderly and
persons with disabilities. (12-1)
2. Fire suppression. Although agencies like USFS state that certain roads and trails
are closed to motorized vehicles but left open for fire suppression, this is a de facto
closing of the road. Motorized recreationalists carry axes and saws to clear dead
fall from roads and trails they wish to utilize. USFS does not have the funds to
accomplish this task in a comprehensive manner. (12-2)

(12-1) Thank you for your comment. The Forest Service looked

3. Fire wood gathering is becoming more important as energy costs rise. Those
who gather fire wood perform an important service by cleaning the dead wood out
of the forest and forming fire breaks and lower the possibility of huge forest fires.
Access to areas of the forest where pine beetles and spruce bud worms have
decimated the forest creating a fire hazard have also created sources of fire wood.
These areas are not always conveniently located next to USFS travel designated
roads and trails. (12-3)
4. The value of retaining more than one certain road or trail that accesses the
same point on the map is that conditions may prevent access or egress to an area
for a short period of time and one must use an alternate trail or road. (12-4)

I first started exploring this area back in the 70’s and on my travels in that area last
summer I have not seen much change. There is still an abundance of wildlife in the
area so obviously ATV and or motorized travel has not taken from it and has not
affected the habitat. There are not allot of places one can take an ATV any more.
Closing more roads on our public lands takes away more from us then you realize.

Restricting access of the public to the public owned ground is wrong on many
levels. The public owns the ground and most almost entirely cutting off access to
that ground to make non ADA accessible is criminal at best.
By reducing the number of routes into an area will concentrate the traffic and drive
wildlife away from those heavily used area, and into areas they are not as well
suited to thrive. Also concentrating them and making easier prey to predators. (151)

RE: USFG Helena National Forest Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact
Statement

(18-1) The Hydrology, Affected Environment section has been
expanded for the Final EIS to include more rationale, with
references to multiple peer-reviewed publications, behind the
assumption that the open/closed designation would not result
in a substantial change to the existing impact of roads on
streams and riparian areas. In short, this decision would not
result in measureable changes in the impact to water quality
from roads because “a road closed by this decision may
generate less, the same, or more sediment over time as a result
of the closure, depending on the road surface condition, the
topography of the road and surrounding terrain, the
effectiveness of the closure, and other factors. Similarly, a road
opened by this decision may or may not become a greater
source of sediment, depending on level of use, maintenance,
improvements, and other factors”.

Dear Mr. Avey:
Thank you for the information and request for comments regarding the Draft EIS
on the Divide Travel Plan project. Please find the below referenced comments:
•On page 148 of the Divide DEIS, USFS acknowledges that the current road
management system does have an impact on stream and riparian health. However
USFS seems to assert that the decision to open or close a road to public use will not
have any significant effect on stream and riparian health. Please provide the
scientific basis for this assertion. (18-1)
•Page 146 contains the following statement:
"In streams with no previously identified water-quality impairment, this report will
assume that beneficial uses are being fully met" (18-2)
Unless a stream is listed in the current, Montana Water Quality Integrated Report
as being in Water Quality Category 1, it has not been determined to be supporting
all beneficial uses. The most current Montana Water Quality Integrated Report can
be downloaded from the Clean Water Act Information Center website at
http://deg.mt.gov/wginfo/CWAIC/default.mcpx.

Sirs,
I live on Priest Pass Road, out of Helena. I have USFS property on three sides of my
property. All I can tell you is that this area is one of the most poorly managed and
abused pieces of public ground I have ever seen. I've lived up here for 30 years and
watched while the bureaucratic bungling and delays have resulted in a once-pristine
area becoming a complete travesty of off-road abuses, wildlife habitat destruction,
pervasive prevalence of noxious weeds and utter desecration.
The lower Sweeney Creek area has been overrun by 4-wheelers, motorcycles and
off-road vehicles of every sort. There are countless "new roads" everywhere, and it
is dangerous, not to mention unsavory, to even consider walking or riding a horse in
the area. It should have been closed to motorized traffic a decade ago. To say that
the USFS has been remiss in managing this part of the public domain, is the
understatement of the year. It is nothing less than criminal to see what has happened.
I understand multiple-use public ground. This is simply unrestrained and chronic
abuse. In short, it has NOT been managed for the public legacy, and largely ignored.
A proper travel plan has been languishing for a decade, while an easy solution has
been ignored. It's pathetic, deplorable and disgusting. Roads are everywhere, lunatic
off-roaders terrorize the place, knapweed runs rampant and it's a complete mess. Fix
it!!
Keep the irresponsible abusers OUT of the area - CLOSE it to motor vehicles!!

Mike Reinig Drainage Road #1856
T9N-R6W sec 34, 35, 26, 23, 14
The existing condition map, Alternative #1, shows Mike Reinig as closed to
motorized, wheeled vehicles year long. This has been the condition for
approximately 20 years, with the exception of two families who were given
exclusive rights of use and occupation beyond every other individual. Even Forest
Service work parties were required to park outside of the F.S. gate and walk to work
sites along the road traveled by the unique elite.
It is understood that access to private property is required, but when done so, that
should not grant exclusive rights to those land owners. Every member of the public
should have been treated equally.
The opening of Mike Reinig road #1856 will finally recognize the rights of the
populace to be commensurate with the rights of specified individuals.
Road 1856 should be opened to motorized, wheeled vehicles from its origin at the
locked “moose ponds” gate to its terminal point at the locked Forest Boundary gate
on the West side of sec. 14 of T9N-R6W. (21-2)
It is the correct thing to do.

and conversly proposed open on Alternatives 2 and 4.

Response to Comments
on which of these routes provide the best opportunity. If route
123-001 is designated open instead of route 4104-A1, it is
recognized that the segment of trail crossing the slump you
mention will need to be rebuilt. It is also recognized that
crossings will need to be improved on either route if designated
open for wheeled motorized use.

(21-2) The area accessed by this road in upper flume, Little
Flume, and Mike Renig Gulch is important year-round habitat for
a number of key wildlife species. The gate closure, while
compromised to an extent by the presence of local landowners,
minimizes motorized activity in the area—which is the goal of
management in this key area.

This route constitutes a diverse recreational opportunity and a vital Forest utilization
access for the management of resources to the Helena N.F. in this segment of the
District remote to its personnel.
The inclusion of this route to continued motorized, wheeled traffic would be an asset
to Forest recreationists in the Kading campground area to take advantage of an
opportunity to cross into the Spotted Dog drainage with an extended loop.
The connectivity of road 314 on the South and the “Tree Farmer” road along with
the “Avon Bridge” road on the North is highly advantageous to the Helena N.F. and
to its users.
Please keep it open to wheeled, motorized use as it now exists. (21-3a)

Recommendation for final publishing of Helena N.F. Travel Plan map & all
subsequent publications of all National Forest Maps
The great majority of Forest users and Forest visitors are navigating through G.P.S.
Many of them have difficulty in determing their location on the ground as
referenced by the Forest plarimetric maps.
To simplify their use and make it easier to comply with the Forest Travel Plans, I
would like to recommend that tick marks be added to the external margins of all
Forest maps. Presently tick marks are shown for each 7 1/2 minute interval,
probably to match the 7 ½ minute quad maps.(21-3b) I would appear to me that 1
minute intervals would be an easy addition and would facilitate use by intersecting
vertical & horizontal map axes, corresponding to latitude and longitude lines and
their interpolations. This should result in fewer lost Forest workers, users and
visitors. Thank you for your consideration.

In the DEIS page 6 – you have stated that you intend to close creek and/or river
crossings at existing Fords until they can be replaced by bridges, bottomless arches
or culverts. There were three locations stated and will be addressed here
individually.
Larabee – the existing condition definately requires that this route remain closed
until extensive mitigation occurs.
Little Blackfoot River - ford to access the “Evening Star”, “Golden Anchor” and
“Negro Mtn.” areas. This is a ford that has been of such structure for 125 years. It
has handled year of heavy mining traffic from the 1800’s until the present. It has
been the primary access route for all utilization functions for many, many decades.
To close it for any period of time until contractual arrangements, funding and
construction can be accomplished, is not necessary nor prudent. It is highly
advisable to keep the solid bottom, rolled rock ford open throughout all of the
process.
The Bison Creek ford on road 4104-A2 will become the access point for roads 4104A2 and 4104-A1 which is a proposed interconnection between the Telegraph and
Little Blackfoot drainages. (21-4a)
There is an existing ford of Bison Creek at the East end of this road 4104-A2.This
ford has a heavy gravel bottom and a heavy gravel approach to the stream. It has
experienced recreational camping and hunting traffic of 4x4 pick up and ATV and
snow mobile traffic prior to the harvest of Bison Mtn. It had been a resident cabin
site at the time of the activity of the “Hard Luck” mine. Recreationists and hunter
camps have continued to use it to access camp sites just across the ford for many
years.
Again to close this ford while awaiting preparation time, contracting, funding and
construction is not necessary nor prudent. It is highly recommended that this fully
functional ford remain open throughout the process.
Please do not hold up the function of the road awaiting construction that is not
necessary to become fully functional. (21-4d)

Response to Comments
When private property is concerned, a single route crossing the
private property is generally sought to reduce redundancy and
public travel on private property. Route 4005 appears to be the
primary route used to access this area.
(21-4a)Ford stream crossings can increase sediment delivery to
stream channels because they provide a direct link between the
road surface and the stream. These impacts are discussed in
greater detail in the Affected Environment section of the
Hydrology Specialist Report and in the Fisheries Specialist
Report.

(21-4d)Please also see the fisheries report in the EIS for further
discussion on these crossings and why they are to be closed until
they can be upgraded.

At present this route is closed to wheeled, motorized vehicles. On Alternatives 2 and
4 it is recommended to open it to such traffic.
The recommendation to open said routes is an excellent addition to the travel plan. It
would afford an extremely viable interconnection between the Telegraph and Little
Blackfoot drainages.
These routes along with the remainder of the Bison Mtn. Timber Sale have been
locked off for elk security purposes. The regeneration and subsequent growth of
naturally regenerated Lodge-pole and Douglas fir now constitute excellent hiding
cover. The road prisms are in great condition and are fully stable. (21-5)
The inclusion of these two road segments may also eliminate the need felt by some
to create non-authorized routes from the Telegraph to the Little Blackfoot drainages.
The creek crossing at Bison Creek at the origin of road 4104-A2 is one that has been
defined as delaying the opening of this route for an undetermined length of time
until a bridge, bottomless arch or culvert can be installed. (The Helena Ranger
District anticipates 2 to 3 years to complete this).
The existing crossing at Bison Creek has been a simple hard bottom Ford, that has
been fully functional for time reverting back to mining operations likely 80 years
ago.
Campers and hunters have used the area immediately distal to the creek crossing for
many, many years.
Please do not delay the route opening, contingent upon a modernization of the creek
crossing.

The patented private mining claim at the N. most extremity of sec. 22 had a road as

Approximately 15 years ago, the owner of the patented property built a cabin in the
center of the road. This was legal by the land owner (Lindquist) and approved by the
Helena N.F. An alternative connector to 1859-E1 was constructed and signed
approximately 100 yards to the N. of the route shown on Alternative #1 of the
existing condition. Therefore road 1859-E1 no longer passes through this private
property to connect with road 495. The new connection of 1859-E1 is shown on the

The entire “road” is approximately ¾ mile long and parallels a drainage known as
the “Right Hand Fork of Jerusha”. It interconnects two private pieces of mining
claim properties and interconnects with the Lost Horse road immediately East of the
O’Connel Cabin. It is an interesting access for our ATV group between the
Ophir/Marysville route and Lost Horse/Empire creeks. It passes through a stand of
well sheltered old age D.F. There are no fishery concerns and wildlife appears to be
losing any competition to domestic cattle.
Please consider recognizing this very short segment as a route of Historic
significance and as a recreational route we have used for many years.
Please keep this route open to motorized wheeled ATV traffic.(21-14)

There is an old road initiating at the distal end of Colorado Gulch and terminating
on the North Fork of Travis gulch, near the Brooklyn Bridge Divide, that should be
re-opened.
Colorado Gulch with its numerous residences presently constitutes a disaster waiting
to happen.
When we experience a wildfire in the mouth of Colorado Gulch combined with the
prevailing N.W. wind, we will have great potential of losing life. The problem is
that Colorado Gulch is a “dead end” road with numerous homes within it. The
sensible and proactive alleviation would be to re-open the road from the Featherpipe ranch to McKelvey’s place on the N. Fork of Travis. This would provide an
alternative exit for the population of Colorado Gulch and wildland fire fighters,
when that inevitable fire occurs.
The road could be reconstituted for emergency exit only with knockdown fences

have access to for review. Without a historic map showing this
route we do not have a base line date to make an accurate
historical assessment. If you have a historic map that shows this
route, we would be happy to asses its historic value. However,
FSM 2364.35 states one of the administrative measures to protect
cultural resources from human-caused and environmental
damage is “Closure to public and motor vehicle access”.
Cultural resources (included historic routes) could be directly
affected by permanent use and maintenance. The closure of
historic routes or routes that lead to sensitive cultural resources is
considered a protection and preservation measure.

Divide Travel Plan 2014
Throughout these comments I use the plural “we” to refer to myself and my
extended family who have had input and editorial license throughout this
commentary.
First of all, we wish to state on the public record, that few things matter to us more
than the conscientious stewardship of our public land natural resources – here at the
doorstep of our home along the flanks of the Continental Divide. Few agencies have
more history or meaning to us than the U.S. Forest Service with its colorful and
courageous genesis out of the corporate exploitive era of the late 1890s and early
1900s. The Helena National Forest was in fact, one of
Theodore Roosevelt’s “Midnight Forests” – public lands that he and his staff
valiantly worked to define as National Forests, and to preserve wild places “for
those yet unborn in the womb of time.” We are those unborn souls he was referring
to, and we do not believe we have the right to drop the ball or retreat from the
responsibility to be involved in the future of our public lands.
For that reason, I very much appreciate the opportunity to comment on actions that
affect the National Forest public lands, and in this case, the Divide Travel Plan.

Linkage
The Divide Travel Planning area constitutes one of the most important linkage zones
in the Northern Region. It connects the Northern Continental Divide, Yellowstone,
and Salmon- Selway ecosystems, yet it is one of the most roaded, fragmented, and
thus fragile areas of national forest land in Montana.
The Divide Landscape of the Helena National Forest constitutes the central linkage
connection between all areas of western and central Montana as described by
American Wildlands (2008) and Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks analysis of

wolverine movements (2008 Furbearer Regulations). The Divide Landscape is the
center or “Hub” of wildlife linkage within the state of Montana. Its ability to
continue to function in this capacity is critical for low-density, far ranging carnivore
species such as grizzly bears, wolverine, mountain lions, wolves, lynx, as well as
wide-ranging ungulate species (elk, moose, bighorn sheep). Bighorn sheep have
been seen at the headwaters of Minnehaha Creek, along the Continental Divide in
the Divide Landscape even though this is not bighorn habitat. Another marked
bighorn from the Sleeping Giant area was located near Elliston, attesting to the
linkage importance of the Divide landscape. And yet the Divide Landscape is a
relatively battered place in need of careful, restorative management.

Response to Comments

Maps of seasonal elk distribution over a portion of the Divide Landscape are
attached (Divide Elk maps 27-34) and demonstrate the importance of the Helena
Forest lands and distribution following the Continental Divide. Maps from 2008
showing wolverine and lynx distribution for the MacDonald Pass area are available
but additional information for a broader area from the Helena National Forest who
has contracted Wildthings Unlimited to gather low-density mid- sized carnivore
information. They report: “Our cameras obtained photos of several different
wolverines, and added valuable data related to year-round use of an area of atypical
wolverine habitat including: relatively low elevation, roaded, and with human uses
such as logging, hunting, and snowmobiling. We believe this is extremely important
to wolverine conservation in Montana. Last winter’s efforts resulted in
documentation of more previously unknown lynx and wolverines in the Helena N.F.
study area, which is exciting and valuable news.”
In addition, the Wildlife Conservation Society has defined a crucial area connecting
the three major wolverine ecosystems as the Central Linkage Ecosystem that
includes the Divide Landscape (Inman et al., 2008).
Grizzly bear occurrences throughout the Divide Landscape attest to the area’s
importance as a linkage zone if not yearlong habitat in areas such as Nevada
Mountain, Hahn-Hat Creek near Elliston, and Little Blackfoot.

Effects of Recreation on Wildlife
National Forest management decisions are required to be based upon “the best
available science.” In borrowing from the Montana Chapter of The Wildlife
Society’s January 14, 2009 comment on the Divide Travel plan, it should be noted
that the Montana Chapter of The Wildlife Society undertook a comprehensive effort
to address the Effects of Recreation on Rocky Mountain Wildlife – A Review for
Montana1. That document, and its associated on-line bibliography, was partially
funded by the USFS. Copies of the report were provided to every national forest and
most ranger districts in the State of Montana. The Effects of Recreation report was
compiled by 35 wildlife biologists from state, federal, university and private settings
from across Montana, who volunteered their time specifically to provide this
information to land and wildlife managers.

The Divide Draft EIS cites the Montana Chapter of The Wildlife Society document
in the References section, however, the material provided in the document does not
appear to be utilized or referenced in the DEIS, either in the various Wildlife
chapters or the Recreation chapter. (23-1). Valuable scientific information was
provided for all wildlife species groups including amphibians and reptiles, small
mammals, birds, ungulates, carnivores, and semi-aquatic mammals. In addition,
discussion about impacts from recreational uses to soils, water, and vegetation was
presented. Several Chapter members have been responsible for collecting
information for this specific area over the years. Within the chapter on Ungulates,
the following with respect to big game security is noted:
“Managers of public lands control only a few of the potential variables that
contribute to security including retention of important vegetative cover, travel
management, and enforcement of travel regulations. There is a strong relationship
between adequate security and predicted buck/bull carryover”2

(23-2a,b) The Forest Plan amendment and the wildlife analysis
describe cover and travel management for all alternatives. These
analyses assume that all regulations are being followed (See Big

Previously, MCTWS noted, and the comments are still relevant for the Draft EIS:
Conversion of previously closed routes to open routes for motorized use has not
been analyzed or justified with respect to initial closure rationale and whether the
purposes for initial closure have changed.
Established analysis procedure requires that the USFS use the best scientific and
commercial information available and ensure that any final decision is based on the
most recent, up-to-date information on wildlife use of the area.
The proposed action must be in compliance with the Helena National Forest Plan.
At present, the proposed action does not appear to be in compliance with standards
for soils, watersheds, elk (security, summer and winter range standards), or the
Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction. (23-2b)
User-created roads (whether they are called roads or trails) must be closed and
reclaimed, and should not be included in the transportation system. These “user
created routes were developed without agency authorization, environmental
analysis, or public involvement and do not have the same status as National Forest
System roads and trails included in the forest transportation system.” 70 Fed. Reg.

the USFS, and have never undergone any form of NEPA analysis. As such, these
user created routes must be immediately closed, repaired, and excluded from the
USFS’s transportation network.
The USFS cannot and should not legitimize such routes or reward OHV users for
their illegal and destructive behavior by now designating such routes as part of the
new transportation system.

The USFS must ensure compliance with the Travel Management Rule and all
relevant Executive Orders – including Ex. Order 11644 (as amended by Ex. Order

duty to locate areas and trails to minimize damage to soils, watersheds, and
vegetation, minimize harassment to wildlife, or minimize conflicts with users. (233b)
Big Game Security Standard/Amendment
The existing big game security standard was based on published literature derived
from 15 years of research on the specific topic of road density, placement, and
timing of use in Montana (Lyon, et al. 1985). The document, Coordinating Elk and
Timber Management3, was conducted over 4 study areas and concluded: Road
density and pattern, including off-road travel, play an important role in determining
the security level an area provides to elk during the hunting season. An area with
sparse cover and low road densities may provide as much security as the same size
area with heavy cover and high road densities.(8)

Response to Comments
specifies compliance with Forest Plan direction on water quality
for the action alternatives, “The proposed travel plan, under any
of the action alternatives, does not specify any activities that
would directly result in the degradation of water quality in the
planning area. In this sense, the travel plan is in compliance with
the Forest Plan standard requiring that a project resulting in water
pollution be modified or discontinued. The plan is also consistent
with the Forest Plan standard requiring that BMPs are employed
in projects to minimize non-point-source pollution, in that routes
designated as system routes would be required to be maintained
at appropriate standards, and unauthorized routes would be
available to be removed from the landscape. While the Decision
would not directly specify road improvements or
decommissioning, its route designations set the stage for this
work.”

Conversely, it is also true that areas with heavy cover and high road densities may
provide as much security as the same size area with sparse cover and low road
densities. However the proposed big game security standard would eliminate all
reference or requirement for cover.
With respect to security and the need for cover, Lyon et al. (1985) stress:
Road density and cover quality are both important when considering adequate elk
security during the hunting season. (8)
Central Montana elk require the greater security provided by good cover at the edge
of the opening. (10)
The proposed big game security amendment was not derived from field research,

(23-4)The Forest Plan amendment is based on the best available
information. The purpose and need for this amendment is
articulated in the amendment section as follows:
In the twenty nine years since the development of the Forest
Plan, a substantial amount of scientific studies, surveys, and
other information have been accrued. These studies have
suggested other measures that are also appropriate for measuring

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 192

Comments
nor is it based on full application of scientific literature on the subject of elk
vulnerability. None of the literature presumes that during the hunting season no
vegetative cover is required. In circumstances where little cover is naturally
available, such as the Missouri River Breaks, topography must substitute for
vegetative cover; however, the hunting season must be severely restricted through
permit only hunting to compensate for the lack of security. (23-4)
The proposed big game security amendment merely draws polygons on the
landscape and declares that these areas will be big game security. No longer would
all National Forest lands be potential elk security. Big game security would be
relegated to polygons. And the requirements for non-cover vegetation that Lyon et
al recommended have not been described and listed as caveats for these polygons.
Those requirements as described by Lyon et al. include:
•
Clearcuts: Openings should be small, even though openings up to 100 acres
may be acceptable where the adjacent forest edge supplies adequate security;
•
Provide undisturbed security areas adjacent to the area of activity
•
Concentrate management activity into the shortest possible time (includes
follow-up activity such as planting and burning) (39)
•
Confine disturbance to the smallest area possible within a single drainage
(39)
It must be noted that the knowledge of elk security with respect to vegetative cover
and roads described in “Coordinating Elk and Timber Management” (1985) was
signed and adopted unilaterally in 1984 by the Bureau of Land Management (Edwin
Zaidlicz, State Director), Northern Region U.S. Forest Service (Tom Costain,
Regional Forester), School of Forestry, University of Montana (Benjamin B. Stout,
Dean), Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (James W. Flynn,
Director), and the U.S. forest Service, Intermountain Forest and Ranger Experiment
Station (Laurence El. Lassen, Director).

big game security, and are more closely tied to open motorized
route densities during times of elk stress and increased
vulnerability (i.e. hunting season). In addition, the elk harvest
metrics used by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and
Parks (MFWP) to evaluate and manage elk vulnerability during
the hunting season (the reason for providing security) have
evolved, leaving part of the standard as currently written useless
because it relies on data methods no longer available or in
practice. As a result, public access is being constrained without
the clear benefits for elk envisioned by the standard.
This programmatic Forest Plan amendment for the Divide Travel
Plan project area is needed to more closely align current science,
local conditions, and other information with the needs of big
game, particularly elk, which meet the intent of the Forest Plan.
The amendment considers the impacts of open motorized routes
on elk security, establishes blocks of secure habitat, and can be
measured regardless of changes in hiding cover. While the
proposed amendment decouples hiding cover from security
during the hunting season, several Forest-wide and Management
Area standards remain in place that govern management of
hiding cover.
The assumptions built into the existing (1986) Forestwide
Standard 4a (hereafter Standard 4a) have not proven useful in
gauging or guiding management activities under the Forest Plan.
Actual elk populations and trends as monitored over the last
twenty nine years simply do not correlate with this existing
standard or its assumptions. Elk numbers have consistently
increased during this time period and the existing standard needs
to be revised to address recent elk management challenges.

security amendment? (23-4). I would posit that there is none and that the current
proposal to change the standard for big game security has been designed at a
conference table over the past couple years, with no field research or testing.
The very plausible reason for this approach is that the Helena National Forest has
failed, over the past 28 years, to apply and adhere to the existing security standard,
and instead has determined repeatedly for landscape altering projects that there
would be “No Significant Impact”. As a result, the HNF has finally arrived at the
day of reckoning, and in fact they cannot comply with their own standard now,
because they have failed to do so over the past 28 years (23-4).
For example the “Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact” for the
Forestwide Hazardous Tree Removal and Fuels Reduction Project, signed August
23, 2010 by Supervisor Riordan is just one of hundreds of projects that have been
similarly issued over the past 28 years. The Decision stated: “An alternative that was
considered but eliminated from detailed study was one that addressed the road
density issue raised from the public. These comments came during the Objection
period. Some comments suggested the Responsible Official consider an alternative
that would reduce open road densities as a means to increasing elk security. With
this proposal not being a travel management decision, this proposed alternative is
outside the scope of the decision space and analysis.” (Hazard Tree Project DN,
August 2010)
Yet the Decision that was made to “treat” many roads in remote settings, influenced
the subsequent travel plan, the functionality of the big game security and habitat
effectiveness standards, but failed to address those impacts. (23-4)

Response to Comments
In response to public comment, the Forest includes a cover
guideline as part of Alternative B. While the new Forest Plan
Programmatic Amendment does not require that elk security
areas provide a particular level of hiding cover, it does recognize
forest cover as an important component of security and includes
a set of guidelines for managing cover. The guidelines focus on
maintaining cover to the extent practicable where it exists within
security areas and in travel lanes between them. Where cover is
not available, the guidelines emphasize managing for its
recruitment.
(23-4)The ‘Coordinating Elk and Timber Management’ (Lyon et
al. 1985) remains a part of the Helena National Forest Plan.
Standard 6 (Forest Plan, p. II/19) states the following: Montana
Cooperative Elk-Logging Study Recommendations, in Appendix
C, will be followed during timber sale and road construction
projects. Appendix C includes all of the considerations in that
study.
The purpose and need for the amendment is stated above.
Contrary to the public comment (“…cannot comply with their
own standard now, because they have failed to do so over the
past 28 years”) three of the 6 elk herd units in the travel plan
project area do meet Forest Plan Standard 4a.

IRAs to Elk Herd Unit security. The rationale for “clearing” old routes within these
roadless areas was unjustified as indicated by the lack of compliance with the
security standard and the fact that other areas that do not occur in/near roadless areas
do not meet the security standard. This is not to say that areas not having roadless
areas cannot meet the standard, the HNF simply has to limit road densities in these
areas. (attach HAZARD TREE PROJECT ROADS BY ELK HERD UNIT: Roads
Analysis of EHU to HNF/Hazardous Tree Removal/Issues/HHAA)
DEIS Appx C pg 17 indicates that even for Alt 3, one herd unit would remain below
the 30% threshold, but then goes on to say all 6 EHUs would meet the 30%
standard. That in fact is not the case – one would NOT meet the standard. Measures
should be taken to raise all EHUs above the minimum 30% security level.
Elk have been used as a surrogate, or Management Indicator Species, for the needs
of other ungulates (mule and white-tailed deer, moose), but for a variety of
behavioral and nutritional reasons, elk do not reflect the needs of other ungulates.
While elk herd numbers have often risen over the years because they are so mobile
and move off of national forest lands when it becomes insecure, deer and moose do
not. Currently in Montana, mule deer, white-tailed deer, and moose populations are
at serious lows. These are species whose movements are much more limited than
that of elk. This is not a time to be eliminating the forest cover component from the
big game standards.
It is time for restoration of the landscape. The landscape and wildlife will begin to
heal if an aggressive travel plan is implemented so a return to the time-tested “best
available science” of the existing big game security standard can be restored.

Compliance with the Roadless Rule must be demonstrated. That compliance
includes providing “lasting protection” for IRAs in the project area. These IRAs are
characterized by high quality, undisturbed soil and water and a diversity of plant and
animal communities. According to the USFS, these IRAs “provide clean drinking

These IRAs also “provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation,
opportunities that diminish as open space and natural settings are developed
elsewhere. They also serve as bulwarks against the spread of non-native invasive
plant species and provide reference areas for study and research.” Id. By law, these
biological strongholds are to be managed for “lasting protection.” In adopting a
proposed action the USFS: (1) must comply with the Roadless Rule and manage
these areas for lasting protection; and (2) should prohibit and/or restrict all
motorized access in the IRAs.

Road 495-D1 is a clear example of a road that was included in the Hazardous Tree
Removal Project, deep in the National Forest next to an IRA, but didn’t provide a
hazard to anyone. (23-7) Yet road 495-D1 has been or will be “treated” by removing
trees along its length, grading and possibly gravelling. This was an action that was
not necessary and was pre-decisional to the Divide Travel Planning process. Other
roads not occurring within the Wildland Urban Interface that have been slated for
Hazardous Tree Removal treatment prior to the Divide Travel Planning process and
thus were also pre-decisional and cumulatively impacted big game security, leading
the HNF to declare that they could not meet the standard for security. This recurring
situation has led to the Catch-22 situation wherein the FS has chosen not to meet the
big game security standard, so then they devised a new standard that would not limit
either timber removal or motorized travel. But the fact is, they cumulatively ignored
their own valid, scientifically based standard for nearly 3 decades.

The Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless Area supports both denning grizzly

Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks, I personally observed wolverine tracks and
excavation holes on Nevada Mountain. In Alts 2 and 4, road 4044-E1 goes deep
into the Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless Area. This route dead-ends after
crossing through an area restricted to over snow motorized vehicles and penetrates
about 1.5 miles into the IRA. (23-8a)
None of the action alternatives adequately address massive road duplication to the
south of the Nevada Mountain IRA. (23-8b). These roads inhibit linkage between
the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area along the Continental Divide to and south of
Highway 12, thus hindering movement of wildlife between ecosystems.

1863, 607, 293, 293-A1, 296, 296-B1, 4196, 1892, 485-D1, 601-F1, 601-K2, 601K3, 601-K4.
Another 18 roads (36.44 miles) were slated for “treatment” next to Roadless areas
during the Hazardous Tree project, even though the trees were not a hazard to
anyone (607-H1, 123, 495- D1, 1834, 1834-C1, 1834-D1, 296-A1, 296-A2, 296-A3,

This was simply an expeditious move on the part of the HNF to improve roads for
future projects without having to go through the travel planning process. The Helena
Hunters & Anglers objected to this approach, but their objection was denied by the
Regional Office of the Forest Service. In addition, the Hazard Tree Removal project
concluded that the big game security standard could not be achieved during that
project, so the Forest Supervisor simply exempted the Helena National Forest from
adherence to Forest Plan standard 3 (summer hiding cover) and 4a (big game
security): “As part of my Decision I am amending the Forest Plan through a sitespecific Forest Plan amendment for this project. Analysis for this project indicated
the need for a site- specific Forest Plan amendment to the Helena Forest Plan
regarding elk summer and winter range and big game security… As part of my
Decision I am also making a site- specific amendment to the Forest Plan. This
amendment exempts this project from the Forest Plan big game standards 3 and 4a.”
There was no actual amendment to Forest Plan wildlife standards 3 and 4a -- the
amendment was simply an exemption from compliance with the Helena Forest Plan
by the Helena Forest Supervisor. (23-9)
Water Quality
Please fully address Helena National Forest water quality conditions and where and
how sedimentation would be curtailed and TMDL standards met under each of the 4
alternatives. Please explain what action would be necessary to fully rectify humancaused sedimentation and water pollution problems across the Divide Travel Plan
landscape.(23-10a)

Response to Comments

(23-9)A site-specific exemption is actually an amendment.
There are two types of amendments: site-specific and
programmatic. The effects of site-specific project amendments
are limited in time and space; programmatic amendments provide
direction that would be applied to future management activities
(See Forest Plan amendment, Cumulative Effects section).

(23-10a) The Affected Environment section of the Hydrology
Specialist report discusses water quality conditions in Helena
National Forest streams based on available data, and summarizes
water quality issues that are associated with forest roads as
discussed in the Lake Helena and Little Blackfoot TMDL
reports. This decision does not determine future road
decommissioning activities. The decision for future road
decommissioning and related potential sedimentation reductions
would be subject to future NEPA analysis and decision.
Eliminating all human-caused sedimentation would require
relocating all roads/trails to upland locations and hardening all
stream crossings, which would not be not economically feasible
nor would that meet the needs of all resources represented by the
Forest Service. This travel plan provides an avenue for future
decommissioning of closed routes and would allow maintenance
efforts to be concentrated on open routes with resource issues.
These steps would aid the Forest Service in moving towards
meeting TMDL standards for reducing sedimentation from
unpaved roads.

Of the 23 stream segments sampled for % fines in gravels (Table 3.31), all but one
(N. Fk Ophir Cr) exceeded reference levels – in some cases by 100%. The
alternative having the least amount of motorized routes would help reduce
sediments, and along with restoration activities, would be the most cost effective
approach to improving the water quality.
The Forest Service maintains jurisdiction on about 58.6 miles of high risk roads (pg.
213). Under action Alternative 3, about 27.98 miles of high risk FS roads would
remain open and 30.66 miles (17.32 miles currently closed plus 13.34 proposed
miles) or 52% would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicle use. Private and
county roads account for balance of high risk roads or about 19.8 miles; these nonFS roads represent an ongoing cumulative effect to the surface water system in the
planning area.
With approximately 378 stream-road intersections (crossings) in the planning area,
the Forest Service has jurisdiction on 288 crossings. About 142 FS crossings (49%)
would be closed under this alternative.
Additionally, nine FS dispersed campsites associated with high risk roads are
directly adjacent TES fish habitat, and six of these would close under this
alternative. The other three dispersed recreation campsites would remain open to
public users and continue to adversely affect TES fish habitat without mitigations.
Six currently open fords on TES fish streams would experience permanent or
temporary closures to reduce risk of direct mortality to WCT and bull trout. A
seventh closed ford located in Ontario Creek would remain closed to wheeled
motorized traffic.
Pg. 218 Currently there are approximately 58.6 miles of high risk roads and 288
crossings under FS jurisdiction throughout the planning area. Under the No Action
Alternative, 17.3 miles (30%) of HRR and 94 (33%) of crossings are currently
closed to wheeled motorized vehicle travel. Alternative 3 is the most beneficial

alternative with respect to water quality with the least number of stream crossings
open (but still 146 open crossings), and the least miles of sediment producing roads
with 28 miles open and 30.6 closed. This translates into 8 fewer crossings and 1.6
miles more of closed high risk roads. Although the best of the offered alternatives, it
seems there could be a much more beneficial alternative e offered to further reduce
the extreme human caused sedimentation that still would come from 146 open
stream crossings and 28 miles of open road even in Alternative 3. So, even in the
best alternative, this still amounts to 50.7% of the damaging stream crossings, and
47.8% of the high risk roads being open to motorized travel. Please provide a more
beneficial alternative for water quality. (23-10b).

Divide Travel Plan Questions and Individual Road Recommendations
What constitutes an over snow vehicle and is there a minimum amount of snow that
must be on the ground to travel on it?(23-11) See comments regarding 227-B1 and
all other roads that have been “Closed to motorized vehicles yearlong, including
over snow motorized vehicles” (gold lines over roads in Alternative 1).
Adequate signage and physical barriers are essential to prevent illegal use of roads
designated for closure. Decommissioning must be considered in certain cases. Such
actions must be part of this proposal, but is currently is not.

(23-12)Thank you for your input.

Travel Plan implementation. (23-11a)
Road decommissioning and removal must be available tools to address landscape
recovery. The Divide Landscape does not compare to many other less impacted, less
damaged areas of the Northern Region that have not been as affected by mining,
logging, roading, damaging motorized use, and thus requires more attention in
bringing it back to a more healthy, naturally functioning status. A failing landscape
is one that is experiencing severe water quality issues, diminished fisheries and
wildlife services in terms of habitat quantity and quality, movement, population
structure. The Divide Landscape is verging on such a place. However, responsible,
assertive stewardship can go a long way to recovering this portion of the HNF on
the edge of the capitol city, along the Continental Divide, and linking the
Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide Ecosystems. (23-12)
(23-13b) Thank you for your input.
As tattered as the Divide is, the Helena City Commission recognized its value when
it passed Resolution 2008-57 entitled, Resolution to Protect and Promote
Conservation of Wildlife Habitat and Corridors along the Continental Divide
(attached).
The 2006 HNF Travel Map, signed by supervisor Kevin Riordan on May 1, does not
show many roads that appear on Alternative 1. Opening such roads for motorized
use is not responsible management in a landscape that has severe water quality and
wildlife security issues. (23-13a)

This area has always been recognized as important mule deer winter range.

1991 to create a motorized area closure for Sweeney Creek to protect critical mule
deer and elk winter range, as well as limited old growth ponderosa pine habitat for
sensitive species including pileated woodpecker and flammulated owls (MFWP
correspondence 1991). In fact, one of the rationales for the Sweeney Cr timber sale
was to enhance bitterbrush production on the winter range. This project then

Alternatives
Alternative 1 – Existing Condition/No Action
Alternative 1 would retain the existing condition, which in many cases is more
friendly toward water, soil, and wildlife resources in that dozens of miles of roads
that would be opened in the other 3 action alternatives, would remain closed on a
yearlong basis. All “yellow” roads on Alt 1 Travel map are designated closed
yearlong, but most of these in the other alternatives would be opened to some type
of motorized use, even in Alternative 3. Alternative 1 is the only Alternative that
would retain the closure to over snow vehicles in the Limburger Springs area winter
range so they could not be used during the hunting season. Alt 1 is clearly more
winter friendly to lynx and wolverine than the other alternatives with 31,350 acres
open, while Alt 3 and 4 would allow 44,980 acres to be open to over snow vehicles.
Alternative 1 would retain the existing Forest Plan Big Game Security Standard
(involving a matrix of road density and vegetative cover – all action Alternatives
would remove all vegetation cover requirements) and would not implement the
proposed security Amendment. The proposed Amendment would remove all
vegetation cover requirements for big game security. (23-23)
Alternative 2 – Maximum Motorized Use
This Alternative does try to rectify on-going natural resource problems and would
exacerbate these problems with the maximum motorized use.
Alternative 3 – Most Natural Resource Friendly
Of the three action alternatives, Alt 3 is generally the best choice for natural
resource concerns, but it does not go far enough and could be improved with certain
site-specific alterations described previously. It allows more winter motorized
travel than Alt 4, and would allow snowmobile use on the previously designated
winter ranger in the Spotted Dog-Limburger Springs area. Winter range in this area
should be identified on the travel map. Off route over snow use would INCREASE

seasonal movement. Saddles, low divides, and heads of
drainages are examples of important landscape features within
which cover should be retained when possible in order to provide

Subject to Guideline #1, vegetation management projects should

limited or not available.
Subject to Guideline #1, provide cover, if available; in elk
security areas to maintain and/or improve elk security in areas
known to be used by elk or that have the potential to be used by

that have the potential to be used by elk.
Frequent, continuous dense cover, if available, should be

3, and only in some cases is it better than the Existing Condition (Alt 1). It does not
recognize winter motorized closures. It designates additional motorized trails,
highway vehicle use roads, and longer motorized use periods. It does not recognize

vehicles. (23-25)

Not all timber projects listed in Appendix B include acreage involved. In addition to
the 1,352 acres that have been “treated, there is the 6,335 acre Telegraph Creek
treatment area, and the 491 miles of road in the Hazard Tree Project (9,415 acres or
nearly 15 square miles, Table 2 Soils
Report Hazard Tree Project). These projects total at least 26.7 square miles of the
Helena National Forest. Cumulatively, a 27 square mile area of timber removal
cannot be considered of “no significant impact.” Clearly there has been little effort
to maintain or adhere to Forest Plan Forest Plan Standard 4a for big game security.
This inconvenient truth does not absolve the Helena National Forest from working
to restore this science-based standard. (23-27)

Divide Landscape (Hazardous Tree Removal/Issues/HHAA).
In the case of the Hazardous Tree Removal Project, the Helena Forest Supervisor
decided in the Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact: “As part of
my Decision I am amending the Forest Plan through a site-specific Forest Plan
amendment for this project. Analysis for this project indicated the need for a sitespecific Forest Plan amendment to the Helena Forest Plan regarding elk summer and
winter range and big game security… As part of my Decision I am also making a
site- specific amendment to the Forest Plan. This amendment exempts this project
from the Forest Plan big game standards 3 and 4a.”

(23-29)Currently, three out of the six elk herd units in the project
area meet Standard 4a (See Forest Plan amendment, Comparison
of Alternatives/Alternative A).

There was no actual amendment to Forest Plan wildlife standards 3 and 4a -- the
amendment was simply an exemption from compliance with the Helena Forest Plan

Response to Comments

There is concern that measures to protect natural resources and abide by wildlife
standards and guidelines have not been consistently applied as per these decisions.
Cases in point would be all the roads and trails that appear on the existing condition
Alternative 1 map, but do not appear on the 2006 Travel map, or now (as per Alt 1)
have broader use periods than what appears on the 2006 Travel map.
Timber sale projects such as Sweeney Creek, Mullan Pass, Hope/Snowshoe, Lava
Mountain etc. had associated decisions that may not have been fully followed. For
example it took more than a decade to implement road decisions for the Lava
Mountain sale, and then only because the public objected to new timber sale action
unless the earlier stipulations regarding road closures at Lava Mountain were
completed.
If decisions and stated rationale behind those decisions are not followed, the
consequences cumulatively add up to impacts on natural resources. Such cumulative
actions, many of which had associated decisions of No Significant Impact, also are
the reason that Forest Plan amendments are now being proposed – because they
cannot, through their own doing – meet the Forest Plan standards. This behavior
does not justify throwing out the scientifically-based big game standard for security.
(23-29)
Another example was the proposed Biathlon Project which received a No
Significant Impact finding by the Helena National Forest (June 12, 2008), but was
challenged in court and was remanded to the HNF based in part on inattention to
wildlife linkage/connectivity, cumulative impacts, wetlands, elk standard for hiding
cover, among other things.
We believe the Forest must be accountable to past decisions, and through future
actions the Helena National Forest has the means to rectify past management
oversight or actual transgressions. We welcome the opportunity to work with Forest

Monitoring, Enforcement, and Schedule
Monitoring
“Overwhelmingly, scientists agree that in absence of monitoring, a project may be
rendered invalid. While funding for monitoring is almost universally short of what is
required to address scientific and technical uncertainties, monitoring is the only way
to understand short- and long- term effects of restoration actions.”4
And yet, at the April 1, 2014 meeting of Helena Hunters & Anglers Association the
District Ranger for the adjoining Blackfoot Travel Planning area stated that because
financial resources are limited, it would take years to implement the plan. In the
meantime, she stated that all roads that are currently open would remain open. She
did not say that all roads that are currently closed would remain closed or that any
enforcement would occur. She stated that monitoring and enforcement is a
partnership between the FS, the FWP and the public. Of course the public has no
authority to enforce anything, thus essentially divesting themselves of the
responsibility to monitor and enforce.
Enforcement
Positive feed-back loops to correct problems on the ground seem to be very limited,
only occurring through site specific Emergency Orders. Please provide the steps that
must be taken for the public to request and document the need for an Emergency
Order.
The Divide DEIS acknowledges serious enforcement deficiencies. An active
enforcement presence must be guaranteed. What is the point of having a travel plan
if it is not enforced? How will the ROD address this very serious issue of
enforcement of the travel plan within the Divide Landscape? Just one example:
“Illegal OHV use of a pioneered trail around Slate Lake would continue in the
absence of effective enforcement.” (Appx C-25)

Existing travel restrictions up to 2014 have not been enforced for years on the
Helena National Forest. Recently the new Helena Forest Supervisor signed
emergency orders to require enforcement of the existing (2006) travel plan. What
will be the requirements and time frame for enforcement of this new travel plan
once it is signed into law?
Schedule
Fundamental to a functional Travel Plan is an implementation schedule on the order
of 5 years or less. Please provide a schedule in the ROD that speaks to site-specific
implementation of all actions associated with the Travel Plan. We request
expeditious implementation of road closures, decommissioning, removal (revegetation in some cases).
Recommendation
Fashion a modified Alternative 3 that will bring the Divide Landscape, to which this
travel planning process is applied, to a restored, ecologically functioning condition.
Thank you for addressing these concerns and considering these suggested
modifications to the final Alternative.

I am writing in support of the non-motorized plan for the Nevada Mountain area. I
understand that there are many different user groups that utilize Forest Service land.
However the forests and streams of Montana are too special to sacrifice to the uses
of mechanized machine. Montana's wild cores are what makes it so superior to any
other state in the lower 48. Currently I find myself down in Colorado. The
mountains down here are massive and beautiful, but they fail to produce the special
feeling one encounters when he or she steps foot into the Montana backcountry.
Please act to protect the Wild characteristics and diverse wildlife of Montana's land.
It would be a shame to see Montana Coloradoized.

Forest utilization by the Nation’s populace is a highly desired function of the U.S.
Forest Service which then garners public support for the agency.
The resources of the Forest include the products derived from the biological,
hydrological and geological features that occupy their relative positions on the
landscape managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Each of these resources is managed
for continued utilization as necessitated and directed by our needs and desires.
On a local level – the Helena N.F. level – and the Forest Travel Plan level, we
recognize that our travel routes have been historically created as a result of Forest
utilization, specifically to access the biological, hydrological and geological
resources that our nation and every Nation rely upon.
As our society has developed, so has our life style. People now have a greater
affluence and much more leisure time away from work. Our recreational time has
become a large component of our lives within our highly industrialized and
computerized society.
The Forest recognizes that our expansive and diverse landscapes offer extensive
opportunity for many recreational opportunities in the great outdoors.
To meld Forest recreational opportunities with the already developed access created
by the resource functions of Forest management promotes and enhances the use of
infrastructure that currently exists on our National Forest lands. To fail to use or to
recognize the potential of using these resources created infrastructures for Forest
recreational activity would be short-sighted.
To obliterate roads today is to destroy infrastructural investments with potential
viable function in the future. Roads from all resource ventures still function as the
routes traveled by all Forest users; motorized, non-motorized, hikers, horse back,
bicycles and even wildlife.

In my 47 years of working for the Forest Service, I honestly believe that I can count
on one hand, the number of forest users I ever encountered in the field who were
“bush-whacking” (off of a road or trail). (With the exception of times during hunting
season.) When I did, I was shockingly startled, surprised and somewhat fearfully
alarmed. Roadways offer a sense of safety-security-comfort, and ease of movement
with determined destination. Conversely “bush-whacking” increases hazards, allows
feelings of insecurity or apprehension and difficulty in maneuvering.
The National Forest System has gone through historical infrastructural obliteration
in the 1970’s-1980’s, when we dozed and burned numerous lookouts, ranger
stations and guard stations only to recognize too late that they were inheritantly
valuable for re-purposing.
Let’s not make similar mistakes today by destroying infrastructural investments that
continue to persist today because Forest users have established new found purposes
extraordinary to their original function.

We ask that the Divide Travel Planning Project adequately address the following
significant issues:
1. If further motorized closures of the CDNST are pursued, then a significant issue
to motorized recreationists is the re-opening of all CDNST motorized closures
enacted to date including Homestake Pass north and south, Bison Mountain North
and South, Sugarloaf Mountain, Black Mountain North, Flesher Pass to Rogers
Pass, McDonald Pass to Jericho Creek, Bison Mountain, and Thunderbolt
Mountain(38-1). These motorized closures were enacted without the correct
consideration of the requirements of the CDNST enabling law, and CDNST EIS and
ROD. They were illegal motorized closures and corrective action must be taken to
resolve these past illegal motorized closure actions as part of this decision.
2. The Continental Divide trail between McDonald Pass and Jericho Mountain and
Ontario Creek over Bison Mountain to the BDNF were illegally closed to motorized
recreationists by past actions. The motorized CDNST closures proposed as part of
the draft Blackfoot Record of Decision are illegal. The Divide travel plan should reevaluate that closure and mitigate for all illegal closures by re-opening these
sections of CDNST to motorized recreationists as required by the original
legislation.(38-2) Further documentation of this illegal closure is provided in the
followings sections.
3. Non-motorized reaches of the CDNST receive very little use. Recent inspection
of a new non-motorized section of the CDNST near Burnt Mountain in the
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (see photographs) could not find any sign of
foot prints or use. (editorial note – photos pertaining to the these comments were
attached, but not included in this table. They are available for viewing at the HNF
office). A CTVA member monitored game cameras on a section of the CDNST near
Helena for a 3 month period from June to August of 2013. These cameras did not
pick up any non-motorized users during this period. At the same time, we have
observed that motorized sections of the CDNST see significant motorized use and
corresponding benefits. By looking at actual miles traveled and hours spent
recreating the obvious best use of the CDNST is for shared multiple-use.(38-3) This

is also true when considering our limited and valuable public taxes and funds.
Single-track reaches should be designated for motorcycle and mountain bike use,
48” width areas should be designated for ATV use, and reaches wider than 48”
should be designated for UTV and 4x4 use. (38-3)
4. Motorized recreationists keep trails open for all users including motorcycle
single-track trail. This issue is especially important during this period of intense
downfall from trees killed by beetle infestations. A once a year trail clearing by a
Forest Service trail crew is no longer adequate to keep trails open. Past closures
have proven that motorized trails that have been closed to motorized use have
become impassable within 3 to 5 years. Examples include the Brooklyn Bridge route
in the Helena National Forest and the Middle Fork of Rock Creek in the
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest. At the same time motorized recreationists
have proven that they are willing to work to keep trails open so that all visitors are
able to enjoy them. This ability to keep trails open for use by everyone is a
significant advantage to designate all routes within the project area open for
motorized use. (38-4)

Response to Comments

(38-4)Thank you to all user groups for maintaining the trails.

5. We are very concerned about the closure of any motorized routes to create
CDNST. The closure of any existing motorized route to create a non-motorized
segment of the CDNST was not authorized by the National Trail Systems Act and in
the direction given in a policy memorandum by the Deputy Forester in 1997.
6. Specifically, the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1241)
(http://nplnews.com/toolbox/fedlaws/68nattrails.pdf) was the authorizing law for
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. The general criteria as stated in the
National Trail Systems Act, is that “the use of motorized vehicles by the general
public along any national scenic trail shall be prohibited”. However, in the case of
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST), an exception is made for
“the use of motorized vehicles on roads which will be designated segments”
(Section 5 (5), page 2-6). The law also allows uses (including motorized vehicle
use) along the CDNST “which will not substantially interfere with the nature and

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 224

purposes of the trail” where such uses are permitted at the time of designation (Sec.
7 (c), page 2-21).
7. Specifically, the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1241) provided for “(6)
DIVERSIFIED TRAIL USE.—(A) REQUIREMENT.—To the extent practicable
and consistent with other requirements of this section, a State shall expend moneys
received under this part in a manner that gives preference to project proposals
which—(i) provide for the greatest number of compatible recreational purposes
including, but not limited to,
those described under the definition of ‘‘recreational trail’’ in subsection (g)(5); or
(ii) provide for innovative recreational trail corridor sharing to accommodate
motorized and non-motorized recreational trail use.
Both sections of proposed trail are outside the wilderness area and would make
outstanding shared-use (motorized and non-motorized) trails. Development as
shared-use trails would better meet the guidelines of the National Trail Systems Act
for “innovative” solutions.(38-5a)
8. Specifically, the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1241) defined
RECREATIONAL TRAIL.—The term ‘‘recreational trail’’ means a thoroughfare or
track across land or snow, used for recreational purposes such as bicycling, crosscountry skiing, day hiking, equestrian activities, jogging or similar fitness activities,
trail biking, overnight and long-distance backpacking, snowmobiling, aquatic or
water activity and vehicular travel by motorcycle, four-wheel drive or all-terrain offroad vehicles, without regard to whether it is a ‘‘National Recreation Trail’’
designated under section 4 of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1243). (385b)
9. The language cited above from the National Trails System Act clearly indicates
the intent of the original act. The creation of non-motorized sections of the CDNST
by converting motorized sections is not within the intent of the original act. (38-5c)

National Trails System Act and has not closed any motorized sections of the
CDNST since the CTVA appeal of the Nez Perce trail in 2004. Recent CDNST
projects in the BDNF have used the strategy of constructing non-motorized routes
parallel to existing motorized CDNST trail sections. We support this strategy to
avoid illegal closure of motorized sections of the CDNST. (38-6a)

Response to Comments

11. In too many cases a couple of non-motorized users have been able to displace
hundreds of motorized users. It is not reasonable or fair to allow a few nonmotorized recreationists to convert a motorized trail used by hundreds of motorized
recreationists for their exclusive use. Unfortunately, sections of the CDNST have
been created with this approach. This approach must not be perpetuated and past
motorized closures should be mitigated. (38-6b)

(38-6c) Thank you for your input.

12. Now the 1997 Policy Letter by the Deputy Chief of the Forest Service
(http://www.mtvra.com/Docs/CNDST%20July%201997%20Memo.pdf ) is being
used by the Forest Service to justify conversion of motorized, multiple-use sections
of the CDNST to non-motorized use only. Our interpretation of that policy memo is
completely different. The 1997 directive to Regional Foresters clearly says that
conversion of the CDNST to non-motorized applies only to "newly constructed trail
segments" and that reaches of the existing CDNST that use existing roads and trails
should continue to accommodate motorized use. (38-6c)

Divide Travel Plan Programmatic Plan Amendment for Big Game Security
Dear Forest Supervisor Avey:
The following comments are submitted in response to the Helena National Forest
Divide Travel Plan Programmatic Plan Amendment for Big Game Security. We
request these comments be entered into the public record, and fully
analyzed/addressed in the Final EIS.
The Helena Hunters and Anglers Association (“HHAA”), Clancy-Unionville
Citizens Task Force, and Anaconda Sportsman’s Club offer the following comments
to implementation of a scientifically unsupported proposed amendment to Helena
Forest Plan Standard 4a for big game security (DEIS, Appendix D). The proposal
would negatively affect big game security on Elk Herd Units (EHU) throughout the
planning area, and have an even more acute effect on those EHUs that do not fall
entirely within the Administrative Boundary of the Helena National Forest.
Amendment Alternative B removes the hiding cover component of security. In
addition, all necessary criteria to evaluate the proposed amendment are not

The focus of the amendment erroneously is based on elk population rather than bull
elk survival – the metric that defines security on public lands.

1. The purpose and need for the proposed amendment disguises the motivation
behind an amended big game security standard.
2. Best Available Science is not being used to develop the proposed amendment.
3. The programmatic amendment fails to follow all necessary criteria as set forth in
the Hillis Model and does not describe referenced guidelines for its application.
4. The proposed amendment must recognize the open, topographically gentle “eastside” Helena Forest – and develop alternatives that accurately describe the existing
landscape and its potential.
5. The EIS has misused the State of Montana’s Elk Plan in its use of population data
to reflect elk security and thus gives misleading justification for amending Big
Game Standard 4a (security).
6. To be effective, any big game security standard must be applied for the duration
of the hunting season, from September 1 to December 1.
7. The cumulative impacts of the proposed Big Game Security amendment upon
other Forest Plan Standards have not been adequately evaluated.
8. Cumulative Forest Service actions have led to a tipping point for big game
security across much of the Helena National Forest.
9. The Helena National Forest inappropriately proposes a unique amendment for the
big game security standard for the Divide Travel Plan area.
10. Inadequate and unfunded maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement of
roads/trails and motorized travel as allowed under the Divide Travel Plan, virtually
assures that any standard for big game security will not function properly.
The proposed amendment to Big Game Standard 4a of the Forest Plan of the Helena
National Forest will impact recreational activities of members by reducing wildlife
habitat and recklessly implementing a model that has not been validated for “eastside” forests – something that authors of the model cautioned against. In addition,
the model being used for the amendment is not being applied as was defined by
authors of the model 39-1).

Comment 1. Purpose and Need statements in the proposed amendment disguises the
motivation behind an amended big game security standard.
The stated Purpose and Need in the DEIS does not honestly explain that the HNF
has altered the landscape through impacts from previous cumulative decisions
during which Forest Plan standard 4a (among other standards) has been ignored to
such a degree that the HNF is compelled to now redesign the standard in order to
meet a new, lower standard.
The stated Purpose and Need to amend the Divide big game security standard is:
“This programmatic Forest Plan amendment for the Divide Travel Management
project area is needed to more closely align current science, local conditions, and
other information with the needs of big game, particularly elk, to meet the intent of
the Forest Plan. It considers the impacts of open motorized routes on elk security,
establishes blocks of secure habitat, and can be measured regardless of changes in
hiding cover. While the proposed amendment decouples hiding cover from security
during the hunting season, several Forest-wide and Management Area standards
remain in place that govern management of hiding cover.” (DEIS Appx D, pg 1)

Refer to response 39-2 & 39-3.

(39-2)Three out of six elk herd units in the project area currently
meet Standard 4a (See the Forest Plan amendment, Comparison
of Alternatives/Alternative A).

The existing big game security standard has been an inconvenient obstacle to a
variety of HNF actions. Rather than abide by the limitations imposed by the
standard, the HNF chose to ignore them stating: “The assumptions built into the

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 232

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
existing (1986) standard 4(a) have not proven useful in gauging or guiding
management activities under the Forest Plan.“(39-2)
There is an attempt to correlate elk populations instead of bull elk survival with the
standard by stating: “Actual elk populations and trends as monitored over the last
twenty six years simply do not correlate with this existing standard or its
assumptions. Elk numbers have consistently increased during this time period and
the existing standard needs to be revised to address recent elk management
challenges.”
For the travel planning process, efforts to amend the big game security standard
have been challenging, because it represents an inconvenient truth that the HNF has
over-harvested its forests and over-roaded its lands. The amendment contends that
the existing security standard: “places impractical constraints on Forest management
and on the ability of the public to use the Forest.”
“Impractical constraints on the ability of the public to use the Forest” does not apply
to public hunters, public hikers, public mountain bikers, but rather to motorized
users, who have the same access to the Forest that the other public users have.
Purpose and need (40 CFR 1500.1(b)) – the HNF contends it needs more
management latitude, but the amendment does not assure it will benefit big game.
“High quality” and “accurate scientific analysis essential to implementing NEPA”
has not been displayed.
The solution to the problems is provided in big game Standard 4: “implement an
aggressive road management policy.”
A Forest Plan standard is designed to be just that: a standard for the Forest. A travel
plan should be designed to comply with a Forest Plan Standard, not the other way
around. In the case of Divide, the proposed big game Amendment is subservient to
the Divide Travel Planning Area. This backwards linked action does not disclose the

(1a) The Forest Plan amendment includes an analysis of potential
elk security which addresses the status of security assuming all
Forest Roads are closed and the status of cover. That analysis
concludes that “[s]ome of the herd units experience considerable
increases in security by closing all Forest roads (Greenhorn,
Little Prickly Pear – Ophir, and Quartz Creek). However, as
previously noted several of the Forest roads that are assumed
closed as part of this exercise are located outside of the Travel
Plan project area and have already been subject to a travel plan
decisions (i.e. Soundwood, Clancy Unionville Vegetation
Manipulation and Travel Management Project)”. And,
“[p]otential cover includes existing hiding cover (as described
above) and capable cover, i.e. those areas that are naturally
capable of having relatively dense (> 40%) canopy cover. This is
generally provided by Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, spruce and
lodgepole pine…”
(1b) As part of the Divide Travel Plan, an alternative to meet
Standard 4a was considered but not fully developed. In that
scenario, 5 out of 6 EHUs would meet Standard 4a (compared
with 4 out of 6 in Alternative 5, the most aggressive Alternative
in terms of road closures during the hunting season). Although
that analysis indicates that it’s possible for the Forest to close
enough roads in the Quartz Creek EHU to achieve compliance
with Standard 4a, several of those road miles over which the
Forest has discretion are located outside of the Travel Plan

amendment for the Divide.
1a. Comment Suggestion: The purpose and need for amending the Forest Plan
standard for big game security should be to define a method to bring the forest into
compliance with elk security literature and science based habitat capability of the

project area and have already been subject to a travel plan
decision (i.e. Clancy Unionville Vegetation Manipulation and
Travel Management Project). The few miles of open roads in
Quartz Creek EHU that could be closed as part of the Divide
Travel Plan decision access private land. The Greenhorn EHU
would remain out of compliance with Standard 4a because the
Forest simply does not have sufficient road closure discretion.
See Forest Plan amendment Comparison of
Alternatives/Alternative A/Discussion and Chapter 2 of the FEIS.

Comment 2. Best Available Science is not being used to develop the proposed
amendment.
Pursuant to NEPA, information included in NEPA documents “must be of high
quality” and “accurate scientific analysis [is] essential to implementing NEPA.” 40
C.F.R. § 1500.1(b). While a DEIS may not be expected to reference or rely on every
study or opinion, the state of scientific knowledge on a particular subject must be
fairly represented in a balanced manner. Moreover, a DEIS must contain a reasoned
analysis in response to conflicting data or opinions on environmental issues. The
Forest Service’s decision to replace Standard #4a with an untested, hypothetical
method is not based on the best available science regarding big game management.
Hiding cover is a crucial component of elk security, particularly for bull elk.
The proposed amendment inappropriately removes all cover requirements for
hunting season security – cover that is critically important on the open,
topographically gentle “east-side” Helena Forest – an action that the scientific
literature clearly does not support.1, 2, 3, 4, 5 While much of the literature focuses
on road densities, none of the literature indicates that hiding cover is unimportant for
bull elk survival. With respect to the hunting season and the need for hiding cover,
abundant literature indicates: “elk that survived, decreased movements and showed
avoidance of open areas” ie. They seek hiding cover.
The “security area” approach replaces the “road density/hiding cover index” as the
Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability of elk to hunting. The amendment
derives from the Hillis methodology (1991) and adopts specific guidelines for its

application from Recommendations for Big Game Habitat Management on the
Custer, Gallatin, Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests (MDFWP and
USDA Working Group 2013).
In discussing the proposed big game amendment, the following statement clearly
reveals that the HNF has strayed from the original travel plan intent of the Forest
Plan, and has not aggressively implemented Standard 4 (“implement an aggressive
road management policy”), when it states (DEIS Appendix D-17):
“Alternative A only applies to roads as originally envisioned in the Forest Plan.”

(39-4) The Forest Plan amendment recognizes the role of cover;
Alternative B reflects that by including cover guidelines (See
Forest Plan amendment, Alternative Description/Alternative B).

2a. Comment Suggestion: Utilize the published literature to acknowledge that hiding
cover is a crucial component of elk security, particularly for bull elk. (39-4)
Comment 3. The programmatic amendment fails to follow all necessary criteria as
set forth in the Hillis Model and does not describe referenced guidelines for its
application.
“The amendment derives from the Hillis methodology (1991) and adopts specific
guidelines for its application from Recommendations for Big Game Habitat
Management on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests
(MFWP/FS Big Game Working Group, 2012).” (DEIS 491)
The referenced “specific guidelines from Recommendations for Big Game Habitat
Management” are not described or further referenced, yet the entire amendment is
said to be based upon them. Lacking specifics regarding the guidelines of a working
group document, it must be assumed that the Hillis Model as described in peerreviewed literature is being applied. (39-5)
The Hillis Model7 defines three criteria that are required to make the model function
for west-side forests, with a caveat that all three must be increased in areas having
more open cover and less topographic relief -- such as east-side forests. These
criteria include:
· size of forest cover blocks: larger is better; minimum size of 250 acres; cover
blocks are enhanced with least edge/more topography/important natural features

(39-5) Specific recommendations from the U.S. Forest Service
and Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks
Collaborative Overview and Recommendations for Elk Habitat
Management (2013) [Recommendations] have been applied as
follows:
The Recommendations paper suggest the following: In regards
to elk security, the period September 1 – October 14, i.e. for the
archery season, in addition to the standard October 15 –
November 30/December 1 time period, i.e. the rifle season
should be considered relative to public routes used by any
motorized vehicle. Forest Plan amendment Alternative B defines
the hunting season as 9/1 to 12/1 to recognize the effects of
archery season on elk.

recommended strategies to address the situation (including the
use of Hillis et. al. 1991 concepts). Recommended habitat

security areas (e.g. 500 acres, etc.)…Forest Plan amendment
Alternative B was developed collaboratively with MDFWP to
reflect local conditions. Security areas were increased to a
minimum of 1000 acres to reflect those conditions (See Forest
Plan amendment, Alternative Description/Alternative B).

(39-5a) Refer to response 39-5.
Actual language from The Hillis Model (1991), with regard to the size of cover
blocks, states: “…managers should strive to retain, perpetuate, or replace the largest
security areas possible.” In the Clark Fork area where the Hillis Model was
developed, “cover is dense, terrain is steep, and forest communities are largely unfragmented… under less favorable conditions, the minimum [cover patch size] must
be greater than 250 acres.” Conditions on the Helena National Forest can be
described as less than favorable since dense cover is not characteristic of the Helena,
the terrain is relatively gentle, and the forest communities are overly endowed with
motorized routes (there are approximately 2000 miles of road on the HNF according
to the 2004 HNF Roads Analysis). (39-5a)
The shape of the cover patch is important. A cover patch with the least amount of
edge and the greatest width generally will be the most effective(39-6); i.e. shape of
secure cover patch should be round or condensed; long irregularly shaped cover
patches need greater buffers or they will not provide adequate security.
Actual language from Hillis et al. (1991) with regard to distance from roads states:
“Generally, security areas become more effective the farther they are from an open
road. … the minimum distance between a security area and an open road should be
one half mile… Failure to accomplish this function will reduce the effective size of
the security area and may render it ineffective.” (Ibid.)

(39-6)Forest Plan amendment Alternative B defines elk security
as “..a proportion of an elk herd unit within the administrative
boundary of the Helena Ranger District that consists of an area of
at least 1000 acres in size that is at least ½ mile from a motorized
route open to the public between 9/1 and 12/1. Security blocks
are adjusted for constrictions less than or equal to ½ mile in
width. Security is calculated across all ownerships within the
administrative boundary”. Width and shape are accounted for
through this definition ((See Forest Plan amendment, Alternative
Description/Alternative B

as part of the Comparison of Alternatives (See that section in the
Forest Plan amendment).

Response to Comments

Analysis of existing cover patches within the Divide Travel area are not provided—
information that is necessary to assess whether the proposed amendment would even
come close to meeting the provisions of the model.(39-7)
Open road location plays a large role in defining whether cover patches will actually
provide security, particularly where they funnel people to the edge of security areas
or when they occur above and below security patches.
“When cover is poor and terrain is gentle, it may require a distance of more than one
half mile from open roads before security is effective.” (Ibid.)
One-half mile is accepted as the standard without discussion, even though
circumstances may require a greater distance.
As Hillis notes, even closed roads compromise security areas: “as closed road
densities increase both within the security area and buffer…the minimum distance
between open roads and security areas must increase.” (Ibid.) (39-7)
In open country this caveat is even more important because areas that might be
considered “secure” are not when they are compromised by miles of closed roads
that serve as easy travel conduits for hunters. This fact is not discussed in the DEIS.
(39-7)
Actual language from Hillis et al. (ibid.) with regard to analysis unit states: “First, a
standardized ‘habitat analysis unit’ (Lyon and Christensen 1990) must be described.
To be biologically meaningful, analysis unit boundaries should be defined by the elk
herd home range (Edge et al. 1986), and more specifically by the local herd home
range during hunting season. Typically, the hunting season home-range includes the
local herd transitional-range and at least the upper edge of winter range. These
boundaries should be verified in advance by radio telemetry, particularly where elk
vulnerability is at issue. Without telemetry data, biologists should test their homerange predictions against the experience of reliable local hunters and outfitters.

(39-7)Forest Plan amendment Alternative B includes a
discussion of the effects of closed roads on elk security with the
following conclusion:
“The presence of a motorized route closed during this period did
not disqualify an area from being considered a security area or
intermittent refuge area. These closed routes could facilitate
hunter access and improve hunter success; likely a function of
elk remaining in the ‘secure’ area longer and in greater numbers
(Basile and Lonner 1979, Hillis et al. 1991, Unsworth and Kuck
1991). However, if security and/or intermittent areas were
determined by open and closed motorized routes, several areas
that currently do provide security for elk – or could upon
implementation of the Divide Travel Plan decision - would have
been eliminated from consideration.” See Forest Plan
amendment, Comparison of Alternatives/Alternative
B/Discussion. See also the section Alternative
Description/Alternative B/Discussion.

(39-8)Forest Plan amendment Alternative B discusses the
rationale for confining the security standard to that portion of the
herd unit within the administrative boundary. Private land within
that area is included in the definition and analysis. The

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 237

Analysis units should not be adjusted for land ownership; instead, they should
reflect the cumulative habitat conditions perceived by elk.”
In fact, the proposed amendment seeks to modify the Hillis Model by not applying it
to the Elk Herd Unit, but rather the HNF Administrative Boundary – this is
specifically what Hillis et al. say not to do (39-8). The proposed programmatic
amendment language is as follows (DEIS Appendix D-17): “Implement an
aggressive road management program to maintain or improve big game security.
This will be accomplished in the Divide Landscape of the Helena National Forest by
way of the following: When security areas comprise more than 30% of that portion
of an elk herd unit within the HNF administrative boundary, management activities
shall not reduce the amount of security areas during the rifle season (approximately
October 15 through December 1) to less than 30%. Where security areas comprise
30% or less of that portion of an elk herd unit within the HNF administrative
boundary during the general rifle season, management activities shall not result in a
further reduction.”

Response to Comments
discussion in the Forest Plan amendment points out that herd
units in the Divide landscape are quite large, even those portions
within the administrative boundary. See Forest Plan amendment,
Alternative Description/Alternative B/Discussion.

So the Amendment would allow reduction of security even though much of the area
needs security greater than 30% as noted by Hillis et al. due to bull elk vulnerability.
“Elk vulnerability increases when less than 30% of an analysis unit is comprised of
security areas. (Canfield 1991) Where bull survival objectives are high, it may be
necessary to retain greater than 30% of the analysis unit in security… Minimum
percentage of an analysis area that must function as security is 30%-- more when
bull survival objectives must be met.”
The Hillis Model clearly indicates that a minimum of 30% of the EHU or larger area
is necessary for security. However, the proposed amendment makes no provision for
more than 30% security even though the Helena National Forest is lacking in
rugged, broken topography, lacks continuous conifer cover and is highly fragmented
with roads. Neither does the proposed amendment describe, for this particular
landscape, what the ideal security percentage should be. However, Hillis et al.
(1991) is clear that provisions of the Model would have to be expanded for open,

Comments
gentle forests such as on the Helena Forest. Again, the proposed amendment
specifically thwarts this most important provision by allowing for only 30% elk
security, and then only within the HNF Administrative Boundary. Limiting
application of security to within the Administrative Boundary only, would
artificially shrink big game security even further.

Response to Comments

The schematic below demonstrates shrinkage of security when the administrative
boundary of the HNF only – is considered in the 30% requirement.

HNF to right of the line is all in forest cover. To right of the line is 30% of the EHU.
To the left of the line is private or other ownership that has no forest cover. Below
the dotted line would be 30% of total forest cover, or only 11% of EHU.
Elk Herd Unit (EHU) is designated above by seasonal elk distribution (yellow area).
In the above example – to the right of the line is forested cover (entirely and
exclusively on HNF and making up roughly 30% of the total EHU but 100% of the
security cover). Left of the line is private and state land with little or no forest cover.
The entire EHU falls within the current forest plan standard 4a for security for an
Elk Herd Unit and requires retention of all forest cover because it constitutes 30% of

(39-9)For the purposes of analyses and cumulative effects of
past, ongoing, and reasonably foreseeable activities, the herd unit
will continue to serve as the basis for those analyses.
Furthermore, other Forest Plan standards that govern hiding
cover will remain in place – in other words, it’s not realistic to
assume that in this example 2/3 of forested cover within the
administrative boundary. See the Forest Plan amendment,
Background section, for the list of standards that will remain in
place.

the EHU.

Response to Comments

An Elk Herd Unit might extend across various land ownerships (as described in the
Hillis Model) but only that portion within the HNF Administrative Boundary would
be considered when management activities are planned. If the EHU consisted of
30% forested cover, but most or all of that cover occurred on the
HNF (a very real example), the amendment would then potentially allow removal of
2/3 of the forest cover within the Administrative Boundary (39-9). This would meet
the proposed standard by allowing 30% cover to remain within the administrative
boundary. But actually, across the entire EHU, cover would be depleted down to
11% over the elk herd unit. In short, the new proposed standard’s criteria of 30%
security within the Administrative Boundary of the HNF completely circumvents
the intent of the Hillis Model which states: “Analysis units should not be adjusted
for land ownership; instead, they should reflect the cumulative habitat conditions
perceived by elk.” (Hillis et al. 1991, pg. 39)
Our example is quite realistic in that the Helena National Forest, by definition, is
where the trees are and thus big game security cover occurs largely on National
Forest lands. In other documents (Blackfoot Travel Plan DEIS-494) the HNF notes
the following, but then neither the Divide nor the Blackfoot amendment is modified
to take into account the need for security across the entire Elk Herd Unit (NOT just
within the HNF Administrative Boundary): “Hillis et al. have recommended at least
30 percent of the fall range in each analysis area, such as a herd unit or larger
management area, be maintained as elk security areas if elk vulnerability is to be
effectively tempered during the hunting season. Herd units with security above the
30 percent threshold allow for considerably more flexibility in the management of
forest vegetation and the road/motor trail network than those that remain below the
30 percent security level.”
Montana Backcountry Hunters & Anglers contacted two principle authors of the
1991 Hillis Paradigm paper, and requested their response to the Helena’s proposal to
apply the model to the Helena forest conditions. Below is their response:

only escape areas available. See the section Alternative

Comment 4. The proposed amendment must recognize the open, topographically
gentle “east-side” Helena Forest – and develop alternatives that accurately describe
the existing landscape and its potential.
DEIS Appendix D states: “The ‘security area’ approach replaces the “road
density/hiding cover index” as the Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability
of elk to hunting. The amendment derives from the Hillis
methodology (1991) and adopts specific guidelines for its application from
Recommendations for Big Game Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin,
Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests (MDFWP and USDA Working
Group 2013).”
Yet, Appendix D of the Divide DEIS does not describe “specific guidelines for its
application” as per the MDFWP and USDA Working Group.
And most distressingly, the amendment has no intention of meeting even the
minimum criteria to provide big game security when it states: “Where security areas
comprise 30% or less of that portion of an elk herd unit within the HNF

administrative boundary during the general rifle season, management activities shall

Response to Comments

The amendment therefore accepts a level of security below the minimum threshold
if an EHU is currently below 30%, with no directive to bring it up to minimum
levels. In addition, the standard does not prevent EHUs that are above the minimum
of 30% from being reduced to the minimum 30% threshold through “actions” by the
HNF. Neither of these scenarios is acceptable as a starting point for big game
security on the Divide landscape. The Standard as worded in the DEIS is as follows,
but no mention is made of hiding cover: STANDARD
Implement an aggressive road management program to maintain or improve big
game security. This will be accomplished in the Divide Landscape of the Helena
National Forest by way of the following: When security areas comprise more than
30% of that portion of an elk herd unit within the HNF administrative boundary,
management activities shall not reduce the amount of security areas during the rifle
season (approximately October 15 through December 1) to less than 30%. Where
security areas comprise 30% or less of that portion of an elk herd unit within the
HNF administrative boundary during the general rifle season, management activities
shall not result in a further reduction.
Definition
Security Area – a block of big game habitat, 250 acres or larger, that is generally at
least ½ mile from any open motorized route during the rifle big game hunting
season (10/15 – 12/1).
Hillis et al. (1991) clearly indicates that for forests east of the Continental Divide
having more open and gentle terrain, security patch sizes should be enlarged,
roadless buffers around cover should be enlarged, and the percentage of the area
serving as security should be enlarged. These provisions have not been adequately
addressed in the proposed amendment.
Language about the proposed amendment simply states (DEIS Glossary-9) that a
“Security Area” is “Any area which, because of its geography, topography, and/or

vegetation, will hold elk during periods of stress. For this project, a security area is
defined as a block of dense forested cover at least 250 acres in size and located at
least 1/2 mile from any roads open to motorized traffic during the general hunting
season.” These criteria are inadequate according to Hillis et al.

Response to Comments

An analysis of the Hillis Model was conducted for the Bighorn National Forest of
northeastern Wyoming10 (39-11). The Bighorn National Forest lies east of the
continental divide, and like the Helena National Forest, the terrain is more open with
less topographical relief than west-side forests. The Wyoming study clearly
indicates that cover is essential to elk survival on the Bighorn National Forest and its
findings run counter to the un-validated amendment being proposed for the Helena
National Forest: “Research indicates the importance of various aspects of cover to
elk survival through hunting seasons. Providing adequate security areas for elk make
them harder for hunters to find, therefore, allowing liberal hunting opportunities that
are less costly in terms of elk vulnerability. For instance, starting in the mid-1960s,
accelerated timber harvesting on the Big Horn Mountains sent former elk hiding
cover to the sawmills as logging roads permeated previously secluded areas. With
better access and a booming economy, the Bighorn National Forest became deluged
with hunters by the mid 1970’s. Responding to public concerns about the quality of
the hunt, and fewer mature bulls (a symptom of rising elk vulnerability), the WGFD
cut elk hunting seasons and switched to limited-quota permits. This resulted in a
long-term decrease in elk hunting recreational opportunities. Today, approximately
one-third the number of hunters and recreation days found in the 1960’s, 70’s and
80’s remain. The loss of hunting opportunity not only affects hunters; it also means
a loss of hunting license revenues for wildlife management programs and loss of
income to the state’s economy.”
Wyoming researcher B. Jellison11, in evaluating application of the Hillis Model to
the Bighorn National Forest which has open landscapes typical of east-side Montana
forests, states: “Rather than imposing more restrictions on hunters (shorter hunting
seasons, antler restrictions, limited licenses and technology limitations), one
alternative is to maintain habitat security levels that allow desired numbers of bull

elk to escape harvest…”

Response to Comments

“It should be noted that the above guidelines [Hillis Model] were developed for
steep, heavily forested habitats of Western Montana. The Big Horn Mountains, with
large natural openings and gentle high elevation slopes, provide less security from
hunting pressure and other stress induced human activities. Large openings make elk
more detectable and gentle slopes provide easier hunter access (Burcham and
Jellison 1993). For this reason, we contacted authors of the Hillis paper to get their
ideas on security area guidelines for the BNF. Mike Hillis (pers. comm. 1992)
recommended applying the model by increasing minimum parameters. He suggested
that security area might approximate one mile from open roads and 500 acres in
size. Jack Lyon (pers. comm. 1992), Mike Hillis (pers. comm. 1992), and Les
Marcum (pers. comm. 1992) all agreed that security guidelines would be most
effective if applied to the portions of the Big Horn Mountains where relatively
continuous cover exists. Although we initially applied these more restricted
parameters suggested by Hillis, the computer model found that few areas met these
requirements. Consequently, only the original parameters were mapped and
analyzed in this report.”
The Bighorn National Forest analysis found that forested cover had been reduced to
24% of its biological potential since pre-forest plan levels of the 1960s. The Bighorn
National Forest could not meet the required 30% security for an analysis unit
(Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Sheridan Region 2004). Although they did
not analyze how hiding cover might be restored, they did note that hunter
opportunity on the Bighorn National Forest has plummeted as a result of
“accelerated timber harvesting… [that] sent former elk hiding cover to the sawmills
and logging roads permeating previously secluded areas”
(39-12)See responses to 4a and 4c below.
The Wyoming researcher B. Jellison12 determined: “approximately one-third the
number of hunters were found as in the 1970s and 1980s. The loss of hunting
opportunity not only affects hunters; it also means a loss of hunting license
revenues for Wyoming’s wildlife management programs and a loss of income to the

Response to Comments

An analysis of forested cover equivalent to that of the Bighorn NF has not been
conducted to determine whether the Hillis Model could even approach functionality
for big game security on the HNF. We recommend that this be done.(39-12)
Hillis et al. (1991) noted in their concluding statements for their research in western
Montana: “Two disturbing trends were discovered. First, most herd units already
had less than the minimum 30% security due to past timber harvest; in many of
these cases, there were strong indications that bull survival was declining or at risk.
Second, even in situations where security was substantially less than 30%, all
remaining security stands were targeted for timber harvest. This indicates that
timber harvest decisions made over the next few years will potentially severely
impact remaining security, and, ultimately, hunter opportunity. Additional research
is needed to test and refine these guidelines… Planning must not only address the
quality and spatial arrangement of existing security areas, but also must provide for
the regeneration of
replacement security areas where a sustained timber harvest is desired.”

(39-13) See response to 4b below.

We are concerned that the HNF has not addressed the presence/absence of its forests
and that omission is camouflaging years and years of serious decline in big game
security.
Clearly the HNF has struggled to abide by forest plan standard 4a (39-13) The
following table taken from a 2011 report, Divide Travel Plan: Background
Information for Forest Plan Site-Specific Amendment of Big Game Security
Standards, and compared to information provided in the Divide DEIS reveals that
methodology to describe hiding cover varies from project to project. Some of the
EHUs have apparently increased in hiding cover since 2011 (from 41% to 59% on
Spotted Dog) while other have apparently dropped significantly (from 55% to 30%
on Greenhorn), and yet others stayed the same (Quartz at 44%).
From this information, the public cannot decipher what is going on.

The proposed big game security standard for Divide would start with existing
forested spots of 250 acres which are buffered by a distance of at least ½ mile from
a road. Where there are areas that are larger than 250 acres, for example 1000 acres,
the FS could manage for the minimum of 250 acres, thus cutting the existing 1000
acre block down to only 25% of the original size. In an area seriously lacking
security, this would not be acceptable.

Hiding Cover Methodology section.

4a. Comment suggestion: HNF undertake a well defined process to quantify, at least
on the Divide landscape, the biological/vegetative potential of the Travel Planning
Area, as well as the proportion of the landscape that is not meeting that potential.
This information is likely already available on the HNF. (39-14)
4b. Comment suggestion: HNF vegetative cover types should be classified as to
whether they are capable of providing elk hiding cover at a 40% canopy closure.
This metric must be clearly described.(39-15)
· Does the 40% canopy closure involve trees that are of at least of a certain height?
· Does 40% mean that 40% of the ground is covered at a height of at least 8 feet (the
height of a bull elk and his antlers)?
· Does the 40% closure account for steep terrain where security is reduced such as a
situation in which a person on a road on a side hill can look across the drainage and
see down through the canopy cover?
· Is there an option for hiding cover on relatively flat ground that could use the
Forest Service definition of hiding cover where 90% of an elk at 200 feet is
obscured? This might occur in regenerating clearcuts, or even dense tall sagebrush.
4c. Comment suggestion: We recommend an analysis similar to that conducted on
the Big Horn National Forest in Wyoming.13 Such an analysis would put to rest the
question, “What is the capability of the Helena National Forest to provide big game
hiding cover (potential and actual hiding cover in acres)?” The Wyoming report
addresses big game security in Strategy 3: “Strategy 3: Detect natural and
anthropogenic temporal changes to elk habitats using Landsat TM or similar sensor
data every five years. These techniques are proven to be an efficient and cost
effective means of gauging federal agency progress towards managing and
preserving their elk habitats. The data also facilitates landscape analysis and allows
biologists to determine issues and formulate solutions, irrespective of land
ownership and accessibility of habitats.”

4d. Comment Suggestion: The Hillis Model provides important guidelines, and the
Wyoming research provides a method to evaluate the status of forested cover on the
HNF. It is time that the east-side forests conduct such an analysis (east-side forests
as referenced in the DEIS: Lewis and Clark, Custer, Gallatin), on how concepts of
Hillis et al., combined with a cover analysis as per the Wyoming design might be
beneficially modified to provide big game security on these more gentle, and less
densely forested landscapes.(39-17)
5. The EIS has misused the State of Montana’s Elk Plan in its use of population data
to reflect elk security and thus gives misleading justification for amending Big
Game Standard 4a (security).

(39-19) The final analysis for the Forest Plan amendment
includes a discussion on the correlation between Standard 4a and
elk numbers and concludes that there is not a strong correlation
between consistency with Standard 4a for a particular EHU and
the actual performance of the elk population within the relative
Hunting District. We do not make the case that elk population
levels are independent of hiding cover but rather that
“[c]ompliance, or lack thereof, with Standard 4a is not a good

The DEIS erroneously states that elk population levels are independent of hiding
cover because in some areas elk populations are strong even though cover has
declined as a result of insect infestations. (39-18) An inverse relationship is likely
present between elk populations and hiding cover, wherein a lack of hiding cover
leads to displacement of elk to more secure private lands where elk numbers cannot
be managed. Concluding that hiding cover is not an issue for elk populations is an
erroneous interpretation of security. Bull elk survival reflects security as described
by the Montana Elk Plan, not elk population numbers.

Response to Comments
indicator of elk population performance given the patterns of
land ownership and other factors affecting elk security and/or
population levels”. See the Forest Plan amendment, Relationship
of Forest Plan Standardr 4a and Elk Management/Correlation
between Standard 4a and Elk Numbers section.

Bull elk provide the majority of elk hunting opportunity in Montana. Cow elk
generally are hunted on a permit basis. When security is inadequate on public lands,
acceptable bull:cow ratios (bull populations) cannot be maintained. The Montana
Elk Plan (2005) defines minimum bull:cow ratios for each Elk Management Unit.
The desired ratios are not being regularly achieved within the Hunting Districts that
constitute the six Elk Herd Units within the Divide Travel Area. The DEIS correctly
indicates that excessive roads are the leading cause of low bull ratios, but it
inappropriately concludes that forest cover is unimportant.
The MFWP Elk Plan explains that in hunting districts that have public lands, elk
populations can be controlled with antlerless elk permits only if elk security is
adequate on public lands. In other words, public lands must be able to “hold” elk via
adequate security so they will not be displaced to private, unhuntable private lands.
When elk are displaced to private lands, population levels cannot be controlled with
hunting seasons. The DEIS wrongly concludes that the current elk numbers which
are, at times, above elk population Objectives, are evidence that present elk security
is sufficient. In fact, MFWP has documented movement of elk to private lands
within the Divide planning area where hunting of elk is extremely limited or not
allowed.
Due to lack of hiding cover security and excessive road density, displacement of elk
from HNF public lands has occurred on all portions of the HNF, resulting in elk
displacement to private lands and game damage complaints from private

(39-20)Recent elk data collected by MFWP indicate that three of
the four hunting districts are at bull:cow objectives (HDs 215,
335, and 343). The other HD, 293, is below objectives most

landowners. So, when:
1) security is not adequate on public lands,
2) elk are displaced to private lands,
3) public hunting opportunity is diminished, and then
4) wildlife numbers become unmanageable.
Of the four MFWP hunting districts that make up the six EHUs on the Divide
landscape, half are below or just barely meeting the minimum bull:cow objectives.
The other half are just barely above the minimum objective. This is not a strong
testament to security for bull elk. (39-20)

Response to Comments
likely due to predation effects in the northern part of that HD
(which is outside of the travel plan area). See the table’ MFWP
2005 population objectives and recent trend data in Hunting
Districts that Overlap with the Forest’ in the Forest Plan
amendment and the discussion for HD 293 also in the Forest Plan
amendment in the Relationship of Forest Plan Standard 4a and
Elk Management/Factors Influencing Elk Management/Hunting
District 293 section.

So the DEIS is mixing apples and oranges. It does not focus on survival of the bull
elk component of the population, which provides the bulk of hunter opportunity, but
rather it delves into total elk population issues to assert that because some elk
populations are meeting population objectives, the lack of cover is irrelevant. Of
course a lack of cover on public lands is very likely why elk numbers are increasing,
as large numbers of elk move from insecure habitat to non-hunted private lands.
In addition to hiding cover, bull elk survival is correlated with road density.
Unsworth et al. (2001) notes that the probability of mortality for a bull elk is 50
percent greater in an area with one mile of road per section than an unroaded area.
Two miles of road/section doubles the mortality probability, and athigher road
densities bulls usually do not survive the hunting season.
Abundantly clear is the fact that the Divide landscape has too many roads:
“Total road density in the Divide landscape averages 2.07 mi/mi²; open road density
is 1.69 mi/mi²; weighted open road density (calculating arterial and collector routes
at 100% of length; local roads at 25% of length) is 0.90 mi/mi².” (DEIS 250)
There appears to be a great deal of opportunity to reduce road density on this overly
roaded landscape that has 2.07 mi/mi2. This is an amount that more than doubles the
probability of mortality for a bull elk.

(39-21)Discrepancies between the Forestwide Hazardous Tree
and Fuel ReductionProject and the Divide EIS are due to better
data. In fact, there are differences in data between the Divide
DEIS and FEIS because better data have become available. See
the Forest Plan amendment, Changes between Draft and Final

ratios. Management implications for forested cover would be relaxed with the
proposed amendment to allow more forest cover removal and thus an amended
standard could lead to more cover removal or greater road density, to not “place
impractical constraints on Forest management and on the ability of the public to use
the Forest.” The possibility and even likelihood of reducing cover even further if the
proposed amendment is implemented would not be in the best interest of bringing
bull numbers up to or even slightly above objective.
5a. Comment Suggestion: Acknowledge that bull elk vulnerability on public lands
is the basis of defining elk security on public lands. (39-22)
5b. Comment Suggestion: A combination of principles regarding security from
Hillis et al.14, along with an evaluation of existing and potential forest cover as per
Jellison15 should be explored to design and implement an amendment that reflects
bull elk security on public lands. (39-23)
6. To be effective, any big game security standard must be applied for the duration
of the hunting season, from September 1 to December 1.
The archery season extends from the first Saturday in September for approximately
5 weeks generally until one week before the opening of the general rifle season,
which occurs in the latter half of October. Archery hunting is becoming more and
more popular and comprises a growing percentage of all hunterdays afield. We
suspect that when evaluating public lands, the relative number of bow hunters as
compared to rifle hunters is even higher. We find application of the proposed big
game security amendment to apply only to the general rifle season -- a serious
oversight that ignores the displacement impacts by bow hunters. There are about
40,000 licensed bow hunters in Montana and most hunt at least part of the season on
public lands, including the Divide Travel Plan area. Grigg16 and others have
documented the displacement of elk to private lands due to bow hunting activity.
The distribution of bow hunters into the most secure habitats likely exceeds the
distribution of rifle hunters because of longer hunting daylight in late summer/early
fall, better travel conditions with a general lack of snow, and travel restrictions that

other Forest Plan Standards have not been adequately evaluated.
Indirect and cumulative effects of the proposed Amendment on other forest plan
standards were not adequately evaluated.
Pursuant to the National Forest Management Act (“NFMA”), the Service must
ensure that the proposed amendment (as well as the proposed Divide Travel Plan) is
consistent with the Helena Forest Plan. See 16 U.S.C. § 1604 (i). If not, then the
responsible official must either change the proposed amendment to bring it into
compliance with the other standards in the Forest Plan or amend to the other Forest
Plan standards.
Appendix B of the DEIS lists various projects that have occurred on the HNF. There
is no analysis presented regarding cumulative effects of these projects upon Forest
Plan Standard 4a or the proposed Amendment Alternative B. There is no evaluation
of the consequences of the proposed Amendment upon other Forest Plan standards.
By focusing on elk alone, other big game species such as mule deer, white-tailed
deer, moose, and bear – are being ignored. A big game standard designed for elk
alone is insufficient. Behavioral traits and habitat niche selection – set mule deer and
moose apart from elk.

8. Cumulative Forest Service actions have lead to a tipping point for big game
security across much of the Helena National Forest.
Cumulative impacts are “the impacts on the environment which result from the
incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably
foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or
person undertakes such other actions.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7.
Cumulative impacts can result from “individually minor but collectively significant
actions taking place over a period of time.”
Helena Forest Plan IV/2 states, “Within this guidance, projects are developed to
most efficiently and effectively accomplish the management goals and objectives.

All NEPA requirements will be complied with in all projects. This includes

Response to Comments

Failure to address HNF actions, through honest cumulative effects analysis, has lead
to the erroneous conclusion that big game standard 4(a) has been ineffective. The
real problems are road proliferation and vegetative cover that has systematically
been depleted largely through repeated “Finding of No Significant Impact”
(FONSI), RODs, DNs and other decisions on Forest lands. Cover-loss impacts have
accumulated over the 28-year life of the Helena National Forest Plan – a blind eye
has been turned to big game security by the HNF for a long time.
The Divide analysis area is 243 square miles as indicated in the DEIS-62: “The
analysis area consists of National Forest System lands in the Divide Travel
Management Area. This includes approximately 155,480 acres of public land
located in Lewis & Clark and Powell counties. The area encompasses Black
Mountain and extends from the Tenmile drainage west to the Little Blackfoot and
Bison Mountain area.”

(39-30)The Forest Plan amendment includes a discussion of
existing cover in security areas (See the Forest Plan Amendment
Findings Required by Laws…/National Environmental Policy
Act/Alternative B/Cover as well as potential cover in security
areas (See the Potential Elk Security section).

The percentage of the analysis area capable of producing forested cover is not
disclosed in the DEIS, but should be provided. (39-30)
Several actions that have occurred on the HNF over the years are not presented in
the Cumulative Effects Tables (eg. Sweeney Creek, Bryant Creek), but the
information that is presented indicate that through timber sales alone, more than
12,000 acres, or at least 18.75 square miles of forest have been removed since 1990.
How much of this has regenerated to hide an elk? Also associated with these sales,
at least 7 miles of new road have been constructed, 6 miles of existing road have
been widened and straightened, and 5 additional miles have been reconstructed. So,
significant percentage of forest cover has been removed since 1990. And now the
HNF presses for a new big game security amendment, because the old one is
limiting its legal ability to continue removing hiding cover or increase road density.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 256

Response to Comments
Code language for this seems to be “the standard 4(a) has not proven useful in
gauging or guiding management activities under the Forest Plan” and… “impractical
constraints on Forest management and on the ability of the public to use the Forest”.
The upshot is, the Forest Service now contends it cannot meet its own security
standard: “Hiding cover has declined to levels that cannot be counterbalanced by
any degree of road closures.”
Collectively, the information in DEIS Appendix B represent only a portion of
activities that have occurred on the Helena Ranger District. Not all of the
information relevant to evaluating cumulative effects is present, but acreage of
forest removal has been substantial. Implementation of these and the other projects,
as well as Forest Plan amendments that have not been adequately analyzed in the
full context of forest cover loss, demonstrates that the HNF simply has chosen not to
abide by the forest plan standard for big game security. The Forest Service knew
that these projects would severely affect hiding cover and thus compliance with the
Forest Plan security standard 4a. But instead of addressing bull elk vulnerability and
antlerless elk displacement to more secure private areas, the HNF erroneously shifts
the emphasis to elk populations: “All of the Forest Plan amendments described
above with the exception of the Divide Travel Plan Amendment have been or would
be site-specific in time and space. None of the past amendments has resulted in
significant impacts to elk; nor should the proposed site-specific amendments
significantly impact elk. Cumulatively, effects to elk hiding cover from this and
other site-specific Forest Plan amendments should not compromise the Forest's
ability to provide habitat potential to meet Forest Plan elk population goals.”
(emphasis added – taken from the Blackfoot big game security Amendment
FEIS)(39-31)

(39-31) The Forest Plan amendment has been updated to describe
bull elk vulnerability. This information is included throughout
the amendment; see particularly the following sections:
Background/Recent Science regarding Elk Management,
Background/The Concept of Elk Security Areas, and Findings
Required by Laws, Regulations, and Policies/National
Environmental Policy Act/Cumulative Effects of Other Forest
Plan Amendments. More importantly, the Forest Plan included
standards to provide big game habitat based on state population
goals in place at the time the Forest Plan was crafted (See Forest
Plan amendment Background/Relationship of Forest Plan
Standard 4a and Elk Management/Forest Plan Elk Population
Goals). The analysis in the Forest Plan amendment describes the
relationship of Alternative B with those goals and objectives
envisioned in 1986. The analysis finds that “[a]mending
Standard 4a would not affect the Forest’s ability to realize the elk
population potential established in the Forest Plan”. See the
Forest Plan amendment Findings Required by Laws,
Regulations, and Policies/National Forest Management Act.

In the context of amending the big game security standard, the DEIS lists but does
not fully reveal the cumulative loss of hiding cover that is currently impacting
security. It is important that the pending ROD be based on relevant analytical factors
that affect big game security.

Where is the analysis across the Divide landscape that describe what proportion of
the forest is currently denuded? A discussion of the Divide’s habitat potential is not
addressed. It is relevant to know whether the HNF compares to the Bighorn National
Forest where it was found that forested cover had been reduced to 24% of its
biological potential since pre-forest plan levels of the 1960s.”
In addition to timber sales, fragmentation of critically important Roadless Areas is a
concern (Jericho/Black Mountain, Bison Mountain). The HFRA Hazard Tree
Project had the following effects:
o 136.2 miles of road and 66 different road segments within the Divide landscape
were “treated” and routes in two IRAs were improved
o IRAs constitute extremely important big game security areas – but the
functionality of these areas for security were reduced as a result of the Hazard Tree
decision, even though HHAA submitted comments18 and filed an Objection19
requesting that this action not proceed until HNF Forest Travel Planning for
Blackfoot and Divide was completed. The HHAA Objection was denied.
o The Hazard Tree decision was supposed to be based on Wildland Urban Interface
(WUI) maps, and roads within those areas were to have received “treatment”.
However only 110.2 miles of road occurred in the WUI, and 380.8 miles of road did
not. Nevertheless, all 491 miles of road were rubber stamped for “treatment” which
involved tree removal along the road extending out 125’-150’, and grading and
gravelling the surface in many cases. Many dead-end spur roads and road that were
closing themselves due to lack of use and vegetation encroachment, were allowed to
be reopened – all affecting, or potentially affecting, Forest Plan big game standards
1, 3, 4 (a, b, c, g, h), and 5.
o That action allowed treatment (removal of dead and live timber and possible
surface improvement) of more than 491 miles of road and created 9,415 acres of
disturbance (Hazard Tree EA pg 23) across the HNF – substantially impacting big
game summer range hiding cover, fall security, winter thermal cover, and other
wildlife requirements.

Forest Plan Amendments
Cumulative effects of previous Forest Plan Amendments upon big game security

Tree project and incremental losses that are dismissed as irrelevant even though the
EHUs are already below standard. (39-32)
· 300’ Rule
The 300’ rule is present in all alternatives. In at least one alternative this provision
should have been absent.
“Motorized use within 300-feet of open motorized routes is an action that
potentially affects all wildlife species and/or their habitat.”20
The 300’ rule was to have been used judiciously in areas of dispersed camping. It
was not to have been applied in a blanket fashion across the Forest.
Allowing vehicle travel for dispersed camping for up to 300 feet from a designated
travel route will affect a large amount of land thus pushing back security areas from
roads, even farther.
300 feet on either side of a road equates to 600 feet of potential vehicle use.
This is a significant action for which resource impacts have not been specifically
evaluated within the DEIS or considered as part of the alternatives evaluation.
Maintenance and enforcement budgets are inadequate to address the current road
system, let alone expanded motorized use in a 600’ swath along all roads.
o The HNF has acknowledged that enforcement of travel plans is difficult and that
they do not have the resources to monitor for illegal travel activities. Therefore, this
decision alone, to allow a 600’ swath of motorized use along roadways will certainly
have a significant impact on big game security, hiding cover, vegetation, soil, water
resources, and riparian areas. The DEIS does not state how site-specific problems
will be addressed once they are discovered.
This is an insurmountable problem because road maintenance resources are already
woefully lacking21.
The HNF itself has severely violated its own Forest Plan Standards and will

resource impacts associated with cross-country travel and preventing establishment
of numerous new spur roads to dispersed campsites.

portion of the Forest when similar conditions are present throughout. The Helena

Forest Plan amendment Alternative Description/Alternative B
section). Because this Forest Plan amendment is programmatic
in nature, it would replace Standard 4a for all future management
activities.
(39-39)This is outside the scope of the Forest Plan amendment.

We are concerned that conflicting procedure and policy decisions emanating from
the Divide Travel Planning area will have conflicting consequences upon the
Clancy-Unionville portion of the Divide Travel Plan. The proposed amendment
would be at variance with the decision that was rendered in 2003 for the ClancyUnionville travel planning area. That decision came with the clear understanding
that existing Forest Plan standards would be applied to this area. Thus a change in a
Forest Plan standard after the fact is a connected action that has not been addressed.
(39-38)
Other East-side Forests have similar big game security issues. Therefore we request
that this big game amendment process be abandoned in favor of an Eastside Forest
process that is more comprehensive and applies proper scientific method and peerreviewed scientific literature. We suggest a process such as defined in Comment #4
above. (39-39)
9a. Comment Suggestion: The HNF has quite possibly gone beyond the tipping
point of cumulative impacts to hiding cover and security. The Hillis Model provides
important guidelines, and the Wyoming research provides a method to evaluate the
status of forested cover on the HNF. It is time that the eastside forests conduct such
an analysis (east-side forests as referenced in the DEIS: Lewis and Clark, Custer,
Gallatin), on how concepts of Hillis et al., combined with a cover analysis as per the
Wyoming design might be beneficially modified to provide big game security on
these more gentle, and less densely forested landscapes. Restoration actions are
likely in order. (39-40)

(39-40) (9a) The Forest Plan amendment includes an analysis of
potential hiding cover in elk security areas in response to a public
comment request that an analysis similar to the one conducted in
Wyoming be conducted for the Divide Travel Plan. See the
Forest Plan amendment, Potential Elk Security section. Also,
based on updated data, three of the six herd units in the Travel
Plan area currently meet Standard 4a. See the Forest Plan
amendment, Changes between Draft and Final section and
Findings Required by Laws, Regulations, and Policies/National
Environmental Policy Act/Comparison of

eastside-wide is outside the scope of the project.

10. Inadequate and unfunded maintenance, monitoring and enforcement of
roads/trails and motorized travel as allowed under the Divide Travel Plan, virtually
assures that any standard for big game security will not function properly.
DEIS says it could take the FS several years to complete the necessary clearances
needed to implement the decision. Until then, not all the routes and areas depicted in

scheduled for closure remain open and on the map till they are closed? (39-41)

In summary, NEPA (40 CFR 1500-1508) requires: (1) considering a broad range of
reasonable alternatives; (2) disclosing cumulative effects; (3) using best scientific
information; (4) consideration of long-term and short-term effects; and (5)
disclosure of unavoidable adverse effects. As compared to the existing condition,
Amendment Alternative B does not constitute a “broad range of reasonable
alternatives,” nor does it reflect “using best scientific information.” The analysis of
Alternative B does not accurately “disclose cumulative effects” specifically the
thousands and thousands of acres that no longer have forested cover as a result of
HNF projects, “consider long-term and shortterm effects” such as permanently
affixing security areas to specific polygons, or “unavoidable adverse effects” such as
increased landscape fragmentation as a result of identifying permanently fixed
security areas, between which intense actions such timber harvest and additional
roading could occur.

Heather,
First a little background for you; I started hunting and recreating in the Little
Blackfoot area in 1961, and still do today. I have seen a lot of changes and must say
I think you are on the right track with your Divide Travel Plan. I found a lot of
inaccuracies trying to read thru your Divide Bible. I would hope that someone
would check all alternatives or at least the one you decide on for accurate data.
Again, I must keep my comments to the area I use and understand.
Of the four alternatives I would be happy with either alternate #3 or alternate #4
with some suggestions:
•The proposal to close MTR-502, MTR-503, MTR-504 and 227-E1, I completely
agree with. MTR-503, it is a user created route and definitely should be closed.
MTR-502 is a route that undoubtedly should be closed, due to the hazardous trail
and erosion factor. It leads to a road that goes in and out of the proposed Electric
Peak Wilderness and the Beaverhead/Deerlodge travel plan that only allows over the
snow travel after December 2nd. (42-1)

(42-1) Preferred alternative reflects these suggestions.

•MTR-504 goes through a wet riparian area that has been used for a mud bog area
and is heavily damaged. This should be closed also. (42-2)
•MTR-501, I understand was marked wrong on the new map. I am not sure what it
is supposed to be, but, I would like to see it opened to wheeled vehicles 50" and
under from May 15th. to Sept 18t. This is the only access from Little Blackfoot
River Road into the Spotted Dog area, and back to Avon or Elliston. Again, the only
route that a 2 track will be allowed on would be on MTR-501. At the top of the hill
MTR-501 would intersect with #314 and #1870 which are open to wheeled vehicles
50" or under from May 15th. To Sept. 1st. and should remain so.(42-3)
•The Forest Service gate on Spotted Dog #314 and at the pillars on #1870, in the
past were signed and closed on Sept 1st. for wildlife protection, before archery
season opens. This should remain the same. Then the gate off of the Little Blackfoot
River Road should also be signed and closed Sept. 1st. again, for wildlife protection,
before archery season opens. (42-4)
•For some reason MTR-501 is not even listed in appendix E of the Divide Bible.
•#227-E1 is another example of a road that is traveled a lot in wet conditions, and it
doesn't go anywhere. The heavy travel in and out in wet conditions creates a lot of
sediment that flows into the Little Blackfoot. This route should be closed at the turn
around area.
•The roads #4104-A1 and #4104-Al as marked on alternative #4 are a good example
of a proposal carried forward to have wheeled vehicles 50" and under travel from
the Little Blackfoot River road, through an area that was closed. This will connect
into the Ontario/Telegraph /Rimini area. This is also a good choice. By opening
#4104-A1 and MTR-501 this will open long loop routes with access from RiminiBasin to Avon-Elliston.
•There are a lot of short, dead-end roads for both ATV and over the snow vehicles,
which should be closed. They don't go anywhere and create an opportunity for
someone to travel where they are not legal.(42-6)
•There are some others that need some attention: # 227-Al is gated with no access,
except for foot or horseback. It also enters section 35 which belongs to FWP/Spotted
Dog WMA which is a non-motorized area. #227-Cl only accesses private property
and is not open to the public. #227-Dl the bridge is out and there should be no

300 feet off the main road just because they can. I personally would like to see this

to create a new one. Again signage would help this. (42-10)

with any road closures. That being said, I believe that Alt 2 is a livable compromise.
I believe that the FS could do well in most travel plans by adding a few miles of
trails/roads that would connect some trails to create circuitous routes so that trail
riders don't have to leave by the same route they came into an area. I think riders
would be more open to trail closures if they had more of these type routes. (43-1)

Response to Comments
(43-1)The preferred alternative was designed around the concept
of providing loop opportunities.

Amendment comments - I don't know the country at all so I can't really pick any of
the plans but I would just comment that I have no problem with closing some trails
during hunting season and/or calving season if needed. Access to an area is
important but road hunting is definitely not a necessity.

following reasons:
Enjoyment and Rewards of OHV Recreation
• Opportunity for a recreational experience for all types of people.
• Opportunity to strengthen family relationships.
• Opportunity to experience and respect the natural environment.
• Opportunity to participate in a healthy and enjoyable sport.
• Opportunity to experience a variety of opportunities and challenges.
• Camaraderie and exchange of experiences.
• For the adventure of it.
Acknowledged Responsibilities of Motorized Visitors
• Responsibility to respect and preserve the natural environment. We are practical
environmentalists who believe in a reasonable balance between the protection of the
natural environment and the human environment.
• Responsibility to respect all visitors.
• Responsibility to use vehicles in a proper manner and in designated places.
• Responsibility to work with land, resource, and recreation managers. We are
committed to resolving issues through problem solving and not closures.
• Responsibility to educate the public on the responsible use of motorized vehicles
on public lands.

Response to Comments

We feel that we are representative of the needs of the majority of visitors who
recreate on public lands but may not be organized with a collective voice to
comment on their needs during the public input process. These independent
multiple-use recreationists include visitors who use motorized routes for family
outings and camping trips, weekend drives, mountain biking, sightseeing, exploring,
picnicking, hiking, ranching, rock climbing, skiing, camping, hunting, RVs,
shooting targets, timber harvesting, fishing, viewing wildlife, snowmobiling,
accessing patented mining claims, and collecting firewood, natural foods, rocks, etc.
Mountain bikers seem to prefer OHV trails because we clear and maintain them and
they have a desirable surface for biking. Multiple-use visitors also include
physically challenged visitors including the elderly and veterans who must use
wheeled vehicles to visit public lands. All of these multiple-use visitors use roads

Response to Comments
(44-1)Resource management is a blend of Social
economic/political needs balanced with biological/
environmental needs. The preferred alternative we feel reaches
this sensitive balance and provides for the public needs as it is
providing for environmental concerns..

A Pro-Recreation alternative is viable and needed by the public. The reasons and
issues presented by motorized recreationists including these comments are adequate
justification to develop and support a Pro-Recreation alternative. Other motorized
recreationists are available to develop and support a Pro-Recreation alternative if the
agency would engage them. Again, we urge the Forest Service to address this
situation and restore public confidence in the agency by developing and selecting a
Pro-Recreation alternative that provides equal program delivery by converting roads
to OHV trails and allocating at least 50% of the trails to motorized use. (44-1)
We are looking forward to working towards a more reasonable travel management

motorized opportunity can be closed. There is no proof that the grizzly bear is
impacted. A five year study must be done in the Divide Travel Planning area to
clearly demonstrate significant impact using a sense of magnitude as defined in our
objection. We would like to be partners in the study and cosponsor a grant to fund it.
(44-2)
2. We support reasonable protections for wildlife when real negative impacts to
wildlife are clearly demonstrated and when actions such as seasonal motorized
closures for elk calving are shown to have a reasonable magnitude of positive
benefit. FWP has not provided any documentation that clearly demonstrates the
impact of OHV recreation on grizzly bears. We have not heard of a bear being
killed, maimed, or otherwise harmed by an ATV or motorcycle. FWP has been
wanting to close roads and trails for years in the name of grizzly habitat and it is still
grizzly habitat. This is clearly demonstrated in the Swan Valley study referenced
below. Additionally, FWP and other agencies clearly disturb grizzly bears more than
OHV recreationists with their annual capturing, tagging, and collaring for study
programs described in the following news release

3. Research has found that grizzly bears in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem have
a varied diet and are minimally affected by the decline in the number of whitebark
pine trees, federal research found. The findings were presented Thursday in
Bozeman at a meeting of the Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee of the
Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee. The subcommittee voted 10-4 to accept the
research findings. It also gave preliminary approval to a motion that recommends
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service remove federal protections for the bears,
currently listed as “threatened.” Grizzly bears are minimally affected by the supply
of pine nuts and the federal protections grizzlies are in the process of being
removed. Therefore, grizzly bears should not be used to close motorized routes and
opportunities.

Response to Comments
neighboring Recovery Zones—in this case, the NCDE. Wildlife
management and travel management in the Distribution Zone are
not driven primarily by the need to accommodate grizzly bears.
The pattern of road density and non-motorized security areas is
shaped primarily by elk and other hunted big game species. The
availability of these unroaded enclaves and the location of roads
away from productive habitat sites (primarily riparian and
wetland areas) benefits grizzlies, wolverines, lynx, and a variety
of other species averse to human presence. But the main driver
of the system is elk security and habitat effectiveness [Wildlife
Background Report (p. 47-77, 157-183)].
(44-4) In the case of grizzly bears, the non-motorized areas are
designed not so much as a buffer against human-caused mortality
as they are undisturbed areas of suitable habitat large enough to
allow the small local population of bears to make a living. We
expect that, while the local population in the Travel Plan Area
will increase somewhat in the future as bears migrate in from the
Recovery Zone to the north, it will remain small. The bears are
territorial and there is only so much suitable habitat. Grizzlies
will be accommodated, but the area will not be managed
primarily as a grizzly bear refuge, as are the Recovery Zones.

the name of grizzly bear protection are not warranted at this time.

5. The actual zone of influence of motorized trails on wildlife is very small as
demonstrated in a later comment. 6. The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem
(NCDE), outside of Glacier National Park, has grizzly bear population densities of
about 1 bear per 20-30 square miles and has human recreation consisting of
motorized access, motorized recreation, hiking, fishing, camping, horseback riding,
and big game hunting. Glacier National Park annually receives approximately 2-3
million visitors, does not allow hunting, and has grizzly bear population densities
estimated at about 1 bear per 8 square miles. The Yellowstone Ecosystem (YE)
which is comprised of Yellowstone Park and surrounding National Forests, receives
more visitation than Glacier Park and has an increasing grizzly bear population
estimated at 1 bear per 30-50 square miles
(http://www.r6.fws.gov/endspp/grizzly/bittereis/deischp2.htm). All indications are
that grizzly bear habitat is fully occupied and that additional road closures and
obliteration will not produce any more bears and, therefore, motorized closures are
not reasonable or productive. Further evidence of this condition is the fact that
grizzly bears are moving out onto the prairies around Valier and Choteau. Therefore,
grizzly bears can coexist at reasonable population densities with multiple-use
recreation and there is no compelling reason to close roads and trails to motorized
recreationists to increase grizzly populations because the most significant constraint
is their need for so many acres between other grizzly bears. (44-5)

Response to Comments

(44-5)As discussed in the Wildlife Background Report (p. 86-89,
184-190) and equivalent sections of the FEIS, the Divide
landscape, under any of the 5 Travel Plan alternatives, maintains
a considerably higher open route density and a much smaller
array of unroaded “core areas” than does the NCDE Recovery
zone referenced here. Grizzlies can successfully inhabit the
Divide landscape, in spite of this more ubiquitous human
presence, but their populations will be much smaller than in the
Recovery Zone and they will require a few large areas where
human activity is minimal.

(44-6) Population goals and grizzly bear numbers in the NCDE
are not relevant to management of grizzlies in the Divide Travel
Plan Area (other than the indirect effect of increasing populations
in the NCDE driving the export of bears toward the Divide
landscape).
ESA delisting is beyond the scope of the Divide Travel Plan.

7. Kate Kendall's Greater Glacier Bear DNA study (includes all the North Fork of

Flathead), which identified 367 unique individual bears with one year’s data not yet
analyzed. The recovered population target was 600 bears for the entire Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem, so there is already known that about 2/3 of that
target exist on about 1/4 of the habitat. Completion of DNA study of the rest of the
ecosystem is certain to show that bear populations far exceed the recovery goal and
should be de-listed. The study was released in December 2006 and indeed did
confirm that there was more than 545 bears in the ecosystem
(http://www.greatfallstribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006612240302 ).
Furthermore, a study released in September 2008 found that there were at least 765
grizzly bears
(http://www.helenair.com/articles/2008/09/17/top/55st_080917_grizzlies.txt. It is
clear that the grizzly bear populations are healthy and that motorized recreationists
should no longer be shut out of grizzly bear habitat. (44-6)
8. Grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region were delisted in 2007 and then forced
back onto the list by the courts in 2009.
9. A Grizzly Bear study in the Swan Valley of Montana found that 99 percent of the
bears spent 99 percent of their time on Plum Creek property as shown in the
following aerial photograph. This property has been heavily logged resulting in
undergrowth plant species that support bears. Thick and overgrown timber does not
allow for adequate undergrowth. As we now see by this study, critical bear habitat is
quite different than what was once assumed and this new information must be
incorporated into this evaluation. The Forest Service should discard the original
“road density guidelines” and develop new guidelines that reflect the habitat most
critical for bears as one that is timber harvested and roaded. Old outdated science
formulated by assumptions should not be used when true science and actual data is
now available. (44-7)

Response to Comments

(44-7)The Wildlife Background Report (p. 81) discusses the
grizzly bear’s preference for a landscape with a diversity of
habitat formations, including open meadows, grassland, mature
conifer forest, early seral forest, aspen, riparian areas, and shrub
associations, among others. This diversity would be unaffected
by Divide Travel Plan alternatives. What is affected is how
much of this suitable habitat would be rendered unavailable or
less available by the presence of open roads and motor trails
(Wildlife Background Report, p. 82-83, 184-187).

10. A December 31, 2003 Federal Court ruling found that associated with actions
taken under the endangered species action must be paid to the public. The case
stemmed from the government's efforts to protect endangered winter-run chinook
salmon and threatened delta smelt between 1992 and 1994 by withholding billions
of gallons from farmers in California's Kern and Tulare counties. Court of Federal
Claims Senior Judge John Wiese ruled that the government's halting of water
constituted a ``taking'' or intrusion on the farmers' private property rights. The Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from taking private
property without fair payment.
``What the court found is that the government is certainly free to protect the fish
under the Endangered Species Act, but it must pay for the water that it takes to do
so,'' said Roger J. Marzulla, the attorney representing the water districts that brought

(44-9)By this logic, the increase in motorized use of trails
represents a loss of quiet, non-motorized recreation opportunity
for hikers and others who go out on the Forest expecting an
environment free from the mechanized chaos of much of the rest
of the world they live in. These people would thus need to be
compensated for the loss they suffer from mechanized recreation.
Efforts to provide non-motorized habitat opportunity for grizzly
bears represent a positive step for these recreationists.
(44-10)Delisting is expected sometime in the future. But given
erratic history of such efforts in the past and the uncertainty of
the future timeline, delisting does not fit within the definition of

the claim. (44-8)
This same standard should also be applied to the economic and motorized
recreational losses that the public has suffered under the ESA including motorized
closures justified by grizzly bear habitat and impacts on westslope cutthroat trout
and bull trout.
(44-9)(http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcrights/4caliwate2.html )
11. The current analysis does not adequately consider grizzly bear delisting under
the Reasonably Foreseeable actions. This action is imminent. At the same time there
is so much emphasis on the management of the area and region as a non-motorized
area for grizzly bears. First, we do not feel that OHV recreation has a significant
effect on grizzly bears and, secondly, the analysis must be based on the impending
delisting of grizzly bears. Other pended delisting of endangered species must also be
considered.(44-10)
12. “Present day populations of white-tailed deer and elk are at their highest levels
recorded in recent history” (Montana Wolf Conservation and Management Planning
Document, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, January 2000
(http://www.fwp.state.mt.us/wildthings/wolf/wolfmanagement011602.pdf).
Additionally, “nearly 60 percent of Montana's original elk management units exceed
elk-population objectives, while only 31 percent exceed harvest objectives”
(www.fwp.state.mt.us/hunting/elkplan.html).

Response to Comments
“reasonably foreseeable” as used in NEPA. In any case, delisting
would not significantly alter the way the Helena NF manages
grizzly bears in the Divide landscape.
The Helena NF will continue to manage the Divide landscape to
provide adequate habitat and protection for big game animals,
forest carnivores, and other species that require unroaded country
regardless of whether any of them are listed under the
Endangered Species Act. Management is driven primarily by the
habitat requirements of these species as best we can determine
from the latest science. It is unlikely that the Forest will
substantially alter its approach to grizzly bear management in the
Divide landscape if the Grizzly is delisted. The bears will still be
there and they will require the same kind of habitat.

(44-11) NEPA requires that an array of reasonable alternatives be
considered. It does not expect that they will all be implemented.

13. The number of hunters is declining (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1996
National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation.
http://library.fws.gov/nat_survey 1996.pdf and
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/03/national/printable3228893.shtml).
Therefore, there are no compelling reasons “to elevate the level of elk security in the
project area and…enhance elk populations” as frequently suggested by wildlife
biologists (example; Fish, Wildlife and Parks letter dated February 27, 2002 to
Helena National Forest on the Clancy-Unionville Travel Planning Project, bottom of
page 9). Additionally, there are no compelling reasons to justify reduced road

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 279

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
densities as a sought-after or necessary wildlife management criterion. Lastly, there
are reasonable alternatives including permit hunting and seasonal travel restrictions
that can better accomplish the outcome sought by reduced road and trail densities.
NEPA requires consideration and implementation of all reasonable alternatives. Not
considering and implementing reasonable alternatives demonstrates a predisposition
in the process. (44-11)
14. Elk Cover Requirements. Elk do well in places like Nevada without trees.
Additionally, elk were originally a plains animal and survived just fine without
trees. Effective elk hiding is provided by mountains, hills, ravines, ridges, rocks,
brush. These land factors must be incorporated into the elk hiding cover equation.
Recent analysis by the Helena National Forest for the Elkhorn Wildlife Management
Area has demonstrated that a reasonable consideration of the topography in the area
would meet the requirements for elk security. This reasonable and realistic approach
to elk cover and wildlife security requirements was not applied to the Divide Travel
Planning analysis.
15. Additionally, wolves have radically changed elk behavior and use of tree
canopy. Elk now avoid tree cover because the cover allows wolves to prey upon
them easier. Elk now prefer open areas where they can “keep an eye” on the wolves
and defend themselves. Therefore, tree cover is not a significant benefit to elk at this
time and this changed condition must be recognized. (44-12)

Response to Comments

(44-12) Wolves have altered elk behavior in areas where they are
regularly resident and abundant—as in Yellowstone and, more
recently, in the upper Blackfoot country. Wolf packs have been
present to one degree or another in and around the Divide
landscape since 1995. But they have never been enough of a
presence to alter elk behavior patterns, and given the
juxtaposition of Forest and private ranchland in the landscape, it
is highly unlikely that they will ever do so. See Wildlife
Background Report “Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf” (p.
104-112, 209-214) and equivalent sections in the EIS.

(44-13) Thank you for your comment. This is beyond the scope
of the Divide Travel Plan.

16. While Revised Statute 2477 was repealed by the 1976 National Forest
Management Act, the revision clearly stated in the Act was to insure that no new
roads from the effective date of the Act would be considered for RS 2477
consideration. It further clarified the historical highways would be honored. That is
all that the 1976 Act modified or repealed. Until the federal government completely
repeals the 1866 Act, (Revised by the 1872 Act) in its entirety the citizens of the
United States still have the right to access lands for the benefit of the people of the
United States. The decision rendered by the 10th circuit re-affirms this

04-4071 -Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance v. Bureau of Land Management). The
court has ruled that the rights exercised by the counties would be valid if the routes
in question were indeed 2477 classified. The county has records that show that the
routes were there prior to the establishment of the 1976 NFMA and FLPMA and,
are therefore, valid RS 2477 routes. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the
agency proposing a closure action to adequately research those records and establish
which routes meet RS 2477 classification and then consult and coordinate with the
County with respect to that classification. The Divide Travel Plan project area
includes many important RS 2477 routes that were established by miners, loggers,
and early settlers. We request that this project include adequate research of the
county records and adequate formal consultation and coordination with the county
to identify RS 2477 routes and include them as historic motorized routes. (44-13)

17. The most equitable management of public lands is for multiple-uses. Congress
recognized this need with many laws including the Multiple Use Sustained Yield
Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528 et seq.) and National Forest Management Act of 1976.
Multiple-Use was defined as “The management of all the various renewable surface
resources of the national forests so that they are utilized in the combination that will
best meet the needs of the American people...”
Outdoor recreation is the first stated purpose of the act. Note that the pre-Columbian
management scheme has not been enacted by Congress. Therefore, the Forest
Service has a responsibility to provide recreational opportunities that meet the needs
of the public just as government entities provide road, water and wastewater systems
that meet the needs of the public.
Public Law 88-657 states that “the Congress hereby finds and declares that the
construction and maintenance of an adequate system of roads and trails within and
near the national forests and other lands administered by the Forest Service is
essential if increasing demands for timber, recreation, and other uses of such lands
are to be met; that the existence of such a system would have the effect, among
other things, of increasing the value of timber and other resources tributary to such
roads; and that such a system is essential to enable the Secretary of Agriculture

(hereinafter called the Secretary) to provide for intensive use, protection,
development, and management of these lands under principles of multiple use and
sustained yield of products and services.”.

Response to Comments

The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) states that “(7)
goals and objectives be established by law as guidelines for public land use
planning, and that management be on the basis of multiple use and sustained yield
unless otherwise specified by law; and, (c) In the development and revision of land
use plans, the Secretary shall -- (1) use and observe the principles of multiple use
and sustained yield set forth in this and other applicable law;”.
Multiple-use management goals are the only goals that will “best meet the needs” of
the public and provide for equal program delivery to all citizens including motorized
visitors. All of visitors have a responsibility to accept and promote diversity of
recreation on public lands. Diversity of recreation opportunities can only be
accomplished through management for multiple-uses and reasonable coexistence
among visitors. Multiple-use lands must be managed for shared-use versus
segregated-use or exclusive-use. Multiple-use lands are public places. Segregation
in public places has not been acceptable since the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

(44-14)Thank you for your input.

A significant closing of roads and motorized trails in the project area is not
consistent with meeting the needs of the public and the goals of Multiple-Use
Management as directed under Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976
(FLPMA), Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act of 1960 and P.L. 88-657. Legally
designated multiple-use lands must not be managed for limited-use instead of
multiple-use. This is a significant issue and must be adequately addressed. We
request full compliance with multiple-use policies and laws and the development of
a Pro-Recreation preferred alternative that will support these policies and laws and
the needs of the public.

19. Public understanding of the proposed alternatives would be greatly improved by
implementing a mapping tool similar to the one developed by Idaho Parks and
Recreation. This tool can be tried out at http://www.trails.idaho.gov/trails/. Zoom in
and click on a particular trail to see the information provided for each route. Earlier
versions of this tool included GPS downloads for each route which would help
assure that the public was on the right trail. This tool would also be useful after the
analysis and decision to inform the public of the route designations.
20. NEPA law requires adequate public disclosure including adequate public
involvement, and discussion of potential impacts in the environmental document.
NEPA and CEQ guidance includes CEQ Sec. 1500.1 Purpose. Most important,
NEPA documents must concentrate on the issues that are truly significant to the
action in question, rather than amassing needless detail. It shall provide full and fair
discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decision makers
and the public of the reasonable alternatives which would avoid or minimize adverse
impacts or enhance the quality of the human environment. Agencies shall focus on
significant environmental issues and alternatives and shall reduce paperwork and the
accumulation of extraneous background data. Statements shall be concise, clear, and
to the point, and shall be supported by evidence that the agency has made the
necessary environmental analyses. In order to adequately meet disclosure
requirements the environmental document must include an accurate estimate of the
magnitude of the benefit to the natural environmental versus an accurate magnitude
of the impact including dollars, measures of recreation time and benefit on the
human environment. For example, the public needs to know that a salmon run can
be increased by 1,000 fish but at an annual loss in energy production of $10,000,000
for a cost $10,000 per fish. Another example would be the closure of 50 miles of
OHV routes so that 2 lynx are not minimally disturbed resulting in the loss of 5,000
person days of recreation at a value of $150 per day for a cost of $750,000 per year.

An adequate sense of magnitude must be employed in the impact determinations.
This information must be disclosed to the public so that they are adequately
informed and can adequately comment on significant issues surrounding impacts on
the human environment. Adequate disclosure of this information will also allow
decision-makers to better evaluate all reasonable alternatives and make more
reasonable decisions based on a realistic sense of magnitude.

Response to Comments

21. With respect to impact assessment, if you cannot measure or have not measured
an impact then it is not a real impact.
22. Another example of theoretical impact with no real magnitude would be the
lighting of a match theoretically increases the temperature of the earth’s climate but
in reality the magnitude is so insignificant that it is not real. All theoretical benefits
to the environment must include a magnitude of the benefit. A sense of magnitude
has not been used in the impact assessment and must be adequately incorporated
into the impact assessment.

(44-16) Thank you for your comment, this is outside the scope of
the Divide Travel Plan.

23. Impacts associated with beetle-killed trees, fires, and floods are acceptable to the
agency. OHV impacts are insignificant when compared to beetle-killed trees, fires,
and floods. A comparison to natural impacts such as beetle-killed trees, fires and
flood is a reasonable test for magnitude of impacts.
24. A small level of theoretical negative impact from OHV recreation does not
reasonably equate to the need for massive motorized closures.
(44-17) Thank you for your input.
25. OHV recreation is extremely popular in Montana. Registration statistics in 2012
show that there are 77,868 OHVs with both plate and OHV stickers and 69,378
vehicles with OHV stickers for a total of 147,606 licensed OHV vehicles. The total
number of OHV registrations equates to about one OHV for every 6 residents. Note
that many OHVs are used by multiple residents. At 500 miles per year per OHV (a
very conservative estimate), the total miles driven per year in Montana would equal
75,000,000 miles. At an average speed of 18 miles per hour, the total hours of OHV

recreation per year in Montana is estimated at 4,167,000 hours.
https://doj.mt.gov/driving/mvd-bythenumbers/2012-total-vehicle-registrations-statewide/. At a value of $25 per hour the
total value to the economy on Montana is $104,175,000 and the share attributable to
the Lincoln area is a significant part of the economy.
26. Using a conservative estimate of 30 miles per visit and an average speed of 18
miles per hour, OHV visitors to the Helena National Forest travel 4,380,000 miles
(146,000 x 30) and recreate at least 243,000 hours on their OHVs. The magnitude of
these values indicates a significant need for OHV routes and a significant value in
the use of those routes. (44-16)
27. The final 3-States OHV Rule
9http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/final.pdf) included graphic examples
of ATV and motorcycle single-track trails that must be adequately identified and
addressed as part of the required site specific analysis for each and every road and
trail as part of the environmental analysis for any future travel planning. We request
that all routes currently in use be identified in the analysis using the pictures
included in the final decision. (44-17)
28. In 2011 two-thirds of Americans, or nearly 212 million, lived in counties beset
by wildfire smoke two years ago, according to the analysis by the Natural Resources
Defense Council. "It affects a much wider area of the United States than people
realize," says author Kim Knowlton, an NRDC senior scientist and Columbia
University health professor, adding the smoke can drift up to hundreds of miles. She
says the smoke contains fine-particle air pollution and can not only cause asthma
attacks and pneumonia but also worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. The health
impacts can be dire. The 2003 wildfire season in southern California resulted in 69
premature deaths, 778 hospitalizations, 1,431 emergency room visits and 47,605
outpatient visits, according to a study led by Ralph Delfino of the University of
California, Irvine.

(44-18)The purpose of this analysis is to determine the motorized
and non-motorized system routes within the planning area. Five
action alternatives have been provided that look at a reasonable
range of both motorized and non-motorized uses while balancing
these recreational demands with environmental/biological
concerns. The IDT analyzed each alternative appropriately
following laws, policies, and procedures that are in place. The
final decision will include future management direction that will
also comply with laws, policies, manual direction.
From this report GAO recommends, among other actions, that
the Forest Service (1) analyze trails program needs and available
resources and develop options for narrowing the gap between
them and take steps to assess and improve the sustainability of its
trails and (2) take steps to enhance training on collaborating with
and managing volunteers who help maintain trails. HNF has a
very robust partnership organization that reflects this exact plan

29. The Government Accounting Office (GAO) has recently released a report with
recommendations on long- and short-term improvements that could reduce
maintenance backlog and enhance the sustainability of trails on the public lands
(http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-618). Specific recommendations include
Agency officials and stakeholders GAO interviewed collectively identified
numerous options to improve Forest Service trail maintenance, including (1)
assessing the sustainability of the trail system, (2) improving agency policies and
procedures, and (3) improving management of volunteers and other external
resources. In a 2010 document titled A Framework for Sustainable Recreation, the
Forest Service noted the importance of analyzing recreation program needs and
available resources and assessing potential ways to narrow the gap between them,
which the agency has not yet done for its trails. Many officials and stakeholders
suggested that the agency systematically assess its trail system to identify ways to
reduce the gap and improve trail system sustainability. They also identified other
options for improving management of volunteers. For example, while the agency’s
goal in the Forest Service Manual is to use volunteers, the agency has not
established collaboration with and management of volunteers who help maintain
trails as clear expectations for trails staff responsible for working with volunteers,
and training in this area is limited. Some agency officials and stakeholders stated
that training on how to collaborate with and manage volunteers would enhance the
agency’s ability to capitalize on this resource. CTVA has a long history of
collaboration on trail construction and maintenance projects that we would like to
continue to build on. (44-18)

partnership collaboration have been a program emphasis for the
last 12 years.

(44-19)These comments could also be considered economically
based because they are saying there is a value in volunteer efforts

30. Additionally, OHV recreation generates millions of dollars in OHV gas tax
revenues which should be used to for trail maintenance (see additional comments

the fuel used for OHV recreation,

31. The use of “unauthorized trails or roads or user-created routes” is not an
appropriate term as many of these routes were created during periods going back to
the 1800’s when the forest was managed without designated routes, cross-country
travel was allowed, and access and use of the forest was encouraged. Many of these
routes have been used for decades and are “historic routes”. Many of these routes
are shown on versions of the forest map, and 7.5 minute and 15 minute USGS
quadrangle mapping. The use of “unauthorized trails or roads or user-created routes”
is an inaccurate representation of the management conditions and uses allowed in
the past. These are also terms developed by non-motorized interests that have been
given an inaccurate negative connotation through their campaigns. We request that
this term be dropped from the text and that these routes be recognized as appropriate
routes in the analysis. (44-20)
32. The underlying definition of the “environment” that the Forest Service has
chosen to use in the impact analyses and decision-making places an emphasis and
priority on the “resource” environment in the project area. NEPA was very clear that
the total complement of the environment was to be considered in the impact
analyses and decision-making including the guiding purpose statement “achieve a
balance between population and resource use which will permit high standards of
living and a wide sharing of life’s amenities” (Public Law 91-190, Title I, Section
101 (b) (5)). The wording of NEPA was carefully chosen and was intended to
produce a balance between the resource environment and population or human
environment. NEPA was not intended to be used to put an end to human access and
use of the resources. However, the Forest Service is using the NEPA process
inappropriately by creating significant cumulative impacts on the human
environment through a series of travel plan decisions aimed at removing the public
from public lands. This trend does not conform to Public Law 91-190 and must be
corrected by implementing a pro-recreation alternative as part of this action.

(44-21) Attempts are made to provide for opportunities to both
motorized and non-motorized users where viable.

(44-22)Outside the scope, Divide Travel is a motorized analysis.

34. We support all of the routes shown on the alternative map attached to these
comments.
35. The 20 miles of proposed motorized trail is not adequate to meet the needs of the
public. The comments and information that we have provided in this submittal and
others provide adequate justification to support this statement. Certainly a motorized
trail system equal to the miles of non-motorized trail system in the Helena National
Forest is justified for motorized trail users. Moreover, there are over 200 miles of
non-motorized trail in the immediate area just outside the project boundary so
several hundred miles of motorized trail can easily be justified. Therefore, a
reasonable alternative would be to at least provide a motorized trail system in the
project area equal to the non-motorized trail system in the immediate area of the
project. This objective can be accomplished by eliminating the conversion of
motorized trails to non-motorized trails, reopening the illegal closures of the
CDNST, and incorporating old logging roads with the construction of new
connector segments to create loops. We request that this reasonable alternative be
developed and promoted as the preferred alternative. (44-21)
36. The proposed action does not adequately consider that there are hundreds of
miles of non-motorized trails available to the public in the immediate area. The
balance of recreational opportunity must recognize the availability of the nonmotorized trails in the adjacent wilderness area. Because the adjacent non-motorized
trails were not adequately factored in to the analysis, the proposed balance of
recreational opportunities does not adequately address the needs of motorized
recreationists. Because of the vast wilderness area adjacent to the Divide project

38. Because of the significant number of motorized visits to the forest and
significant issues associated with motorized closures (both points are documented in
our comments and the comments of other motorized recreationists), the preferred
alternative must not reduce motorized opportunities. Moreover, in order to address
the issues and needs of the public, a reasonable preferred alternative would provide
for an increase in motorized opportunities. (44-24)
39. In order to be legally defensible the following two tests must be used to identify
any proposed motorized route closures: 1) the proposed closure of a motorized route
must be based on site specific data and documentation of actual significant impacts
caused by motorized recreation, and 2) the documented impacts from motorized
recreation must be substantially more significant than naturally occurring events.
40. Because of the significant negative cumulative impact of all motorized closures
and if the two tests outline above are met, then a reasonable alternative that must be
included for public input is a trade of the closed motorized route for a motorized
route of equal opportunity and value in a different location. (44-25)
41. Small towns surrounded by wilderness areas such as Lincoln are struggling with
the existing economic conditions which confirm that an economy based largely on
wilderness recreation will be limited. Further decisions that force the economy to
rely solely on wilderness and non-motorized recreation will move Lincoln in a
direction that will result in further economic hardship. At the same time, Lincoln is
surrounded by a significant amount of land intended for multiple-use. Managing for
reasonable multiple-use on all federal lands would allow the Lincoln to further
develop an economy based on snowmobile recreation in the winter and OHV

The Lincoln and Helena areas could become as successful Marysville, Utah area
http://www.marysvale.org/) which is based on the Paiute trail and the Caliente and
Pioche, Nevada area which is based on the Chief Mountain and Silver State Trail
systems (http://nvtrailmaps.com/trail.php?trail=708). These trail systems bring in
thousands of motorized recreationists who buy lodging, meals, parts, fuel, and goods
in adjacent towns. The lack of adequate OHV and snowmobile access and
opportunities in the Lincoln area was brought into focus by the recent controversy
over the closure of the highway borrow ditches. When snowmobiles and OHVs are
forced to use the highway borrow ditches confirms that there are inadequate
motorized recreational opportunities in the area. This is not a desirable nor equitable
situation and especially when considering the thousands of acres of multiple-use
land designated in the Helena National Forest. These and other reasons support a
hard look at a reasonable Pro-Recreation Alternative for the Divide Travel Planning
project. (44-27)

significant issue associated with not addressing this need has not been adequately
addressed. (44-28)
43. Motorized recreationists support the use of mountain bikes on the motorized
trails. A reasonable alternative would be to share any proposed mountain bike trails
with motorcycles. Both vehicles create and use the same “single-track” trail foot
print. As proposed there are no motorcycle trails. Furthermore, based on our
experience keeping trails free of downfall in the last 5 years, mountain bikers
without chainsaws will not be able to maintain the trail system and it will not be

the season last fall, we had to remove 50-60 downed trees to get through even
though it was late in the season. The Brooklyn Bridge route in the ClancyUnionville area is another example of a route that is becoming closed by downfall.
Motorcyclists would be quite willing to help build and maintain a
motorcycle/mountain bike single-track trail system. This is a reasonable alternative
that must be adequately addressed.
44. We have observed that motorized trails that have been closed to provide “nonmotorized opportunities” see very little or no use. Another example is the Upper
Hellgate Gulch trail closed as part of the North Belts Travel Plan. As shown below
there is no evidence of use and the trail is now closed by downfall. (44-29)

49. Held to an Unnatural Standard – air quality, water quality, impact on fish and
wildlife, level of erosion. Fires, floods, natural levels of erosion all produce far
greater impacts on air quality, water quality, and fish and wildlife. Motorized
recreationists are being held to an unnatural standard which clearly indicates a
grievous bias. Impacts associated with motorized recreation including sedimentation
and disturbance of wildlife are being judged as significant when in reality they are
less than the natural level of sedimentation and impacts on wildlife associated with
fires and floods. Being held to a level of impact that is less than the natural level is
proof of a strong bias in the evaluation process and arbitrary and capricious
decision-making. (44-31)
50. Impact Assessment. With respect to impact assessment, if you cannot measure
an impact then it is not a real impact. Impacts associated with beetle killed trees and
fires are acceptable to the agency. OHV impacts are minimal when compared to
beetle killed trees and fires.
51. Motorized recreationists are being squeezed out of the high quality places on our

53. The most equitable management of public lands is for multiple-uses. Congress
recognized this need with many laws including the Multiple Use Sustained Yield
Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528 et seq.) and National Forest Management Act of 1976.
Multiple-Use was defined as “The management of all the various renewable surface
resources of the national forests so that they are utilized in the combination that will
best meet the needs of the American people...”. Outdoor recreation is the first stated
purpose of the act. Note that the pre-Columbian management scheme has not been
enacted by Congress. Therefore, the Bureau of Land Management and Forest
Service have a responsibility to provide recreational opportunities that meet the
needs of the public just as government entities provide road, water and wastewater
systems that meet the needs of the public.
Public Law 88-657 states that “the Congress hereby finds and declares that the
construction and maintenance of an adequate system of roads and trails within and
near the national forests and other lands administered by the Forest Service is
essential if increasing demands for timber, recreation, and other uses of such lands
are to be met; that the existence of such a system would have the effect, among
other things, of increasing the value of timber and other resources tributary to such
roads; and that such a system is essential to enable the Secretary of Agriculture
(hereinafter called the Secretary) to provide for intensive use, protection,
development, and management of these lands under principles of multiple use and
sustained yield of products and services.”.
The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) states that “(7)
goals and objectives be established by law as guidelines for public land use
planning, and that management be on the basis of multiple use and sustained yield
unless otherwise specified by law; and, (c) In the development and revision of land
use plans, the Secretary shall -- (1) use and observe the principles of multiple use
and sustained yield set forth in this and other applicable law;”.
Multiple-use management goals are the only goals that will “best meet the needs” of
the public and provide for equal program delivery to all citizens including motorized
visitors. All of visitors have a responsibility to accept and promote diversity of
recreation on public lands. Diversity of recreation opportunities can only be

54. The needs of the aging baby boomer population and their desire for adequate
motorized access and motorized recreation is a significant issue that is brought up
continually at our monthly meetings and in many discussions with other motorized
recreationists. This significant issue must be recognized and given a hard look in the
Purpose and Need, adequately addressed as part of the human environment and
adequately addressed by the development of a reasonable Pro-Recreation
alternative. (44-33)
55. Since 1988, forest fires have eliminated many motorized roads and trails. These
losses have occurred due to deadfall, re-growth, and loss of trail tread associated
with the forest fire. These losses are occurring with every fire. For example, the
motorcycle single-track trail #418 from Snowbank Lake to Stonewall Mountain and
road #771 the Snow-Talon fire area in the Lincoln Ranger District of the Helena
National Forest has been lost to motorized use. Motorized losses due to forest fires
are occurring in every National Forest in our area. The loss of motorized
opportunities from fires has become a significant cumulative impact and issue to
motorized recreationists. The cumulative loss and negative effect on motorized
recreationists due to loss of recreational opportunities due to fires within the project
area, forest and region is a significant issue that must be evaluated as part of this
travel plan. The evaluation should also address mitigation measures necessary to
reduce the significant impact of losses due to fires on motorized recreationists. (4434)

56. The final OHV Rule (http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/final.pdf)
required site-specific analysis as part of the route designation process. Motorized
recreationists agreed to accept the rule on this basis. Site-specific analysis was
mentioned 11 times throughout the rule and this project must meet the requirements
for site-specific analysis.(44-35)
57. An adequate site-specific analysis should include monitoring and quantification
of existing motorized use versus non-motorized use, types of motorized use and
visitors, and effects of motorized closures on the quality of the human environment.
Examples and goals of site-specific analysis include: 1) single-track trails should be
designated for motorcycle and mountain bike use, 2) 48” width routes areas should
be designated for ATV use, 3) routes wider than 48” should be designated for UTV
and 4x4 use, 4) open riding areas should be designated for trials bikes which have
different riding area requirements than trail riding, and 5) motorized trail systems
should be provided for all skill levels and types of popular motorized vehicles so
that the needs of all motorized users are adequately addressed. Site-specific analysis
in the motorized route designation process should also adequately consider the
mileage of trails required for weekend camping trips, adequate destinations, and
other factors. We ask that motorized recreationists be adequately queried as part of
the site-specific evaluation process and that the site-specific conditions that they
identify be considered as required by the Final 3-States OHV Rule. (44-36)

58. The Forest Service Travel Management Rule
(http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/final.pdf ), was presented to OHV
recreationists as a “route designation” process that would designate motorized routes
for the appropriate type of motorized use (motorcycle, ATV, UTV, 4x4, etc.). Some
form of route designation was referred to 404 times in the final rule. The rule did not
state that it would be a huge motorized closure process and it was presented and
accepted by motorized recreationists on that basis. In fact, the rule specifically
allows new motorized routes. The rule did not authorize or direct a massive
motorized closure process. However, in actual implementation, the travel
management rule is being used as a massive motorized closure tool contrary to the

Proper implementation of the travel management rule is a significant issue. We

use it to designate existing motorized routes and create new motorized routes. We
also request that this action monitor the process for any misuse of the rule. (44-37)

environmental needs. The preferred alternative we feel reaches

59. The Purpose and Need for this action is to implement the Final OHV Rule. The
Final OHV Rule was written to designate existing motorized routes for appropriate
uses and create new motorized routes where needed. Implementation of the Final
OHV Rule should not result in a massive motorized closure. The Purpose and Need
for this project must follow through on the Final OHV Rule as a route designation
process as it was presented to motorized recreationists during the rulemaking. (4438)

61. In an article on road de-commissioning
(http://www.greatfallstribune.com/article/20110824/NEWS01/108240302/Nationalroad-trailreme), a Forest Service fisheries technician stated that “Fish and aquatic
life are adapted to natural influxes of sediment in the spring, but too much material

establish this sort of impact and associate it with OHV recreation, the Forest Service
must have site-specific data on natural sediment loads in a stream and site-specific
data on the gradation of the sediment from trail erosion and where it ends up. Finegrained material may wash through the system and cause virtually no impact to fish
spawning beds. Any purported impact by OHV recreation without site-specific data
and analysis that connects the relatively minor amounts of sediment produced by
OHV recreation on critical fish habitat is pure conjecture. Motorized recreationists
have been paying a significant price in the form of lost opportunities due to the lack
of site-specific data and conjectures. We request that any conjectures about potential
impacts be carefully evaluated and only allowed in the analysis when confirmed by
actual site-specific proofs and data. (44-40)

62. Additionally, an adequate sense of magnitude must be employed within the
analysis and decision-making. For example, the total naturally occurring loss of soil
from the Cibola National Forest is estimated to be on the order of 1,577 acre-feet per
year (1,892,000 acres total forest area times a depth of 0.008 feet of soil loss per
year). The loss associated with OHV use is on the order of 52 acre-feet (5,200 acres
of roads and trails times a depth of 0.01 feet of soil loss per year). Therefore, the soil (44-44)Thank you for your input, volunteer labor and partnership
development are critical elements to a successful trails program.
erosion associated with OHV recreation is relatively insignificant compared to the
naturally occurring erosion rate and acceptable for multiple-use lands. Moreover,
there are many mitigation measures that can be employed to reduce soil erosion on
roads and trails while still allowing the public to enjoy them. Other examples that
should be part of the evaluation include the naturally occurring mortality rate of fish
and game compared to the mortality rate associated with OHV recreation. The
evaluation and disclosure to the public must include the analysis and a comparison
of the magnitude of OHV impacts to naturally occurring impacts for all resource
areas used to assess impacts based on site-specific data. Lack of the comparison of
impacts to naturally occurring levels combined with the lack of site-specific data
would be a procedural deficiency that could allow inaccurate statements and
opinions due to the lack of an adequate sense of magnitude. (44-41)

tendency to favor information that confirms an individual’s or group think
preconceptions or hypotheses regardless of whether the information is true
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias ). In past travel plans only studies
with negative motorized conclusions have been cited. We request that the evaluation
include a broad screening of issues, information, data, opinions, and needs so that it
is not based on confirmation bias and meets NEPA procedural requirements. One
important component required to avoid confirmation bias is the inclusion of OHV
and other motorized recreationists on the inter-disciplinary team. (44-42)
64. We are very concerned about what is considered natural and what is not
considered natural. First, the needs of the human environment for motorized
recreation should be considered part of the natural environment (as required by the
original NEPA) and adequately considered in the evaluation. Secondly, massive
impacts from natural events such as fires, floods, and pine beetle (we have
witnessed all of them recently) are considered acceptable while relatively miniscule
impacts from motorized recreation are considered unacceptable. This sort of
reasoning is clearly arbitrary and capricious and we ask that the evaluation define
the natural level of impacts, develop a sense of magnitude for those impacts versus
motorized impacts and carefully screen out any hint of arbitrary and capricious
decision-making. In order to avoid being arbitrary and capricious, all impacts must
be compared to natural levels. Impacts associated with OHV recreation should not
be considered significant unless they are 50% or more of the natural level.
65. Motorized recreationists keep trails open for all users including motorcycle
single-track trail. This issue is especially important during this period of intense
downfall from trees killed by beetle infestations. A once a year trail clearing by a
Forest Service trail crew is no longer adequate to keep trails open. Past closures
have proven that motorized trails that have been closed to motorized use have
become impassable within 3 to 5 years. Examples include the Brooklyn Bridge route
in the Helena National Forest and the Middle Fork of Rock Creek in the

68. The positive economic benefit of OHV recreation in Montana is significant as
documented by Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks in their report Montana OffHighway Vehicles 2008 published in January 2009
(www.bber.umt.edu/pubs/survey/MT_OHV_2008.pdf). This report was prepared by
James T. Sylvester, Bureau of Business and Economic Research, The University of
Montana-Missoula and found that total OHV recreation expenditures by Montana
residents was $122,900,000 in 2008. There is also a significant out-of-state
expenditure that was not evaluated by this investigation. This is an especially
significant issue during these tough economic times. OHV recreation based on a
network of trails that attracts visitors to the area will produce a significant positive
economic impact that must be given a hard look during the development of
alternatives and the evaluation. (44-45)
69. The number one concern of OHV recreationists as documented by Montana Fish
Wildlife and Parks in their report Montana Off-Highway Vehicles 2008 is “Access
to trails”.
70. OHV recreationists have a strong interest in long distance routes where they can
pack their camping gear with them and travel 90 to 125 miles. The concept is to
camp 2 to 4 along the way similar to the Magruder trail in Idaho
(http://fs.usda.gov/nezperce) and cover 90 to 125 miles as part of the experience.
This opportunity could be developed by creating boundary trails around areas such
as the Elkhorn WMA, Big Snowys and Pioneer Mountains and using connecting
trails through the interior to create figure 8 opportunities. We request that this type
of opportunity be evaluated as part of the planning process and that motorized
recreationists be involved. (44-46)

71. Most residents of Montana are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th generation Montanans who

have been raised with motorized access to their public lands. They have driven their
jeeps and motorcycles to places like the Divide Travel Planning project area for
decades and now many of them enjoy recreating on ATVs. This is a very important
cultural issue that must be adequately considered by a travel management plan. (4447)
72. Another significant issue that goes along with historic motorized access is
associated with the way that the level of involvement in a NEPA process is used to
justify motorized closures. Grandpa did not have to participate in a NEPA process
and NEPA as currently practiced is not reaching most Montanans. Please do not
interpret a lesser level of participation as acceptance of motorized closures and use it
as a reason to support grant and foundation funded non-profit non-motorized
environmental groups with paid staff. The level of participation is due to the lack of
an adequate public involvement program that reaches or involves the majority of
residents including motorized recreationists. The project team must be
interdisciplinary and include a sufficient number of motorized recreationists that are
capable of relating to and understanding the needs of motorized recreationists. At
the same time, the NEPA process should seek communication with motorized
recreationists equal to that afforded non-motorized environmental groups. We
request that the agency carefully assess this situation and implement a NEPA public
involvement program that adequately compensates for these conditions and
adequately identifies the significant issues and needs of motorized recreationists.

75. A motorized travel plan is a plan that specifically designates roads, trails and
areas for motorized use, designates which vehicles will be allowed on which routes
and if seasonal restrictions apply. A comprehensive trail designation plans does the
same thing except it includes all trail uses, including mountain bike, equestrian and
hiking. This is a very important distinction because the anti-access groups will
attempt to convince the planning team to develop a "comprehensive" travel plan by
using only the existing inventory of motorized routes. They do this by identifying
existing motorized trails that are good for mountain bikes, equestrians and for bird
watching... or whatever. The current approach is inequitable because it takes the
current motorized route inventory and tries to make it the route inventory for all
users. It leaves out possibilities for constructing or otherwise developing nonmotorized trails and ignores existing non-motorized trails that exist in both the
planning area and adjacent lands. Now, that doesn't mean the agency can't take into
consideration the effect each alternative will have on non-motorized visitors. It can and it should be part of the NEPA analysis. But that is totally different from

specifically providing a non-motorized trail system via the existing inventory of
motorized routes. We support the creation, designation and management of nonmotorized trails, but not at the expense of motorized visitors. We request that the
agency not use the existing motorized trail inventory for designating non-motorized
trails. Instead, if there is a need for non-motorized trails, then the agency should
consider options that do not reduce the existing opportunity for motorized users.
(44-49)
76. An adequate and reasonable preferred alternative would include an adequate
quantity and quality of beginning, intermediate, and advanced routes and trails for a
wide cross-section of motorized visitors including motorcycles, ATVs, and fourwheel drive vehicles. Additionally, the quantity and quality of motorized routes
would be at least equal to the quantity and quality of non-motorized routes. This is
the yard stick that the team should measure travel plan alternatives by. (44-50)
77. Road density does not equal motorized trail density. Impact information
developed based on roads should not be used to estimate impacts from ATV and
single-track motorcycle trails. ATV trails has far less impact than roads in all
resource areas and motorcycle single-track trails have far less impact than roads in
all resource areas. Motorized trails have less impact than roads and this condition
must be recognized during the analysis and decision-making. (44-51)
78. One of the specific requirements under NEPA is that an agency must consider
the effects of the proposed action in the context of all relevant circumstances, such
that where “several actions have a cumulative . . . environmental effect, this
consequence must be considered in an EIS.” Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. U.S.

84. The needs of the public for motorized recreational opportunities include a
variety of trails for different skill levels. Also, routes with minimal traffic are
needed as practice routes for beginning riders. (44-53)
85. The availability of motorized single-track trails has declined dramatically. At the
same time, nearly all of the single-track trails see very little hiking or other use. It is
not reasonable to segregate users on single-track trails. We can all get along and
have done so for years. Sharing should be a primary goal for use of these lands. It is
also consistent with the desegregation of public places as required by the Civil
Rights Act of 1964. Therefore, it is a reasonable alternative to designate all existing
single-track trails on multiple-use lands within the project area open to motorcycle
use. Additionally, single-track challenge trails are needed for expert riders and trials
type motorcycles. (44-53a)

single-track trail does not adequately address the issues and the needs of the public

years, would rather ride their motorcycles on single-track trails and have developed
the skills necessary to ride a motorcycle on single-track trails. We are very

recreation trails are limited at this time and continue to decline. The process has not
differentiated between ATV and motorcycle trails in the travel plan alternatives. In
order to recognize the different needs and impacts, the evaluation must be
differentiated between ATV and motorcycle trails. Figure 2.2 and 2.7 on page 14 of
Chapter 2 in the 3-State OHV EIS and Decision clearly shows that existing tracks
used by motorcycles are to be considered as motorized trails
(http://www.mt.blm.gov/ea/ohv/Chapter2.pdf). The evaluation must consider these

closure. In other words, the analysis must adequately evaluate the site specific value
of a road or trail proposed for closure to motorized recreationists. It must also
quantify the significant negative cumulative impact experienced when motorized
recreationists could not find a trail or road with a similar experience in the area. The
quality of our experience has been significantly reduced. It must also quantify the
significant cumulative impact that the closure of a system of road and trails would
have collectively when enough routes are closed to eliminate a good motorized day

(44-66) We recognize the demand for both motorized and nonmotorized opportunities in the planning area. We have been
working cooperatively with the motorized community to develop
loop trails and connectors suggested here.

92. Site specific monitoring of motorized versus non-motorized use must be
provided for each route as required by the National OHV Rule.
93. Each route must be evaluated on the basis of whether it will see more use as a
motorized route or a non-motorized route and then the appropriate decision should
be made on that basis.
94. Each route must include a socio-economic analysis that includes the impacts on
the public owning OHVs and looking for opportunities to use them and landowners
who purchased property with the intent of being able to access and recreate using
motor vehicles. (44-56)

Travel Plan.

95. It would be a huge step backward for society if we had to comment on every
foot of road, water line, sewer pipe, sidewalk, and motorized trail that the public
needs. Gauging public need by the number of comments is not the norm in our
society and should not be used in this process.

since 1999 and have found that 97% of the visitors are motorized recreationists. The
public comments and votes by how they use the forest, and more motorized access
and recreation is what they are asking for with every visit.
97. The travel management plan for the area must reflect that use and the needs of
the public for motorized recreational opportunities in the area. Again, these are
multiple-use lands and we ask that they remain viable multiple-use lands by not
closing existing motorized routes.

(44-68) This is beyond the scope of the Divide Travel Plan, and
will be considered in the Forest Plan Revision.

98. Theoretical or assumed impacts must not be used to close motorized recreational
opportunities. This is happening way too often. For example, an impact on wildlife
by OHV recreation is assumed on a theoretical basis but there is no site specific data
or monitoring to back that statement. A similar situation is happening in other
resource areas including sedimentation and noxious weeds. Decisions to close
motorized recreation must not be made on the basis of theoretical or assumed
impacts to the natural environment. In order to avoid arbitrary and capricious
decisions, site specific data and monitoring must be presented and demonstrate a
measure significant impact.
99. A sense of magnitude must be used when making decisions about road closures
based on indicators such as sediment production. For example, a route should not be
closed because it is estimated to produce 10 cubic yards less sediment. The sediment
yield must be compared to naturally occurring conditions which includes normal
runoff, floods, and fires. The recent fires in the Helena National Forest discharged
thousands of cubic yards of sediment to the area streams which is more than all of
the motorized routes in the project area for the next 100 years. (44-57) Another
example is the assertion that groomed snowmobile trails affect the lynx. Groomed
snowmobile trails cover less than 0.001% of the total area and the impact on the
lynx is of a similar magnitude. Additionally, if snowmobile trails affect the lynx,
then so do cross-country and snowshoe ski trails. Again, we doubt that these impact
the lynx but if snowmobiles do, then so do trails packed by non-motorized uses.
Quite often non-motorized impacts are equal or greater and they must be fairly

100. Confirmation of the significant magnitude of the impacts of fire versus the
relatively minor impacts of recreation are further substantiated by the following
article from the Helena IR: The popular Meriwether picnic area, located along the
Missouri River in the Gates of the Mountains corridor, also will be closed until the
area is deemed safe for public use. Following the 2007 Meriwether Fire, debris and
numerous floods continue to flow through the picnic site, creating a serious safety
hazard. The public docks will not be installed this year; instead, people should use
Coulter campground. The Meriwether Picnic Area closure could remain in effect for
several years, until hydrologic conditions improve in Meriwether Canyon. “Flash
floods, as those happening at this site, occur when the ground becomes saturated
with water that cannot be absorbed quickly enough,” said Mike Cole, acting Helena
District ranger. “Without live
vegetation to absorb the precipitation up on the mountain, the water runs off and
floods the picnic area.” http://helenair.com/news/article_633fdef8-6a1c-11df-8dcf001cc4c002e0.html?print=1

101. With respect to the position that there is not enough money to mitigate
problems, motorized recreationists can work with the Forest Service as partners to
obtain many different grants. (44-59)
102. Also, motorized recreationists generate significant levels of funding that would
be available if the agency would pursue them and the system was working to
distribute them equitably. The magnitude of gas tax paid by OHV recreationists is
significant. Fuel used for off-road motorcycle, atv and 4-wheel drive recreation in
Montana is estimated at 18,537,060 gallons per year (Report ORNL/TM-1999/100,
Federal Highway Administration http://wwwcta.
ornl.gov/cta/Publications/Reports/ORNL_TM_1999_100.pdf). Federal gas tax paid
by OHV recreationists living in Montana is significant and is estimated at
$3,410,819 ($0.184 tax per gallon times 18,537,060 gallons per year). The present
worth of this annual amount over the past 30 years is about $58,973,000. The State

(44-72) The Forest Service strives to strike a balance with respect

of Montana fuel tax is $0.2775 per gallon
(http://www.mdt.state.mt.us/administration/gastaxrefund.html). Therefore, an
estimated $5,144,034 in state fuel tax ($0.2775 per gallon times 18,537,060 gallons
per year) is paid annually by Montana off-road recreationists. The present worth of
this annual amount over the past 30 years is about $88,940,000. The amount of gas
tax being returned to Montana OHV recreationists through State Trails Program
(STP) and Recreational Trails Programs (RTP) is less than $200,000 per year
(http://www.fwp.state.mt.us/parks/trails/trailgrantapps.asp and
http://www.fwp.state.mt.us/parks/ohvgrantaward.asp) or less 3% of the total annual
gas tax paid by OHV recreationists. Basically OHV recreationists generate a
significant amount OHV gas tax but it is not being returned for use in OHV trail
projects. These monies should be used to maintain, develop, and provide
environmental enhancement of OHV recreational resources but, unfortunately, it is
being diverted elsewhere. This significant issue must be addressed. (44-60)

103. The most common maintenance requirement for 4x4 and OHV routes is the
construction and maintenance of water bars/dips/mounds to divert runoff from the
route. This maintenance could easily be provided by running a SWECO trail
machine with a trained operator over each route once every 5 years. OHV trail
maintenance and gas tax monies are available to fund this maintenance. Each region
could set up a program similar to the Trails Unlimited program
(http://www.fs.fed.us/trailsunlimited/). AmeriCorps type labor could also be used.
The SWECO could not be used on motorcycle single-track trails but they typically
require less maintenance and water bars/dips/mounds can usually be constructed on
these trails by hand work. (44-61)
104. Where cattle grazing have established a network of cow trails, a reasonable
alternative would be to allow motorcycle use on these single-track trails as there

106. The Helena National Forest has far less than the desired number of motorized
trails. This creates two problems. First, the public will tend to “explore” closed
routes in an attempt to salvage a decent outing. Secondly, it produces an
unsatisfactory OHV experience.
107. The scope of the project must address both existing routes and new
construction. This is necessary and reasonable because a certain percentage of the
existing routes are likely to be closed. Putting a sideboard on the project scope that
prevents the evaluation and creation of any new trail segments also eliminates the
opportunity to mitigate the overall level of motorized closures. (44-64) This
approach, if pursued, would preclude the evaluation of a reasonable alternative and
also preclude any opportunity for mitigation and enhancement. Therefore, limiting
scoping of the project to existing routes only would produce a significant built-in
disadvantage for motorized recreationists, i.e., the overall number of motorized
routes are destined to be reduced and nothing can be considered to enhance existing
routes and to mitigate the overall loss to motorized recreationists. We are concerned
that the process will not provide motorized recreationists with an equal opportunity
(50/50 sharing of motorized to non-motorized trails) in the outcome and we are only
destined to lose. We would appreciate an independent evaluation of this situation as
soon as possible so that the proper scoping direction can be corrected early in the
process. (44-65)
108. Note that non-motorized recreationists can use routes that are both open and
closed to motorized recreationists including roads and the evaluation of the
opportunities available to non-motorized recreationists must be based on the total of
all existing roads and trails. Additionally non-motorized recreationists can use an
infinite amount of cross-country opportunity and motorized recreationists cannot. A

109. Over 50% of the public land is managed by wilderness, wilderness study area,
national park, monument, roadless, non-motorized area, wildlife management, and
other restrictive management criteria that eliminates most or all motorized access
and motorized recreation. The Final Roadless Rule published on January 5, 2001
(http://roadless.fs.fed.us/documents/rule/roadless_fedreg_rule.pdf) specifically
stated “The proposed rule did not close any roads or off-highway vehicle (OHV)
trails”. The agency must honor this commitment. This commitment was recently
upheld as part of appeal Number 07-05-10-0005 dated January 10, 2008 for the
Smith River NRA travel management plan in the Six Rivers National Forest filed by
Blue Ribbon Coalition
(http://www.sharetrails.org/releases/media/?story=556 and
www.sharetrails.org/files/SmithRiverNraBrcAppealDecisionJan14.pdf).
Therefore, all (100%) of the remaining public lands including roadless areas must be
managed for multiple-uses in order to avoid further contributing to the excessive
allocation of resources and recreation opportunities for exclusive non-motorized use.

110. Jim Angell, the Denver-based Earth Justice attorney, says that's why it's too
simplistic to liken roadless protections to those of full-blown wilderness
designations - which take an act of Congress. "And it didn't bar things like oil and
gas, which often takes place without the building of roads by angling the drilling
from elsewhere; it didn't apply to ORV use which can continue without any stop,"
Angell says.

acres or 23.36% is already designated wilderness. Current forest planning actions
seek to convert roadless lands to defacto wilderness even though they are designated
multiple-use lands. Therefore, this percentage will be even more lopsided toward
non-motorized opportunities at 53.79% assuming that 58,518 acres of roadless areas
are converted to defacto wilderness areas and managed for non-motorized
recreation. We maintain that the management of all of the remaining 147,381,000
congressionally designated multiple-use acres (including roadless) or 76.64% of the
forest should be managed for multiple-uses. Every multiple-use acre must remain
available for multiple-uses in order to meet the needs of 96.41% of the public who
visit our National Forests for multiple-uses. Every reasonable multiple-use acre
must remain available for multiple-uses in order to maintain a reasonable balance of
opportunities. The proposed plan does not meet the basic needs of the public for
multiple-use opportunities, does not provide a proper allocation of multiple-use
recreation opportunities and does not meet the laws requiring multiple-use
management of these lands. (44-68)

112. Basically, as shown in the table below, there is too little motorized access and
too few motorized trails in the Helena National Forest. Therefore, every mile of
existing road and motorized trail is very, very important. The evaluation must
adequately consider and address the fact that motorized access to the Helena
National Forest is relatively limited as shown by the miles of roads versus the
number of acres in the following table. The miles of motorized trails are
exceptionally inadequate for the thousands of OHV recreationists looking for those
opportunities. Additionally, the miles of motorized trails and especially single-track
is way out of balance with the needs of thousands of motorized recreationists in the
region surrounding the Helena National Forest. At the same time, the miles and
percentage of non-motorized trails is excessive compared to the use that they receive
and this does not consider the endless cross-country opportunities that available. The
total route opportunity available to non-motorized recreationists is 2836 miles and
the total miles of exclusive non-motorized trails are 541 (78.52%) and the crosscountry miles are infinite. The total miles of roads open to motorized recreationists
are 1410 and the total mile of trails open to motorized recreationists is 148 (21.48%)

and the miles of cross-country opportunity is zero. Existing motorized single-track
trails total about 38 miles or 5.52%. (44-69)
Given the number of motorized recreationists and the miles of routes available, it
should be very obvious that motorized recreationists are already squeezed into an
inadequate system of routes. Under the existing condition, 12.00% of the Helena
National Forest is set-aside for segregated exclusive non-motorized use for 3,000 or
0.59% of the visitors to the forest. The remaining 505,000 or 99.41% of the visits
are associated with multiple-use. Multiple-use lands are public places. Segregation
in public places has not been acceptable since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In order
to reasonably meet the requirements of integration a reasonable management goal
for the remaining 88.00% of the forest would be for shared multiple-use that would
produce a forest-wide 50/50 sharing of non-motorized/motorized trail opportunities
and correct the current imbalance as shown in the table below. The overall
allocation of existing non-motorized versus motorized access and trail riding
opportunities in the Helena National Forest is a does not reasonably meet the needs
of the public for motorized access and the recreational needs of motorized
recreationists.(44-70) We request that this data be used to guide the decision-making
to a preferred alternative that adequately meets the needs of the public by increasing
motorized recreational opportunities in the project area. (44-71)

113. While we do not support segregation, if segregation is to be implemented on
multiple-use lands (which must be considered public places), then a corresponding
goal would be to demonstrate an absolutely perfect 50/50 sharing of non-motorized
and motorized trails as part of that segregation. Therefore, if the proposed plan
further promotes segregation on multiple-use lands, then it must include a
corresponding 50/50 sharing and it must not tip the balance further in favor of nonmotorized trails and at the expense of motorized routes. (44-72)
114. It is not reasonable to reward recreationists who create and promote a culture of
non-sharing on public lands.
115. In order to bring equality to the allocation of non-motorized to motorized trails
in the Helena National Forest must either convert 197 miles ((689/2)-148) of nonmotorized trails to motorized trails or 393 miles (541-148) of new motorized trail
must be constructed. The Divide Travel Plan must adequately address this
imbalance and it was a step in the wrong direction by creating an even greater
imbalance.

when they already have a significant unjustified advantage in non-motorized trail
opportunities when compared to motor trail opportunities (541 miles and 78.52%
non-motorized trails versus 148 miles and 21.48% motorized trails). Moreover, it is
not equitable to use a process that is pre-determined to provide one group or selected

At a typical width of no more than 48 inches, the 110 miles of ATV trails cover
about 53 acres. At a typical width of no more than 24 inches the 38 miles of
motorized single-track trails cover about 9.2 acres. The total Helena National Forest
is covers 977,000 acres. The percentage of the total forest used by roads, ATV trails,
and single-track motorcycle trails under existing conditions is respectively,
0.2099%, 0.0055%, and 0.0009%. The total area of roads and trails under Existing
Conditions far less than 1% of the project area. The total area used by motorized
routes under Existing Conditions is 2113 acres or 0.2163% of the 977,000 acre area.
These values demonstrate the often heard concern from the public that they are
being squeezed out of our public lands. The area used Under Existing Conditions is
relatively insignificant and is an entirely reasonable level of use on multiple-use
lands. The reduction under the proposed action produces a significant impact on the
public’s ability to access and recreate and is not a reasonable level of use for lands
designated for multiple-use by congress (44-75). Furthermore, a Pro-Recreation

This final rule requires designation of those roads, trails, and areas that are open to
motor vehicle use. Designations will be made by class of vehicle and, if appropriate,
by time of year. The final rule will prohibit the use of motor vehicles off the
designated system, as well as use of motor vehicles on routes and in areas that is not
consistent with the designations.
The clear identification of roads, trails, and areas for motor vehicle use on each
National Forest will enhance management of National Forest System lands; sustain
natural resource values through more effective management of motor vehicle use;
enhance opportunities for motorized recreation experiences on National Forest
System lands; address needs for access to National Forest System lands; and
preserve areas of opportunity on each National Forest for non-motorized travel and
experiences.

Clearly the rule intended to identify existing routes being used for motorized access
and recreation and preserve existing non-motorized routes by elimination of crosscountry travel. Why is a process that was intended to eliminate cross-country travel
and designate existing motorized routes been allowed to turn into a massive closure
process?
.
Additionally, the rule preserves existing non-motorized routes by not allowing them
to be converted to motorized routes and it does not state anywhere that nonmotorized travel and experiences were to be significantly enhanced by a wholesale
conversion of motorized routes to non-motorized routes. The intention of the final
OHV Route Designation rule must be followed by the Divide Travel Plan decision
and that the rule not be used inappropriately as an action to create wholesale
motorized closures and a wholesale conversion of motorized to non-motorized
routes.

124. Forest Service and BLM law enforcement has taken the position that OHVs
cannot legally ride on forest or BLM roads unless the road is designated dual-use.
Cumulative decisions have closed OHV trails to the point that there is not an interconnecting network of routes. At the same time, the agencies have not designated a
functional network of dual-use routes to interconnect to OHV routes. Dual-use is
essential for the family OHV experience. Therefore, these closure decisions are
forcing the OHV recreationists to ride non-designated dual-use routes illegally. The
proposed action must include these designations in order to provide a network of
OHV routes with inter-connections, where required, using dual-use roads in order to
be functional. This will allow OHV enthusiasts to operate legally on forest and BLM
roads. We request that a system of dual-purpose roads, and OHV roads and trails
that interconnect be one of the primary objectives of the travel management plan
and that this objective be adequately addressed in the document and decision. The
issue of speed can be adequately and easily addressed by specifying maximum
speeds and signing. Without the dual-use designation, the proposed action would
transform family OHV trips from a healthy family oriented recreation to an illegal
activity. This is not a reasonable or acceptable outcome. (44-78)
125. The continual closure of motorized trails has forced OHVs to be operated on
forest roads in order to provide a reasonable system of routes and to reach
destinations of interest. The lack of dual-use designations on forest roads then
makes OHV use on these routes illegal. The cumulative negative effect of motorized
closures and then combined with the lack of a reasonable system of roads and trails
with dual-use designation have not been adequately considered in past evaluations
and decision-making. We request that all reasonable routes be designated for dualuse so that a system of roads and trails can be used by motorized recreationists.
Additionally, we request that the cumulative negative effect of all past decisions that
have adequately considered dual-use designations be evaluated and considered in
the decision-making and that this project include an adequate mitigation plan to

126. In many cases illegal trails are created in response to the lack of adequate
motorized opportunities. If there were an adequate number of OHV trail systems,
then the need to create illegal trails would be greatly diminished. Therefore, the
catch-22 of the closure trend is that in the end it feeds the illegal activity. In other
words, it would be a more advantageous and equitable situation to pro-actively
manage motorized recreation.
127. The Forest Service has only addressed less motorized access and less
motorized recreational opportunities. The alternatives formulation and decisionmaking must adequately recognize and address the fact that the majority of the
public visiting the project area want more motorized access and motorized
recreational opportunities.
128. The existing level of motorized access and recreation cannot be dismissed
because it is only associated with the No Action Alternative. The existing level of
motorized access and recreation is reasonable alternative and an alternative other
than No Action must be built around it. (44-80)
129. The Ravalli County Off-Road Users Association has found that “at the end of
2006, there were approximately 2500 “stickered” OHV’s in Ravalli County. For the
past five years, the growth rate of “stickered” OHV’s has been about 20% per year.
If this growth rate continues, the numbers of OHV’s in the forest will double every
four years. On the Bitterroot National Forest there have been no new OHV “system”
routes designated for OHV travel since 1996. History, experience and common
sense tell us that when adequate, responsible, sustainable routes with attractive
destinations are provided, OHV enthusiasts will ride responsibly. On the Bitterroot
National Forest this means more routes, not more restriction.” The same analysis
must be done for the Helena National Forest and it will find the same no growth
trend and a lack of an adequate number of existing routes that is further made worse
by a lack of new routes to address growth. (44-81)

manage natural resources, improve recreation management in

130. It is not environmentally and socially responsible to squeeze motorized
recreationists into the small possible numbers of areas and routes, yet this is the goal
being pursued by the Helena National Forest. There is also a significant public
safety aspect associated with squeezing everyone into a small area as accidents will
increase with too many motorized recreationists on too few routes. We request that
these significant issues be adequately addressed. (44-82)
131. Motorized recreationists endorsed and accepted millions of acres of area
restriction under the Off-Highway Vehicle Environmental Impact Statement and
Proposed Plan Amendment for Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota (3-State
OHV) decision (http://www.mt.blm.gov/ea/ohv/FSROD.pdf ) and the Travel
Management; Designated Routes and Areas for Motor Vehicle Use, Final Rule
(http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/final.pdf) as a positive action to
control environmental impacts. We accepted area restriction and not area closure.
Area closure is permanent. Area restriction allows flexibility as needed to address
site specific conditions. Each motorized road and trail exists because it serves some
multiple-use need. Every road and trail is important to some individual for some
purpose. Each motorized road and trail must have adequate site-specific analysis to
determine all of its values including motorized recreational value. Motorized
recreationists gave up 97% of the area historically available to them under both the
3-State ROD and the National Route Designation rule as the ultimate act of
mitigation so that we would continue to have use of existing motorized routes that
cover or provide access to an area estimated at less than 3% of the total area. Now
motorized recreationists have been given almost no credit for our cooperation during
that action and we have only been penalized for our past cooperation by current
route designations, resource management plans, forest plans and travel plans that
seek to close 50% to 75% of the existing motorized routes. This outcome was not
part of the 3-StateOHV and National Route Designation agreement and this level of
closure is not acceptable to us for that reason. The 3-State OHV and National Route
Designation agreements were not made with the intention of massive closures
beyond that agreement. We ask that all BLM and Forest Service actions include

proper recognition of the agreement behind the 3-State OHV and National Route
Designation decisions which allow continued use of the existing networks of

132. The typical use of public lands and the typical needs of the public in our region
are described on Table 2-7 in the Social Assessment of the Beaverhead-Deerlodge
National Forest dated October 2002 (http://www.fs.fed.us/r1/bd/
forest_plan/revision/reports_documents/social/Forest%20Social%20Assessment%2
0Masterfin al%20.pdf). This document reported that the total number of forest
visitors in Forest Service Region 1 for year 2000 was 13,200,000. The total number
of wilderness visits was estimated at 337,000 or 2.55%. Therefore, millions of
visitors to public lands (nearly all at 97.45%) benefit from management for
multiple-use and benefit from motorized access and mechanized recreational
opportunities which are consistent with our observations of visitors enjoying
motorized access and mechanized recreation on public lands.
The agency has overlooked one important aspect of the visitor use data. The visitor
use data cited above is based on a percent of the total population. However, the
percent of the total population visiting our public lands is a fraction of the total
population. Public lands should be managed for those people that actually visit
them. We request that this adjustment be made in this evaluation.
The total number of individuals that visit our national forests is about 56 million
(personal communication Don English, National Visitors Use Monitoring Program,
Forest Service, November 29, 2005). Our total U.S. population is about 286 million
(2000 Census Data). Therefore, only about 20% (56 million/286 million) of the total
U.S. population actually visits our national forests. This number needs to be used as
the denominator (baseline) for total forest visitors.
Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth recognized the true popularity and magnitude
of motorized recreation in his January 16, 2004 speech which stated “Off-highway
vehicles, or OHVs, are a great way to experience the outdoors. But the number of

OHV users has just gotten huge. It grew from about 5 million in 1972 to almost 36
million in 2000.” We agree with the Forest Chief that 36 million is a significant
number of recreationists. Additionally, the USDA Southern Research Station has
recently validated the growing popularity of OHV recreation in their Recreation
Statistics Update Report No. 3 dated October 2004
(http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/trends/RecStatUpdate3.pdf). This document reports that
the total number of OHV users has grown from 36 million to 49.6 million or 38% by
the fall 2003/spring 2004. Based on the 2000 estimates OHV and motorized
recreationists are about 64% of the population that actually visits the forest (36
million / 56 million).
This is further substantiated on page 9 of a report prepared by National Survey on
Recreation and the Environment (NSRE 2000) titled Outdoor Recreation
Participation in the United States
(http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/trends/Nsre/summary1.pdf) which asks the question
“During the past 12 months. Did you go sightseeing, driving for pleasure or driving
ATVs or motorcycles?” The percent responding “Yes” was 63.1% and the total
number in millions was estimated at 130.8 million. Additionally, NSRE is often
referenced by the agency but the summary statistics are skewed against motorized
recreation because driving for pleasure and OHV use are split out as separate
groups. These two groups represent motorized recreation and if they are added
together they are as large as any other group in the survey which correctly
demonstrates the magnitude of motorized recreation.
Additionally, the Southern Research Station in their report Off-Highway Vehicle
Recreation in the United States, Regions and States
(http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/ohv/OHV_final_report.pdf) determined
that of the total U.S. population in the West 27.3% participated in OHV recreation
and that out of the total population in Montana 29.1% participated in OHV
recreation. It appears that the study is diluting the actual percentage of OHV
recreationists by using total population and not the population actually visiting and
using the forest. As discussed above only 20% of the total U.S. population visits the

forest. The percentage of Montanans that actually visit our national forests is higher
than the national average and is estimated at ½ of the total state population. Based
on this estimate, it is our opinion that about 60% (29.1% x 2) of the actual visitors to
Montana national forests participate in OHV recreation.
These surveys and data demonstrates the significant popularity of motorized and
OHV recreation and the tremendous public support and need for motorized and
OHV recreational opportunities. We maintain that motorized recreationists are the
main group of visitors out of the total population of visitors to the national forest
visiting the forest 5 or more days per year. The needs and support of motorized
recreationists must be adequately addressed in this planning effort by preserving all
reasonable existing motorized recreational opportunities. This planning effort must
also adequately address the increasing popularity by creating new motorized
recreational opportunities. OHV and dual-sport registrations in Montana grew by at
least 24% from 2004 to 2005

The U.S. census determined that the population in 2005 was 935,670

motorized recreational opportunities. These numbers demonstrate that the agency’s
motorized closure trend is contrary to the needs of the public. The magnitude of the
number of motorized recreationists is real. The misrepresentation of visitor numbers
must be discontinued. Proper emphasis must be given to motorized recreation. (4484) Additionally, the agency must understand and accept that many motorized
recreationists do not participate in the NEPA process. Therefore, the agency should
not be driven by the number of perceived participants and comments received. As
originally envisioned and stated in law, the NEPA process should be driven by
issues and needs and motorized recreationists have significant issues and needs.
Motorized recreationists believe and hope that the Forest Service as a public agency
will look out for their issues and needs in an even-handed way. In other words, as
the process works now, the needs of largely unorganized motorized interests
including individuals and families are largely ignored. The agency must not be
overly influenced by organized non-motorized groups and their significant lobbying,
organized comment writing and legal campaigns. The agency must adequately
emphasize the needs of lesser organized and funded motorized recreationists by
developing a motorized travel plan that addresses the needs associated with the
numbers and popularity of at least 272,280 motorized and OHV recreationists. The
current proposal does not meet these needs in a multiple-use area that is ideal for
motorized use.
135. The current allotment of recreation resources on all Forest Service lands is way
out of balance with 44,919,000 acres out of 192,300,000 acres or 24% in wilderness
designation while no more than 2.55% of the visitors are wilderness visitors.
Designation as wilderness is further out of touch with the needs of the public
because recreation is not a stated purpose of the wilderness act and, therefore,
recreation in wilderness area cannot and should not be emphasized. Note that we
could oppose any recreation development in wilderness areas in retaliation to nonmotorized groups that go after our recreation opportunities but we have chosen not
to do so. Recreation is a stated purpose in the multiple-use laws and, therefore,
should be emphasized in the purpose and action.

137. The evaluation must adequately consider and address the fact that motorized
access to the national forest is relatively limited as shown by the miles of roads
versus the number of acres in the following table. The miles and percentage of nonmotorized trails is excessive compared to the use that they receive and this does not
consider the endless cross-country opportunities that available to non-motorized
recreationists. The total route opportunity available to non-motorized recreationists
is 510,575 miles; the total miles of exclusive non-motorized trails are 93,088 or 75%
of the existing total. The miles of non-motorized cross-country opportunity are
infinite.(44-85)
138. The total miles of roads open to motorized recreationists are 286,445 and the
total miles of trails open to motorized recreationists are 31,853 or 25% of the
existing total. The cross-country miles are or will be shortly equal to zero.
Therefore, the overall allocation of non-motorized versus motorized access and trail
riding opportunities in the national forest system is way out of balance with the
needs of the public for motorized access and the recreational needs of motorized
recreationists.
Furthermore, we request that the data in the next two tables be updated to reflect the
significant reduction in miles of roads and motorized trails that decisions have
produced since this data was assembled. This revised data should be used to guide
the decision-making to forest plan and travel plan alternatives that adequately meet
the needs of the public by increasing motorized recreational opportunities in the
national forest system. (44-86)

there were 10,055,000 total site visits to the forest and only 304,000 wilderness
visits (http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/nvum/revised_vis_est.pdf).
Therefore, wilderness visits in Montana are only 3.02% of the total visits yet past
decisions have produced both a disproportionately large and an increased number of
recreation opportunities for non-motorized and wilderness visitors and at the
expense of the multiple-use and motorized visitors. The remaining 96.98% of the
visitors are for the most part associated with multiple-uses. The public comments
and votes by how they use the forest, and more motorized access and recreation is
what they are asking for with every visit regardless of whether they provide
comments in a cumbersome NEPA process.

141. Additionally, specific NVUM data for the Helena National Forest shows that
there were 508,000 total site visits to the forest and only 3,000 wilderness visits
(http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/nvum/revised_vis_est.pdf). Therefore,
wilderness visits in the Helena National Forest are 0.59% of the total visits yet past
decisions in Region 1 and the proposed plan by the Helena National Forest have
produced both a disproportionately large and an increased number of recreation
opportunities for non-motorized and wilderness visitors and at the expense of the
multiple-use and motorized visitors. The remaining 99.41% of the visitors are
associated with multiple-uses. The public comments and votes by how they use the
forest, and more motorized access and recreation is what they are asking for with

142. The NVUM and Southern Research Station reports cited prove that there are
146,000 (508,000 forest visitors x 29.1% OHV) OHV visitors to the Helena
National Forest and 3,000 wilderness visitors. The ratio of trail users is 49
motorized to 1 non-motorized yet the balance of existing trails is 21% motorized
versus 79% non-motorized. Clearly there is an imbalance of opportunity that
justifies more (not less) motorized recreational opportunities.

143. As demonstrated by Table 3, the ratio of acres available to wilderness/nonmotorized visitors versus the acres available to multiple-use visitors is way out of
balance in the existing condition with 39 acres per wilderness visitor and 1.70 acres
per multiple-use visitor for a ratio of about 23:1. The proposed action to designate
all roadless areas non-motorized areas makes this inequity even worse by providing
187 acres per wilderness visitor and 0.82 acre per multiple-use visitor for a ratio of
about 228:1.
The available multiple-use (MU) acres and acres per MU visitors is less than this
example because even though lands are designated as MU by congress the agency is
effectively managing many multiple-use acres as non-motorized/defacto wilderness.
Therefore, the acres per MU visitor are significantly less than shown and the
imbalance of the ratio of defacto wilderness acres per visitor to MU acres per visitor
is significantly greater than this example.

We recognize the desire for a quiet experience in the forest as a legitimate value. To
varying degrees, we all visit the forest to enjoy the natural sounds of streams, trees,
and wildlife. Forest visitors who require an absolutely natural acoustic experience in
the forest should be encouraged to use the portions of the forest which have been set
aside for their exclusive benefit where they are guaranteed a quiet experience, i.e.,
wilderness areas. Given the demonstrated underutilization of existing wilderness
areas, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that there is adequate wilderness area.

144. There is an estimated 147,828 OHV visitors to the Helena National Forest each
year. At 20 miles per visit, OHV visitors log a total of 2,956,560 miles on OHV
routes. We have observed that there is significantly more construction and
maintenance provided for non-motorized trails in the Helena National Forest when
compared to motorized trails and the amount of use that they receive. As a result,
non-motorized trails are in better condition and there are more miles of nonmotorized trail per user. Construction and maintenance efforts for motorized trails
should be at least equal to that expended on non-motorized trails. This inequity is a
significant issue that must be adequately addressed. For example, the Forest Service
provides hundreds of wilderness rangers to patrol the wilderness, and educate
wilderness visitors. Multiple-use Rangers are almost non-existent even though the
ratio of multiple-use visitors to wilderness visitors is over 100:1. As required by
NEPA, the evaluation and document must disclose the dollars expended annually in
the Helena National Forest for construction and maintenance efforts for motorized
trails and non-motorized trails. The decision must move in the direction of a
motorized trail system that is equal to the non-motorized trail system. The decision
must also move in the direction of an equal allocation of maintenance dollars. (4489)
145. Based on our estimate that 40% of the visitors are OHV recreationists, we
estimate using the NVUM data for total visitors that the total number of OHV visits

or 90% were OHV recreationists and 1,087 or 10% were non-motorized
recreationists which includes mountain bikes which are a form of mechanized travel,
Therefore, the use of trails is 8:1 motorized versus non-motorized and the use of all
routes is 13:1 mechanized versus non-motorized. Therefore, nearly all (97%) of the
visitors to public lands benefit from management for multiple-use and benefit from
motorized access and mechanized recreational opportunities which are consistent
with our observations. Therefore, 90% of the trail users are motorized and 94%
when including mountain bikes which enjoy using the same trails. Therefore, in
order to be reasonably responsive to the needs of the public at least 90% to 94% of
the trails system and public land should be managed for multiple-uses including
motorized access and recreation. (44-91)

conflicts on multiple-use trails as a concern that needed attention. The Committee
worked with the Federal Highway Administration to produce a report
(https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/9849/GV_191.67_T
7M66_1994.pdf?sequence=1) to promote a better understanding of trail conflict, and
identify approaches for promoting trail-sharing. The goal of the report was to
promote user safety, protect natural resources, and provide high-quality user
experiences. It reviews management options such as trail design, information and
education, user involvement, and regulations and enforcement. The report found
very sound ways to promote cooperation and understanding among trail users and
presented ideas that will help reduce conflict on multiple-use trails. The report
provides 12 principles for minimizing conflicts on multiple-use trails and we ask
that each of these principles be incorporated into the travel management plan. (4492)

OHV recreationists, the total number of OHV related visits to the Helena National
Forest is 147,828 (508,000 x .291) (see NVUM citation for total number of forest
visitors above). Given the 148 miles of existing motorized trails, there are 985
(147828 / 148) OHV visitors per mile of motorized trail or 1 OHV visitor every 5.3
feet. Given the 541 miles of non-motorized trail and 3,000 wilderness visitors, there
are 5.55 (3,000 / 541) non-motorized visitors per mile of trail or 1 non-motorized
visitor every 952 feet. Note that these statistics are at least 6 years old and do not
reflect the motorized closures that have occurred during the last 6 years. This
imbalance of opportunity cannot be considered equal program delivery and the
proposed action must address this significant issue by creating more motorized
trails. Clearly the current proposal would be a step in the wrong direction. (44-93)

150. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on OHV recreation has
been prepared and released to the general public
(http://www.gao.gov/Products/GAO-09-509). GAO investigators interviewed
agency personnel, OHV rider and industry representatives and environmental group
representatives. GAO issued a number of findings in terms of OHV recreation on
public lands. GAO highlights include that OHV recreation is growing in popularity
and that more Americans are seeking access to federal public lands via their OHVs.
Second, the report found that the federal land agencies could do a better job of
providing signage and general outreach to the recreating public so that visitors to
public lands have a better understanding of where they can and cannot ride their
OHVs. The report also focused attention on the inadequacies of law enforcement
and the inconsistent scale of fines and penalties for inappropriate behavior on public
lands. GAO found that the land agencies were stretched, both in terms of financial
resources and personnel, and that other pressing concerns, such as fighting wildfires,
apprehending drug criminals and border control issues kept agency personnel from
devoting the necessary time to make public lands more accessible to recreation
visitors. GAO looked into the issue of environmental damage caused by OHVs and
found such damage is far less than some observers believed to be the case. Another
finding was that agency personnel worked well with OHV user groups on trail
maintenance projects. The report's conclusions confirm what we have known for a

continue working on our priority issues. Motorized recreationists will continue to
carry on our efforts to support law enforcement reform legislation as well as seek
additional funding for better signage, maps and trail maintenance. Working with the
Congress and our land agencies, we can create an environment where OHV
recreation can continue to grow in popularity as more American families look to

motorized closures on the health of our members and the loss of the benefits of
OHV recreation are significant issues to motorized recreationists. In order to make a
reasonable decision, the Forest Service must adequately considers the issues and
impacts associated with motorized closures on the mental and physical health of the
public. These issues are critical due to the cumulative effect of all motorized
closures. (44-64) As one example, consider the motorized closure of the Scratch
Gravel Hills near Helena. Members of our group collected over 300 signatures on a
petition protesting that closure. Many of the signatures were from high school
students. Now there is no place close to Helena that young people can go. What are
they doing now? It is not as positive as riding their dirt bike or ATV in the hills.
Now multiply that by the thousands of miles of roads and trails that have been
closed to the public. The following health issues and benefits of OHV recreation
must be addressed in order to arrive at a reasonable decision for this action.
A. Sadly, one indicator of the condition of the human environment in Montana is the
suicide rate. Montana ranks number 2 in the nation (http://www.suicide.org/suicidestatistics.html). This significant problem has been specifically identified as requiring
special attention by the Department of Health and Human Services
http://www.dphhs.mt.gov/amdd/statesuicideplan.pdf. Motorized recreation is
popular and it is a very healthy and positive human activity that can help address

this significant human issue (http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/The-ResultsAre-in-Off-Road-Vehicle-Riding-is-Good-for-Your-Body-and-Soul-1310189.htm).
The Forest Service can help address this significant problem by providing an
adequate quantity and quality of motorized recreational opportunities. We ask that
you adequately address this significant issue associated with the human
environment.
B. Videophilia - the new human tendency to focus on sedentary activities involving
electronic media has become a significant social problem in the U.S. (Pergams, O.
R. W. and P. A. Zaradic. 2006. Is love of nature in the US becoming love of
electronic media? 16-year downtrend in national park visits explained by watching
movies, playing video games, internet use, and oil prices. Journal of Environmental
Management 80:387-393). The study shows that people in the US and other
developed nations are spending far less time in nature than ever before. The study
tested trends in nature participation in 16 time series in the categories of visitation to
various types of public lands in the US, Japan, and Spain; number of various types
of game licenses issued; amount of time spent camping; and amount of time spent
backpacking or hiking. The four activities with the greatest per capita participation
were visits to Japanese National Parks, US State Parks, US National Parks, and US
National Forests, with an average individual participating 0.74-2.75 times per year.
All four are in downtrends and are losing between 1% and 3% per year. The longest
and most complete time series show that these declines in per capita nature
participation typically began between 1981 and 1991, are losing about 1% per year,
and have so far lost between 18% and 25%. At the same time, the interest and desire
to participate in OHV recreation in the outdoors is increasing and strong as
previously documented. OHV recreation is a reasonable alternative to increase
participation in outdoor activities and we request that this issue and solution be
adequately addressed by this plan by implement more OHV opportunities.
C. In the past 30 years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased
sharply for both adults and children. Between 1976–1980 and 2003–2004, the
prevalence of obesity among adults aged 20–74 years increased from 15.0% to

32.9%. This increase is not limited to adults. Among young people, the prevalence
of overweight increased from 5.0% to 13.9% for those aged 2–5 years, 6.5% to
18.8% for those aged 6–11 years, and 5.0% to 17.4% for those aged 12–19 years.
(Reference: ttp://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/obesity/). This disturbing trend has
prompted the President to promote a health and fitness initiative
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/fitness/toc.html) and OHV recreation is an
activity that meets the physical requirements of the President’s fitness program and
counters the epidemic of videophilia.

D. Research by the Ontario Federation of Trail Riders studied 310 off-road
motorcycle enthusiasts and found that the physical exertion was on the order of 60%
of VO2max, or 80% HRmax, or 9.3 METS which is slightly greater than jogging
(Characterizing the Physical Demands of Off-Road Motorcycling, Executive
Summary, Jamie Burr, Norman Gledhill, Veronica Jamnik, Ontario Federation of
Trail Riders, February 2007,
http://www.oftr.org/OFTR_Fitness_Study.pdf).
E. The July 2010 issue of Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, the Official
Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), “Physiological
Demands of Off-Road Vehicle Riding”) focuses specifically on the physiological
demands of off-road vehicle (OHV) riding, compares them to the demands of other
recreational activities, and explores the health and fitness benefits that OHV
participation can provide
(http://www.nohvcc.org/Tools/TopicLibraries/Health.aspx). The study concluded
that the health benefits of OHV recreation include:
• Off-road vehicle riding was found to require “a true physiological demand that
would be expected to have a beneficial effect on health and fitness according to
Canada’s current physical activity recommendations”.
• Off-road vehicle riding was determined to be a recreational activity associated
with moderate-intensity cardiovascular demand and fatigue-inducing muscular
strength challenges, similar to other self-paced recreational sports such as golf, rockclimbing and alpine skiing.

• Oxygen consumption, which is an indicator of physical work, increased by 3.5 and
6 times the resting values for ATV and ORM riding respectively – which falls
within moderate intensity activity according to the American College of Sports
Medicine guidelines and is in line with Canadian physical activity
recommendations.
• The duration of a typical ride (2-3 hours for ATV, 1-2 hours for ORM) and the
frequency of the rides (1-2 times a week) create sufficient opportunity to stimulate
changes in aerobic fitness which falls within the physical activity guidelines
(American College of Sports Medicine recommends between 450 – 720 MET
minutes per week).
• Using heart rate measurements alone, the demands of riding belong to the category
of “hard” exercise – this increase of intensity may be linked to heightened psycho
emotional responses (i.e. adrenalin), an effect of heat stress while riding, or a
response to repeated isometric squeezing of the handlebars.
• When considering muscular force and power involvement, study results indicate a
greater impact on muscular endurance as opposed to an increase in strength.
• Off-road vehicle riders perform considerable physical work using their arms and
upper body. This upper body strength requirement “could lead to beneficial training
increases in musculoskeletal fitness”.
• Study findings also picked up on the psycho-social effects of riding – the
“enhanced quality of life and stress reduction effects of off-road riding”.
• Findings also reflect the importance of alternative physical activity such as offroad riding to promote physical activity in a group who might otherwise forego
exercise altogether.

F. Research by a leading neuroscientist has determined that riding a motorcycle
helps keep riders young by invigorating their brains. The brain functions were
measured by devices put on the heads of 22 males while riding motorcycles. The
researchers found that the rider’s brains prefrontal areas became highly activated.
This is the area of the brain that covers memory, information processing and
concentration functions. The research was conducted by Ryuta Kawashima, the
scientist behind popular "Brain Training" computer software at Nintendo.

One experiment involved 22 men, all in their 40s and 50s, who held motorcycle
licenses, but had not taken a ride for at least a decade. They were randomly split into
two groups. The first group was asked to resume riding motorcycles in everyday life
for two months, the other group was asked to keep driving their cars or trucks. "The
group that rode motorbikes posted higher marks in cognitive function tests,"
Kawashima said.
Another test, required the men to remember a set of numbers in reverse order, “the
riders' scores jumped by more than 50 percent in two months, while the non-riders'
marks deteriorated slightly,” said Kawashima. It should also be noted that the riders
in the study mentioned that they made fewer mistakes at work and felt happier.
"Mental care is a very big issue in modern society," says Kawashima. "I think we
made an interesting study here as the data shows you can improve your mental
condition simply by using motorbikes to commute.” The study goes on to display
that a motorcycle rider's brain becomes tenser and is in a heightened alertness in
order to process information actively during riding. The obvious payoff is that riding
a motorcycle helps keep riders young by invigorating their brains.

http://motocrossactionmag.com/Main/News/MOTORCYCLES-MAKE-YOUSMARTERJapanese-Study-Discov-5756.aspx
We have observed that the same benefits that Kawashima has documented for
motorcyclists also extend to all OHV recreation. We ask that the tremendous value
of OHV recreation for both mental and physical health benefits be recognized in the
evaluation and used to justify an increase in motorized recreational opportunities.

153. There are 17 references to climate change in the NOI for the forest planning
rule (http://fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5110264.pdf). Climate
change is mentioned far more than any other issue. This apparent focus is not
balanced with objective science and the needs of the public. The existence of
climate change and any positive or negative impacts are simply not known at this
time. There are many in the scientific community that support this position
(44-97)(http://www.sepp.org/Archive/NewSEPP/LttrtoPaulMartin.html ,

http://epw.senate.gov/speechitem.cfm?party=rep&id=263759). The climate has
always been changing. Twelve thousand years ago North American was covered by
ice. Before that dinosaurs roamed the area in a humid climate. The planning rule
should not create impacts on the human environment because it “presumes” that the
climate is changing any more or less than it always has. The planning rule must be
based on extensive long-term credible scientific study. (44-98) The quality of
people’s lives cannot be compromised by a ghost issue without adequate basis. We
only get one shot at this life and we want to experience the positive benefits of OHV
recreation. Extensive long-term credible scientific conclusions on climate change do
not exist at this time and, therefore, it would be unreasonable to make any
assumptions about climate change and use those assumptions to impose any impacts
on the human environment including motorized recreation in the planning rule.

carbon dioxide.

Lewandowsky professor at the University of Western Australia has concluded that it

our beliefs. It’s when that change contradicts something we’ve long held as
important that problems occur. If information doesn’t square with someone’s prior
beliefs, he discards the beliefs if they’re weak and discards the information if the
beliefs are strong. Even when we think we’ve properly corrected a false belief, the
original exposure often continues to influence our memory and thoughts. Strongly
held beliefs continued to influence judgment, despite having the correction

Dear Supervisor Avey, Ranger DeGeest, and Project Leader Tompkins:
Helena Hunters and Anglers Association (HHAA) members live, work, and recreate
on the Helena National Forest, and several of our members are intimately familiar
with the Divide Travel Planning Area. Much of our membership is made up of
professionally trained natural resource managers. We either are now or have
previously worked in the fields of fish, wildlife, forestry, recreation management,
water quality, cultural resources and environmental assessment. Our mission
statement is commensurate with stated management objectives for the Helena
National Forest:
“The Helena Hunters and Anglers Association is dedicated to protecting and
restoring fish and wildlife to all suitable habitats, and to conserving all natural
resources as a public trust, vital to our general welfare. HHAA promotes the highest
standards of ethical conduct and sportsmanship, and promotes outdoor hunting and
fishing opportunity for all citizens to share equally.”
The following members of our club formed the Divide Travel Management
Evaluation Committee, and include: Steve Platt, Gary Ingman, Bill Orsello, Charlie
McCarthy, Thomas Baumeister, Doug Powell, Jim Posewitz, and Stan Frasier. We

Wildlife
Linkage
The Divide Travel Planning area constitutes one of the most important linkage zones
in the Northern Region. It connects the Northern Continental Divide, Yellowstone,
and Salmon-Selway ecosystems, yet 19th century mining and over-exuberant 20th
century USFS timber harvest have left it as one of the most roaded, fragmented, and
fragile areas of National Forest lands in Montana. It consists of relatively open,
park-like landscapes. In the last few years much of this area’s forest has
experienced extensive beetle-kill.
The Divide Landscape of the Helena National Forest constitutes the central linkage
connection between all areas of western and central Montana as described by

Response to Comments
American Wildlands (2008) and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks’ analysis of
wolverine movements (2008 Furbearer Regulations). The Divide Landscape is the
center or “Hub” of wildlife linkage within the state of Montana. Its ability to
continue to function in this capacity is critical for low-density, far-ranging carnivore
species such as grizzly bears, wolverine, mountain lions, wolves, lynx, as well as
wide-ranging ungulate species (elk, moose, and bighorn sheep). Bighorn sheep have
been seen at the headwaters of Minnehaha Creek, along the Continental Divide in
the Divide Landscape even though this is not bighorn habitat. Another marked
bighorn from the Sleeping Giant area was located near Elliston, attesting to the
linkage importance of the Divide landscape. And yet the Divide Landscape is a
relatively battered place in need of careful, restorative management.
Maps of seasonal elk distribution over a portion of the Divide Landscape (Divide
elk maps 27-34) demonstrate the importance of the Helena National Forest lands
along the Continental Divide. Maps from 2008 showing wolverine and lynx
distribution for the MacDonald Pass area are also available. Additional information
on low-density mid-sized carnivores for a broader area of the Helena National
Forest has been compiled by wildlife contractor Wild Things Unlimited. They
report:
“Our cameras obtained photos of several different wolverines, and added valuable
data related to year-round use of an area of atypical wolverine habitat including:
relatively low elevation, roaded, and with human uses such as logging, hunting, and
snowmobiling. We believe this is extremely important to wolverine conservation in
Montana. Last winter’s efforts resulted in documentation of more previously
unknown lynx and wolverines in the Helena National Forest study area, which is
exciting and valuable news.”
In addition, the Wildlife Conservation Society has defined a crucial area connecting
the three major wolverine ecosystems as the Central Linkage Ecosystem that
includes the Divide Landscape (Inman et al., 2008).
Grizzly bear occurrences throughout the Divide Landscape attest to the area’s

importance as a linkage zone and year-long habitat in areas such as Nevada
Mountain, Snowshoe Creek, Hahn-Hat Creek near Elliston, and the Little Blackfoot
River. Travel planning actions taken to improve landscape linkages, in the form of
limiting duplicative motorized road and trail use in the Divide area, would be an
important and positive step. Alternative 3 clearly does the best job of that, but still
can be improved upon.

Effects of Recreation on Wildlife
National Forest management decisions are required to be based upon “the best
available science.” In borrowing from the Montana Chapter of The Wildlife
Society’s January 14, 2009 comment on the Divide Travel Plan, it should be noted
that the Chapter undertook a comprehensive effort to address the Effects of
Recreation on Rocky Mountain Wildlife – A Review for Montana1. That document,
and its associated on-line bibliography, was partially funded by the USFS. Copies
of the report were provided to every National Forest and most ranger districts in
Montana. The Effects of Recreation report was compiled by 35 wildlife biologists
from state, federal, university and private settings from across Montana who
volunteered their time specifically to provide this information to land and wildlife
managers.
The Divide Draft EIS cites the Montana Chapter of The Wildlife Society document
in the References section. However, the material provided in the document does not
appear to be utilized or referenced in the DEIS, either in the various Wildlife
chapters or the Recreation chapter. Valuable scientific information was provided for
all wildlife species groups including amphibians and reptiles, small mammals, birds,
ungulates, carnivores, and semi-aquatic mammals. In addition, discussion about
impacts from recreational uses to soils, water, and vegetation was presented.
Several Chapter members have been responsible for collecting information for this
specific area over the years. Within the chapter on Ungulates, the following
comments pertaining to big game security are noted:
“Managers of public lands control only a few of the potential variables that

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 352

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
contribute to security including retention of important vegetative cover, travel
management, and enforcement of travel regulations. There is a strong relationship
between adequate security and predicted buck/bull carryover”1

Response to Comments

Three key issues are mentioned: vegetative cover, travel management, and
enforcement of travel regulations. Since the final selected alternative will determine
the effectiveness of the proposed big game security forest plan amendment, these
subjects must be fully addressed within the FEIS and reflected in the selected
Alternative.
Previously, the Montana Chapter of The Wildlife Society noted the following, and
these comments are still relevant to the Draft EIS:
Established analysis procedure requires that the USFS use the best scientific and
commercial information available and ensure that any final decision is based on the
most recent, up-to-date information on wildlife use of the area.
Conversion of previously closed routes to open routes for motorized use has not
been analyzed or justified with respect to initial closure rationale and whether the
purposes for initial closure have changed.
The proposed action must be in compliance with the Helena National Forest Plan.
At present, the proposed action does not appear to be in compliance with standards
for soils, watersheds, elk (security, summer and winter range standards), or the
Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction.
User-created roads (whether they are called roads or trails) must be closed and
reclaimed, and should not be included in the transportation system. These “user
created routes were developed without agency authorization, environmental
analysis, or public involvement and do not have the same status as National Forest
System roads and trails included in the forest transportation system” (70 Fed. Reg.
68268). In other words, these illicit routes were illegally created, never authorized

Response to Comments
by the USFS, and have never undergone any form of NEPA analysis. As such, these
user created routes must be immediately closed, repaired, reseeded, and excluded
from the USFS’s transportation network. The USFS cannot and should not
legitimize such routes or reward OHV users for their illegal and destructive behavior
by now designating such routes as part of the new transportation system. The
Sweeny Creek, Priest Pass, and Greenhorn Mountain areas are prime examples of
places on the Divide Landscape where illegal motorized use and lack of USFS travel
management have led to a plethora of illegal routes that are damaging soil and water
quality, and compromising important wildlife habitat.
The USFS must initiate and complete formal consultation on lynx pursuant to
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.
The USFS must ensure compliance with the Travel Management Rule and all
relevant Executive Orders – including Executive Order 11644 (as amended by
Executive Order 11989). At present, the proposed action is not in compliance with
Executive Order 11644’s duty to locate areas and trails to minimize damage to soils,
watersheds, and vegetation, minimize harassment to wildlife, or minimize conflicts
with users.
Big Game Security Standard/Amendment
The existing big game security standard was based on published literature derived
from 15 years of research on the specific topic of road density, placement, and
timing of use in Montana (Lyon, et al. 1985). The document, Coordinating Elk and
Timber Management3, was conducted in four study areas and concluded:
Road density and pattern, including off-road travel, play an important role in
determining the security level an area provides to elk during the hunting season. An
area with sparse cover and low road densities may provide as much security as the
same size area with heavy cover and high road densities. (8)

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 354

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
Conversely, it is also true that areas with heavy cover and high road densities may
provide as much security as the same size area with sparse cover and low road
densities. However the proposed big game security standard would eliminate all
reference or requirement for cover.

Response to Comments

With respect to security and the need for cover, Lyon et al. (1985) stress:
Road density and cover quality are both important when considering adequate elk
security during the hunting season. (8)
Central Montana elk require the greater security provided by good cover at the edge
of the opening. (10)
The proposed big game security amendment was not derived from field research,
nor is it based on full application of scientific literature on the subject of elk
vulnerability. None of the literature presumes that during the hunting season no
vegetative cover is required. In circumstances where little cover is naturally
available, such as the Missouri River Breaks, topography must substitute for
vegetative cover. However, the hunting season must be severely restricted through
permit-only hunting to compensate for the lack of security.
The proposed big game security amendment merely draws polygons on the
landscape and declares that these areas will provide big game security. No longer
would all National Forest lands be potential elk security and big game security
would be relegated to a series of polygons. Additionally, the requirements for noncover vegetation that Lyon et al. recommended have not been described and listed as
caveats for these polygons. Those requirements as described by Lyon et al. include:
Clearcuts: Openings should be small, even though openings up to 100 acres may be
acceptable where the adjacent forest edge supplies adequate security.
Provide undisturbed security areas adjacent to the area of activity.
Concentrate management activity into the shortest possible time (including followup activity such as planting and burning) (39).
Confine disturbance to the smallest area possible within a single drainage (39).

Response to Comments

It must be noted that the knowledge of elk security with respect to vegetative cover
and roads described in “Coordinating Elk and Timber Management” (1985) was
signed and adopted unilaterally in 1984 by the Bureau of Land Management (Edwin
Zaidlicz, State Director), the Northern Region U.S. Forest Service (Tom Costain,
Regional Forester), School of Forestry, University of Montana (Benjamin B. Stout,
Dean), Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (James W. Flynn,
Director), and the U.S. Forest Service, Intermountain Forest and Ranger Experiment
Station (Laurence El. Lassen, Director).
We question on what grounds and based on which literature is the Lyon et al. (1985)
time-tested approach to elk security being tossed out and replaced with the proposed
big game security amendment? We posit that there is none and that the current
proposal to change the standard for big game security has been designed at a
conference table over the past couple of years, with no supporting field research or
testing.
The very plausible reason for this approach is that the Helena National Forest has
failed, over the past 28 years since the Helena Forest Plan was adopted, to apply and
adhere to the existing security standard. Instead, the Forest has determined
repeatedly for landscape altering projects that there would be “No Significant
Impact”. As a result, the Helena National Forest has finally arrived at the day of
reckoning. In fact, they cannot comply with their own standards now because they
have failed to do so incrementally over the past 28 years.
The “Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact” for the Forest-wide
Hazardous Tree Removal and Fuels Reduction Project, signed August 23, 2010 by
Supervisor Riordan is just one of hundreds of projects that have been similarly
issued over the past 28 years. The Decision stated:
“An alternative that was considered but eliminated from detailed study was one that
addressed the road density issue raised from the public. These comments came

during the Objection period. Some comments suggested the Responsible Official
should consider an alternative that would reduce open road densities as a means of
increasing elk security. With this proposal not being a travel management decision,
this proposed alternative is outside the scope of the decision space and
analysis.”(Hazard Tree Project DN, August 2010).

Response to Comments

The decision that was made to “treat” many roads in remote settings influenced the
subsequent Travel Plan and the functionality of the big game security and habitat
effectiveness standards, but failed to address those impacts.
The analysis conducted for the Hazardous Tree Project clearly reveals that all the
Elk Herd Units that were meeting Forest Plan Standard 4a for big game security
were in and near roadless areas, including Nevada Mountain, Jericho, Little
Blackfoot, and Bison Mountain. All of these Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs)
occur on the Divide Landscape and emphasize the importance of IRAs to Elk Herd
Unit security. The rationale for “clearing” old routes within these roadless areas
was unjustified as indicated by the lack of compliance with the security standard and
the fact that other areas that do not occur in or near roadless areas do not meet the
existing security standard. This is not to say that areas not having roadless areas
cannot meet the standard. However, the Helena National Forest will simply need to
limit road densities in these areas.
Appendix C of the Divide DEIS (page 17) indicates that even for Alternative 3, one
herd unit would remain below the 30% threshold, but then goes on to say all six
EHUs would meet the 30% standard. That in fact is not the case – one would not
meet the standard. Measures should be taken to raise all EHUs above the minimum
30% security level.
Elk have been used as a surrogate, or Management Indicator Species, for the needs
of other ungulates (mule deer, white-tailed deer, and moose). However, for a
variety of behavioral and nutritional reasons elk do not reflect the needs of other
ungulates. While elk herd numbers have often risen over the years because they are

so mobile and move off of National Forest lands when it becomes insecure, deer and
moose do not. Currently in Montana, mule deer, white-tailed deer, and moose
populations are at serious lows. These are species whose movements are much
more limited than that of elk. This is not a time to be eliminating the forest cover
component from the big game standards.

Response to Comments

It is time for restoration of the landscape. The landscape and wildlife will begin to
heal if an aggressive travel plan is implemented so a return to the time-tested “best
available science” of the existing big game security standard can be restored.
Roadless Areas
Compliance with the Roadless Rule must be demonstrated. That compliance
includes providing “lasting protection” for IRAs in the project area. These IRAs are
characterized by high quality, undisturbed soil and water and a diversity of plant and
animal communities. According to the USFS, these IRAs “provide clean drinking
water and function as biological strongholds for populations of threatened and
endangered species . . . [and] large, relatively undisturbed landscapes that are
important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of many at risk species.”
(66 Fed. Reg. at 324).
These IRAs also “provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation,
opportunities that diminish as open space and natural settings are developed
elsewhere. They also serve as bulwarks against the spread of non-native invasive
plant species and provide reference areas for study and research.” By law, these
biological strongholds are to be managed for “lasting protection.” In adopting a
proposed action the USFS: (1) must comply with the Roadless Rule and manage
these areas for lasting protection; and (2) should prohibit and/or restrict all
motorized access in the IRAs.
Jericho Mountain is an Inventoried Roadless Area (IRA). It should be returned to a
roadless status. The Divide Landscape is extremely fragmented with private inholdings in Banner, Monitor, Minnehaha, and Telegraph Creeks. Roads that have

been created in roadless areas should be removed to improve the landscape integrity.

Response to Comments

The Bison Mountain Inventoried Roadless is known to have denning grizzly bears
and wolverine. Yet, over-snow vehicles can use Road 1801 which traverses the
Bison Mountain Area (Electric Peak Roadless Area) in Alternative 3 and 4, but is
currently closed to snowmobiles in Alternative 1. The Helena National Forest
should maintain the existing condition of no over-snow motorized vehicles by
keeping Road 1801 closed. Within meters of the Bison Mountain IRA, Road 495D1 was sanctioned for “treatment”. This road connects to the CDNST that has
restrictions of 50” or less, yet 495-D1 is open to highway vehicles year- long even
though it does not connect to any road that is currently open to motorized vehicles.
Road 495-D1 is a clear example of a road that was included in the Hazardous Tree
Removal Project, deep in the National Forest next to an IRA, but didn’t provide a
hazard to anyone. Yet Road 495-D1 has been or will be “treated” by removing trees
along its length, grading and possibly gravelling. This was an action that was not
necessary and was pre-decisional to the Divide Travel Planning process. Other
roads not occurring within the Wildland Urban Interface that are slated for
Hazardous Tree Removal treatment prior to the Divide Travel Planning process
were also pre-decisional and cumulatively impacted big game security, leading the
Helena National Forest to declare that they could not meet the standard for big game
security. This recurring situation has led to the Catch-22 situation wherein the
Forest has chosen not to meet the big game security standard, but then devised a
new standard that would not limit either timber removal or motorized travel. The
harsh truth is that the Helena National Forest cumulatively ignored its own valid,
scientifically based standard for nearly three decades.
The Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless Area supports grizzly bears, wolverine
and lynx. While doing aerial wildlife surveys as a wildlife biologist for Montana
Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Gayle Joslin observed wolverine tracks and excavation
holes on Nevada Mountain. HHAA board member, Gary Ingman, has personally
observed wolverines within the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area on three occasions

and typically see their tracks annually. In Alternatives 2 and 4, Road 4044-E1 goes
deep into the Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless Area. This route dead-ends
after crossing through an area restricted to over-snow motorized vehicles and
penetrates about 1.5 miles into the IRA.

Response to Comments

None of the action alternatives adequately address massive road duplication to the
south of the Nevada Mountain IRA. These roads inhibit linkage between the
Nevada Mountain Roadless Area along the Continental Divide to and south of
Highway 12, thus hindering movement of wildlife between ecosystems.
A total of 22.59 miles of roads that were stamped for Hazardous Tree Removal in
2010, prior to this 2014 Divide Travel Plan, but which failed to meet the standards
for “hazard” under the Wildland Urban Interface include Roads 1863, 607, 293,
293-A1, 296, 296-B1, 4196, 1892, 485-D1, 601-F1, 601-K2, 601-K3, and 601-K4.
Another 18 roads (36.44 miles) were slated for “treatment” next to inventoried
roadless areas during the Hazardous Tree project even though the trees were not a
hazard to anyone (Roads 607-H1, 123, 495-D1, 1834, 1834-C1, 1834-D1, 296-A1,
296-A2, 296-A3, 1830, 1831, 329-E1, 1838-E2, 1838-F1, 4135, 601-D1, 601-E1,
and 601-J1).
This was simply an expeditious move on the part of the Helena National Forest to
improve roads for future projects without having to go through the travel planning
process. The Helena Hunters and Anglers Association objected to this approach, but
their objection was denied by the Regional Office of the Forest Service. In addition,
the Hazard Tree Removal project concluded that the big game security standard
could not be achieved during that project, so the Forest Supervisor simply exempted
the Helena National Forest from adherence to Forest Plan Standard 3 (summer
hiding cover) and 4a (big game security), as follows:
“As part of my Decision I am amending the Forest Plan through a site-specific
Forest Plan amendment for this project. Analysis for this project indicated the need
for a site-specific Forest Plan amendment to the Helena Forest Plan regarding elk

summer and winter range and big game security… As part of my Decision I am
also making a site-specific amendment to the Forest Plan. This amendment exempts
this project from the Forest Plan big game standards 3 and 4a.”

Response to Comments

There was no actual amendment to Forest Plan wildlife standards 3 and 4a. The
amendment was simply an exemption from compliance with the Helena Forest Plan
by the Helena Forest Supervisor.
Water Quality
The following streams within the Divide Travel Planning Area have been identified
by Montana DEQ as having water quality impairments due to
sedimentation/siltation stemming from forest roads and/or silvicultural activities:
Little Prickly Pear Creek from the North and South Forks to Clark Creek (23.9
miles)
Tenmile Creek from the headwaters to Spring Creek (6.72 miles) and from Spring
Creek to the Helena Water Treatment Plant (7.32 miles)
Little Blackfoot River from the headwaters to Dog Creek (22.54 miles)
Telegraph Creek from the headwaters to Hahn Creek (5.35 miles)
Elliston Creek from the headwaters to mouth (4.95 miles)
Dog Creek from the headwaters to Meadow Creek (4.33 miles)
Trout Creek from the headwaters to mouth (11.5 miles)
Snowshoe Creek from the headwaters to mouth (11.45 miles)
The above list is not all inclusive for streams within the Divide Travel Planning
Area. Montana DEQ has developed sediment Total Maximum Daily Loads
(TMDLs) for all of the above streams except Little Prickly Pear Creek. The
Tenmile Creek sediment TMDL was completed in 2006, while sediment TMDLs for
the Little Blackfoot River and the above listed tributaries to the Little Blackfoot
were completed in 2011. DEQ assessed sediment delivery to the subject streams
from open unpaved roads using GIS, field data collection, and sediment modeling

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 361

Response to Comments
techniques. The most significant source of road sediment loading was linked to
unpaved road crossings. DEQ determined reductions in sediment loading from
unpaved roads that are needed to attain water quality standards for each of these
streams as a component of the TMDLs. The stated prescription for attaining the
sediment load reductions includes the application of road sediment best management
practices (BMPs) and road closure or abandonment, where appropriate. For the
Little Blackfoot streams, targeted percent reductions in sediment delivery from
unpaved roads are as follows:
Little Blackfoot River – 71% reduction
Telegraph Creek – 71% reduction
Elliston Creek – 70% reduction
Dog Creek – 70% reduction
Trout Creek – 76% reduction
Snowshoe Creek – 74% reduction
As a primary landowner in these watersheds, the Helena National Forest has a
responsibility to help attain the targeted reductions in road sediment loading
established in the TMDLs. Travel management, and especially road closures and
decommissioning, is an effective tool for reducing sediment loading to streams from
unpaved forest roads. The Helena National Forest should select an alternative for
the Divide Travel Planning Area that appropriately minimizes the miles of open
motorized travel routes within these sediment impaired watersheds in order to
improve water quality and attain full support of the streams’ designated beneficial
uses.
As the Divide Travel Plan EIS is finalized, we ask that you fully address Helena
National Forest water quality conditions and where and how sedimentation would
be curtailed and TMDL standards met under each of the 4 alternatives. Please
specify actions that are planned to fully rectify human-caused sedimentation and
other water pollution problems across the Divide Travel Plan landscape.
Of the 23 stream segments sampled for percent fines in gravels (Table 3.31 of the

DEIS), all but one (North Fork Ophir Creek) exceeded reference levels – in some
cases by 100%. The alternative having the least amount of motorized routes would
help reduce sediments, and along with restoration activities, would be the most cost
effective approach to improving the water quality.

Response to Comments

The Forest Service maintains jurisdiction on about 58.6 miles of high risk roads
(page 213 of the DEIS). Under action Alternative 3, about 27.98 miles of high risk
Forest Service roads would remain open and 30.66 miles (17.32 miles currently
closed plus 13.34 proposed miles) or 52% would be closed to wheeled motorized
vehicle use. Private and county roads account for the balance of high risk roads, or
about 19.8 miles. These non-Forest Service roads represent an ongoing cumulative
impact to the surface water quality in the planning area. With approximately 378
stream-road intersections (crossings) in the planning area, the Forest Service has
jurisdiction on 288 crossings. About 142 forest road crossings (49%) would be
closed under Alternative 3. Additionally, nine dispersed campsites associated with
high risk roads are located directly adjacent to TES fish habitat, and six of these
would close under this alternative. The other three dispersed recreational campsites
would remain open to public use and would continue to potentially adversely affect
TES fish habitat without mitigation measures. Six currently open fords on TES fish
streams would experience permanent or temporary closures to reduce the risk of
direct mortality to westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. A seventh closed ford
located in the Ontario Creek drainage would remain closed to wheeled motorized
traffic.
Page 218 of the DEIS states that currently there are approximately 58.6 miles of
high risk roads and 288 crossings under Forest Service jurisdiction throughout the
planning area. Under the No Action Alternative, 17.3 miles (30%) of high risk
roads and 94 (33%) of crossings are currently closed to wheeled motorized vehicle
travel. Alternative 3 is the most beneficial alternative with respect to needed water
quality improvements associated with sedimentation because it has the least number
of stream crossings (146 open crossings), and the least miles of sediment producing
roads with 28 miles open and 30.6 closed. This translates into eight fewer crossings

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 363

Comments
and 1.6 new miles of closed high risk roads. Although Alternative 3 appears to be
the best of the offered alternatives, it seems there could be an improved alternative
offered to further reduce the extent of human caused sedimentation that would be
generated from 146 open stream crossings and 28 miles of open road in Alternative
3. Even in the best alternative, this still amounts to 50.7% of the damaging stream
crossings, and 47.8% of the high risk roads being open to motorized travel. Please
provide an improved alternative that better addresses the well documented and
widespread sedimentation problems in the Divide Travel Planning Area and meets
the intent of the completed and approved TMDLs.

Individual Road Recommendations
General Comments and Questions
See comments regarding Road 227-B1 and all other roads that have been “Closed to
motorized vehicles year-long, including over-snow motorized vehicles” (gold lines
over roads in Alternative 1). We question what constitutes an over-snow vehicle
and whether there is a minimum amount of snow that must be on the ground to
travel on it.
Adequate signage and physical barriers are essential to prevent illegal use of roads
designated for closure. Decommissioning must be considered in certain cases. Such
actions must be part of this proposal, but currently are not.
The Divide Travel Plan public notice in the March 18, 2014 Independent Record,
states: “The DEIS would include only open or closed determinations;
decommissioning would not be specified in this decision.”
We wonder why this limitation is being imposed on the Divide Travel Planning area
when it was not imposed on the Blackfoot Travel Planning area in either the Draft or
Final EIS, when arguably the Divide area needs more attention and restoration than
the Blackfoot. We request that decommissioning be allowed as a tool in Divide
Travel Plan implementation.
Road decommissioning and removal must be available tools to address landscape
recovery. The Divide Landscape does not compare to many other less impacted,
less damaged areas of the Northern Region that have not been as affected by mining,

logging, roading, damaging motorized use, and thus requires more attention in
bringing it back to a more healthy, naturally functioning status. A failing landscape
is one that is experiencing severe water quality issues, diminished fisheries and
wildlife services in terms of habitat quantity and quality, movement, and population
structure. The Divide Landscape is verging on such a place. However, responsible,
assertive stewardship can go a long way to recovering this portion of the Helena
National Forest on the edge of the capitol city, along the Continental Divide, and
linking the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide Ecosystems.
As tattered as the Divide is, the Helena City Commission recognized its value when
it passed Resolution 2008-57 entitled, Resolution to Protect and Promote
Conservation of Wildlife Habitat and Corridors along the Continental Divide.
The 2006 Helena National Forest Travel Map, signed by supervisor Kevin Riordan
on May 1 does not show many roads that appear on Alternative 1. Opening such
roads for motorized use is not responsible management in a landscape that has
severe water quality and wildlife security issues.

the south facing slopes of Sweeny provide winter forage for mule deer, elk and
moose. Sweeny provides important big game security along a part of the Divide
Landscape that is otherwise heavily fragmented by roads.
“Alternative 1 maintains existing condition. A 12-mile maze of motor trails
produces a local open trail density of 2.9 mi/mi². There are no seasonal restrictions,
and snowmobiles use the trails when snow is adequate. The northwest end of the
area and adjacent slopes provide prime winter range for big game animals.
Motorized activity in this part of the area from mid-fall through mid-spring is a
serious disruptive influence.” (DEIS Appendix C-25)
The numerous motorized routes in Sweeny Creek are all illegal user-created routes.
No NEPA evaluation has been done on any of these routes. They need to be
physically closed, reseeded and fully reclaimed.
The cluster of illegal spur roads emanating from the Priest Pass Road must be
physically closed and reclaimed. A number of these spur roads cross live streams
or are located in wet aspen/dogwood riparian habitat. Uncontrolled firewood
cutting is starting to impact the aspen stands along the Priest Pass road.
This area has always been recognized as important mule deer winter range. Both
Alternatives 3 and 4 would finally close it to wheeled motorized vehicles and also
recognize it as a winter area closure. This move is strongly encouraged, and if
implemented would finally accommodate the requests of MFWP that were made in
1991 to create a motorized area closure for Sweeney Creek to protect critical mule
deer, elk, and moose winter range, as well as limited old growth ponderosa pine
habitat for sensitive species including pileated woodpecker and flammulated owls
(MFWP correspondence 1991). In fact, one of the rationales for the Sweeney Creek
timber sale was to enhance bitterbrush production on the winter range. This project
then extended into the Porky-Roundwood timber sale of 1995. Recognition of a
year-long area closure is due and appreciated.
No alternative closes Road 1802-B2 to over-snow motorized travel, yet this road
accesses the non-motorized winter area and the Continental Divide linkage zone in
this immediate area is known to be used by lynx, wolverine, and wolves.

Alternatives
Alternative 1 – Existing Condition/No Action
Alternative 1 would retain the existing condition, which in many cases is friendlier
toward water, soil, and wildlife resources in that dozens of miles of roads that would
be opened in the other three action alternatives would remain closed on a year-long
basis. All “yellow” roads on the Alternative 1 Travel Map are designated closed
year-long, but most of these in the other alternatives would be opened to some type
of motorized use, even in Alternative 3. Alternative 1 is the only alternative that
would retain the closure to over-snow vehicles in the Limburger Springs area winter
range so they could not be used during the hunting season. Alternative 1 is clearly
more winter friendly to lynx and wolverine than the other alternatives with 31,350
acres open, while Alternatives 3 and 4 would allow 44,980 acres to be open to oversnow vehicles. Alternative 1 would retain the existing Forest Plan Big Game
Security Standard (involving a matrix of road density and vegetative cover – all
action alternatives would remove all vegetation cover requirements) and would not
implement the proposed security amendment. The proposed amendment would
remove all vegetation cover requirements for big game security.
Alternative 2 – Maximum Motorized Use
This Alternative does try to rectify on-going natural resource problems but would
exacerbate these problems with the maximum motorized use.
Alternative 3 – Most Natural Resource Friendly

Of the three action alternatives, Alternative 3 is generally the best choice for natural
resource concerns, but it does not go far enough and could be improved upon with
certain site-specific alterations described previously. It allows more winter
motorized travel than Alternative 4, and would allow snowmobile use on the
previously designated winter ranger in the Spotted Dog-Limburger Springs area.
Winter range in this area should be identified on the Travel Map. Off-route oversnow use would increase in this alternative over the existing condition from 31,350
to 44,980 acres. These limitations should be corrected. Alternative 3 is the best of
the offered alternatives for grizzly bear, elk, and mule deer. Lynx would be better
served with over-snow use at existing levels (Alternative 1, Appendix C-18).
Alternative 3 reduces open road density from to 0.1 mi/sq mi, so is clearly the best
option for key areas including Baldy Ridge-Spotted Dog-Kading.

Response to Comments

Alternative 4 – Helena National Forest Proposed Alternative/Combination of
Alternatives 1, 2 and 3
From a natural resource perspective, Alternative 4 is an improvement over
Alternative 2 but not Alternative 3, and only in some cases is it better than the
Existing Condition (Alternative 1). It does not recognize winter motorized closures.
It designates additional motorized trails, highway vehicle use roads, and longer
motorized use periods. It does not recognize the Blackfoot-North Divide Winter
Travel Plan restrictions to over-snow motorized vehicles.
Alternative L – Landscape Restoration
This alternative would allow for reasonable recreational motorized use but
maximize implementation of authority, regulations, and executive orders to restore,
preserve, and protect water quality, soil and vegetation health, fish and wildlife
habitats, and healthy ecosystem function and resilience.
Cumulative Effects
Thank you for listing some of the projects conducted in the Divide Travel Planning
Area. We would ask that you also include the decision process that was used for
each project. Decision notices, RODs, and other decisions associated with these

projects will describe stipulated mitigation (and other) measures that were or should
have been implemented since the Forest Plan was adopted in 1986.

Response to Comments

We noticed that not all activities are listed, including the Sweeney Creek or the
subsequent Porky-Roundwood timber sales. This area has been particularly
damaged by motorized use subsequent to those actions. In addition, inconsistent
information about the projects is provided. For example, the acreage and board feet
of timber removal are not listed for the Hope/Snowshoe, Ophir Creek and Cave
Gulch timber sales, or the Hazardous Tree Removal project which involved
“treatment” of 491 miles of road on the Helena National Forest. Please provide this
missing information in the final EIS.
Not all timber projects listed in Appendix B include the acreage involved. In
addition to the 1,352 acres that have been “treated”, there is the 6,335 acre
Telegraph Creek treatment area, and the 491 miles of road in the Hazard Tree
Project (9,415 acres or nearly 15 square miles) (Table 2, Soils Report, Hazard Tree
Project). These projects total at least 26.7 square miles of the Helena National
Forest. Cumulatively, a 27 square-mile area of timber removal cannot be considered
as having “no significant impact.” Clearly there has been little effort to maintain or
adhere to Forest Plan Standard 4a for big game security. This inconvenient truth
does not absolve the Helena National Forest from its responsibility to work to
restore this science-based standard.
A list of roads that were stamped for Hazardous Tree Removal in 2010, prior to this
2014 Divide Travel Plan, but which failed to meet the standards for “hazard” under
the Wildland Urban Interface were submitted with our earlier comments (Roads
Analysis 3rd – Divide Landscape, Hazardous Tree Removal/Issues/HHAA).
In the case of the Hazardous Tree Removal Project, the Helena Forest Supervisor
decided in the Decision Notice and Finding of No Significant Impact:
“As part of my Decision I am amending the Forest Plan through a site-specific

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 373

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
Forest Plan amendment for this project. Analysis for this project indicated the need
for a site-specific Forest Plan amendment to the Helena Forest Plan regarding elk
summer and winter range and big game security… As part of my Decision I am
also making a site-specific amendment to the Forest Plan. This amendment exempts
this project from the Forest Plan big game standards 3 and 4a.”

Response to Comments

There was no actual amendment to Forest Plan wildlife standards 3 and 4a -- the
amendment was simply an exemption from compliance with the Helena Forest Plan
by the Helena Forest.
There is concern that measures to protect natural resources and abide by wildlife
standards and guidelines have not been consistently applied as per these decisions.
Cases in point would be all the roads and trails that appear on the existing condition
Alternative 1 map, but do not appear on the 2006 Travel Map, or now (as per
Alternative 1) have broader use periods than what appears on the 2006 Travel map.
Timber sale projects such as Sweeney Creek, Mullan Pass, Hope/Snowshoe, Lava
Mountain, etc. had associated decisions that may not have been fully followed. For
example it took more than a decade to implement road decisions for the Lava
Mountain sale, and then only because the public objected to new timber sale action
unless the earlier stipulations regarding road closures at Lava Mountain were
completed.
Also, Roads 335-A1 and 335-A2 on the south side of the Priest Pass road were
closed for big game security after timber removal in the 1980s. Despite ongoing
and increasing illegal motorized trail pioneering in the area (note the Helena
National Forest watershed group identified “non-system” routes), several Divide
Travel Plan alternatives call for opening Roads 335-A1 and 335-A2, inviting further
motorized incursion into secure big game hiding cover. These roads were closed as
part of past NEPA-reviewed forest management activities and must not be used as
“bargaining chips” during the present travel planning process.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 374

Comments
If decisions and stated rationale behind those decisions are not followed, the
consequences cumulatively add up to impacts on natural resources. Such
cumulative actions, many of which had associated decisions of No Significant
Impact, also are the reason that Forest Plan amendments are now being proposed –
because they cannot, through their own doing – meet the Forest Plan standards.
This behavior does not justify throwing out the scientifically-based big game
standard for security.

Response to Comments

Another example was the proposed Biathlon Project which received a No
Significant Impact finding by the Helena National Forest (June 12, 2008), but was
challenged in court and was remanded to the Helena National Forest based in part
on inattention to wildlife linkage/connectivity, cumulative impacts, wetlands, elk
standard for hiding cover, among other things.
We believe the Helena national Forest must be accountable to past decisions, and
through future actions the Helena National Forest has the means to rectify past
management oversight or actual transgressions. We welcome the opportunity to
work with Forest personnel to help identify and promote restorative stewardship
projects for natural resources.
Monitoring, Enforcement, and Schedule
Monitoring
“Overwhelmingly, scientists agree that in absence of monitoring, a project may be
rendered invalid. While funding for monitoring is almost universally short of what is
required to address scientific and technical uncertainties, monitoring is the only way
to understand short- and long-term effects of restoration actions.”4
At the April 1, 2014 meeting of HHAA the Lincoln District Ranger for the adjoining
Blackfoot Travel Planning area stated that because financial resources are limited, it
would take years to implement that plan. In the meantime, she stated that all roads
that are currently open would remain open. She did not say that all roads that are

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 375

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
currently closed would remain closed or that any enforcement would occur. She
stated that monitoring and enforcement is a partnership between the USFS, MFWP,
and the public. Of course the public has no authority to enforce anything, thus
essentially divesting the USFS of the responsibility to monitor and enforce. We are
concerned that this same situation should not be repeated in the Divide Travel
Planning Area.

Response to Comments

Enforcement
Positive feed-back loops to correct problems on the ground seem to be very limited,
only occurring through site-specific emergency orders. Please identify and
communicate the steps that must be taken for the public to request and document the
need for an emergency order.
The Divide DEIS acknowledges serious enforcement deficiencies. An active
enforcement presence must be guaranteed. What is the point of having a Travel
Plan if it is not enforced? How will the ROD address this very serious issue within
the Divide Landscape? Just one example: “Illegal OHV use of a pioneered trail
around Slate Lake would continue in the absence of effective enforcement.”
(Appendix C-25)
Existing travel restrictions up to 2014 have not been enforced for years on the
Helena National Forest. Recently the new Helena Forest Supervisor signed
emergency orders to require enforcement of the existing (2006) travel plan. What
will be the requirements and time frame for enforcement of this new travel plan
once it is signed into law?
Schedule
Fundamental to a functional Travel Plan is an implementation schedule on the order
of 5 years or less. Please provide a schedule in the ROD that speaks to site-specific
implementation of all actions associated with the Travel Plan. We request
expeditious implementation of road closures, decommissioning, and removal (revegetation in some cases).

Recommendations
We encourage you to fashion a modified alternative that will bring the Divide
Landscape, to which this travel planning process is being applied, to a responsible
restored condition.
HHAA members are interested and willing to provide volunteer labor to assist the
Helena Ranger District with closing illegal trails, rehabilitating user-created routes,
and posting travel management signs. Our membership is also looking forward to
helping the Helena Ranger District monitor compliance with this travel management
decision.

Dear Sir or Madam:
I write this letter in support of the Nevada Mountain Proposed Wilderness, the
Electric Peak Wilderness, and the non-motorized prescription in Alternative 3. Over
the last seven years of my life I have lived in the Western states. The one and only
state that draws me back is Montana. Currently I reside in Colorado and it fails
utterly in comparison to Montana. Montana’s most valuable resource is its wild
lands. These are the places people dream of and the things people wish to
experience; blue ribbon streams, herds of elk, high alpine lakes, million acre
wilderness areas, grizzly bears, old growth forests, and frontier lifestyle. No other
place in the lower forty-eight can compare to this. There is no place for motorized
use in these special places in Montana. I urge you to support the creation of these
wilderness areas, and to promote non-motorized use in the other associated areas.
(46-1) We must not make the mistakes of previous people. Wild land is a precious
resource in which we cannot recreate.

(46-1) Recreation – Thank you for your comment – Zach has
provided 4 letters that are all similar to each other. One response
for all should address his concerns. My want to respond by
talking about the differences in alternatives and which one
provides the most protection for his areas of interest.

Helena Hunters’ members live, work, and recreate on the Helena National Forest
and several of the organization’s members are intimately familiar with the Helena
Ranger District and Divide Travel Planning Area in particular. Helena Hunters’
membership is made up of professionally trained natural resource managers. They
are now or have previously worked in the fields of fish, wildlife, forestry, recreation
management, water quality, and environmental assessment. Helena Hunters’
mission statement is commensurate with stated management objectives for the
Helena National Forest:
“The Helena Hunters and Anglers Association is dedicated to protecting and
restoring fish and wildlife to all suitable habitats, and to conserving all natural
resources as a public trust, vital to our general welfare. HHAA promotes the highest
standards of ethical conduct and sportsmanship, and promotes outdoor hunting and
fishing opportunity for all citizens to share equally.”
The following discussion itemizes Helena Hunters’ comments on the proposed
amendment to big game standard 4(a) in the Helena Ranger District.

Best available science.

NEPA and the Service’s planning regulations direct the responsible official to “use
the best available scientific information to inform the planning process.” 36 C.F.R. §
219.3. The Service is to determine “what information is the most accurate, reliable,
and relevant to the issues being considered” and document how the “best available
scientific information was used to inform . . . the plan decision . . .” Id. In this case,
the Service is not using (or documenting how it is using) the best available science.
The existing Forest Plan Standard #4a includes standards for hiding cover and roaddensity in big game habitat and was based on extensive peer review and published
science, including Lyon et al. (1985), Basile and Lonner (1979), Burbridge and Neff
(1976), and Coggins (1976). For this reason, the Standard was incorporated into a

Hunters is not aware of any scientific support for this approach.
Both Hillis et al. (1991) and Christensen et al. (1993) require cover in elk security
areas. (47-8) Hillis et al. (1991) does not expressly include a standard for hiding
cover but the paper does discuss the importance of cover (as do other papers) and
does recognize that security areas may consist of a variety of cover types. Notably,
in a April 12, 2013, letter to Greg Munther of Montana Backcountry Hunters and
Anglers regarding the Service’s proposed amendment for the neighboring Blackfoot
Travel Plan (the letter was provided with Mr. Munther’s comments on the DEIS)
Hillis and Jack Lyon describe the 250 acre block size requirement as a “hiding
cover” variable. Clearly, the amount of available hiding cover in security areas –
and how it will be managed – is an important factor that must be considered and
explained by the Service.

Reasonable range of alternatives.

NEPA “mandates that agencies ‘study, develop, and describe appropriate
alternatives to recommended course of action in any proposal which involves
unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.” Pit River
Tribe v. U.S. Forest Service, 469 F. 3d 768, 785 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C.
§ 4332 (E)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2) (C) (iii) (must consider “alternatives to
the proposed action”).
The alternatives analysis as “the heart” of the environmental analysis because it
presents “impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus
sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options.”
40 C.F.R. § 1502.14. The alternatives analysis guarantees that “agency decision
makers ‘[have] before [them] and take into proper account all possible approaches to
a particular project (including total abandonment of the project) which would alter
the environmental impact and the cost-benefit balance.’” Bob Marshall Alliance v.
Hodel, 852 F. 2d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). “Informed and
meaningful consideration of alternatives . . . is thus an integral part of the statutory
scheme” and critical to the goals” of NEPA. Id. at 1228-29.
In this case, the Service fails to adequately describe, let alone consider and analyze a
reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed amendment. No alternatives to the
proposed amendment, other than the “no action” alternative, are mentioned or
analyzed in the DEIS. This is a blatant violation of NEPA. The Service must (but
has failed) to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed amendment.
(47-9)

(47-9) (Planning might need to address the reasonable range of
alternatives)

At the very least, this would include a more thorough analysis of the no action
alternative (keep standard #4a) and then evaluating and comparing a wide range of
new standards/approaches for managing big game habitat in the Helena National
Forest based on the best available science. Such alternatives might include: (1)

applying the Hillis model as described in Hillis et al. (1991) without any changes;
(2) increasing block sizes, threshold values, and/or distances from roads or making
other modifications to the Hillis method’s criteria to account for difference between
the eastside and Westside forests; (3) the Service’s current proposed amendment; (4)
keeping parts of Standard
#4a and combining it with other approaches, including the Hillis method; (5) keep
the existing standard work towards compliance by increasing hiding cover and
reducing road density ; or (6) develop an entirely new approach based on current
habitat conditions and harvest numbers for the analysis area and after consulting
local researchers and biologists. (47-10)
(3) Purpose and need.
Pursuant to NEPA, the Service must “specify the underlying purpose and need” of
the proposed action. 40 C.F.R. § 1502.13. Doing so is important because it dictates
the range of alternatives that must be considered and evaluated by the Service (see
above).
The purpose and need of the proposed amendment is not adequately described in the
DEIS. The Service maintains the purpose and need is to bring big game security in
line with the best available science but, as outlined above, this is inaccurate. The
proposed amendment is not based on the best available science because it fails to
include a hiding cover component. (47-11) A more honest purpose and need
statement would reference the Service’s prolonged failure to comply with an
important Forest Plan standard (big game standard 4(a)) for security.
As the Service concedes, elk numbers “have been steadily increasing” since the
existing Standard #4a was adopted. So, decline in elk numbers and a need to shift
management strategies to improve big game management is not the motivation. The
Service mentions that Standard #4a is 28 years old and does not reflect the “relevant
science” but, as outlined above, this is inaccurate. The standard was developed for
the Helena and other National Forests. In the end, the Service’s proposed

keeping with the Hillis model since Hillis et al. emphasize that
“strict adherence to the guidelines should be avoided”. See the
Forest Plan amendment Alternative Description/Alternative
B/Discussion section.
2) The Forest Plan amendment Alternative B was updated to
reflect public comments regarding security on eastside Forests,
particularly with regards to patch size and security threshold
values. Security is “defined as a proportion of an elk herd unit
within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District
that consists of an area of at least 1000 acres in size that is at
least ½ mile from a motorized route open to the public between
9/1 and 12/1. Security blocks are adjusted for constrictions less
than or equal to ½ mile in width”. Alternative B also includes a
goal to “[m]aintain or, where opportunities arise, improve big
game security in those portions of an elk herd unit within the
administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District during the
9/1 – 12/1 hunting season where security is less than 50%.
Maintain big game security in those portions of an elk herd unit
within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District
between 9/1 and 12/1 where security is greater than or equal to
50%”. See the Forest Plan amendment Alternative
Description/Alternative B.
(3) We replaced the DEIS proposed amendment in order to be
responsive to public comments.
(4) and (5) An alternative was considered but not carried forward
to test the efficacy of closing all Forest Roads in order to achieve
consistency with Standard 4a. That analysis concluded that “5

amendment is more about giving the Service more flexibility and latitude in forest
management and travel planning than proper management of big game habitat. This
needs to be conveyed to the public. (47-12)

Direct impacts.

Pursuant to NEPA, the Service is required to assess how the proposed amendment
may directly impact the environment. Direct impacts are caused by the action and
occur at the same time and place. See 40 C.F.R. §1508.8. The direct impacts of an
action must be analyzed based on the affected interests, the affected region, and the
locality in which they will occur. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 (a).
Here, the Service failed to take a hard look at the direct impacts of the proposed
amendment which– by eliminating the hiding cover – will result in less hiding cover
on National Forest lands in the EHU (and more timber harvest), increased roaddensities, and potentially less real security in big game habitat. Nowhere in the
DEIS, however, does the Service analyze what the direct impacts of these changes
will be on survival of male big game animals and habitat (elk, deer, and moose) or
on other MIS, sensitive, and listed species (lynx and grizzlies) or proposed to be
listed species (wolverine) inhabiting the area. Most of these species depend on (and
need) dense forests with high levels of horizontal cover, secure areas, and less roads
for long-term survival and recovery. Nor does the Service analyze how the proposed
amendment will impact lynx critical habitat (the PCEs) or the importance and use of
the area as a linkage zone or travel corridor for wildlife. (47-13)
In the DEIS, the Service concludes that loss of hiding cover (and eliminating the
standard) will have no negative effect on big game security but no analysis is
provided. And, the assumption that cover is not important for big game species like
elk, deer, and moose is belied by the best available science, including Hillis (1991).
(47-13)

road closures during the hunting season). Although that analysis
indicates that it’s possible for the Forest to close enough roads in
the Quartz Creek EHU to achieve compliance with Standard 4a,
several of those road miles over which the Forest has discretion
are located outside of the Travel Plan project area and have
already been subject to a travel plan decision (i.e. Clancy
Unionville Vegetation Manipulation and Travel Management
Project). The few miles of open roads in Quartz Creek EHU that
could be closed as part of the Divide Travel Plan decision access
private land. The Greenhorn EHU would remain out of
compliance with Standard 4a because the Forest simply does not
have sufficient road closure discretion. Even if it were possible
to close all of the roads in the project area (several miles of roads
are outside of the Forest Service’s jurisdiction), some of the
concerns identified by MFWP in the Montana Final Elk
Management Plan (MFWP 2005) would not be ameliorated
especially in those HDs where access to elk is a management
concern”. See the Forest Plan amendment Findings Required by
Laws, Regulations, and Policies/National Environmental Policy
Act/Comparison of Alternatives/Alternative A/Discussion and
Chapter 2 of the FEIS.

remaining security and, ultimately, hunter opportunity.” Hillis (1991) at 42; see also
Jellison (1998) (hunter opportunity down on the Bighorn National Forest due to
“accelerated timber harvesting . . . [that] sent former elk hiding cover to the
sawmills and logging roads permeating previously secluded areas.”); Christensen et
al. (1993) (“As you move east into Montana and over the Continental Divide,
cover considerations become more important because cover is less abundant and
less contiguous . . . it will be important to develop long-term perspectives (rotation
length) on cover management that address condition, quantity, location, and
configuration.”).
Notably, the proposed amendment is only described in Appendix D - it is not
incorporated into the affected environment or environmental consequences section
of the DEIS. This is a major oversight.
The Service must take a hard look at how the proposed amendment will impact the
environment, including but not limited to, soil quality and productivity, water
quality (sediment from existing routes in the analysis area is currently a problem),
wetlands, Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs), wilderness values, integrity and use
of the area as a corridor or “linkage zone” for wildlife, and habitat and population
numbers for threatened and endangered species (including lynx and grizzlies),
sensitive species (wolverine - currently proposed for listing), and various MIS on
the forest, especially forest-dependent species. The Service must also consult with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pursuant to Section 7 of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. §
1536, to determine whether and how the proposed amendment may affect grizzlies,
wolverine (once listed and conference with the agency now), lynx, and designated
lynx critical habitat.

Response to Comments
(47-12) The intent of amending Standard 4a is articulated in the
Forest Plan amendment throughout that document.
(47-13) The amendment does not mandate or suggest that cover
be removed. In fact, it encourages the retention of hiding and
concealment cover where it exists and creation of conditions that
will lead to rapid recruitment of cover where it does not—both
within and between elk security areas. What the amendment
does not do is to hang compliance with the standard on a specific
percentage of hiding cover. Currently, widespread loss of hiding
cover has nothing to do with Forest Service actions, but rather,
with the ubiquitous mountain pine beetle epidemic. This will be
the primary driver of cover patterns over the next several decades

degree or another.
The amendment will have no impact on lynx management. Lynx
are managed under the Northern Rockies Lynx Management
Direction (NRLMD), which requires that forest stands providing
suitable winter habitat for snowshoe hares (both early seral and
mature multistoried stands) is preserved in areas outside the
wildland-urban interface (WUI). All projects must meet these
standards.

Response to Comments

Here, the proposed amendment will likely result less hiding cover of National Forest
lands. This may push elk off of public lands and onto private lands (assuming
security is provided on those lands).(47-13) And the loss of hiding cover, most
likely from timber projects, will come with additional logging roads and skid trails
thereby providing even more access into secure areas. In addition, eliminating
Standard #4a’s road density standards paves the way for more roads and motorized
trails on National Forest lands which, in turn, means more public access to remote
areas. These roads – which make it easier and faster for walking, biking, and
horseback riding – will funnel more hunters, trappers, and recreationists into
otherwise secure habitat. No analysis of these and other indirect effects are provided
in the EIS. (47-14)

Ensuring the viability of MIS.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 387

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments

Response to Comments

Under NFMA, the implementing regulations, and the Helena Forest Plan, the
Service is required to manage wildlife habitat on the Helena National Forest to
ensure viable populations of existing native species are maintained.
To do so, the Service identified management indicator species (MIS) for various
species groups within the Helena National Forest whose habitat is most likely to be
changed by forest management activities. The MIS for the mature tree dependent
group, for instance, is the marten. The old growth dependent group is represented by
the pileated woodpecker and the goshawks; the snag dependent groups is
represented by the hairy woodpecker; the threatened and endangered group includes
the grizzly bear (and other species); and the commonly hunted MIS are elk, mule
deer, and bighorn sheep.
These MIS represent a proxy or surrogate for the health and viability of many other
species. While the Service retains some flexibility with respect to the appropriate
methodology used to monitor population numbers (actual and trend) of MIS, i.e.,
using population data on MIS and/or habitat data as a proxy for MIS population data
(commonly referred to as the “proxy-on-proxy” approach) the mandate to maintain
viable populations of MIS like elk, mule deer, marten, grizzlies and woodpeckers,
cannot be ignored. And the methodology employed must be reasonably reliable and
accurate. Native Ecosystems Council v. Tidwell, 599 F. 3d 926, 933 (9th Cir. 2010).
If, for example, the Service decides to use habitat as a proxy for population numbers
for MIS, then the proxy results must mirror reality. Maintaining the acreage of
habitat necessary to maintain viable populations of big game species (elk, deer, and
moose) on the Helena National Forest must in fact ensure viable populations (47-19)
are maintained. At the very least, the Service must describe the quantity and quality
of habitat that is necessary to sustain the viability of big game species and explain
its methodology for measuring this habitat. Native Ecosystems Council v. Weldon,
848 F. Supp.2d 1207, 1213 (D. Mont. 2012).

(47-19) The Forest Plan amendment describes elk trends
Forestwide and within hunting districts; it also includes a cover
analysis by elk herd unit. The amendment concludes that “[w]e
would also continue to achieve our objective of “ensuring that
viable populations of existing…animal species are maintained”
(USDA 1986, p. II/17). Elk habitat will remain abundant and
well distributed across the Forest. It is anticipated that the Forest
will retain security components necessary to maintain a viable
and huntable elk population”. (See the Forest Plan amendment,
National Forest Management Act section.)

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 388

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
In the Helena National Forest, the Service uses the big game standards, including
Standard #4a, as a means of ensuring compliance with NFMA’s viability
requirement.
Compliance with Standard #4a’s hiding cover and road-density standard, for
instance, is used as a proxy for population numbers and composition of elk and, as
such, other big game species.
The proposed amendment, however, eliminates standard #4a and replaces it with an
untested standard based solely on size and distance from an open route during the
hunting season. Hiding cover for big game and other forest dependent species was
eliminated from the big game standard. (47-20) And, under the new standard,
“security” is allowed to dip to 24% of an EHU in certain areas. Because it is
untested and eliminates the standard for hiding cover and road-density, there are no
assurances that the new standard will work. There are no assurances, let alone
reasonable assurances, that the new standard is reliable and accurate and will ensure
viable populations of elk and other big game species will be maintained. See
Weldon, 848 F. Supp.2d at1214-1215.
Indeed, under the proposed amendment, a 1,000 clear cut would qualify as “big
game security” so long as it is a half mile from a motorized route open during the
hunting season.
Use of the new standard as a proxy for monitoring populations (actual and trend) of
MIS like elk and deer, therefore, is a violation of NFMA, the implementing
regulations, and the Forest Plan.

Response to Comments

Here, the Service has failed to ensure the proposed amendment - which eliminates
the existing hiding cover standard for big game security – is consistent with the
following existing standards in the Helena Forest Plan:
•Big game Standard #1 requiring that important summer and winter range for big
game species include adequate hiding and thermal cover to support habitat potential.
The Service must (but has failed) to explain how the proposed amendment – which
does away with the hiding cover standard – will ensure compliance with this
important standard;
•Big game Standard #2 requiring that an environmental analysis for all project work
include a cover analysis at the drainage or EHU level;
•Big game Standard #3 directing that elk summer range be maintained at 35% or
greater hiding cover and areas of winter range maintained at 25% or greater thermal
cover in drainages or EHUs. This standard incorporates all land (private, state, and
federal) in the EHU;
•Big game Standard #4 directing the Service to implement an aggressive road
management program to maintain or improve big game security. The Service must
explain how the proposed amendment – which removes standards for maximum
road density in the EHUs, exempts private and state lands from the big game
standards, ignores the caveats in the Hillis model, and allows for the reduction in elk
security to the 30% threshold – qualifies as an “aggressive” program to maintain and
improve big game security;
•Big game Standard #4b stating that elk calving grounds and nursery areas will be
closed to motorized vehicles during peak use by elk;
•Big game Standard #4c directing that all winter range areas be closed to vehicles
between December 1 and May 15;

Response to Comments

•Big game Standard #5 dictating the minimum size areas for hiding and thermal
cover;
•Big game Standard #6 stating that the Service will follow the Montana Cooperative
Elk-Logging Study Recommendations (Appendix C in the Forest Plan);
•Big game Standard #10 stating that moose habitat will be managed to provide
adequate browse species diversity and quantity to support current moose
populations. Notably, Standard #4a is a big game standard designed to protect
habitat for elk, deer, and moose. Mule deer and moose numbers are in decline in
western Montana and eliminating standards for habitat cover may make a bad
situation worse for these big game species;
•The standards, guidelines, and objectives included in the Northern Rockies Lynx
Management Direction (“NRLMD”);
•The grizzly bear standards included in the Helena Forest Plan, including but not
limited to the requirement, in occupied grizzly habitat, to minimize man-caused
mortality by limiting the open road density to the 1980 density of 0.55 miles per
square mile and the IGBC’s open road, total road, and core area standards for
grizzly bear habitat;
•All standards and monitoring requirements of MIS, including but not limited to all
forest (mature, old growth, snag) dependent species and sensitive, threatened and
endangered species.

Amending big game standard 4(a) is a significant amendment. (47-22)

The Service’s proposed amendment to big game standard 4(a) in the Helena
National Forest Plan qualifies as a significant amendment and thus, under the
National Forest Management Act (NFMA), requires an EIS and full-blown analysis

(47-22) The National Forest Management Act section in the
Forest Plan amendment identifies the factors that were
considered to determine amendment significance. That analysis
concluded that the “amendment would not alter the long-term
relationship between levels of multiple-use goods and services
originally projected in the Forest Plan for wildlife habitat,
Allowable Sale Quantity, or other resource outputs, nor does it
have an important effect on the entire land management plan or
affect land and resources throughout a large portion of the
planning area during the planning period”. See that section, in

particular the table “Factors for consideration to determine
amendment significance”.

According to the Forest Service Manual (FSM) 1926.51, the types of non-significant
changes to Forest Plans include:
(1)Actions that do not significantly alter the multiple-use goals and objectives for
long-term land and resource management.
(2)Adjustments of management area boundaries or management prescriptions
resulting from further on-site analysis when the adjustments do not cause significant
changes in the multiple-use goals and objectives for long-term land and resource
management.
(3)Minor changes in standards and guidelines.
(4)Opportunities for additional projects or activities that will contribute to
achievement of the management prescription.
FSM 1926.52 explains that the types of changes that are “significant” and thus
require a comprehensive EIS include:
(1)Changes that would significantly alter the long-term relationship between levels
of multiple-use goods and services originally projected.
(2)Changes that may have an important effect on the entire land management plan
or affect land and resources throughout a large portion of the planning area during
the planning period.
As explained above, the Service’s proposed amendment, which fails to include any
requirements for hiding cover within big game security areas across the entire
Divide (and neighboring Blackfoot) analysis area is not a minor change.

On the contrary, such action will significantly alter the long-term goals and
objectives for managing the Divide analysis area for big game and other species that
depend on hiding cover (grizzlies and lynx). Such action will “significantly alter”
how this important area is managed and will likely impact and influence how the
Helena National Forest manages habitat for threatened species and wilderness
quality lands into the future. This is a significant change to the Helena Forest Plan.

Ranger DeGeest:
The entire route of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail through the Helena
National Forest should be protected for quiet, non‐motorized recreation. The trail
needs better definition and signing in many areas.(59-1)
As local Helenans, we hike sections of the CDNST regularly. In fact, today, we
headed for Priest Pass for a hike but were turned back by culvert installation by the
Forest Service, a necessary activity to be sure. Instead, we hiked south from
MacDonald Pass on the CDNST through snow drifts, downed trees and wonderful
fields of glacier lilies and spring beauties.
During the past couple of years we’ve met and chatted with some of the CDNST
thru‐hikers in the area. They have commented that route finding near Helena is often
“confusing”.(59-2)

(59-1) Resource management is a blend of Social
economic/political needs balanced with biological/
environmental needs. The preferred alternative we feel reaches
this sensitive balance and provides for the public needs as it is
providing for environmental concerns governed by law.

Thank you for your input.
We’d also encourage adoption of Alternate #3 to protect the Nevada Mountain area.
This alternative reflects the work done cooperatively with snowmobilers on winter

Dear Sir or Madam,
Currently, I write this letter from the Manzano Mountain Wilderness in central New
Mexico. The Manzano mountains and its forest rise out of the high desert. As you
climb into the high country the ponderosas give way to the aspens and firs. This
area is beautiful, however it is missing something. It lacks the authenticity and
wildness of the historic west. The absence of top tier predators has had a taming
effect on the land, which has damaged the ecosystem as a whole. The Northern
Rockies of Montana still hold the characteristics and natural heritage of pre-colonial
America. No other state in the lower forty eight has the wealth. This wealth
exceeds the profits of timber harvesting, resource exploration, and land
development. Americans are finally beginning to realize that we do not need to
have a road built through every slice of public land, a ski lift going up every
mountain, or allow OHVs to steal the tranquility and pristine aspects of the forest. I
write this letter in support of designating Nevada Mountain and Electric Peak as
wilderness. Once our wild lands are gone they are gone forever…(61-1)

cut timber, develop land, explore resources, and simply dominate the land as a
human. What we lack are places where we can be humbled. Montana, as opposed
to any other state in the lower forty-eight, is fortunate to still have some of these
humbling lands. I write this letter in support of designating Nevada Mountain and
Electric Peak as Wilderness. Both of these areas carry a great deal of power within
them. They have the power to humble humans and support grizzly populations.
Without the protection of wilderness these landscapes are at risk of being sacrificed

Elliston area. My husband and I enjoy riding the forest service roads and trail via
jeep, 4 wheelers and snowmobiles. We are both in our 70’s and have somewhat
limited physical capabilities. If this forest service plan continues to close access to

you are DISCRIMINATING against the handicapped and elderly (65-1). I am 73

Re: Helena Hunters and Anglers Association’s comments (supplemental) on the
draft EIS for the Divide Travel Plan.
The Western Environmental Law Center (WELC) hereby provides these
supplemental comments on the Forest Service’s (the Service’s) draft environmental
impact statement (DEIS) for the Divide Travel Plan in the Helena Ranger District of
the Helena National Forest (hereinafter “Divide travel plan” or “travel plan”). The
Divide Travel Plan designates routes (roads and trails) for motorized use, authorizes
car camping off-road, and opens areas for over-snow motorized vehicles in the
analysis area (hereinafter “proposed action” or “proposed travel plan”).

Response to Comments
(p. 290-310)]. We have used this information to determine
which routes need to be closed because of impacts to key
habitats—rather than simply closing roads to lower overall open
route density. Camping has been limited to road corridors, which
do not affect elk security areas or effective habitat sites for
grizzly bears—both of which are situated further from open
roads.
(66-3) The Forest Plan amendment recognizes the body of
research that was used to craft Standard 4a and discusses the
rationale for changing the standard. “Alternative A - was crafted
to provide big game security during the hunting season and
largely reflected work by Coggins (1976), Basile and Lonner
(1979), and Lyon et al. (1985) that was based on a focused road
building and timber management program on National Forests in
Montana. While this provision remains relevant – i.e.
maintaining big game security during the hunting season - the
method by which big game security is measured needs to be
updated to reflect more recent scientific deliberations and to
address shortfalls in the application of the current standard,
primarily the fact that the current standard is not a particularly
sensitive indicator of changing elk security conditions.” See the
Forest Plan amendment Alternative Description/Alternative
B/Discussion.

These comments are submitted by WELC on behalf of the Helena Hunters and
Anglers Association (hereinafter “Helena Hunters”). These comments supplement
and do not replace the comments already submitted by Helena Hunters (Gayle
Joslin).

Helena Hunters’ members live, work, and recreate on the Helena National Forest
and several of the organization’s members are intimately familiar with the Divide
Travel Planning Area in particular. Helena Hunters’ membership is made up of
professionally trained natural resource managers. They are now or have previously
worked in the fields of fish, wildlife, forestry, recreation management, water quality,
and environmental assessment. Helena Hunters’ mission statement is commensurate
with stated management objectives for the Helena National Forest:

Response to Comments

“The Helena Hunters and Anglers Association is dedicated to protecting and
restoring fish and wildlife to all suitable habitats, and to conserving all natural
resources as a public trust, vital to our general welfare. HHAA promotes the highest
standards of ethical conduct and sportsmanship, and promotes outdoor hunting and
fishing opportunity for all citizens to share equally.”
The following discussion itemizes Helena Hunters’ comments on the DEIS for the
Divide travel plan.
(1) Best available science.
NEPA and the Service’s planning regulations direct the responsible official to “use
the best available scientific information to inform the planning process.” 36 C.F.R. §
219.3. The Service is to determine “what information is the most accurate, reliable,
and relevant to the issues being considered” and document how the “best available
scientific information was used to inform . . . the plan decision . . .” Id. (66-1)
In this case, the Service must consult the latest and best science on how the
proposed action, including the designation of motorized routes (roads and trails),
authorization of car camping off-road, and opening areas for over snow motorized
vehicles adversely impacts big game security, listed species (grizzlies and lynx) and
critical habitat, habitat connectivity, and wolverines (especially habitat for denning
and denning behavior) in the Divide analysis area. (66-2)

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 409

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
The Service must also incorporate the best science when making changes to big
game standard 4(a) in the Helena Forest Plan (“proposed amendment”). In this case,
the Service is not using (or documenting how it is using) the best available science
on big game security.

Response to Comments
(66-4) Cover guidelines were incorporated into Forest Plan
amendment Alternative B to address this concern. See the Forest
Plan amendment Alternative Description/Alternative B.
(66-5) Refer to response 66-4.

The existing Forest Plan Standard #4a includes standards for hiding cover and roaddensity in big game habitat and was based on extensive peer review and published
science, including Lyon et al. (1985), Basile and Lonner (1979), Burbridge and Neff
(1976), and Coggins (1976). For this reason, the Standard was incorporated into a
number of Region One Forest Plans and has served as the applicable standard for the
Helena National Forest for nearly 30 years. It is also why the Service is choosing to
keep Standard #4a in place outside the analysis area and on the Helena National
Forest, including in the Elkhorn Mountains. (66-3)
The Service’s proposed amendment would replace Standard #4a with an untested
standard based on maintaining a certain percentage of big game security areas based
on two variables: (1) blocks of big game habitat of at least 250 acres or larger; and
(2) distance from an open motorized route during the rifle big game hunting season
(10/15 - 12/1). Maintaining sufficient hiding cover for big game within the “security
areas” is no longer part of the standard. And, the new standard does not define “big
game habitat.” Helena Hunters does not support the new standard.
The Service cannot logically define “security areas” in the absence of a hiding cover
standard. As proposed, an area would be deemed “secure” based solely on the area’s
distance from an open road and regardless of the amount (or lack of) forest cover.
(66-4) In other words, under the Service’s proposed amendment, a 1,000 acre clear
cut – a non-secure area for elk – would qualify as “big game security” so long as it
is a half mile from a motorized route open during the hunting season. Helena
Hunters is not aware of any scientific support for this approach.
Both Hillis et al. (1991) and Christensen et al. (1993) require cover in elk security
areas. (66-5) Hillis et al. (1991) does not expressly include a standard for hiding

(66-6) Such an option is presented in Alternative 5. See Wildlife
Background Report, Tables 18, 19.
(66-7) Direct effects on these species groups are analyzed in the
Wildlife Background Report: Elk (p. 157-183),
threatened/endangered species (p. 184-203); sensitive species (p.
204-226); MIS (p. 227-241). This information is also presented
in equivalent sections of the FEIS.
(66-8a) Effects to water quality are analyzed in the Hydrology
Specialist Report in the Environmental Consequences section. As
discussed in the Hydrology Specialist Report, the Divide Travel
Plan decision is not anticipated to directly result in measurable
additions to or reductions in road sediment delivery because it
does not authorize any new ground disturbing activities. The
Hydrology Specialist Report also discusses the uncertainty in
predicting future sediment generation from roads as a result of
changes to the open/closed status. Additional information on
road impacts to streams is available in the Fisheries Specialist
Report.
(66-8b) Effects to Inventoried Roadless and wilderness attributes
are analyzed in the Inventoried Roadless report located in the
project record.
(66-8c) The wildlife analysis has taken the “hard look” at these
issues in the Wildlife Background Report: corridor/linkage zone

cover but the paper does discuss the importance of cover (as do other papers) and
does recognize that security areas may consist of a variety of cover types. Notably,
in a April 12, 2013, letter to Greg Munther of Montana Backcountry Hunters and
Anglers regarding the Service’s proposed amendment for the neighboring Blackfoot
Travel Plan (the letter was provided with Mr. Munther’s comments on the DEIS)
Hillis and Jack Lyon describe the 250 acre block size requirement as a “hiding
cover” variable. Clearly, the amount of available hiding cover in security areas –
and how it will be managed – is an important factor that must be considered and
explained by the Service.
(2) Reasonable range of alternatives.
NEPA “mandates that agencies ‘study, develop, and describe appropriate
alternatives to recommended course of action in any proposal which involves
unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.” Pit River
Tribe v. U.S. Forest Service, 469 F. 3d 768, 785 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C.
§ 4332 (E)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2) (C) (iii) (must consider “alternatives to
the proposed action”).
The alternatives analysis is “the heart” of the environmental analysis because it
presents “impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus
sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options.”
40 C.F.R. § 1502.14. The alternatives analysis guarantees that “agency decision
makers ‘[have] before [them] and take [ ] into proper account all possible
approaches to a particular project (including total abandonment of the project)
which would alter the environmental impact and the cost-benefit balance.’” Bob
Marshall Alliance v. Hodel, 852 F. 2d 1223, 1228 (9th Cir. 1988) (citations
omitted). “Informed and meaningful consideration of alternatives . . . is thus an
integral part of the statutory scheme” and “critical to the goals” of NEPA. Id. at
1228-29.

function (p. 30-40, 138-146); threatened/endangered species (p.
81-98, 184-203); sensitive species (p. 99-118, 204-226); MIS (p.
119-128, 227-239).
(66-9) Indirect effects on key wildlife groups are analyzed in the
Wildlife Background Report: Elk (p. 157-183),
threatened/endangered species (p. 184-203); sensitive species (p.
204-226); MIS (p. 227-241). This information is also presented
in equivalent sections of the FEIS.
(66-10) All proposed action alternatives would, to one degree or
another, reduce the overall reach of roads and motor trails into
“secure” habitat. Alternatives 3 and 5 would be the most
effective this way.
The effects of snowmobile use on lynx are analyzed in the
Wildlife Background Report (p. 193-197) for all alternatives, as
is the potential for motorized intrusion into key wolverine habitat
(p. 102-104, 204-209). See also equivalent wildlife sections in
the FEIS.
(66-11) All projects, activities, and human-related
circumstances—past, ongoing, and foreseeable—are cataloged,
described, and their implications for wildlife discussed in the
comprehensive Cumulative Effects List (Table) in the Project
Record. In addition, relevant cumulative effects are discussed
for each species, species group, or habitat component in the
Wildlife Background Report. Appendix B in the Report
duplicates the comprehensive cumulative effects listing and
indicates the nature of each activity/circumstance on each key
wildlife species and habitat component.

In the DEIS, the Service only considers four, closely related alternatives for the

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 411

proposed action: (1) a “no action” alternatives which represents the existing baseline
and authorizes motorized use on 286 miles of roads without seasonal restrictions
(the existing baseline should only include routes designated for motorized use, not
user-created two-tracks never authorized for motorized use); (2) the proposed action
which authorizes motorized use on 284 miles roads without seasonal restrictions; (3)
alternative three which authorizes motorized use on 262 miles roads without
seasonal restrictions; and (4) alternative four which authorizes 265 miles of roads
without seasonal restrictions. In the entire 155,500 acre planning area, therefore, the
Service does not consider and analyze a single alternative that authorizes motorized
use on less than 262 miles of roads. Most of the acreage open for over-snow
motorized vehicle use in the alternatives is also very similar. Given the critical
importance of the Divide area to wildlife (big game, grizzlies, wolverine, lynx) and
wildlife connectivity in the region, and the adverse impacts associated with roads
and high road density and over-snow motorized use (especially for denning
wolverines), analyzing an alternative that authorizes motorized use on less than 262
miles of roads and less acreage for over-snow motorize use is necessary and
required by NEPA. (66-6)

Response to Comments
(66-12) These effects are analyzed in detail throughout the main
body of the Wildlife Background Report, in Appendix B, and in
the comprehensive Cumulative Effects Table.
(66-13) These effects are discussed individually in the main
segment of the Wildlife Background Report and summarized in
Appendix B, as well as in the comprehensive Cumulative Effects
Table (Project Record).

(66-14) Thank you for your input on the issue “300 foot
dispersed vehicle camping allowance”. Based on public
comments on the DEIS, the Helena National Forest developed
alternative 5 which is the preferred alternative. This alternative
does not propose a 300 foot allowance to access disperse
campsites from designated routes. Instead, alternative 5 proposes
the following:

(3) Direct impacts.
Pursuant to NEPA, the Service is required to assess how the proposed amendment
may directly impact the environment. Direct impacts are caused by the action and
occur at the same time and place. See 40 C.F.R. §1508.8. The direct impacts of an
action must be analyzed based on the affected interests, the affected region, and the
locality in which they will occur. 40 C.F.R. § 1508.27 (a).
Here, the Service must carefully consider and analyze the direct impacts of
authorizing motorized use on hundreds of miles of routes, car camping off-route,
and over-snow motorized vehicle use on thousands of acres of National Forest land
in the analysis area. This includes, but is not limited to impacts on big game security
and numbers, MIS, sensitive, and listed species (lynx and grizzlies) or proposed to
be listed species (wolverine) inhabiting the area, (66-7) soil quality and productivity,

Parking and motor vehicle use associated with dispersed camping
would be limited to no more than 70 feet from the edge of a
designated route as long as:
No new permanent routes are created by this activity.
No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources i.e.,
damage to live trees and shrubs, rutting, and eroding of stream
banks or bare soil.
Travel off-route does not cross streams.
Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas.
Vehicles travel to and parking associated with dispersed
campsites would be limited to no closer than 30 feet of a stream
or body of live water.

habitat connectivity, Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs), and areas recommended
for wilderness. In the DEIS, such an analysis is lacking.
In sum, the Service must take a hard look at how the proposed travel plan (winter
and summer) will impact the environment, including but not limited to, soil quality
and productivity, water quality (sediment from existing routes in the analysis area is
currently a problem), wetlands, (66-8a) Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs),
wilderness values, (66-8b)integrity and use of the area as a corridor or “linkage
zone” for wildlife, and habitat and population numbers for threatened and
endangered species (including lynx and grizzlies), sensitive species (fisher and
wolverine), and various MIS on the forest, especially forest-dependent species. (668c) The Service must also consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pursuant
to Section 7 of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1536, to determine whether and how the
proposed travel plan may affect grizzlies, wolverine (once listed and conference
with the agency now), lynx, and designated lynx critical habitat.
(4) Indirect impacts.
Pursuant to NEPA, the Service must take a hard look at the indirect effects of the
proposed action. (66-9) Indirect effects of a proposed action are effects that are
caused by the action but occur later in time or are further removed in distance. 40
C.F.R. § 1508(b). Indirect effects “may include growth inducing effects or other
effects related to induced changes in pattern of land use; population density or
growth rate; and related effects on air, water, and other natural resources.” Id.
Here, the proposed action will designate hundreds of miles of routes for motorized
use, off-route driving for car camping, and thousands of acres for over-snow
motorized vehicle use.
Designating roads and motorized trails on National Forest lands, areas open to car
camping, and over-snow motorized vehicle use and putting this information on a
MVUM means more public access to remote areas in the Divide areas. These roads

Response to Comments
Dispersed campsites located more than 70 feet from the edge of a
designated route that are identified on the alternative 5 map
would remain open for dispersed camping and parking associated
with dispersed camping. The five items identified under the
access to dispersed campsites up to 70’ from a designated route
section are applicable for this as well.
Alternative 5 has been analyzed by multiple resource areas. The
analyses are reflected in the FEIS.

(66-15) The purpose Divide Travel Plan is to provide a
manageable system of designated public motorized access routes
and areas within the Divide area, consistent with and to achieve
the purposes of Forest Plan and travel management regulations at
36 CFR part 212 subpart B. Travel planning is required under 36
CFR part 212 regardless of the amount of available resources to
enforce and monitor travel management decisions. This being
said, the Helena National Forest acknowledges that any change
to existing conditions (no action alternative) would potentially
require additional effort from law enforcement personnel and
Forest Protection Officers on a short-term basis while the users
adjust to the new closures and become familiar with the use of
the MVUM. However, supplying the appropriate amount of
resources to monitor and conduct law enforcement is not within
the scope of the Divide Travel plan.

– which make it easier and faster for driving, walking, biking, and horseback riding
– will funnel hunters, trappers, and recreationists into otherwise secure habitat. They
will also push wildlife off public lands and onto private lands in the area. The
Service must analyze these indirect effects. The Service should also analyze the
indirect effects of winter motorized recreation on lynx and wolverine, in particular
how snow compaction from winter motorized use indirectly affects wildlife
movement and, in particular lynx and the species’ competitive advantage in deep
snow conditions over other species, such as bobcat, coyotes, and wolves. (66-10)

analysis by elk herd unit. The amendment concludes that “[w]e
would also continue to achieve our objective of “ensuring that
viable populations of existing…animal species are maintained”
(USDA 1986, p. II/17). Elk habitat will remain abundant and
well distributed across the Forest. It is anticipated that the Forest
will retain security components necessary to maintain a viable
and huntable elk population”. (See the Forest Plan amendment,
National Forest Management Act section.)

(5) Cumulative impacts.

(66-17) See the table “Compatibility of Forest Plan Amendment
Alternative B-Preferred Alternative with Existing Wildlife
Standards” in the Forest Plan amendment. All wildlife related
standards are included in that table.

Pursuant to NEPA, the Service must analyze the cumulative impacts of the proposed
action. Cumulative impacts are “the impacts on the environment which result from
the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and
reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or nonFederal) or person undertakes such other actions.” 40 C.F.R. § 1508.7. Cumulative
impacts can result from “individually minor but collectively significant actions
taking place over a period of time.” Id.
The proper consideration of cumulative impacts under NEPA requires “some
quantified or detailed information; general statements about possible effects and
some risk do not constitute a hard look absent a justification regarding why more
definitive information could not be provided.” Great Basin Mine Watch v. Hankins,
456 F. 3d 955, 971 (9th Cir. 2006). Moreover, the “analysis must be more than
perfunctory; it must provide a useful analysis of the cumulative impacts of past,
present, and future projects.” Id. The Service “must do more than just catalogue
relevant past projects in the area.” Id. It must give a “sufficiently detailed catalogue
of past, present, and future projects and provide adequate analysis about how these
projects, and the difference between the projects, are thought to have impacted the
environment.” Id. Some “quantified assessment of their combined environmental
impact” is required. Id. at 972. (66-11)

Response to Comments

At present, there are a number of Federal, State, and private actions that have
occurred, are occurring, or are reasonably certain to occur in the Helena National
Forest, the EHUs, and the proposed analysis area that may be having a cumulative
impact on big game security and other resources and must be analyzed by the
Service in conjunction with the proposed action. (66-13) These include, but are not
limited to: forest management on public lands (thinning, salvage, regeneration
harvests, hazardous tree removal, pre-commercial thins) and associated roads, skid
trails, and disturbance; the R-1 and N-1 amendments for the neighboring Blackfoot
Travel Plan; the new Blackfoot Travel Plan (including the 300 foot dispersed
camping authorization); the big game amendment for the Divide planning area;
private land development and forest management; motorized recreation and travel
planning; beetle-kill, climate change, livestock grazing, highways, hunting, and
superfund cleanup/storage. It is not enough to merely list various activities. The
Service must engage in a quantified assessment of the various activities impacts of
specific resources.
(6) The 300 foot dispersed vehicle camping allowance. (66-14)
The proposed action in the DEIS authorizes wheeled motorized vehicle travel for
dispersed camping or parking associated with dispersed camping within 300 feet of
all designated system routes, including roads and trails (unless signed otherwise or
specifically closed) as long as: (1) no new permanent routes are created by this

activity; (2) no damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources occurs; (3)
travel off-route does not cross streams, and (4) travel off-route does not traverse
riparian or wet areas.

Response to Comments

According to the Service, authorizing car camping within 300 feet of all designated
system routes provides a reasonable level of access for recreational purposes. The
DEIS further states that, with the implementation of the criteria for resource
protection described in the actions common to all alternatives section of the DEIS,
any off-route vehicle impacts resulting from such use would be minimized. The
DEIS also concludes that the 300 foot provision would be consistent with the 2001
Tri-State OHV Decision, the 2005 Travel Planning Rule (Travel Rule), Executive
Order 11644, and the Helena Forest Plan. The DEIS further states that the Helena
National Forest would make a commitment to monitoring and enforcement of this
provision, in order to ensure routes would not expand in these areas and any
problems encountered would be dealt with as they arise.
Helena Hunters has a number of concerns about the Service’s decision to authorize
car camping within 300 foot (the length of a football field) off of all designated
routes in the analysis area.
First, allowing vehicle travel for dispersed camping for up to 300 feet from a
designated travel route (roads and trails) will potentially affect a large amount of
land and essentially constitutes un-managed motorized recreation in the analysis
area. The authorized distance – 300 feet on either side of a designated route – equals
a 600 foot corridor (two football fields in length) for driving off-route (perhaps
larger – more like 610 feet – if the corridor is measured from the edge of the system
route instead of the center line). Multiplying this width times the number of
motorized roads and trails in the proposed action means tens of thousands of acres
of National Forest land could be negatively impacted by off-route motorized travel.
This is a significant decision for which resource impacts have not been specifically
evaluated in the DEIS (see below).

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 416

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
Second, the premise of the 300 foot proposal seems to be that it will not be abused
by the public and that no travel route to a camping site will ever be reused. This
seems highly unlikely. Unmanaged off-route vehicle use has caused and will
continue to cause uncontrolled proliferation of trails resulting from repeated use.
Effects of off-route travel by vehicles on soil, water quality, vegetation, heritage and
cultural sites, wildlife and the spread of invasive species are well documented in the
scientific literature. Soil compaction and erosion contributes to sedimentation of
streams, and damaged vegetation may create opportunities for establishment of
invasive plant species.

Response to Comments

Many wildlife species are affected by noise and disturbance associated with
vehicles. While the decision states that such use will not be allowed to create
permanent routes or to impact vegetation, soil, water resources, and riparian areas, it
is reasonable to assume that such impacts will occur.
Indeed, the DEIS acknowledges that the Helena National Forest has never
conducted a comprehensive survey of this use, but states that cursory monitoring
and field checks by various Service resource crews have not resulted in any widespread violations or wide-spread resource concerns. Where site-specific issues have
arisen, they state they have been able to address them via site-specific area closures
or restrictions. Such general statements and anecdotal observations, however, do not
constitute a reasonable assurance that the 300 foot provision will not result in
significant and irreparable resource damage.
Third, the Service states that the highest priority for monitoring will be ensuring that
wheeled, motorized vehicle travel within 300 feet of designated system routes is not
creating any new permanent routes and damaging vegetation, soil, or water
resources, or crossing streams, riparian or wet areas. However, it does not state how
site-specific problems (which seem likely to occur at some frequency) will be
addressed once they are discovered. This could be a huge task for which resources
are extremely limited.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 417

Comments
Enforcement of travel plans is difficult and Helena Hunters does not believe the
Service has the resources to monitor for illegal travel activities (66-15) (Amber
Kamps, April 1, 2014 in comments to Helena Hunters). Surveys of travel
restrictions in the neighboring Blackfoot Planning Area by Helena Hunters members
in 2013-2014 have shown a high degree of violations and a readily apparent lack of
monitoring and enforcement. This causes Helena Hunters to doubt the accuracy of
the statements pertaining to intended comprehensive monitoring and enforcement of
the 300 foot provision.

Response to Comments

Finally, contrary to the Service’s statement in the DEIS, a blanket authorization of
dispersed vehicle camping within 300 feet of all system routes is not consistent with
the language and spirit of Executive Order 11644, as amended, or the 2005 Travel
Planning Rule (and the 2001 Tri-State Decision was merely a one-size-fits all
planning level decision that has no bearing on the designation of specific routes or
areas for motorized use in the Helena National Forest).
The term “dispersed vehicle camping” refers generally to the ability to drive your
motorized vehicle, i.e., OHV, motorcycle, or 4 x4 car, off designated roads and trails
and car camp wherever you would like. When authorizing car camping off-road on
National Forest lands, the Service explains it has four options:
(1) Do not provide for any driving and car camping off-road and restrict all
motorized use to designated roads and trails;
(2) Individually map each short spur route to a designated, existing car camping site
and then include the spur route in the travel system;
(3) Issue individual permits authorizing the holder to car camp off-road; or
(4) Use the authority in the Travel Rule (36 C.F.R. § 212.51 (b)) to authorize limited
amounts of car camping off-road within a specific distance of designated routes.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 418

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
According to the Service, option (4) is the least preferential option that, if used,
should only be applied at the individual route level and not broadly across an entire
forest.

Response to Comments

The language in the Travel Rule authorizing car camping off-road “is written
narrowly (‘limited use,’ ‘within a specified distance,’ ‘of certain designated routes,
’solely for the purpose of’).” Id. The Service, therefore, is to apply the off-road car
camping provision “sparingly, on a local or State-wide basis, to avoid undermining
the purposes of the [Travel Rule] . . . and to promote consistency in
implementation.” 70 Fed. Reg. 68264, 68285 (emphasis added); see also FSM §
7703.14(2). “Broad use of this provision could lead to corridors of cross-country
motor vehicle use along many designated roads and trails, with attendant
proliferation of unauthorized routes and environmental damage.” For this reason,
authorizing car camping off-road in certain areas is to be “applied with caution” and
only after carefully considering the impacts at the local, individual route level. 36
C.F.R. § 212.55 (a), (b).
In the DEIS, the Service chose option (4) for the proposed action but ignored its
own directive to narrowly and cautiously apply the provision, choosing instead to
authorize car camping off-road within 300 feet of every motorized route in the
analysis area subject to some limitations that will be nearly impossible to enforce
and monitor.
This means individuals in the Divide analysis area can drive their cars, OHVs, and
motorcycles off-road and off-trail and car camp wherever they want so long as their
motor vehicles are within 300 feet (a football field) of a designated road or trail. In
effect, the Service’s allowance creates 600 foot-wide corridors open to driving and
car camping throughout the analysis area. The off-road car camping allowance is not
allowed in a few areas but is otherwise not limited to pre-existing access or spur
roads, not limited to designated or popular camp sites, and not prohibited or
restricted in sensitive areas, including but not limited to secure elk habitat, lynx
critical habitat, or some roadless areas. Notably, the Helena National Forest’s

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 419

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
Response to Comments
approach to off-road car camping differs significantly from the approach taken by
the neighboring Lewis and Clark National Forest. In the Lewis and Clark National
Forest, the Service chose to reduce the 300 foot dispersed vehicle camping
prescription to “one vehicle (and attached trailer) length” in response to a barrage of
public comments and concerns about how the Agency’s decision in the DEIS would,
in effect, “create a 600 foot swath down each and every road or trail for vehicles to
travel.” As explained by one organization:
From a management perspective, it will be virtually impossible to prove that
someone is not looking for a parking or camping spot. Moreover, this decision will
inevitably result in the creation of new roads and trails and result in an enormous
amount of natural resource damage. In fact, [the Service’s] decision translates into a
600 foot camping/off-road travel corridor for each road and trail in the analysis area.
Under any alternative, this decision has the potential to affect over five hundred
thousand acres of public land in the analysis area. . .
Other members of the public raised similar concerns and requested that the size of
the dispersed vehicle camping prescription be reduced or eliminated. After carefully
considering these comments, the land-management implications of the 300 foot rule,
and the resource damage issues associated with creating 600 foot swaths open to
cross-country travel for dispersed vehicle camping, the Service modified the
alternatives presented in the draft EIS by shortening the distance from 300 feet to
approximately 70 feet (the size of a vehicle and attached trailer). In the Agency’s
own words:
In reaching my decision, I considered the comments on the [draft] EIS, the
information contained in the analysis concerning user-created trails, how
recreationists use areas to park or turn around, public safety, and the numbers and
locations of dispersed camp sites . . . My decision will reduce the creation of new
trails out of dispersed camp sites by prohibiting travel off designated routes to a
campsite, while still allowing access to continue to the majority of the existing
dispersed campsites.

Response to Comments

The Helena National Forest should follow the Lewis and Clark’s lead and adopt a
similar approach, one that allows car camping within a reasonable distance of an
open road and, in so doing, reins in natural resource damage.
If the Service decides to take a different approach than the Lewis and Clark National
Forest and go with option (4) and authorize car camping within a 600 foot corridor
along every road and trail in the analysis area, as proposed, then it must first
carefully consider the impacts (direct, indirect, and cumulative) of that decision
pursuant to NEPA and the Travel Rule on the affected resources, including but not
limited to soil quality and productivity (the Service, for example, should collect and
analyze soil samples from the impacted area and consult and apply its Region One
soil quality standards), native vegetation, special management or resource areas,
wilderness characteristics, IRAs (including compliance with the Roadless Rule),
cultural and historic properties, big game habitat and security (virtually all dead
trees within the dispersed vehicle camping corridor will be removed), listed species
(grizzlies and lynx, including lynx critical habitat), candidate species (wolverines),
and sensitive and management indicator species (MIS) on the Helena National
Forest. To date, no such analysis has occurred. Nor has the Service complied with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) to ensure cultural and
historic properties within the 600 foot corridor (or on our near roads and trails
designated for motorized use under the proposed action) are inventoried, identified
and protected prior to authorizing car camping and off-route driving within the 600
foot corridor (or on designated roads and trails). Section 106 of the NHPA is often
described as the “stop, look, and listen” provision. Te-Moak Tribe of Western
Shoshone Nevada v. USDOI, 608 F.3d 592, 607 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).
Pursuant to Section 106, the Service is required to “take into account the effect of
[an] undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in
or eligible for inclusion in the National Register.” 16 U.S.C. § 470f. Authorizing car
camping off-road within 300 feet of a system route qualifies as an undertaking. So
too does designating routes for motorized use pursuant to the Divide Travel Plan.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 421

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
The process begins by defining the “area of potential effects,” which in this case
includes the area open to dispersed vehicle camping. 36 C.F.R. § 800.16 (d). The
Service is then directed to review all existing information on cultural and historic
properties within this area (including data on possible yet-to-be identified
properties) and seek out additional information from individuals with knowledge of
the area, as well as information from local Indian tribes. 36 C.F.R. § 800.4 (a).
Based on information gathered from this first, initial step, the Service must then take
additional steps “necessary to identify historic properties within the area of potential
effects.” 36 C.F.R. § 800.4 (b). The Service must make a “reasonable and good faith
effort to carry out appropriate identification efforts.” 36 C.F.R. § 800.4 (b) (1). To
date, no such “reasonable and good faith effort” to identify cultural and historic
properties within the area open for car camping has occurred. Nor has such an effort
be undertaken before designating routes (roads and trails) for motorized use.

Response to Comments

In addition, the Service has not carefully considered and applied Executive Order
11644's and the Travel Rule’s “minimization criteria” before designating routes for
motorized use or authorizing widespread car camping within a 600 foot travel
corridor along every route in the analysis area.
Executive Order 11644, as amended and strengthened by Executive Order 11989,
directs that all areas designated for motorized use on public lands be located to
minimize: (1) damage to soil, watershed, vegetation, or other resources of the public
lands; (2) harassment of wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife habitats; and
(3) conflicts between off-road vehicle use and other existing or proposed
recreational uses of the same or neighboring lands.
These criteria, “known as the ‘minimization criteria,’ require federal agencies to
minimize motorized impacts on public lands.” Wildlands CPR v. USFS, – F.Supp.
2d –, 2012 WL 1072351 at *12-13 (D. Mont. 2012); Center for Sierra Nevada
Conservation v. U.S. Forest Service, 832 F. Supp. 2d 1138, 1146 (E.D. Cal. 2011)

The word “minimize” means to “reduce (something, especially something unwanted
or unpleasant) to the smallest possible amount or degree.” THE NEW OXFORD
AMERICAN DICTIONARY (2001) at 1087. It does not mean the Service must
eliminate all impacts. Use of the word minimize in Executive Order 11644 also does
not refer to the total number or overall mileage of routes but to the effects of route
and area designations, i.e., the Service must designate areas for motorized use to
minimize damage to natural resources and conflicts between uses. Idaho
Conservation League v. Guzman, 766 F. Supp. 2d 1056, 1073 (D. Idaho 2011)
(citing CBD v. BLM, 746 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1080 (N.D. Cal. 2009)).

Response to Comments

The Service’s 2005 Travel Rule codifies Executive Order 11644's minimization
criteria by directing the Agency to consider, with the “objective of minimizing”
damage to natural resources and conflicts among uses when designating trails and
areas for motorized use. 36 C.F.R. § 212.55 (b). While the language may differ
somewhat (minimize vs. the “objective of minimizing”) both Executive Order
11644 and the Travel Rule contemplate the “same result.” Guzman, 766 F. Supp. 2d
at 1074; Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation, 832 F. Supp. 2d at 1146 (same).
Both directives, for example, require the Service to document and explain “how the
minimization criteria were applied in the route designation decisions.” Id.;
Wildlands CPR, 2012 WL 1072351 at *14 (same); CBD, 746 F. Supp. 2d at 10791080 (same). “Simply listing the criteria and noting that they were considered is not
sufficient to meet this standard.” Id. Nor is it sufficient to rely on conclusory
statements in the record from the Agency or excel spreadsheets and appendices that
merely list various routes and why they were included in the system. See CBD, 746
F. Supp. 2d at 1079-1080.
Instead, the Service must carefully document and explain how the minimization
criteria was applied when making specific route and area designations. Id. No such
documentation or explanation is provided in the DEIS regarding the authorization of
car camping within a 600 foot wide corridor along nearly every road and trail in the
Divide analysis area. Nor is it sufficiently made during the route designation

process.

Response to Comments

The Service says it “minimizes” impacts to resources (and presumably complies
with the Executive Order 11644's and Travel Rule’s minimization criteria) by
complying with all Forest Plan standards and objectives. This may be true, but the
Service must still connect the dots and explain how compliance with specific
standards in the Forest Plan (especially new amendments) satisfies its legal
obligation to minimize impacts and conflicts. This has yet to occur. In fact, nowhere
in the DEIS does the Service adequately explain how it considered and applied the
minimization criteria when authorizing a 600 foot travel corridor for car camping off
of every designated route in the analysis area.
(7) Ensuring the viability of MIS.
Under NFMA, the implementing regulations, and the Helena Forest Plan, the
Service is required to manage wildlife habitat on the Helena National Forest to
ensure viable populations of existing native species are maintained.
To do so, the Service identified management indicator species (MIS) for various
species groups within the Helena National Forest whose habitat is most likely to be
changed by forest management activities. The MIS for the mature tree dependent
group, for instance, is the marten. The old growth dependent group is represented by
the pileated woodpecker and the goshawks; the snag dependent groups is
represented by the hairy woodpecker; the threatened and endangered group includes
the grizzly bear (and other species); and the commonly hunted MIS are elk, mule
deer, and bighorn sheep.
These MIS represent a proxy or surrogate for the health and viability of many other
species. While the Service retains some flexibility with respect to the appropriate
methodology used to monitor population numbers (actual and trend) of MIS, i.e.,
using population data on MIS and/or habitat data as a proxy for MIS population data
(commonly referred to as the “proxy-on-proxy” approach) the mandate to maintain

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 424

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
viable populations of MIS like elk, mule deer, marten, grizzlies and woodpeckers,
cannot be ignored. And the methodology employed must be reasonably reliable and
accurate. See Native Ecosystems Council v. Tidwell, 599 F. 3d 926, 933 (9th Cir.
2010).

Response to Comments

If, for example, the Service decides to use habitat as a proxy for population numbers
for MIS, then the proxy results must mirror reality. Maintaining the acreage of
habitat necessary to maintain viable populations of big game species (elk, deer, and
moose) on the Helena National Forest must in fact ensure viable populations are
maintained. At the very least, the Service must describe the quantity and quality of
habitat that is necessary to sustain the viability of big game species and explain its
methodology for measuring this habitat. See Native Ecosystems Council v. Weldon,
848 F. Supp.2d 1207, 1213 (D. Mont. 2012).
In the Helena National Forest, the Service uses the big game standards, including
Standard #4a, as a means of ensuring compliance with NFMA’s viability
requirement.
Compliance with Standard #4a’s hiding cover and road-density standard, for
instance, is used as a proxy for population numbers of elk and, as such, other big
game species.
The proposed action, however, involves eliminating standard #4a and replaces it
with an untested standard (never submitted for public review and comment) based
solely on size and distance from an open route during the hunting season. Hiding
cover for big game and other forest dependent species was eliminated from the big
game standard. Because it is untested and eliminates the standard for hiding cover
and road-density, there are no assurances that the new standard will work or that the
approved Divide Travel Plan will ensure viable populations of MIS are retained on
the Helena National Forest. There are no assurances, let alone reasonable
assurances, that the new standard – designed to accommodate the travel plan -- is
reliable and accurate and will ensure viable populations of elk and other big game

species will be maintained. See Weldon, 848 F. Supp.2d at1214-1215. Indeed, under
the proposed amendment, a 1,000 clear cut would qualify as “big game security” so
long as it is a half mile from a motorized route open during the hunting season. (6616)

Response to Comments

(8) Compliance with other forest plan standards. (66-17)
Pursuant to NFMA, the Service must ensure that the proposed action is consistent
with the Helena Forest Plan. 16 U.S.C. § 1604 (i). If not, then the responsible
official must either change the proposed action to bring into compliance with the
other standards in the Forest Plan or amend to the other Forest Plan standards.
Here, the Service has failed to ensure the proposed action (the new travel plan) and
proposed amendment to standard 4(a) which eliminates the existing hiding cover
standard for big game security is consistent with the following existing standards in
the Helena Forest Plan:
• Big game Standard #1 requiring that important summer and winter range for big
game species include adequate hiding and thermal cover to support habitat potential.
The Service must (but has failed) to explain how the proposed amendment – which
does away with the hiding cover standard – will ensure compliance with this
important standard;
• Big game Standard #2 requiring that an environmental analysis for all project work
include a cover analysis at the drainage or EHU level;
• Big game Standard #3 directing that elk summer range be maintained at 35% or
greater hiding cover and areas of winter range maintained at 25% or greater thermal
cover in drainages or EHUs. This standard incorporates all land (private, state, and
federal) in the EHU;
• Big game Standard #4 directing the Service to implement an aggressive road
management program to maintain or improve big game security. The Service must
explain how the proposed amendment qualifies as an “aggressive” program to
maintain and improve big game security;

• Big game Standard #4b stating that elk calving grounds and nursery areas will be
closed to motorized vehicles during peak use by elk;
• Big game Standard #4c directing that all winter range areas be closed to vehicles
between December 1 and May 15;
• Big game Standard #5 dictating the minimum size areas for hiding and thermal
cover;
• Big game Standard #6 stating that the Service will follow the Montana
Cooperative Elk-Logging Study Recommendations (Appendix C in the Forest Plan);
• Big game Standard #10 stating that moose habitat will be managed to provide
adequate browse species diversity and quantity to support current moose
populations. Notably, Standard #4a is a big game standard designed to protect
habitat for elk, deer, and moose. Mule deer and moose numbers are in decline in
western Montana and eliminating standards for habitat cover may make a bad
situation worse for these big game species;
• The standards, guidelines, and objectives included in the Northern Rockies Lynx
Management Direction (“NRLMD”);
• The grizzly bear standards included in the Helena Forest Plan, including but not
limited to the requirement, in occupied grizzly habitat, to minimize man-caused
mortality by limiting the open road density to the 1980 density of 0.55 miles per
square mile and the IGBC’s open road, total road, and core area standards for
grizzly bear habitat;
• All standards and monitoring requirements of MIS, including but not limited to all
forest (mature, old growth, snag) dependent species and sensitive, threatened and

Dear Ranger DeGeest,
I would like to thank you for rehabilitating the Sweeney Creek Area to be nonmotorized and ask that you expand this designation to the CDT (68-1). I have
always been an advocate of quiet trails, and my times outside of Montana, where
these protections are not possible, have made me realize how important this
designation is. Montanans and visitors alike cherish Montana because it is a place
where people can still enjoy nature in its entirety, unmarred by the advances of man.
It is largely what sets Montana apart from other places around the country, and it is
absolutely necessary that we do everything possible to ensure that these
opportunities remain possible in Montana.
The CDT, especially, is a national treasure and deserves all the protections possible.
Not only is it a place for hikers and horseback riders to find solitude, but Montana's
unique wildlife depends on the habitat that surrounds it. By protecting it as a nonmotorized area, we are also protecting the region's wildlife that few other places

used to hike in this area. We would start at the Sweeney Creek Ecological Trail then
branch out exploring this quiet mostly roadless area. A few years ago after not
having visited this area in some time I took my granddaughter there for a hike. What
a change. The area had become laced with a spider web of unauthorized illegal
motorized roads. Trash is everywhere. Trees are shot up. Weeds have taken over.
The noise of motor vehicles was prevalent. We soon left. This area needs to be
recovered and reclaimed. The best way to do that is to close off all unauthorized
motor vehicle routes and make the area non-motorized only. From the forest
boundary on the southeast side of the Priest Pass road up to tile top of Priest Pass
and down to Mullan Pass road tile area should be off limits to motorized travel. This
includes forest lands on both sides of Priest Pass Road. West of the road towards
highway 12 and east of the road towards Mullan Pass road tile forest lands should be
non-motorized. The Priest Pass Road # 335 should be the only open motorized route
(70-2).
2. Priest Pass: On top of Priest Pass you must do something to stop the hill climbing
on the open bald hills on the north side of the road. What a mess. Motorized travel

there serves no purpose. The CDT from Priest Pass to Mullan Pass is currently open
to trail motorcycles. To insure a quiet non —motorized experience on the CDT this
trail should be non-motorized only. This would be in keeping with Northern Region
directives for the CDT. There are some fragile wet meadows in there that get ablaze
with Blue Camas flowers (70-3). This is best enjoyed during a non-motorized visit
to protect the resource and the quiet beauty. In section 13 Township 10 North,
Range 6 West there is a short road heading north down a wet drainage. The road is
dead end; it leads to no specific feature and serves no purpose. Motor vehicles in
this wet north facing drainage cause rutting and stream disruption. Please close and
reclaim it (70-4).

Response to Comments

3. CDT from MacDonald Pass to Priest Pass. The trail here has some nasty, muddy,
wide segments of motor vehicle damaged roads. This segment needs to be nonmotorized only. This would protect resources, prevent trail damage and provide a
quiet hiking or horseback experience. You should work with local and national
groups to get a nice single track trail in this area (70-5).
4. CDT. The trail here heading north from Dana Springs should be designated as
non-motorized only. You should put a gate and trail head right at road 136 in
Section lO, Township il North, and Range 7 West. The trail here leads into some
nice wildlands in the Black Mountain area. To protect resources and provide a quiet
non-motorized CDT experience this would be a wise choice (70-6).
5. CDT from Mullan Pass heading north. I strongly encourage you to close some of
the redundant roads here and consolidate motorized travel on a couple of essential
roads. Then restrict CDT travel to non-motorized use only. Try to find a route for a
single track segment or work with some existing roads and narrow them down to
trails (70-7).
6. CDT north from Bullion Parks to the existing single track CDT north of Jericho
Mountain. Close this mess of rutted, water holed, jeep road. Motorized vehicles
have made a mess of this area. Please restrict this route to non-motorized use only

7. CDT in general. I urge you to protect not only the CDT as a non-motorized trail
but to also provide a corridor on either side of it that is closed to motorized use. This
would help protect the trail and also provide a non-motorized buffer zone to protect
wildlife and scenic beauty (70-9).
8. Roadless Areas. The Jericho Mountain and Electric Peak Roadless areas should
be managed for non-motorized use year round. There are plenty of roaded areas for
motorized travel. Protect these small roadless gems for wildlife and non-motorized
travel enjoyment (70-10).

We need to honor that original intent. This is why I support Alternative 3 of the
Divide Travel Plan (73-1). This is the non-motorized option which says these lands
should remain non-motorized year round. This includes the proposed wilderness of
Nevada Mountain, the recommended wilderness of the Electric Peak and adjoining

This proposal was a collaborative effort among several, several organizations

Dear Sir or Madam:
As I grew up as a young man in Illinois I yearned for something more. Agriculture
has wiped out our once wild prairies and forest, predator control has extricated all of
our top tier species and a forest of only 1000 acres is seen as an enormous tract of
public land. This altercated land forced me to move out west when I was eighteen.
Arizona and Colorado were the first places I went. I was then when I thought I had
found what I was looking for. But over time I discovered these places were mere
shadows of what they once were. They no longer hold the howl of the wolf or
presence of the grizzly. It was not until I hiked beneath the Chinese Wall, lost
myself in the Absaorka Beartooth, and saw my first grizzly bear in Yellowstone
when I realized what I and millions of Americans had been missing. I personally

Response to Comments

Subject: Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Travel Management Planning
and Forest Plan Amendments for the Divide Area of the Helena National Forest
Montana Chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers is comprised of Montana
hunters and fishermen who value quality fish and wildlife habitat and maintenance
or enhancement of traditional non-motorized hunting and fishing opportunities.
Many of our members hunt and fish almost exclusively on public lands, and many
focus on the National Forest lands in the Divide travel plan area. We have a deep
commitment to protection of wildlife and fisheries habitats and traditional nonmotorized hunting and fishing not only for the present, but to assure equal
opportunities for our children and their children.
We request each of our comments be individually and thoroughly addressed in the
process and be entered into the public record in their entirety. Montana BHA has
previously commented on this process as early as 2008(78-1).
The Divide Travel Plan process is a rare opportunity to move the Helena
substantially toward meeting the Helena Forest Plan goals, objectives, and
standards. In contrast, most day to day Forest Service business has only minor
effects moving toward meeting the goals, objectives and standards of the Helena
Forest Plan. Forest Plan Direction appropriately focuses heavily on management of
the road and trail network for most Forest Plan goals, objectives and Standards.
Most of the adverse effects of man’s activities on the Forest resources are related to
roads, trails, and use associated with them.
BHA Issue: It is imperative that the Forest only retain the most essential roads and
trails in choosing a final Plan, and take this opportunity to minimize the road and
motorized trail network (78-3). This direction is clear in the current National Forest
Service Travel Plan Policy (FSM 7710) directing a minimal network, and especially
appropriate given the Forest’s acknowledgement of transportation maintenance
shortfall and even lower budget expectations in the future. The objectives of this

environmental needs. The preferred alternative we feel reaches

travel plan process must thoroughly address “FSM 7710.13. “ To determine the
minimum road system needed for sustainable public and agency access to achieve
the desired conditions in the applicable land management plan; to promote
ecosystem health; and to address public safety and efficiency of operations in an
environmentally sensitive manner within current and anticipated funding levels”
(emphasis added). In the DEIS, the Helena only considers four, closely related
alternatives for the proposed action: (1) a “no action” alternatives which represents
the existing baseline and authorizes motorized use on 286 miles of roads without
seasonal restrictions (the existing baseline should only include routes designated for
motorized use, not user-created two-tracks never authorized for motorized use); (2)
the proposed action which authorizes motorized use on 284 miles roads without
seasonal restrictions; (3) alternative three which authorizes motorized use on 262
miles roads without seasonal restrictions; and (4) alternative four which authorizes
265 miles of roads without seasonal restrictions. In the entire 155,500 acre planning
area, therefore, the Service does not consider and analyze a single alternative that
authorizes motorized use on less than 262 miles of roads. Most of the acreage open
for over-snow motorized vehicle use in the alternatives is also very similar. Given
the critical importance of the Divide area to wildlife (big game, grizzlies, wolverine,
lynx) and wildlife connectivity in the region, and the adverse impacts associated
with roads and high road density and over-snow motorized use (especially for
denning wolverines), analyzing an alternative that authorizes motorized use on less
than 262 miles of roads and less acreage for over-snow motorize use is necessary
and required by NEPA.

Response to Comments
this sensitive balance and provides for the public needs as it is
providing for environmental concerns governed by law. Preferred
alternative does address the parking and dispersed camping issue.
A clear and concise travel plan decision will aid in the
enforcement and conviction of travel plan violations.

(78-4) Refer to Alternative 5.

Of course, all action alternatives allowing any number of vehicles to leave the
roadway anywhere along its length for up to 300 feet fails to meet minimization
criteria discussed above. We also believe a 300 foot allowance would be difficult,
if not impossible to enforce, and would likely not be enforced due to inability to
prove a person was not looking for a camping spot. Is one track now a road for
others to legitimately follow…or is it two passes…or three? In addition, travel
enforcement on the Helena rarely occurs, and therefore it is unlikely to improve in
the future. We see no discussion specifically how motorized travel enforcement will

Comments
improve in the future (78-4).

Response to Comments

BHA Issue: The No Action Alternative (Alt 1) inappropriately includes user created
routes as the baseline condition. It is required by NEPA and case law that only the
designated transportation system be used as the baseline condition to accurately
compare and disclose impacts of each alternative relative to this baseline. We
request the No Action Alternative not include undesignated routes to describe the
Alternative nor compare impacts of the other alternatives.
BHA Issue: We also emphasize that the Travel Management Rule and Executive
Orders 16644 and 11989 (EOs) have specific requirements to address. Unlike
NEPA, which requires agencies to assess environmental consequences of their
decisions but does not obligate agencies to take actions that minimize those
consequences, the Travel Management Rule requires the Forest Service to aim to
minimize environmental damage when designating routes. Therefore the Helena
must consider the “minimization” criteria set out in 36 C.F.R. § 212.55(b) and
document how the agency applied the criteria in its designations on the record. The
language “with the objective of minimizing” means that the whole goal or purpose
of the exercise is to select routes in order to minimize impacts in light of the
agency’s other duties. Simply listing the criteria and noting that they were
considered is not sufficient to meet this standard. Instead, the Forest Service must
explain how the minimization criteria were applied in the route designation
decisions. Executive Order 11644 directs minimizing effects on resources and other
users: (1) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize damage to soil, watershed,
vegetation, or other resources of the public lands. (2) Areas and trails shall be
located to minimize harassment of wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife
habitats. (3) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize conflicts between off-road
vehicle use and other existing or proposed recreational uses of the same or
neighboring public lands, and to ensure the compatibility of such uses with existing
conditions in populated areas, taking into account noise and other factors (78-5).

(78-5)- The addition of the roads to the Forest System was
analyzed as part of the effects analysis in the Hydrology
Resource Report and is discussed in the Environmental
Consequences section. The effects to water quality associated
with the adoption of unauthorized routes are minimal for each
action alternative and are offset by the potential of future road
decommissioning afforded by this decision. A route-by-route
analysis for roads added to the travel system is available in the
project record.
Many of the road and motor trail closures in action alternatives
have been driven by site-specific conflicts with wildlife. See, for
example, narratives in the Wildlife Background Report, “Local
Effects in key Areas” (p. 242-282).
Resource management is a blend of Social economic/political
needs balanced with biological/ environmental needs. The
preferred alternative we feel reaches this sensitive balance and
provides for the public needs as it is providing for environmental
concerns governed by law.

(78-6) Thank you for your input

The interpretation of “minimizing” as discussed in DEIS Summary page 8 fails to

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 444

Comments
meet national Forest Service direction. The DEIS has not demonstrated how it has
minimized damage to soil, watersheds, vegetation, harassment of wildlife and
significant disruption of wildlife habitats, nor conflicts of motorized use with other
recreational uses. “Diminish impacts” or “moving toward goals and objective” is
not minimizing. Minimizing means you must address why each route to be left
open to public motorized travel that damages soil, watersheds, vegetation
(including noxious weed spread), disruption of wildlife habitats or other recreational
uses is indeed necessary, and use cannot be avoided (78-6).

Response to Comments

BHA Issue: The application of direction contained in the Travel Planning policy is
not thoroughly reviewed or specifically addressed. FSM 7710 is described as
“Requires travel analysis (FSH 7709.55, ch. 20) to inform decisions related to
identification of the minimum road system (emphasis added) needed for safe and
efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of National Forest
System (NFS) lands per 36 CFR 212.5(b) and to inform decisions related to the
designation of roads, trails, and areas for motor vehicle use per 36 CFR 212.51.
The selected final travel plan must comply with the FSM 7710 of minimizing the
roads network on the Forest, and a discussion of compliance with the policy
included in the NEPA documents including the FEIS.
BHA Issue: Proposing adoption of a Travel Plan preferred alternative that is only
compliant with the current Forest Plan elk standard if a speculative elk security
amendment is adopted is therefore 1) premature, 2) inappropriate and 3) illegal. The
resulting NEPA elk security analysis and conclusions for this travel plan
inappropriately tiers off this speculative and unapproved elk security amendment
that has not had analysis nor public review, and therefore is non-compliant with
NEPA. We find the proposed elk security amendment’s application inappropriate
and without science base, has been peer reviewed or concurred by recognized elk
scientists (including the authors of the Hillis Paradigm paper), does not incorporate
the most current elk science, and has not been validated for being appropriate for
use on Divide landscapes. The authors of the Hillis Paradigm have questioned (we
have their letter on file)(78-7) the application of the Hillis Paradigm for application

(78-7) This letter suggests that “…applying the paradigm to
eastside forests with typical open forest cover types…would be
imprudent without first doing some formal review with local
biologists and researchers familiar with the unique harvest
situations on the eastside.” To that end, the parameters in
Alternative B were developed with MFWP and reflect the
broader collaborations outlined in MFWP and USDA Forest
Service (2013) to which Jack Lyon contributed (See that
document, contributors section).

(78-8) The Forest Plan amendment, Alternative B, includes a

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 445

Comments
in the Divide Travel Plan area, yet the Hillis Paradigm is the premise for
Amendment Alternative B. The proposed application is does not reflect current
scientific knowledge on elk response to hunting pressure nor all-terrain vehicles.
For example, Wisdom (2007 ) found elk displaced up to 0.93 miles from the
presence of an all-terrain vehicle, yet the Hillis Paradigm includes hunting security
areas as little as ½ mile from an open road or ORV trail. We note the authors of the
Hillis Paradigm caution that the Paradigm was developed only for densely vegetated
west-side Montana landscapes and cautioned its applicability to other landscapes.
The proposed application of the Hillis Paradigm becomes even less appropriate as
the forest becomes thinner due to tree mortality, which the Forest has acknowledged
has and continues to occur. Thus the effectiveness of a 250 acre patch size for elk
security is far less effective in thin or thinning stands of canopy when hunters can
see much further than the thickly multistoried stands of timber found on the Lolo
when the Paradigm was developed. Elk in thinner canopies also feel less secure,
move with less disturbance and move further distances away from disturbance (788).

Response to Comments
discussion of adjustments made to Alternative B to account for
eastside conditions. “Factors that increase the effectiveness of
security areas include large size, plentiful forest cover, minimal
trails and old roadways, rugged terrain, and heavy deadfall, and
so on. All of these factors may influence the ability of an area to
hold elk through the hunting season; through collaboration with
MFWP, the key component was determined to be size.
Accordingly, the minimum size of an “elk security area” was set
at 1,000 acres—considerably larger than the 250 acre minimum
recommended by Hillis et al. (1991) for “Westside” forests. This
is an adjustment for “eastside” cover conditions…” See
Alternative Description/Alternative B/Discussion.

We assert that lack of cover can be compensated only by increasing distance from
roads. That means only an Alternative that truly minimizes open roads and does so
to create large security areas can be effective. We find Alternative 2 fails to provide
sufficient elk security as well as does not minimize the Divide road system.
BHA Issue: Proposing a preferred alternative dependent on a yet unapproved forest
plan amendment is premature and does not comply with intent of NFMA nor
planning regulations. To meet law, policy, and direction we request either 1) the elk
security standards remain unaltered, or that, 2) before any Travel Plan (including the
current proposal) is developed, that any elk security amendment proposed utilizes
the knowledge of the West’s recognized independent elk scientists and use of the
most current elk science In other words, the current process has the cart before the
horse, and the process does not meet the National Forest Management Act, current
National Forest Planning Regulations nor NEPA.

BHA Issue: Of the two action alternatives, we find that Alternative 3 or 4 moves the
Divide Travel Plan area closer to meeting Helena Forest Plan direction, including
goals, objectives and standards than Alternative 2. We support Alternative 3 as the
better of the action alternatives, but believe all action alternatives are deficient in
meeting laws, regulations and the Helena Forest Plan’s goals, objectives and

We find the Preferred Alternative 2 in conflict with many aspects of the Forest Plan
as described in more detail below, and therefore another Alternative must be
developed/adopted to meet the current Forest Plan.
Appendix A- Forest Plan Direction
The Forest Plan includes direction for road and trail management and provides
important guidance for this project. Forestwide direction that is applicable to this
project includes:
Goal 15 (Forestwide II/2) –
Develop and implement a road management program with road use and travel
restrictions that are responsive to resource protection needs and public concerns
BHA Issue: We find that the direction to be “responsive to resource protection
needs” has not met. There has been no onsite analysis or trail condition survey of
user created trails selected for adoption into the transportation network in
Alternative 2, therefore the Forest cannot attest to whether these proposed routes
meet Forest Plan requirements, the Clean Water Act, bull trout, INFISH, nor
direction for impaired watersheds. A thorough analysis would specifically perform
onsite inspections and then describe how each route segment affects water quality
standards, riparian health nor site specific wildlife and fisheries effects. How will
user created routes not selected for adoption be treated to assure motorized travel
will cease and resource impacts from these disturbed areas be rehabilitated? (78-14)

(78-14)The addition of the roads to the Forest System was
analyzed as part of the effects analysis in the Hydrology
Resource Report and is discussed in the Environmental
Consequences section. The effects to water quality associated
with the adoption of unauthorized routes are minimal for each
action alternative and are offset by the potential of future road
decommissioning afforded by this decision. A route-by-route
analysis for roads added to the travel system is available in the
project record.

Forestwide Standards, Facilities –
Road Management (Forestwide II/3132) the criteria to be used for road, trail or area
restrictions are safety, resource protection, economics, conflicting uses, facility
protection, public support, land management objectives.
BHA Issue: The Preferred Travel Plan Alt 2 ignores the needs for visitor safety,
facility protection and economics when the preferred (Alt 2) transportation network
is larger than the expected maintenance budget. This plan appears to invite Forest
users to use a network that will have inadequate maintenance on most of its routes.
The resulting deteriorated condition is contradictory to this Standard with regard to
issues of safety and resource protection. This Forest’s preferred alternative appears
to invite Forest users to use an expanded transportation network that will not have
adequate maintenance on most of its routes, which is certain to contain safety
hazards and create additional resource impacts(78-19).
BHA Issue: We object to the concept that this DEIS does not identify roads for
decommissioning and will require yet another NEPA process before initiating any
decommissioning (DEIS summary page 1). Road closure prescriptions are
connected actions to this travel plan effort and must be displayed in this process. An
analogy is a timber sale NEPA decision that states logging will occur, but the
silvicultural treatment prescriptions will require a separate NEPA decision. Given
the size of a separate NEPA task, it is unlikely many roads affected by this travel
plan will have proper treatment if a separate NEPA process is required (78-20).

(78-20)Thank you for your input.

(78-21) Refer the Hydrology and Soils specialist report.
The Divide Travel plan only determines open and close status of
routes. Future site specific analysis will be completed to
determine closure methods.

The pubic cannot assess how effective a closure might be in both restricting
motorized travel, but also whether a roadway will serve as a hunter conduit, thus
reducing the effectiveness of big game security.

Without decommissioning the merely “closed” roads is contradictory to watershed
and soils objectives, as they remain as substantial risks to failure or chronic bleeding
sediment We believe most year-long closed roads should be decommissioned,
unless there is an ongoing or scheduled project. Cost of decommissioning is less
than properly maintaining a “closed” road over a short few years. Decommissioned
roads will also have less sediment, less risk to failure, far fewer motorized
violations, less fragmentation of wildlife habitat and will no longer serve as
effective conduits of hunters and others into secure elk security areas (78-21).
BHA Issue: Preventing or enforcing illegal and renegade travel on roads simply
gate closed to motorized use is also difficult to enforce, as they are easy conduits for
motorized vehicles, even if a gate or other single closure device is in place. They
could intersect other motorized routes which allow motorized users to physically
access an otherwise “stored” road. Stored roads are easy conduits to enable nonmotorized hunter’s easy access into otherwise secure big game habitats. By serving
as walking, mountain biking or horse travel conduits, closed roads reduce the
effectiveness of elk security. We request all roads proposed for “closure” be instead
planned for decommissioning unless a scheduled project needing the road is on the
planned project schedule, and that the road use be conditional on decommissioning
once the project is completed(78-22).

capability and hunting opportunity. To provide for a first week bull elk harvest that
does not exceed 40 percent of the total bull harvest, roads will be managed during
the general big game hunting season to maintain open road densities with the
following limits.
The existing hiding cover to open road density ratio should be determined over a
large geographic area, such as a timber sale analysis area, a third order drainage, or
an elk herd unit.

4b. Elk calving grounds and nursery areas will be closed to motorized vehicles
during peak use by elk. Calving is usually in late May through mid-June and nursery
areas are used in late June through July.
BHA Issue: Elk calving grounds and nursery areas have not been mapped nor
addressed as how this Travel Plan protects these as directed (DEIS p 256) in the
Forest Plan. There is no indication nor documentation the Forest used available
knowledge or data in determining where calving and nursery areas are known to
occur. Did the Forest consult or specifically request such calving or nursery site
specific information from MDFWP or local forest users?(78-26) We are certain
that some such information is available, but this Standard is dismissed with the
above blanket response. Calving areas are usually associated with certain elevations
and openings or thinner canopies, and nursery areas are commonly associated with
wetter or mesic meadow habitats. Even if there is some variability in specific use
areas from year to year, known areas “will be closed during peak use”. Even minor
human use during key use times likely displaces elk from these biologically
preferred areas. The Forest Service routinely has road or route closures for wet
road conditions, snowmobiling conflicts, avalanche hazards, and even winter ranges,
even though conditions favorable to those conflicts do not occur each and every
year. This Standard requires that this travel plan project close such known calving
and nursery areas during the expected elk use times. If the Forest cannot assimilate
and apply site specific known calving and nursery information, it is appropriate to
close all associated habitat types and conditions favorable to calving and nursery
until such elk use maps can be developed. In addition, prior and existing motorized
use may have displaced elk from their traditional calving or nursery areas therefore
likely habitats or previously used calving and nursery areas must be given priority
for removing motorized uses.

Elk Security”.)
(78-25)Alternative B, as developed for the final EIS, reflects this
comment by defining elk security as “a proportion of an elk herd
unit within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger
District that consists of an area of at least 1000 acres in size that
is at least ½ mile from a motorized route open to the public
between 9/1 and 12/1” (See Alternative Description/Alternative
B).
(78-26)Alternative 5, modified, includes road closures that will
protect elk calving and nursery areas that were identified through
the public comment process (See Draft ROD).

(78-27)This issue is discussed in the Wildlife Background Report
along with steps being taken to protect these habitat components
on elk summer range (p. 47-49, 162-163). Alternatives vary in
the degree to which they subtract motor routes from these sites
(p. 164-165). Specific examples are provided in the sections on
“Local Effects in Key Areas” (p. 242-282).

BHA Issue: Christensen, et al (1993) state that key summer range elements are
“Wet drainage heads, saddles, riparian habitats, shadowed draws with cool air
movement, and wet meadows are some examples of special features. In many areas
these features support a disproportionate level of elk use and contribute significantly
to overall elk use of a larger area. Generally, these sites are highly desirable for
forage, water, temperature regulation, movement, or a combination. Such sites
should be recognized and protected in prescriptions that deal with elk summer range
(emphasis added).”(78-27) Because the Helena indicates they do not have more
refined calving and nursery areas identified site specifically, all proposed motorized
routes must be screened for the above habitat features and closed during late spring
and summer to comply with Standard 4b.
DEIS Summary p 38. “Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks data
indicate that elk populations in the Divide landscape are either at or near population
objectives of the Montana Elk Plan (2004) for the last several years for most of the
HDs; or that management challenges are only partially habitat related. That is, elk
security is adequate in many HDs. The FP standard is not an accurate indicator of
elk security.”
BHA Issue: Many of the FWP Hunting Districts included in the Travel Plan area
are composed of substantial percentage of private lands closed to most public
hunters. Although these private lands defacto serve as hunting security, it is
inappropriate to construe that elk security is adequate on the Forest proper. The
Forest, to meet its responsibility for land stewardship and public land hunting, (7828) is responsible for providing adequate elk security within the boundaries of the
Forest. The analysis of current elk security conditions do not convey that the
current elk security definition is “outdated” as stated in the DEIS (Summary p 37),
but simply that the Helena Forest has not managed the transportation network to
provide enough elk security. Proposing to adopt a 20 year old untested Hillis
Paradigm as the appropriate elk security science is unjustified and unprofessional.

Response to Comments
(78-28)The Forest Plan amendment recognizes that private land
poses management challenges for elk “[s]everal studies found
that elk may find more complete security during hunting seasons
by moving to private lands that restrict hunter access or prohibit
hunting which limit is MFDWP ability to manage herd sizes
through harvest” (as an example). (See the National
Environmental Policy Act/Comparison of
Alternatives/Discussion section). The amendment also includes
a discussion of the management challenges faced within the
respective hunting districts within which the Divide Travel plan
occurs (See the section Factors Influencing Elk Management).
Furthermore, the intent of Alternative B is to “reduce elk
displacement from public land prior to normal migration events.
This addresses a primary management goal for MFWP:
maintaining or enhancing elk presence on National Forest
System lands so that elk are available to the hunting public on
public land”. (See the National Environmental Policy
Act/Comparison of Alternatives/Discussion section).
(78-29)In response to public comments, the Forest Plan
amendment incorporated additional data and discussion relative
to bull/cow ratios and other metrics MFWP utilizes to measure
bull survival post-harvest. See the sections Factors Influencing

elk populations in the travel planning area above FWP objective? What proportion
of the Divide Travel Plan area elk stay on the Forest throughout the hunting season
or and what proportion get pushed to private lands closed to the general hunting
public? What concurrence did the Forest receive from MDFWP that all elk herds in
the Travel Plan Area meet elk objectives established by MDFWP?(78-29)
DEIS Summary p 38. “In conclusion, Forest Plan big game standard #4a,
inaccurately depicts the nature of elk security in the Divide landscape, is insensitive
to changing road densities, and places unnecessary and impractical constraints on
travel management. Meanwhile, the more recently developed elk security area
methodology provides a reasonably accurate picture of elk security across the
landscape, is responsive to proposed changes in open road patterns, and correctly
directs management to areas that need further attention.
BHA Issue: We dispute that hunting security “insensitive to changing road
densities” and is less important because elk numbers are at or above objective n
some hunting districts. Lyon (1963) long ago established the relationship of road
density to elk habitat use. Our BHA hunters find elk moving to private lands even
during the archery season as a result of dissected or fragmented habitats, hunting
pressure and disturbance from excessive motorized access.(78-30)
BHA Issue: The Forest has failed to document the “inaccuracy” of the nature of elk
security as expressed in the current elk security standard. Why was this Standard
the best available science when adopted (with supporting published papers) when
the Forest Plan was developed but is now inaccurate? How is the Hillis Paradigm
more accurate, given it was developed for heavily vegetated continuous canopy
conditions and the authors caution about its applicability elsewhere? We strongly
disagree with these conclusions. We also disagree that 4a places “unnecessary and
impractical constrains on travel management” Given that the Helena has presented
Alternative 3 as a viable alternative demonstrates the Helena could easily make

Response to Comments
(78-30)The Forest Plan amendment provides the rationale as to
why Standard 4a is insensitive to changing road densities. The
analysis does not negate the relationship between road densities
and elk distribution; rather it points out that despite the several
miles of road closures, several herd units continue to be below
Standard 4a regardless of changes in open road densities that
would clearly benefit elk. See the Comparison of
Alternatives/Alternative A/Discussion section.

(78-31)Alternative B was developed for the FEIS to address
these comments. Patch size was increased from 250 to 1000
acres to account for the more open terrain on ‘eastside’ forests.
Hunting season was extended to include the archery season.
Cover guidelines have been included. Alternative B is in
keeping with the Hillis paradigm in that it “strict adherences to
the guidelines” was avoided. Alternative B reflects collaborative
discussions with MFWP biologists and other Forest Service
personnel (See U.S. Forest Service and Montana Department of
Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Collaborative Overview and
Recommendations for Elk Habitat Management on the Custer,
Gallatin, Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests).
Furthermore, the analysis conducted for an alternative considered
but not fully developed indicated that even if the Forest could
close all roads over which it had jurisdiction, one herd unit would
continue to remain out of compliance with Standard 4a. The
other 2 herd units (currently below Forest Plan thresholds) that
would come into compliance with Standard 4a would require
most, if not all, of the roads in the respective herd unit to be
closed from 9/1 to 12/1 precluding any other Forest uses during
that time. See the Comparison of Alternatives/Alternative

progress in meeting the 4a standard without being “unnecessary and impractical”.
There is no analysis nor concurrence by the Hillis Paradigm authors that this
methodology is applicable to the Helena National Forest vegetative or topographic
conditions. (78-31) There is no discussion of other elk security methodology in this
DEIS that may be more applicable to Helena conditions. We have listed a few of
the more recent elk security related papers which should have been analyzed and
addressed as part of any elk security amendment process that are more current than
the 20+ year old Hillis Paradigm. The evidence that substantial numbers of elk
move onto private lands early in hunting seasons demonstrates that current elk
security is inadequate in the Divide Travel Plan area.
BHA Issue: The DEIS fails to acknowledge the importance of on-Forest elk and elk
carcasses to TES listed grizzly bears, soon-to- be listed wolverine, other sensitive
species and other large carnivores as well some birds of prey. Retaining large
numbers of elk on the Forest during most of the year also provides retention of this
important prey/food base for these species that otherwise follow the prey/food to
private lands where potential conflicts with livestock and other private land uses are
higher. Such important connection of elk to other species must be evaluated in the
biological assessment for these listed species, and must weigh heavily on selection
of a final alternative. We request an analysis of the connectedness between the
retention of elk on the Forest and the benefits to the grizzly bears, wolverines, other
large carnivores and some birds of prey. (78-32)

A/Discussion section.
(78-32)The Wildlife Background Report discusses, in a number
of places, the issue of off-Forest elk, both on winter range and on
private land refuges during the hunting season (see p. 49-51, 5758, 74). We feel that this is not a problem for large carnivores
for a couple reasons. First, wolves, bears, wolverines and other
predators/scavengers will readily follow big game animals into
the kinds of off-Forest habitats that support them during the
winter and hunting season. A large proportion of the sightings of
these carnivores in this area have been in off-Forest areas.
Secondly, the number of elk that remain on the Forest and that
are killed by hunters and predators, or that die of natural causes,
is more than sufficient to supply the relatively small number of
large, wide-ranging carnivores in the Divide landscape with
carrion (see, for example, Wildlife Background Report, p. 103104).

(78-33)Thank you for your input, This objective of this analysis
is to identify the transportation system necessary for management

our members is large scale frustration with the lack of effective enforcement of
current and past Helena Forest Travel Plans. Motorized closures are regularly
breached understating the negative effects of motorized uses on natural resources
and non-motorized Forest users. Violators are rarely prosecuted. We request the
NEPA process document the historic and realistically expected non-compliance of
this proposed travel plan and project the effects of expected non-compliance
throughout the NEPA resource effects analysis. We request FEIS documentation of
historical recorded travel plan related motorized violation complaints compared to
convictions or bond forfeitures resulting from these complaints (78-33).
BHA Issue: It is imperative to significantly reduce travel plan non-compliance. It is
imperative that travel planning decisions assess and document enforceability of each
road system treatment before deciding on the transportation network. Trailhead
locations, intersections of non-motorized and motorized routes, vegetative cover
type along motorized routes are some key analysis features that should be
considered before a motorized network is developed. “Implementation of the travel
plan will be coordinated with FWP post decision and prior to and during
implementation” does not assure an enforceable transportation network. Waiting to
engage enforcement expertise until after the travel plan decisions have been made
makes enforcement more difficult if not impossible. We do not believe the intent of
this standard is met if enforcement coordination does not take place prior to
decisions. Therefore we request field level enforcement personnel of both FS and
FWP be directly engaged and submit site specific recommended enforcement
considerations well before a final decision has been made. According to our
research, FWP enforcement agents have not been consulted to date on site specific
proposal (78-34).
BHA Issue: Loop trails are known to lead to considerably more motorized use with
expected higher maintenance costs and resulting in greater conflict with resource
objectives, higher maintenance costs in an era of declining maintenance budgets,
and non-motorized users. If existing user created routes are considered for adoption
as part of the loop, it is doubtful if these user created routes meet Forest trail

location are all requirements when constructing a new trail. We object to not having
these features in place when adopting a user created route. Declining budgets will
likely mean timely relocation or reconstruction to meet trail standards will not
occur. Only the continued or increased use and adverse resource impacts will
realistically occur. We object to adoption of user created routes until they are
reconstructed or relocated to protect watershed or riparian values. Have trail

Fisheries Standards
1. Maintain quality water and habitat for fish by coordinating Forest activities and
by direct habitat improvement (see Forest Wide Standards for riparian)
In Alternative 2 the DEIS p 204 alleges that fish habitat conditions would be
maintained or improved by closing only 13% of high risk roads. However this
alternative increases risk to fisheries by opening high risk roads in 3 sub watersheds.
Furthermore, 5 sub-watersheds would have an increase in stream crossings of
previously closed roads, thus putting their fisheries and downstream fisheries at risk.

routes that will require reconstruction, relocation or heavy maintenance with
expectations of a lower facility budget is irresponsible and not in compliance with
this standard. We simply do not believe it is reasonable that adopted trails will be
reconstructed, relocated or have heavy maintenance given the expected budget.
Each year that such trail work is not completed means fish habitat is damaged from
bleeding sediment and unimproved stream crossings. Elsewhere in this document,
the Forest states that available budgets will be prioritized on heavily used primary
roads, acknowledging that backcountry and user created motorized trails will not
receive necessary facility maintenance, reconstruction or relocation (78-36).
The Forest Plan directs that instream activities should allow for maximum
protection of spring and fall spawning habitats.
BHA Issue: INFISH Standards provide direction for roads within 300 feet of bull
trout and WST streams, however, such specific route segments within this 300 foot
distance are not displayed, nor resolution of the direction specified. Also the
sediment analysis must include all active channel crossing as delivery points, not
just stream crossings (78-37).
Watershed Guidance Standards
3. A project which causes excessive water pollution, undesirable water yield, soil
erosion, or site deterioration will be corrected where feasible, or the project will be
re-evaluated or terminated.

(78-37) The Affected Environment section of the Hydrology
Specialist Report reports the total number of sediment sources
observed for each alternative. These sediment sources include all
active channel crossings, as well as potential sediment delivery
locations observed on hydraulically connected road segments
adjacent to streams. The Hydrology Specialist Report now
analyzes the miles of road within the riparian habitat
conservation areas (RHCAs) specified by INFISH standards.

(78-38)The addition of the roads to the Forest System was
analyzed as part of the effects analysis in the Hydrology
Resource Report and is discussed in the Environmental
Consequences section. The user-created routes were evaluated by
determining the number of stream crossings and the mileage
within riparian habitat conservation areas that would be added to
the transportation system. The effects to water quality associated
with the adoption of unauthorized routes are minimal for each
action alternative and are offset by the potential of future road
decommissioning afforded by this decision.

BHA Issues: Adopting a user created motorized route is indeed a “project” because
the adoption of a previously illegitimate route is then classified as a designated route

facility with assumptions about future maintenance which will have potential
adverse impacts, depending on soils, location, and design for the facility. To meet
this standard, any user created route proposed for inclusion in the transportation
network requires an on-site analysis, including a site condition survey on potential
fisheries habitat effects before being adopted. We find that proposed adoption of
user created trails without site specific analysis as to how these routes meet resource
concerns are met in violation of Executive Order 11644, which states “Sec. 9.
Special Protection of the Public Lands. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 3 of this Order, the respective agency head shall, whenever he determines
that the use of off-road vehicles will cause or is causing considerable adverse effects
on the soil, vegetation, wildlife, wildlife habitat or cultural or historic resources of
particular areas or trails of the public lands, immediately close such areas or trails to
the type of off-road vehicle causing such effects, until such time as he determines
that such adverse effects have been eliminated and that measures have been
implemented to prevent future recurrence (78-38).

Response to Comments

(78-39) Thank you for your input, Divide Travel Plan analysis is
an open or closed decision process.

BHA Issue: We object to adoption of user created of routes because they have
disproportionately greater conflict with resource objectives, higher maintenance
costs in an era of declining maintenance budgets, and conflicts with non-motorized
users. If existing user created routes are considered for adoption, it is doubtful these
user created routes meet Forest trail standards for watershed protection nor riparian
protection. Trails grades, drainage features, stream crossing structures and location
are all considerations when constructing a new trail (FS Trail handbook), but are not
features considered or incorporated when adopting a user created route. Declining
budgets will likely mean suggested relocation or reconstruction to meet trail
standards will not occur. Only the use and associated resource impacts from that
continued use will realistically occur. To comply with EO 11644 we object to
adoption of user created routes until they are reconstructed or relocated to protect
watershed or riparian values, and meet trail or road design standards as well as water
quality standards... (78-39)

Plan will be implemented and what mitigation measure(s) will be

BHA Issue: Adoption of a user created route is defacto “construction” as it is added
as-is to the transportation network. This standard says that needed mitigation
actions will be prescribed. Those needs can only be identified if site specific
analysis of each route leg has a soil related onsite visit prior to adoption. Routes
adopted in sensitive soils, steep lands or located vertically on a slope are almost
impossible to mitigate soils, and only at great expense. According to the Forest,
those needed funds are not adequate and not projected to increase. We find it
irresponsible and in violation of this Standard to adopt user created routes without a
detailed analysis of how feasible resource mitigation may be. (78-40)
2. Areas of decomposed granite soils will be identified and erosion control measures

BHA Issue: Continued motorized use on motorized routes is a ground disturbing
activity, and therefore subject to the requirement to identify these route segments
and plan erosion control measures before these routes are included in the open
motorized route network. The DEIS response above indicates the Forest has not
given special attention to route selection based on sensitive soils. We believe at
least one alternative should analyze closing most non-essential routes in sensitive
soils to motorized use to meet Forest Plan direction, including this Standard. (78-41)

Forestwide Road Standards
1. Road construction and reconstruction will be the minimum density, cost, and
standard necessary for the intended need, user safety, and resource protection.

(78-43) See Alternative 5.

BHA Issue: The Divide travel plan proposes to adopt or maintain open travel routes
far in excess of realistic budget projections to maintain or reconstruct. It is realistic
to assume that with declining budgets that any reconstruction will be minimal and
road maintenance will decline. As a result the Forest must project that compliance
with the Streamside Management Zone law, Water Quality Best Management
Practices for Montana Forests, USDA National Best Management Practices for
Water Quality Management on National Forest Land will not be met with the
planned transportation network. To meet these laws, no additions to the
transportation system can be adopted; the final decision must reduce the
transportation network to the quantity that provides for proper reconstruction and
maintenance. (78-43)
Forestwide Road Management Standards
1. The Helena National Forest will generally be open to vehicles except for roads,
trails, or areas that may be restricted. (See Forest Visitor Map for specific

Tristate Off-Highway Vehicle Decision that motorized use will be restricted to roads

BHA Issue: The effectiveness of enforcement of travel plan restrictions has and

Standard requires before completion of this travel plan that the Forest Service
complete a site specific analysis of existing trail routes, as well as proposed adoption
of user created routes as it pertains to meeting Riparian Management Objectives.
The presence of a trail in the riparian area is subject to erosion, trail widening, wet
conditions, compaction, displacement of wildlife from a key habitat and subjects the
fish population to heavier fishing pressure. In some cases these streams could
support bull trout or westslope cutthroat, including spawning activity, for which a
300 foot RHCA would apply. A motorized trail encourages dispersed camping,
most commonly in a Riparian Habitat Conservation Area, and therefore is subject to
site specific designation or other enforceable controls to meet Riparian Management
objectives. (78-49)

BHA Issue: Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. CDNST National
Management direction discourages motorized use with some exceptions. One
constraint on that direction is that such type of motorized use must have occurred
prior to trail designation which occurred in 1978. Therefore, unless the Forest can
demonstrate that the trail had the same type of motorized use in 1978, it cannot be
allowed now. 1978 is prior to ATVs so only motorcycles could be considered to
meet this direction and only if they do not impair the purpose of the Trail. The
CDNST trail for the most part is along ridgetops which is the most adverse location
to elk security as it allows motorized hunters to access the drainage heads which are
preferred habitat for elk. Motorized use along this trail system disproportionately
displaces elk from drainage heads as their preferred summer habitats. Therefore the
only treatment of the Trail as proposed in Alternative 3 is appropriate. However,
eliminating all motorized use should be considered as best meeting CDNST
direction.(78-51)

DEIS Appendix D Cumulative Effects
DEIS Appendix D- Proposed Elk Security Amendment
The Helena has some quality backcountry such as the Scapegoat and parts of the
Elkhorn mountains. However, most of the few remaining secure, undeveloped parts
of the Helena within the Divide Travel Plan area are unroaded simply because they
are overly steep, rocky and otherwise unproductive for both timber and elk. Studies
of elk habitat selection document that elk, like people, select for gentler terrain and
spend little time on terrain over 30% slopes. However, much of the lower, gentler,
and often most productive elk habitats of the Helena have been roaded; have been
laced by ORV routes, or both. In the last 25 years the problem has been exacerbated
by a proliferation of off road vehicle routes, both authorized and unauthorized
renegade routes. In addition the frequent and extensive violations of existing
motorized restrictions render much of the Helena’s most productive elk habitats
seriously compromised, particularly when need to serve as secure habitats during the
hunting seasons.

Response to Comments

The Helena’s elk security habitat condition now is largely dissected and often
marginally or insufficiently small during both the archery and general hunting
seasons. This deteriorated security condition has adverse impacts on elk security
now and likely will have even worse effects in the future. Hunters on the Helena are
already experiencing major displacement of elk from public lands onto private
lands, where general hunter access is most often denied. This is a problem not
unique to the Helena, as it is already a documented phenomenon on the BeaverheadDeerlodge, the Gallatin and the Lewis and Clark Forests. An example of the
behavioral response of elk to human disturbance was well documented in Montana
by Grigg (2007), who documented elk moving from the roaded Taylor Fork to the
private Sun Ranch early in the archery season. Similar movements have been
documented elsewhere, including the Bitterroot National Forest. Movements early
in the archery season are also occurring within this travel plan analysis area. In
addition, mature bulls, a favorite hunter pursuit, are increasingly a smaller
percentage of the herd due to lack of security on public lands. A mature bull
component is important to breeding and breeding timing that results in calves
mature enough to survive their first winter. Without protecting and enhancing
hunting security, the existing 5 week general season will trend toward more permitsonly hunting or shortened seasons, or both. The Elkhorns area, for example, has
mature bulls, but also a very limited number of permits.
BHA Issue: Control of herd numbers can only occur with hunting if cow elk remain
on public lands throughout the hunting season to facilitate adequate harvest.
Displacement of cow elk to private lands during the hunting season is already
occurring and seriously reduces effective population control capability by MDFWP.
This situation of elk displacement from the Forest to private lands explains much of
why some elk herd units are above objective, rather than the conclusion by the
Forest that present security is adequate. The response by responsible land managers
to these elk related issues must be to enhance, rather than lessen the quantity and
quality of secure elk habitat, especially in the Divide Travel Plan area. We believe
that Helena land managers have ample opportunity as well as the obligation to

restore large scale elk security areas (78-52).
BHA Issue: The importance of elk security during archery seasons cannot be
understated. Often public land elk have been displaced to private lands by archery
hunting activities even before general elk seasons have begun as documented on the
MDFWP studies on the Gallatin National Forest (Grigg, 2007). Furthermore,
Forest Service studies of elk in the Blue Mountains of Oregon (Wisdom, et al, 2005)
have documented by telemetry under carefully controlled conditions that elk are
displaced as far as .93 miles by the presence of motorized vehicles. Simply, all road
closures related to wildlife habitat must commence no later than September 1.(7853)
BHA Issue: The Helena has inappropriately chosen to focus on the Hillis Paradigm
as guidance to managing elk security on the Forest in the future, under a proposed
Forest Plan Elk Security Amendment. However, the values used and its application
to the Helena is un-validated and lacks scientific scrutiny. This concept lacks any
scientific validation as to the adequacy of the patch size (250 acres) or the distance
from motorized routes (1/2 mile). The Hillis Paradigm, never validated, was
developed for Westside Forest conditions, primarily the Lolo. The Lolo’s elk
habitats are for the most part, much more continuous canopy, and thicker,
multistoried canopies often with a dense, high underbrush understory of such shrubs
as alder, mountain maple, and ninebark. By contrast, the Helena forests are
generally discontinuous, are dominated by single story, open, dry forests with very
low understories. The Lolo’s terrain is also generally much steeper and dissected.
We conclude it is inappropriate use of elk vulnerability science to adopt the Hillis
Paradigm without specific validation for the Helena.(78-54)
The ½ mile-250 acre patch criteria discounts the reality that significant numbers of
elk hunters do indeed walk more than ½ mile from a road (a 10 minute walk on easy
terrain) and would displace from a 250 acre patch ( about 1/3 square mile) in less
than an hour. We believe if you tell a serious elk hunter there is a 250 acre patch of
unbroken timber habitat only ½ mile from a road, many, if not most, would

willingly walk to such “secure” elk habitat. Blanket application of the Hillis
Paradigm also fails to consider the presence of old roadbeds, trails or gentle terrain
common to the Helena which facilitates easier and quicker travel to a cover patch.
In summary, we conclude the Hillis Paradigm is overly simplistic, un-validated and
inappropriate for the Helena to use as a big game vulnerability standard.
BHA Issue: Wisdom (2007) found elk avoiding the presence of off road vehicles
up to nearly a mile away.(78-55) What validation has occurred to demonstrate that
most elk remain in Divide Travel Plan area cover patches only ½ mile away (Hillis
Paradigm) from the presence of motor vehicles during the hunting season? What
has the Helena done to demonstrate the quality of elk security given the terrain
features present or lack thereof, vertical relationship of open roads to the cover
patch, ease of access by hunters due to open vegetation or old road prisms, or the
density of the cover patch?
BHA Issue: The Forest has acknowledged the Forest is thinning due to insects,
disease, and other factors. The forest canopy is also discontinuous with many
natural non-forested openings. In addition some poor regeneration in previously
harvested and thinned forest stands has further reduced large patches of heavy
multistoried cover. Christensen et al (1993) indicate that cover analysis is justified
when “Today, detailed analyses of hiding and thermal habitat components are not
considered as essential except in habitats with high natural levels of openings or
where conifer cover is at a premium”. Given that the Divide Travel Plan area fits
this description of “high natural levels of openings or where conifer cover is at a
premium” we request a thorough analysis of hiding and thermal cover as it relates to
elk hiding cover. We would expect that any patch attributable to elk security during
hunting season to be examined as to its cover composition. What criteria is used in
describing elk cover and how was it analyzed and applied to each potential cover
patch?(78-56)

with state agency personnel in using models such as the Hillis Paradigm.

intermittent refuge areas by Alternative’). That analysis
indicates that hiding cover percentages are greater than 80% in
all security areas combined for all Travel Plan alternatives. The
figure ‘Distribution of Forest Plan Hiding Cover in the Divide
Travel Plan area’ illustrates this. The section Potential Elk
Security describes potential cover which includes existing hiding
cover and areas capable of providing hiding cover that currently
do not. That analysis indicates that most of the security areas
have realized their potential for providing hiding cover through
the availability of existing cover (See table ‘Acres of existing and
potential hiding cover in security areas for Alternatives 1 and 5’).
The section ‘Hiding Cover Methodology’ describes how hiding
cover is identified, measured, and mapped in the project area.

relationship of hunter access, elk security, and elk mortality.
“Basile and Lonner (1979) reported that when vehicular travel
was restricted, hunters spent more time walking, saw more elk,
and had greater success which may have been a function of elk
staying in the area longer and in greater numbers due to the travel
restrictions. Unsworth and Kuck (1991) noted that road closures
may have varied effects on animal distribution and hunter use

Montana, there appears to be a gradient from west to east regarding the significance
of cover in this equation. In northern Idaho, it appears that open road density, hunter
numbers, and topographic roughness are the major considerations (Unsworth and
others 1993). Cover is so ubiquitous that security can be controlled with road
management alone. As you move east into Montana and over the Continental
Divide, cover considerations become more important because cover is less abundant
and less contiguous. It is extremely important for forest biologists to work with their
State counterparts in developing criteria for security areas, including their size,
extent, distance from roads, and vegetative characteristics. Data from radio
telemetry studies are the best source for developing such criteria”. Therefore we
request the Helena provide the radio telemetry data or other validation of the Hillis
Paradigm for use in the Divide Travel Plan area.(78-57)

Response to Comments
and success. They cite to several studies where road closures
allowed elk to remain in more preferred sites for longer periods
of time which in turn affected elk mortality by providing easier
access to hunters (Irwin and Peek 1979). This may be because
elk and hunters were more likely to be in the same places – i.e.
areas of low open road densities (Millspaugh et al. 2000).” See
the section Alternative Description/Alternative B/Discussion.

BHA Issue: Most experienced elk hunters know where the remaining elk security is
within the Divide Travel Plan area. Any patch of timber less than a mile from a
road or ATV trail will have hunters in that habitat nearly every day during the
season. It is our estimate that a solo hunter can hunt thru a 250 acre patch of cover
(1/3 square mile) in less than an hour and likely move most or all elk from this cover
patch, especially when other cover is not contiguous to the 250 acre patch. How
many times and at what frequency is an elk herd disturbed before it seeks private
land? Based on the eastside forest Grigg study, this threshold occurred in the
Taylor Fork during the archery season and before general season even began. As
the Forest chooses to manage elk security at minimum threshold levels, elk
increasingly are crowded into these remaining “secure” areas, which concentrate
hunting pressure into these areas as well. What is the effect of crowding both elk
and hunters into the same “secure” areas? In addition, what is the hunting
experience for those hunters who value or seek solitude, and do not seek to compete
for getting to these secure areas before other hunters? What validation has the
Helena done to demonstrate that elk stay within a 250 acre isolated patch when
hunters seek elk in the same patch?(78-58)

(78-59)The Forest Plan amendment includes an analysis of elk
security if all Forest Roads were closed. That analysis indicates
shows that the largest patch size in that scenario would be
approximately 38,000 acres. The smallest is ~1000 acres and the
majority are less than 10,000 acres. In other words, the Forest
does not have sufficient jurisdiction to close enough roads to
create security patches that are between 25,000 and 50,000 acres
in the Divide landscape. See the table ‘Elk Security During the
Hunting Season (9/1 – 12/1) Assuming All Forest Roads are
Closed’. Additional data are in the project record.

the majority of elk stay on the Forest thru the general hunting season, or until driven
to private land due to snow depth on the Forest. Simply, there are far too many
motorized routes open on Helena, with little attention to insuring there are sufficient
numbers of large blocks of secure elk habitat on productive lands within the Helena.
The open nature of the Helena National Forest strongly suggests that the Forest
should manage for non-motorized landscapes, rather than patches of cover at
minimum distances from open roads to be successful in retaining elk on the Forest
throughout the hunting season...

Response to Comments

BHA Issue: Given the natural openings, declining density of many forest patches,
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers advocates the Helena establish 25,000-50,000
acre blocks of good elk habitat free of motorized routes during both the archery and
general hunting seasons. This size of motor-free block of secure habitat is necessary
to assure the center of such a block is at least 3 miles from the nearest open road.
We advocate that all Roadless Areas be non-motorized, and can serve as core areas
for which these larger security areas can be assimilated by closing and in many
cases decommissioning roads and motorized routes.(78-59)
BHA Issue: We believe the coordination of road management in this Travel Plan
must extend beyond the immediate Travel Plan area. For example and open,
surfaced road approaches the Bison creek area from the south via the Deerlodge NF,
which dissects an otherwise large security block including the Little Blackfoot.
Hunters are able to access the ridge separating Bison Creek headwaters and the
Little Blackfoot drainage easily this way. (78-60)
Also the Kading Ridge is key to how elk can use the Spotted Dog WMA. Closing
all motorized routes along the Kading ridge complex during hunting season and
restricting snowmobile use would allow elk to move freely toward Spotted Dog
WMA without unnecessary risk of displacement to other late fall habitats on private
lands.
Montana Backcountry Hunters and Anglers urge the Forest to improve this Travel

(79-1) Thank you for your comment.

My children are 4th generation Montanans with a long history of enjoying quiet
hikes and trail rides in Western and Central Montana. We do appreciate the effort
that Ranger DeGeest has proposed to manage Sweeney Creek as a non-motorized
area.
There are some very important lands that need non-motorized protection to help
provide a very important corridor connecting vital wild lands for wildlife. These
same areas will also need protection for the quiet hiking and horse use that is so
important to my family.
I endorse protecting the Nevada Mountain wild lands with Alternative #3. In
addition the Little Blackfoot road less land along the CDT corridor begs for nonmotorized protection. This together with year around non-motorized protection
extended along the CDT corridor to Mullen Pass will provide a marked benefit for
wild life and provide a special place for nourishing the quiet trail values of hikers,
hunters, and equestrians.
Thank you for your consideration.

To Whom It May Concern:
I would like to comment on the Divide Travel Plan.
I know you will be getting a lot of non‐motorized comments and I am on the other
side of the issue.
There are thousands of miles of hiking trails in our wilderness areas. Montana is
way behind most other states when it comes to developed OHV trails!!
I represent a group of 50 avid ATV riders whose average age is about 70. They are
beyond the age of hiking and like to experience the woods with an ATV being the
only way they can.
We see more and more trails closed all the time and I am promoting extended
development for motorized use.
There is room for hiking and ATV usage but the Wilderness people just want all the
motorized access closed which is not right and not what the majority of Montana
folks really want to see happen. They are a vocal minority with more than enough
hiking trails already.

Dear District Ranger Heather DeGeest,
Welcome to your new post and thank you for rehabilitating vehicle damage in
Sweeney Creek as a proposed non-motorized area. I am very hopeful that you will
extend this quiet area to the Continental Divide Trail corridors.
As a prospective thru-hiker and father of a hiker I urge you to fully protect the
Continental Divide Trail and surrounding wildlands by adopting Alternative #3. It is
so important to the wilderness experience and the preservation of this national
treasure, to extend non-motorized, year-round protection to these corridors. Of
special concern are:
MacDonald-Priest Pass,
Priest to Mullan Pass,
All Little Blackfoot Roadless Lands,
Nevada Mountain wildlands along the CDT.
Since alternative #3 is the only alternative based on a collaborative winter
agreement endorsed by the Montana Snowmobile Association, Montana Fish
Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Wilderness Association, it makes the most
sense for all users (82-1).

I'm from a group of friends and family who are avid hikers. We have a priceless trail
in our state, part of a greater whole called the Continental Divide Trail. It isn't just a
few feet of trail that needs to be protected but the surrounding lands that support the
wildlife and wild experience. Please adopt the Alternative #3 which is about nonmotorized use (85-1). The integrity of the land itself and of the animals who live

Dear Sir or Madam,
At this point you are probably getting sick of receiving letters from me, which you
have been hopefully reading. I am just trying to make it clear to you all the
significance of Montana wild lands. I write this on behalf of the millions of
wilderness lovers across our nation and the world, all of the interconnected species
that call these places home, and on behalf of the mission and visions of the likes of
Bob Marshall and Aldo Leopold. What few places we have that remain somewhat
wild are the most valuable resource we have in this world. It is critical that we
preserve what remains wild. I ask you to support the designation of the proposed
Electric Peak Wilderness and Nevada Mountain Wilderness.

Hello sirs
Nevada mountain, the headwaters of the Little Blackfoot and the general continental
divide area in the Helena forest should NOT be considered for additional snow
mobile use. No plans have allowed use where it is now being considered.
Nevada mountain must remain as a year around roadless area (90-1).
This is important area for wildlife habitat, and one of the few undisturbed
landscapes.
Water is every day becoming a more precious resource, and continued

Re: Draft Continental “Divide” Travel Plan and Draft Environmental Impact
Statement
Dear Ranger Degeest,
My comments below are my personal observations. They are made independent of
my volunteer participation with the Montana Wilderness Association and the High
Divide Trails Partnership.
1) Thank you and the many Forest Service staff and contractors who have spent
thousands of hours over the last many years analyzing the many details of this forest
plan. For the most part I find the documents thorough, complete, and consistent. My
following comments are intended to improve and support forest travel plan.
2) Specifically, I support Alternative 3 because it balances the necessity of
providing transportation for forest management and recreation while simplifying the
number and categories of route restrictions It is a clear alternative (91-1).

(91-1)Thank you for your comment.

3) Alternative 3 can be improved by clarifying the where motorized over the snow
travel is authorized to occur Please restrict over the snow travel in and near the
inventoried roadless areas (IRA). Why?(91-2)

(91-2) Refer to Alternative 5.

a. Encroachment in these areas is inadvisable from a winter wildlife perspective, e.g.
wolverines and Canadian lynx are impacted;(91-3)
b. A pre-existing negotiation including snowmobile clubs and conducted during the
Lincoln District Winter travel planning process agreed to restrict over the snow
travel in IRAs, especially in the Nevada Mountain area. This agreement was to carry

(91-3) Effects of snowmobiles on lynx and wolverines are
discussed in respective sections of the Wildlife Background
Report (p. 98, 102, 193-201, 204-207) and in equivalent Wildlife
sections in the FEIS. All action alternatives reduce the potential
for snowmobile use in lynx habitat—areas also known to be
inhabitated by wolverines in winter.
(91-4)Thank you for your input.

over into the Helena District Winter Travel plan for the Nevada Mountain Area (914).
c. We cannot predict the future of how over the snow designs will develop and what
capability they will have. An increase in motorized capability of over the snow
vehicles should not grant access to sensitive areas, just like owning a fast car does
not allow one to speed- For clarity, please make the off-limits for motorized travel
in IRA be the same in winter and summer, granting the possibility for small, well
known exceptions. The more seasonally and geographically consistent the plan is
the easier it will be to understand and enforce.(91-5)
a. I support the trail closures to the west and south of Kading Campground.
Especially the closure of the Kading Grade trail (heavily eroded) and the trail behind
the Kading cabin which continues to deteriorate each season. I support loop routes
north of Kading Campground (91-6). To keep ORV traffic off unauthorized routes
going south along the Kading ridge, the ridge access needs to be gated and posted
(91-7). Please see these pictures from 6/13/2009 where I documented the damage
behind at Kading Cabin, and ATV users pioneering an unauthorized route on the
ridge lines. This is a Google Picasa photo album:

4) Please know I support responsible, legal motorized travel where appropriate. I’ve
owned, raced, and traveled by motorcycles. Nevertheless, I support the closure of
Sweeney Creek to motorized use for a number of reasons.

(91-8) The value of lower Sweeney Creek as wildlife habitat is
discussed in the Wildlife Background Report (p. 271-274) and in
an equivalent section of the FEIS. Alternatives 3, 4, and 5
eliminate motorized use in this area.

a. Historical. The USGS name atlas and Helena National Forest Maps from the 1
970’s to 1990’s names this area as the Sweeney Creek Ecology Trail
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trails_of_Lewis_and_Clark_County,_Montana
). So when did the ecology trail become a motorized playground? Elk winter there A
natural wildlife route funnels from there up Sweeney Creek to the Divide. It serves
as an important buffer between Helena and the Continental Divide wildlands. On the
USGS map in 1985 there was one jeep trail No other trails (91-8).

b. Resource Damage. I’ve been to Sweeney Creek a couple of times to inspect the
area. On June 1, 2014. I spent 1.5 hours traveling along the southern fence line of
the Sweeney Creek area. I counted 10 unauthorized routes in a one mile area at the
southern boundary I saw at least 12 circuitous routes. Only one route was located so
it protected the trail bed. I documented four examples at this Google Picasa photo

c. Sweeney Creek Motorsports Park Having grown up riding motorcycles daily and
racing motorcycles throughout the summer, I am very familiar with how quickly and
to what extent motorized vehicles can damage an area. What I see in Sweeney Creek
is the establishment and expansion of a motorsport play area, but without any of the
boundaries that normally go along with such an area Building motorsport parks is
part of community planning, not forest travel planning activity. Communities solve
the need for motorized play through establishing a designated area and clear
boundaries. Spokane Washington, for example, has three areas dedicated to ORV
use. See them here on Google Maps. Notice the use pattern and how it is similar to
what is happening in Sweeney Creek.

d. No Limits. No Enforcement. One cannot rely on natural obstacles to limit
expansion of the unauthorized motorized use, because naturally these obstacles —
rocks, steep hillsides, fallen trees, etc. — are there to be overcome. Nature is not a
liming factor. Unauthorized routes will expand. Most motorized users do not selfpolice (how many motorized users turn other motorized users in for going off
route?) and by extension, do not realize the consequences of their actions. At the
first sign of a problem the motorized community might have borne the issue with
signage to educate the motorized community about balancing access with
responsible use. A motorized club sponsored sign or notice or boundary marker or
route marker — those did not happen. Now it is the Forest Service’s job to enforce.
If the bad actors are unaware and uneducated, or aware and unstoppable, then an
effective enforcement action is closing the area. Everyone gets the message about
unauthorized routes, while all still have access to designated routes (91-9).
5) Please consider working with the Prickly Pear Land Trust, the Wild Divide
Chapter of the Montana Wilderness Association, the City of Helena Parks and
Recreation, the Helena Bicycle Club, and the Lewis and Clark County recreation
planners to establish a non-motorized walking/biking trail from the heart of Helena
to the Continental Divide. I want the Queen City of the Rockies to have a direct link
to the Crown of the Continent. If there are routes proposed by commenters that will
work to connect our town to the back bone of the Continent and do it in such a way
to respect wildlife and quiet recreation values, please lend your support by opening
or closing trails to make a connecting route possible via Forest Service land. A route
is not proposed but some possibilities could be:
a. Mount Helena Ridge Trailhead to Lazyman Gulch and Ten Mile Recreation Area;
b. LeGrand Canyon Blvd along the water flume then crossing near Baxton Dale

6) Please consider the possibility of having all 75 miles of the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail roadless or at least on closed roads (91-11). I know this
sounds impossible given the number of roads the CDT follows in the Divide Travel
planning area, but I suggest the idea because it is worth inspiring others and aspiring
to making the CDT a gem in the Helena District I want hikers and visitors to say,
“Wow, that stretch around Helena was awesome!” rather than “Too many roads, too
many cars, could not wait to be past it.” Which, incidentally, I heard that once from
a thru-hiker, which was once too much for me. (May his water bladder leak just a
little and dampen his trail arrogance.)

Dear Forest Service,
I am writing regarding the recent draft of the Divide Plan, the beginning of your
agency's consideration of wild lands that mean a great deal to the Continental Divide
ecosystem and to our community. The protection of only 20 miles of 75 on the
Helena Ranger District is indefensible, as is the conclusion that motor vehicle use is
appropriate in these areas that clearly are best suited to protection from such human
consumption.
Please weight heavily the wildlife that live in the Nevada Mountain proposed
wilderness, the headwaters of the Little Blackfoot, the 2005 agreement regarding
winter use, the need to rehabilitate the lower Sweeney Creek areas, and any and all
of the natural characteristics of the lands affected by the plan. We recognize your
agency's daunting task of finding a balanced plan, but support any and all actions
you take to protect that which cannot be regained once lost. Please make the plan
what it should be ‐ a comprehensive, detailed plan of the best options for this
particular and unique area.

My name is Tom McDaniel and I wish to comment on the Continental Divide
Travel plan. I live at 7235 Priest Pass Road in the Sweeny Creek area. My property
borders USFS land on Priest Pass Rd. adjacent to the cattle guard and parking area
for forest users. I have lived at this location since June of 1985 or 29 years. Over
this 29 year period the USFS land has degraded severely due to over use by the
public.

Response to Comments

During the 1980s, ATVs were not as common and kelly humps prevented larger
vehicle from using old trails in the area. There were few roads. Deer, elk, and grouse
were abundant and occasionally you could see bear and moose. The only elk I have
seen in recent years in this area are carcasses brought in and dumped on USFS land.
The area has become a trash dumping area for furniture, TVs, computers, shingles,
nails, pallets, concrete, human waste, condoms, toilet paper, glass, tires etc.
Recently heavy equipment has been used to take boulders off USFS land. My sons
last year turned in a person using heavy equipment removing large living trees
which resulted in a conviction of the perpetrators. As a result of all the vehicle
traffic Knap weed, White Top, Canadian Thistle and other noxious weeds have
spread along every trail.
Spring is especially annoying when around 2:00 AM during rainy periods loud
trucks will race thru the meadows ripping up soil and thus spreading noxious weeds.
I have personally photographed people racing around and tearing up land and turned
these over to USFS law enforcement. One can find areas where a person has driven
their vehicle in circles tearing up the grasses.
Another activity taking place close to residential areas is the firing of large caliber
weapons. I was a firearms instructor and Special Agent of the FBI for 24 years and
know something about firearms safety. On one occasion while riding horseback
along a trail, individuals started shooting and limbs above my head were being
struck with rounds. My horse wasn't all that understanding. From my observations
many people shooting weapons on forest service land use no backstop for their
rounds to safely go into and it is just a question of time before someone is severely

injured or killed. Plus living in close proximity to the shooting makes not only our
livestock but us feel less than safe.

Response to Comments

The fire danger to area residence has increased drastically over the years with more
people camping out or having keggers where fires are just left to burn when the
party is over. We have reported numerous abandoned campfires in the area and have
been lucky that a major fire has not broken out in the area thanks in large part to the
quick response to forest fires by Baxendale, State Lands, and USFS personnel.
Weekends during the warmer months tend to have a lot of two cycle dirt bikes
racing not only on USFS land but up and down Priest Pass Rd. These vehicles are
going way over the speed limit on Priest Pass Rd but also are driving way too fast
for the safety of anyone who might want to ride a horse in the area. The dust being
kicked up is a health hazard as well.
The other major activity occurring every weekend is paint balling. To their credit the
participants have gotten better over the years about shooting at signs and on to
private property but in the past I have had a horse shot in head by paint ballers.
Every year new trails made by dirt bikes and other atvs appear on the forest lands.
The number of roads has gone from few to many some paralleling older trails just a
few feet away. This area is being severely abused and something needs to be done to
stop vehicle traffic of all types. I have an ATV and enjoy getting my firewood on
USFS property but I will gladly cease using a vehicle to end the destruction of this
area. I therefore request that Alternative Number 3 be adopted to ban motorized
vehicle use in the Sweeny Creek area yearlong (93-1).

Re: Continental divide Travel Plan
First, I would like to express my extreme disappointment and anger at the fact that
none of the travel plan “Alternatives” include increased, or even normal, access for
wheeled motorized vehicles. For us elderly citizens, and some handicapped younger
people I know, the Forest Service, in collusion with our US Government, is
effectively locking us out of our public lands. I hope one day the handicapped
access laws find their way into Forest Service “Regulations”!

provided and within those motorized routes there are different

Concerning the Continental Divide Travel Plan, I would like to add a comment in
favor of alternative #4.
Many areas in alternative 4 allow over-the-snow vehicles, but do not allow wheeled
vehicle access. I would prefer a plan with more wheeled vehicle access. Concerns
about such use could be mitigated in a manner that does not involve blanket
prohibiting. It seems like "travel prohibition" cannot be considered "travel
management". Prohibition is the easy way out and does not consider all those who
desire to access the land that their tax dollars are managing (99-1).

Our name is Ron and Kathy Stacey and would like to take a moment to comment on
the Continental Divide Travel Plan. We live at 7480 Priest Pass Rd in the Sweeny
Creek area and bought our land in June 1982 and built our house in 1988. Our land
borders USFS. The land has gone through many changes do to abuse from the
public. Once thriving with wildlife and great place to take picnics with family and
horse rides with a few roads in and out now looks like a junk yard with roads
everywhere do to ATVs, motor cycle, pickups that have causing erosion everywhere
. It has old couches, chair and garbage and just about anything you can imagine. We
have tried so many times to clean up but it is beyond anything we can do. They have
parties, meth labs, and free run with no regards to anyone or the land. Every
weekend in the summer the paint ballers have a get together. After many talks with
them and Law enforcement being called for shooting up signs and our neighbor’s
horses are shot they have gotten better. Every year we have so many run‐ins, with
motor cycles racing up our roads with no regards for safety, going through our
fences in back almost letting our horses out to get hurt. There were no trails they just
race through the forest and go where they like. The last time we road my horses
back there she picked up a nail. You have to be so careful and watch for of all the
junk. They use it for a dumping ground. This is a nonstop problem. Every year it
gets worse. The forest service made a fire line around the properties and that made a
great trail for the motor cycles. Every year we have people camping in no camping
areas having a fire with no water to put fires out. We have put fires out and called
Law Enforcement but they can’t be everywhere. It is a matter of time before we
have a fire. It is going to be a dry year and we all worry about a fire not to mention
the cost. I know we live in the forest and live with hunters with no problems, but
people drive in the back and shoot everywhere they want with no regards for safety.
It is just a matter of time before someone gets killed. This problem that is not going
to go away its just gets worse.
Every year you have motor vehicle making new roads and erosion is getting worse. I

Dear District Ranger DeGeest,
I am responding to the upcoming important decisions about the Helena NF District

In 1997 I hiked from MacDonald Pass, north to Waterton N.P. and passed through
the Nevada Mt. area and Priest Pass / Mullen Pass areas.
(101-1) Thank you for your input
Nevada Mt. was surprisingly scenic, pristine, and rugged. The in fact landscape
reminded me of an area in the Scapegoat Wilderness Area along Straight Creek.
Yes, I was surprised at the Wildness and quiet landscape, so close to home in
Helena.
(101-2) Thank you for your input
The Priest Pass/Mullen Pass areas were surprisingly pristine and quiet, once off the
intersecting roads. There are important bogs and wetland areas along the CDT to
Mullen Pass and a historic trail crossing over the railroad tunnel.
In 2011, I hiked with 2 friends, not solo this time, from MacDonald Pass south,
along the CDT to Chief Joseph Pass at the South end of the Bitterroot Valley.

Electric Peak was the top, scenic and pristine intact landscape from Helena to Butte.
Electric Peak has spectacular view of Helena NF and the Beaverhead-Deerlodge NF.
This area needs protection and was the highlight of walking the CDT from Helena to
Butte. (101-1)
There really needs to be buffer zones along the CDT in all the national forest.
Beaverhead-Deerlodge, Butte District has done a good job of creating, protecting,
maintaining a buffer corridor along the DCT south of Homestake pass to the
Highlands. (101-2)

This section of the CDT goes close to Butte subdivisions, but I never knew this
while I was on the thru-hike, only afterwards while returning to look for a pair of
lost sneakers! We need these corridors, buffers of protection along the CDT. (1013)
In 1997, I wanted to hike the CDT because it was in my backyard, and I know
people from all over the world would be coming to thru-hike, this magnificent idea
of the Continental Divide Trail, north-south across N. America. And I was right! I
have met thru-hikers from Washington, D.C., Italy, Finland and many other places
in the U.S. and Canada, while I was out hiking the CDT. We have a great world
resource in our back yard! I feel it as a privilege to protect, conserve, buffer, and
educate about the CDT.
Please fully protect the Continental Divide Trail, our backyard resource, and the
surrounding wildlands of the CDT areas by adopting Alternative #3 and the CDT
corridor protections. (101-4)

(102-1) Thank you for your input
I don't think it’s fair to be considering closing more roads in the HNF to motorized
users when we have no designated OHV areas in the Helena National Forest now,
outside of the tiny Sweeney Creek area, which is too small to even use, and is close
to residences who are complaining! The HNF should make some shared use trails
like they do in the Lewis and Clark NF. They managed to do it. There are plenty of
other OHV trails in the United States where the trail is open to all uses, with a
system of right-of-way. This Travel Plan should be considering the rights of all of
us. Wasn't the Forest ordered (in about 2008) to implement some TRAVEL PLANS
for motorized users? The one proposal where the Forest is going to expand the
system ---by a mile or 2 ----is a slap in the face to many Montana residents who use
ATVs to get out in the woods and enjoy our public lands. Absolutely terrible! And
the other plans are even worse. If you can't make an improvement, then please leave
it alone. (102-1)
Motorized use is growing. It wouldn't be wise to make rules that will incite law
breaking. If you don't give motorized users a place to use their ATVs and
motorbikes, you will see a lot more people disregarding the law, because it is not
FAIR, and will likely not be followed. But, if you designate routes that are
significant enough, it will serve everyone's best interest, with no animosity toward
the hikers and horse people, who have more than enough trail already designated to
only themselves.
Please do the right thing and expand the trails that are open to OHVs. Because, like
it or not, if you don't provide a place for all the motorized users of the present and
future, they will make their own routes. (102-2)

(102-2) Resource management is a blend of Social
economic/political needs balanced with biological/
environmental needs. Refer to Alternative 5.

Thank You.

Ms DeGeest:
Thank you for the opportunity to be able to comment on the pending Divide Travel
Plan. Enclosed please find 6 comments on some of the aspects of the plan that I
would like you to consider in your deliberations. In addition, via this letter, I would
like to offer some general comments about the plan.
First of all to offer a perspective of where I am coming from, I am a 68 year-old,
third generation Montanan and second generation Helenan. Through the years I have
enjoyed our forests through mountain biking, hiking, camping, cross country skiing
and now ATV riding. In addition, our family has a cabin in the Elkhorns. I truly
believe that we live in God’s paradise here in the Prickly Pear Valley surrounded by
the Little Belts and the Elkhorns.
As I begin to experience some of the limitations that accompany the “Golden
Years”, I am thankful for the ability to continue the enjoyment of visiting our vast
countryside via the invention oats and UTVs. However, as our group rides, we are
finding more and more trails being closed off, both by the government and private
interests. I fully realize that our ability to ride trails that someone else has control
over, is solely dependent on good will and generosity.

Much of the area that the Divide Travel Plan encompasses incorporates many
historic mining districts that were critical to the development of Montana. As an
amateur historian, I greatly enjoy visiting these areas and visualizing the activity
that developed them. Many of these properties predate the founding of your agency.
Once again, I realize that along with the allure of historical wonder, there is also the
curse of damage left unresolved.
Another issue that seems front and center in the DEIS, is that of wildlife.
Unfortunately I am not a biologist, botanist or wildlife expert; however I do have
some opinions about this. As we ride the trails, and I am looking around for game,
my vision is impaired by a whole lot of vegetation that, except for the recent pine
bark beetle scourge, seems rather healthy in the Divide area. It does not seem to me
that the animals have all that much problem finding hiding cover. Also as we ride up
on ridges and mountain tops and look out over the scene around us, I am continually
amazed at how much country there really is that game can travel, propagate and
exist in without coming in contact with the scourge of the human race. It has also
been my experience as we have ridden that when we encounter game, it usually just
moves off into cover until it feels safe and then watches us drive by. And my final
thought on the game issue is that the development activity in the Divide area began
in the late 1800’s. If one considers that a generation of animals in the wild is usually
20 years or less, there have been at least 5 or 6 generations of animals that have
lived and adapted to human intervention in their territory. I don’t think that leaving
the existing trails operable will have an adverse effect on the animal populations.
(103-1)

Response to Comments

(103-1) Most of the trails that we are proposing to close as
motorized routes are causing site-specific problems for wildlife
in one way or another. Most often, they disrupt local habitats that
tend to focus wildlife activity—wet meadows, riparian areas,
aspen stands, calving areas, travel corridors, etc. The mountain
pine beetle is exacerbating the problem in many areas, taking
away cover that, as you have noted, has made it possible for elk
and other animals to buffer themselves from trail riders. Some of
the site-specific problems we are looking at are discussed in the
section “Local Effects in Key Areas” in the Wildlife Background
Report (p. 242-282) and in equivalent sections of the FEIS.

I am a great believer in the adage “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. When we ride the
Divide area, I don’t see a whole lot that is broken. For the most part the trails and
adjacent areas are in decent condition. Yes there are a few areas that either need
some work or need to be closed off, but not nearly to the extent that this plan is
advocating. And, yes there are slob riders, just as there are slob campers and slob
hikers and slob hunters. Unfortunately, that is going to be a continuing problem no
matter what is done with the trail systems.

My experience in riding ATVs is that most of the other riders we have encountered
have been respectful, courteous and caring for the forest. I do not believe that we are
a detriment to the forest and, in fact, we can be an asset for the Forest Service. Each
year, I read in the paper how resources for managing the forest are becoming more
and more limited as money goes to fight fires and Congress tightens the fiscal belt.
With the establishment of a communication conduit, between the ATV riders and
your agency, we could be eyes and ears on the ground for you. As it is, our group
removes trash, maintains trails, and performs other tasks as we ride. I believe that
the various ATV riding groups can contribute to the goals and mission of the Helena
Ranger District.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We submit the following comments to the USDA Helena National Forest (HNF) for
consideration of proposed changes to the motorized vehicle plan as discussed in the
Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and the Forest
Plan Programmatic Amendment.
My family and I have lived at 7500 Priest Pass Rd since early 1993. I am a
professional geologist/hydrogeologist, and we are all avid outdoor enthusiasts.
In the 21 years that we have lived in the Sweeny Creek area we have witnessed
many changes. Most of the changes we have witnessed are the result of an increase
in motorized use and traffic in the Sweeny Creek Area. In particular, in the past 5‐10
years, motorized use on motorized trail roads (MTR) and in many instances,

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 506

Comments
unauthorized trails in the Sweeny Creek area has increased several fold. The results
have been erosion of topsoil, encroachment of noxious weeds, excessive garbage,
firearm violations, destruction of private property, trespassing, harassment of
livestock on private property, noise, dust, contamination of water‐quality in the
Sweeny Creek drainage just to name a few. We are increasingly saddened to watch
the assault of a publically owned natural resource by self‐serving motor enthusiasts
who have the general attitude that an ATV or trail‐bike gives them the right to blaze
a path on public land, and in some instances, private land where none existed. I have
witnessed numerous times during the last 5 years motorcycles and ATVs traveling
behind our property (near its east boundary) using a fire‐line as an undesignated trail
to connect the network of trails such as MTR‐008 with a former footpath that was
part of the Sweeny Creek Nature Trail (NE4NW4 section 27). During this time we
have experienced a bullet traveling overhead as we worked on our deck attached to
our home. We have seen aspen trees on our property vandalized and ‘cut‐in‐two’ by
a shotgun blast by an unknown trespasser. We have experienced trampled and/or cut
fence by hunters dragging deer across our property to access Priest Pass Road from
forest service land. We have found more than one ‘poached’ moose carcass lying
next to Priest Pass Road on USFS land in section 28 (NW4NW4). We have seen
garbage dumps of roofing shingles, wood pallets, computer parts, beer cans and
bottles at sites next to or at the end of numerous MTRs and Priest Pass Road. A
small minority of the public seem to think it is OK to use Priest Pass Road and its
network of trails as a county dump. And last year on a day in May and while hiking
with my dogs I discovered two wildfires next to MTR‐004 started by arsonist.
Motorized use in the Sweeny Creek Area is ‘out of control’ and will only worsen if
nothing is changed, and restrictions are not imposed by the USFS.

Response to Comments

We think motorized use in the Sweeny Creek Area has reached a ‘tipping point’.
Thus, we support a decision selecting Alternatives 3 and 4, which will close all
wheeled motorized traffic on all MTRs in the Sweeny Creek Area. We do not see
how the USFS can allow the current system of motorized recreational use in the
Sweeny Creek Area to continue. We not only support closure of all motorized traffic
on MTRs in the Sweeny Creek Area, but think strict enforcement is necessary to

Regarding the Divide Travel Plan, I support Alternative 3 with some modifications
as noted below. My understanding is that Alternative 3 is based on an actual
agreement between user groups, which should carry some weight. I believe it makes
the most sense to protect the wildlands along the Continental Divide Trail from
development and motorized use.
(106-1) Thank you for your comment.
Specifically, I hope the Continental Divide Trail corridor near Nevada Mountain,
the corridor between Bison Mountain and the headwaters of Ontario Creek, and the
corridor from MacDonald to Mullan Pass can all be designated as non-motorized
year-round. In addition, it makes sense to extend the non-motorized area to all Little
Blackfoot Roadless Lands, and down to the rehabilitated areas near Sweeney Creek.
Given the heavy use the area has seen, I hope more areas can be rehabilitated.(1061)

Much of the Continental Divide has been heavily roaded and abused due to mining
and timber activities. In an overcrowded world where we are altering not only the
planet, but the climate that gave rise to all life, does it make sense to further expand
our impact? I think instead we should be looking for ways to minimize our impact.
It makes the most sense on our public lands to restrict the most damaging uses to the
periphery. Only the least damaging, low impact uses should be granted access to the
interior or the most sensitive areas of our public lands. I hope you will consider
these issues as well. Thank you…

Concerning the Continental Divide Travel Plan, I would like to add a comment in
favor of alternative #4. (109-1)
I've had the privilege of riding motorized vehicles in this area before. Because of the
combination of my age and my medical condition, I would not be able to walk
through this area without the assistance of a motorized vehicle. Option 4 at least
gives me the option to enjoy this area with my grandchild in the winter, but it is very
disappointing that I will not be able to enjoy this area in the summer months.

Response to Comments

For those who didn’t know, the Forest Service is proposing changes to motorized
vehicles that would affect Black Mountain. They have 4 alternative plans they are
seeking comment on. Right now, Victory Mill, Cave Gulch, 3 Mile, the Divide trail
over Black Mountain, etc. are closed to all motorized vehicles, including
snowmobiles. Alternative 1 would keep all that in place. Alternatives 2 & 4 would at
least open these areas to snowmobiles. There are no proposals that would allow 4
wheelers and motorcycles anywhere. The last day to comment is Thursday, June
12.The email address for commenting is:
This is a response to the above closures, families have been riding back there for
years upon years, for some being able to ride back there seems just like everyday
life and for others it's an escape of everyday life, john muir stated that we must
preserve the wilderness for our children and so forth, but we also must allow them to
enjoy what we have worked to preserve. To allow preserving these areas is a great
idea but to be able to raise awareness on preserving you must let the monthly
warrior of the outdoors and their children to enjoy it also, you can't let them enjoy it
by closing it off and saying only foot traffic from here on for the next 60,000 acres,
let's face it we live in a society and day and age that use motorized vehicles whether
it be cars, trucks or ORV's, maybe we should take a look at maintaining trails and
limiting the amount of side trails instead of just closing them all,

Helena National Forest
Attn: Divide Travel Plan

Helena, MT 59602
Dear Ms. DeGeest:
I am writing to submit additional personal comments on the Divide Travel Plan
Draft Environmental Impact Statement. These comments are supplemental to
comments previously submitted by myself and other authors on behalf of the Helena
Hunters and Anglers Association (HHAA), of which I am a board member, and by
the Western Environmental Law Center on behalf of HHAA. I would also like to
endorse the comments submitted by the Montana High Divide Trails Partnership, as
I also contributed to their development.
By way of introduction, I am a third generation Helena native with 50 years of
recreational experience on the Helena National Forest. I am a natural resource
scientist/biologist with 37 years of experience in the field of watershed management
and water quality. I have been intimately involved as a citizen advocate/activist in
forest conservation since at least 1980. My grandparents lived in Marysville until
the early 1930s and they and my father introduced me to the Divide Travel Planning
Area at an early age. I am knowledgeable about the Continental Divide corridor
throughout the Divide TPA and am especially familiar with the Nevada Mountain
Inventoried Roadless Area.
My comments focus on three primary areas, as follows:

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 513

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments

Response to Comments

1. Nevada Mountain Roadless Area Management
2. Greater Continental Divide Corridor Management
3. Sweeney Creek Area Management
Please note that I am not addressing the proposed amendment to the big game
security standard in these comments. HHAA and Western Environmental Law
Center, on behalf of HHAA, have submitted detailed comments on that proposal of
which I was a co-author. I am endorsing those comments and I encourage your
careful consideration of our input and suggestions. I realize the proposed
amendment may be a work in progress subject to modifications, and that some of us
will be meeting with you and Denise Pengeroth on or about June 23 to continue
these discussions. (113-1)
Nevada Mountain Roadless Area Management
As you know, the 56,800-acre Nevada Mountain Roadless Area (NMRA) is the
largest remaining unprotected roadless area on the Helena National Forest (HNF).
The area includes 8,293-foot Nevada Mountain, and 8,338-foot Black Mountain, the
two highest peaks along the Continental Divide from Caribou Peak in the Scapegoat
Wilderness south to Thunderbolt Mountain. The area is important for a number of
reasons. Winter snowpack accumulations along 15 miles of the Continental Divide
and adjacent ridges within the heart of the NMRA annually recharge the watersheds
of Little Prickly Pear Creek, Nevada Creek, Poorman Creek, and Threemile Creek.
This consistent water supply is critical for irrigated agriculture and hydropower
production, and sustains blue ribbon fisheries in the Blackfoot and Missouri rivers.

(113-1) The Wildlife Background Report (p. 278-282) discusses
wildlife and travel management in the Black Mountain/upper
Ophir Creek/Meyers Hill country, which lies adjacent to the
Nevada Mountain Roadless Area within the Divide the Travel
Plan Area. In particular, we recognize the area around Black
Mountain as a key wildlife area, intimately connected to the
Nevada Mountain Roadless Area and to the motorized area
closure in the upper reaches of the Little Prickly Pear watershed
to the northeast. All action alternatives reduce motorized
presence in this area. This discussion is also included in an
equivalent section in the FEIS.

The Nevada Mountain Roadless Area is high quality habitat for more than a few
sensitive species, including wolverine, lynx, grizzly bear, gray wolf, and bull trout
(the latter in upper Nevada Creek and Poorman Creek). Much more importantly, this
undeveloped segment of the Continental Divide serves as a wildlife migratory
corridor between the Northern Rockies and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystems

allowing the transfer of genetic material between increasingly isolated and
fragmented wildlife populations. In the summer, fall, and spring, the area provides
important habitat and security cover for elk. It is also home to black bears, mule
deer, whitetail deer, a growing population of Shiras moose, mountain lions, and
grouse, as well as numerous non-game species. (113-1)

Response to Comments

The area has been popular for big game hunters for millennia. While traversing a
game trail in the area a few years ago, a good friend of mine looked down to spot an
8,000 year old three-inch long Paleo Indian atlatl point. Based on archaeological
evidence, human hunters have pursued elk and deer in the Nevada Mountain country
for at least the last 9,000 years.
From a personal perspective, Nevada Mountain has provided the highest quality
recreational opportunities to four generations of my family. My wife and I raised our
family on its elk and deer. My son and I sat entranced for more than an hour one fall
day as we watched a grizzly foraging at the base of a talus slope below us (one of
several personal grizzly sightings in this area). One early morning, I watched a
wolverine ghost out of the fog to cross in plain view mere yards ahead of me as I
ascended a ridgeline. I have personally seen wolverines in Nevada Mountain on
three occasions, and recent research by Steve Gehman of Wild Things Unlimited
has documented this area as a wolverine “hotspot” because of its high wolverine
densities. It is also documented critical lynx habitat. On another occasion, a friend
and I were stalked by a cougar to within seven yards before the big cat realized his
error and retreated. More recently, I harvested a beautiful gray wolf on the flank of
Nevada Mountain to claim my first predator in more than 45 years of hunting in this
area. Time spent in the NMRA has created my fondest memories and continually
enriches my soul. To me personally, the area is irreplaceable and it is my spiritual
foundation.
The future of Nevada Mountain was not always secure. Condition of the area
trended downward through the 1970s with illegal road construction associated with
mining exploration and other insults. The area as we know it was nearly lost in the

early 1980s when road development into its core and major timber sales were
proposed by the Helena National Forest. We sportsmen rallied for protection and the
proposals were withdrawn. Groups included the Nevada Creek Concerned
Sportsmen, Helena Forest Conservation Coalition, Montana Wilderness Association,
and many individual citizens. I have files documenting this era and the extensive
collective input and support for protection of the area. Organized citizen
involvement during development of the Helena National Forest Plan from 19821986 lead by the Helena Forest Conservation Coalition resulted in designation of a
roadless non-motorized core area, with primarily wildlife emphasis management
prescriptions for the remainder of the area. Since 1986, additional roads have been
closed and a greater portion of the area has been designated for non-motorized uses.
The NMRA has been included in several past Wilderness bills before Congress and
many of us testified in support of Wilderness designation at the hearings. The 2005
Divide-Lincoln Winter Recreation Agreement and the 2009 Montana High Divide
Trails Agreement have added further protections for the area and have unified many
of the user groups with a consensus vision for management.
The Divide Travel Plan EIS provides us with an important opportunity to further
secure the status of the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area and its many values, and to
safeguard this 30 year conservation success story. Alternative 3 within the DEIS is
consistent with the winter recreation agreement boundaries and is the only
alternative that honors this agreement which has been signed by the Helena National
Forest and many user groups. Alternative 3 also preserves Wilderness designation as
a future option, which will be reviewed as a component of the 2014-2018 Helena
Forest Plan revision process. One can make the argument that the NMRA provides
the very best remaining habitat and habitat connectivity along the Continental
Divide within the Helena National Forest for sensitive and listed wildlife species. Its
importance grows every year (for wildlife and human recreation), and the
researchers are just now beginning to document how critically important this area is.
Fortunately, we are learning this before it’s too late to make good management
decisions.

(113-2) Thank you for your input.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 516

Comments
Please adopt Alternative 3 as a core component and consider expanding protections
for the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area through additional motorized closures
along its perimeter area. For example, none of the current alternatives adequately
address massive road duplication to the south of the NMRA. These roads inhibit
linkage between the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area along the Continental Divide
to and south of Highway 12, thus hindering movement of wildlife between
ecosystems. Simply stated, no other roadless area within the Divide Travel Planning
Area warrants more special attention and protection than Nevada Mountain. (113-2)
Greater Continental Divide Corridor Management
Only 20 miles of 75 miles of the Continental Divide Trail would be managed as
non-motorized under the most protective Alternative 3. This should be reconsidered,
and the HNF should strive for consistency with the 2009 Continental Divide
National Comprehensive Plan. (113-3)

Response to Comments

(113-3) Thank you for your input. Alternative 5 designates
sections for the CDNST as non-motorized in areas where
adjacent motorized routes exist.

(113-4) Thank you for your input.

Please enhance protection of the Continental Divide corridor between Bison
Mountain and the headwaters of Ontario Creek by extending non-motorized, year
around protection to all Little Blackfoot Roadless Area lands. Please look for
opportunities to expand year around non-motorized area protection to the
Continental Divide corridor from MacDonald Pass-Priest Pass to Mullan Pass.
Alternative 3 best addresses these requests but can be improved upon. HHAA
provided specific recommendations and supporting rationale for travel management
within these areas and I urge you to strongly consider that information. (113-4)
Sweeney Creek Area Management
The Sweeny Creek area provides over 7,000 acres of high quality wildlife habitat
that extends to the east from the Continental Divide. This area contains important
elk calving and summer range, and security cover during the big game season. In the
cold months the south facing slopes of Sweeny provide winter forage for mule deer,
elk and moose. Sweeny Creek provides important big game security along a part of

the Divide Landscape that is otherwise heavily fragmented by roads. This area has
always been recognized as important mule deer winter range.
The numerous motorized routes in Sweeny Creek are all illegal user-created routes.
No NEPA evaluation has been done on any of these routes. They need to be
physically closed, reseeded and fully reclaimed. The cluster of illegal spur roads
emanating from the Priest Pass Road must be physically closed and reclaimed. A
number of these spur roads cross live streams or are located in wet aspen/dogwood
riparian habitat. Uncontrolled firewood cutting is starting to impact the aspen stands
along the Priest Pass road. (113-5)
Both Alternatives 3 and 4 would finally close this area to wheeled motorized
vehicles and also recognize it as a winter area closure. This move is strongly
encouraged, and if implemented would finally accommodate the requests of MFWP
that were made in 1991 to create a motorized area closure for Sweeney Creek to
protect critical mule deer, elk, and moose winter range, as well as limited old growth
ponderosa pine habitat for sensitive species. Recognition of a year-long area closure
is due and appreciated. However, none of the alternatives closes Road 1802-B2 to
over-snow motorized travel, yet this road accesses the non-motorized winter area
and the Continental Divide linkage zone in this immediate area is known to be used
by lynx, wolverine, and wolves. Please consider an alternative that will close Road
1802-B2 to snowmobile use. (113-6)

Response to Comments

(113-6) Thank you for your comment. The Forest Service
looked at the transportation system as a whole within the entire
Divide Landscape to determine through public participation and
analysis what roads were appropriate to be designated open or
seasonally open to wheeled and over-snow motorized vehicle.
Roads that would potentially have an effect on resources were
considered for yearlong closures. This Final Environmental
Impact Statement discloses analysis findings which were
considered when determining a manageable system of designated
public motorized access routes and areas within the Divide area
which are displayed in the Draft Record of Decision and
associated appendices.

In conclusion, I thank you for the opportunity to submit these additional comments.
I am confident that you will utilize all the extensive input you’re receiving to
finalize the EIS and to develop an improved preferred alternative. I personally look
forward to working with you to complete the Divide travel planning process and to
implement and monitor the new travel plan. Thanks, again, Heather!

With regards to the Continental Divide Travel Plan, these changes are not only a
major disappointment, but they are just plain sad. The technology behind wheeled
motorized vehicles gives many people access to some of Montana’s most beautiful
scenery that they normally would not be capable of visiting due to age or health
restrictions. Taxes are paid by all and to restrict access to this land with a blanket
policy is not fair. It’s sad to think that some people will lose access to this land for
perhaps the rest of their life…

ISSUES WITH THE PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE 2
We support enhancements to Alternative 2 so that it becomes a reasonable ProRecreation Alternative for the following specific reasons which are supported by our
comments in this submittal and further supported by all of our comment submittals
listed at the end of this document. (116-1)
We are a locally supported association whose purpose is to preserve trails for all
recreationists through responsible environmental protection and education. We are
practical environmentalists who sponsor weed control projects, and do trail
maintenance including clearing trails and building bridges and water bars for use by
all. We sponsor education projects including construction of kiosks and signage.
The public has a great need for motorized trails.
Human ecology specific to the benefits and need for OHV recreation deserves more
consideration in the analysis and preferred alternative.
Under existing conditions there are considerably more non-motorized trail
opportunities than motorized trail opportunities in the Helena National Forest.
OHVs are growing in popularity (see registration trends). Additional routes are
needed to address future motorized growth. The public needs more motorized trail
opportunities and not less. (116-2)
The Forest Service has proposed less motorized trail opportunities.
Motorized recreationists are the only ones to lose in this proposal. Non-Motorized
trails are significantly increased (50%) by the proposed alternative. The exact
number is not easy to determine in the DEIS. (116-3)

OHV recreationists need an adequate trail system for all of the same reasons that
non-motorized recreationists need a system.
The percentage and miles of non-motorized versus motorized trails does not
adequately consider the total miles of non-motorized trails in the entire Helena
National Forest including the miles of non-motorized trails in nearby wilderness
areas. (116-4)
Motorized recreationists are the only one to lose in every travel plan action.
The National OHV policy was not intended to be a massive motorized closure
process but that is how it is being used.
We are extremely concerned that the claimed benefits to the natural environmental
are not all that real and come at a significant cost to the human ecology which is
very real.

for us to stay current with this process given this duration. Additionally, the
Blackfoot Travel Plan has come out with an almost concurrent review and objection
period. We greatly appreciate the extension of the comment period so that we can
reasonably respond given the concurrent schedules and the complexities of these

with the public when you try to enforce a travel plan that is not in touch with the
public’s need for motorized access and motorized recreation in the Helena National

(116-5) As described in more detail in the EIS, we did consider
an ‘equal sharing’ or pro-recreation alternative. Alternatives 2, 3
and 4 as described in the EIS are the IDT’s best attempt at
providing a full range of recreation options while balancing
recreation and resource protection needs. Alternative 5 was
developed based on public input and does address these
suggestions.

18. We are concerned about the significant cost of the road decommissioning project
versus the use of those funds for maintenance of motorized routes. A better return
on the funding in both environmental enhancement and recreational opportunities
would be realized by investing the same funding in maintenance of motorized
routes. Questions that need to be adequately addressed include:
a. For how many years can motorized routes be maintained for public use and
benefit versus the cost of decommissioning them? (116-6)
b. How much more environmental enhancement could be realized by using the same
funding for maintenance of motorized routes including water bars. The Stream
Systems Technology Center found that installing water bars at a reasonable spacing
was a very effective way to reduce the sediment discharge from trails and roads
(July 2007 Stream Notes at http://www.stream.fs.fed.us ). Many other best
management practices are available to control sediment production at demonstrated
by the bibliography at http://www.fs.fed.us/td/programs/wsa/pdfPubs/road_bmp.pdf .
19. Lack of funding was used as a reason in the EIS to close motorized routes. Now
the agency is able to readily find funding to decommission motorized routes. This
inconsistency greatly concerns motorized recreationists and we encourage the

The alternative maps use a format that is not familiar to the public. The public has
used for decades and is familiar with the traditional Helena National Forest map
which has enough features so that the public can locate themselves. In the interest of
adequate public disclosure, we request that the alternative maps be shown using the
forest map as the base. (116-7)
Because of the lack of detail on the alternatives map and because it is not the
familiar traditional Helena National Forest map, the public will have a difficult time
distinguishing routes and provide adequate comments on the route proposal.
The map format requiring the public to look at both the existing conditions map and
the alternative map to determine if a particular route is open or closed is extremely
confusing and difficult to interpret. Because of the confusing process of looking at
two maps, we cannot distinguish routes and provide adequate comments on the
alternatives. We request that the alternative maps be modified so that each one

the public has a reasonable way to comment on a route. The Alternative 1 map does
not include any route numbers. The other maps do not include all of the route

individual routes. Routes are shown as lines on paper and the maps include very few
features from which one can locate a route.
Public understanding of the proposed alternatives would be greatly improved by
implementing a mapping tool similar to the one developed by Idaho Parks and
Recreation. This tool can be tried out at http://www.trails.idaho.gov/trails/ . Zoom in
and click on a particular trail to see the information provided for each route. Earlier
versions of this tool included GPS downloads for each route which would help

The project scoping was conducted in 2008. Six years have gone by which creates
two deficiencies. First, since 2008 motorized recreationists have suffered significant
cumulative impacts from closures in the Helena National Forest and surrounding
forests and BLM lands including the Gallatin National Forest travel plan, Lewis and
Clark National Forest travel plan, Beaverhead Deerlodge Forest Plan and BLM
Butte District Resource Management Plan which included the closure of the Scratch
Gravel Hills to all motorized access. These and other significant actions have
produced significant impacts on motorized access and recreational which render the
2008 scoping out of date and require a re-opening of the scoping process. Secondly,
the public cannot be expected to remain engaged in the travel planning process over
the course of six years. Many motorized recreationists have become frustrated with
the length of time that has transpired and have given up on the travel planning
process. The Forest Service must come up with an adequate adjustment to the
process to adequately restore the involvement of motorized recreationists.
The proposed plan continues to provide non-motorized recreationists with more
opportunities at the expense of motorized recreationists even though non-motorized
recreationists are a minority user on the existing routes.
Most of the public including motorized recreationists expect a “travel plan” to
adequately look out for their needs, culture and traditions for motorized access and
recreation in the forest. These values are extremely important to us because our
culture and traditions of access and use of public lands go back decades and
generations to our pioneer forefathers. These values should not be easily dismissed.
A Pro-Recreation Alternative would meet these expectations.

OHV recreationists need an adequate trail system close to town for all of the same
reasons that non-motorized recreationists need a system such as the Mount Helena

The analysis in the DEIS assumes that OHV trail impacts are equal to those
associated with roads. We do not believe that this is the case based on our
knowledge and observations which include the fact that OHV trails are less in width,
no trees are removed (minimal disturbance of wildlife habitat), and very little or no
cut and fill is required to construct them. (116-15)
The project scoping was conducted in 2008. Six years have gone by. Since 2008
motorized recreationists have suffered significant cumulative impacts from closures
in the Helena National Forest and surrounding forests and BLM lands. We feel that
this condition should be factored into the evaluation.
It is also asking a lot for the public to remain involved in a process that has gone on
for 8 years.

37. Past timber sales at Bison Mountain and Treasure Mountain included significant
motorized closures to accommodate elk cover requirements. Now these areas have
re-forested and it would be reasonable to re-open these areas to OHV routes.
38. Elk Cover Requirements. Elk do well in places like Nevada without trees.
Additionally, elk were originally animals that lived on the plains and survived just
fine without trees. Effective elk hiding is provided by mountains, hills, ravines,
ridges, rocks, brush. These land factors must be incorporated into the elk hiding
cover equation. (116-16)
39. Additionally, wolves have radically changed elk behavior and use of tree
canopy. Elk now avoid tree cover because the cover allows wolves to prey upon
them easier. Elk now prefer open areas where they can “keep an eye” on the wolves
and defend themselves. Therefore, tree cover is not a significant benefit to elk at this
time and this changed condition must be recognized. (116-18)

OHV use is increasing. If there is any impact to be identified, it appears that it
should be that the positive impact associated with increasing OHV use and
increasing wildlife populations. Secondly, OHV use does not kill wildlife. Wildlife
coexists just fine with OHVs. This was recently confirmed again by a study in
Yellowstone Park which found that “Most elk, bison and trumpeter swans barely
reacted last winter to the presence of snow coaches and snowmobiles in
Yellowstone National Park, according to a study released Tuesday. Scientists
watched more than 2,100 interactions between over-snow vehicles and wildlife last
year to try to determine how they responded. Of those, 81 percent of the animals had

(116-20b) To say that “wildlife populations” are at an all time

indeed at an all-time high in the Divide landscape: bull/cow
ratios, however, which are a key measure as to the health of the
populations, are inevitably low. Part of the reason elk numbers
are so high in many areas is that they have been leaving
motorized areas on the National Forest to find refuge on private
lands where hunting is not allowed. The problem for elk in
summer—as it is for a number of other species—is not risk of
mortality, but simply being able to find enough productive
habitat away from human disturbances (Wildlife Background
Report, p. 48-49). Populations of some species are declining or
hovering around levels that are well below what the habitat is
capable of supporting, primarily because of the presence of
humans on roads and trails. This certainly doesn’t apply to a

The 3-States OHV Record of Decision requires that they agency provide a site

Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 provide respectively, 26, 0 and 4 miles of OHV routes in a

enough key habitat areas to allow the more sensitive wideranging animals to maintain viable populations on the landscape.
(116-20c) Volumnous research indicates that motorized use of
open roads and motor trails do indeed affect habitat use patterns
and other behavior of animals such as deer, elk, moose, bears,
mountain lions, and others (Wildlife Background Report, p. 32,
48-49, 51, 82-83, 158, 161, 184-187, 204) This is not to say that
some of these animals don’t use habitat near trails or use them as
travelways. But regular motor use of these trails restricts use of
areas around them to certain times of day (nighttime) or certain
times of year. Many animals avoid them almost entirely. The
objective is not curtail OHV use across the landscape, but to
create a pattern of trails that allows certain wildlife species large
blocks of habitat free from this kind of disturbance.

motorized recreation, non-motorized recreation, and the

total about 38 miles or less than 5% of all trail opportunity. The Divide project area
is multiple-use land that should be used to address this imbalance by creating more
motorized trails.
The stated goal of the Forest Service is now to “Minimize” (Chapter 2, page 15)
which is contrary to Multiple Use Law which allows reasonable use of public lands.
Motorized recreationists need adequate opportunities to recreate with their family

needs.
The plan does not include any motorcycle single-track trail. The 3-State OHV ROD

agencies that adequately consider their needs without a protracted (6 year) and
demanding input process. The travel planning process must have reasonable
expectations in regards to public involvement and also include an adequate internal
process to properly identify the site-specific needs of motorized recreationists.
Each alternative proposes closures of existing motorized CDNST trail. This is illegal
per the original National Trail System Act, and the CDNST EIS and ROD. See a
separate CTVA submittal with more details on this issue.
The CDNST enabling law required that existing motorized reaches of the CDNST
remain open for motorized use. Several reaches of the Continental Divide National
Scenic Trail ignored the requirements of the law and were illegally closed to
motorized use including Bison Mountain North and South, McDonald Pass to
Jericho, and Black Mountain North. Supporting information is provided in a
separate CTVA comment submittal. We request that these illegal closures be reopened as part of this action. (116-29a)
Furthermore, past actions closed motorized reaches of the CDNST such as Bison
Mountain, McDonald Pass South and Black Mountain North which were open to
motorized travel. These reaches of the CDNST must be reopened in order to be in
compliance with the law and ROD. (116-29b)
While Revised Statute 2477 was repealed by the 1976 National Forest Management
Act, the revision clearly stated in the Act was to insure that no new roads from the
effective date of the Act would be considered for RS 2477 consideration. It further
clarified the historical highways would be honored. That is all that the 1976 Act
modified or repealed. Until the federal government completely repeals the 1866 Act,
(Revised by the 1872 Act) in its entirety the citizens of the United States still have
the right to access lands for the benefit of the people of the United States. The

A Grizzly Bear study in the Swan Valley of Montana found that 99 percent of the
bears spent 99 percent of their time on Plum Creek property as shown in the
following aerial photograph. This property has been heavily logged resulting in
undergrowth plant species that support bears. Thick and overgrown timber does not
allow for adequate undergrowth. As we now see by this study, critical bear habitat is
quite different than what was once assumed and this new information must be
incorporated into this evaluation. The Forest Service should discard the original
“road density guidelines” and develop new guidelines that reflect the habitat most
critical for bears as one that is timber harvested and roaded. Old outdated science
formulated by assumptions should not be used when true science and actual data is
now available. (116-30)

67. Agency actions geared toward closing public access and restricting natural
resource production on public lands are being justified by very old, outdated
technology from the 1980’s and 90’s. Recently at the May 14-15, 2014 meeting
(http://leg.mt.gov/css/Committees/interim/2013-2014/EQC/Meetings/May-14-152014/may-14-15-2014.asp)Montana’s Environmental Quality Council (EQC) and 25
other elected officials requested use of current technology in agency plans and
actions related to grizzly bears. Our statement acknowledged the federal
government's 21 year old Grizzly bear Recovery Plan is outdated and, “is no longer
based on the best available science”. EQC further affirmed, “Important new research
is available, recent grizzly bear studies based upon GPS satellite monitoring and
DNA analysis offer better quality and more accurate

data, and proper planning is critical for bears, people, and resource management.”
EQC concluded, “The current recovery plan, based upon outdated science, continues
to impact resource management and limit access and use of public lands, land
management options, and our economy.” To demonstrate this point the aerial
photograph shown above from a 2005 University of Montana scientific study which
reveals over 20,000 GPS locations of 23 grizzly bears in NW Montana was shared
with EQC. For a decade or more, state and federal agencies have failed to bring
forth current scientific data such as this which may contradict their conclusion that
bears avoid roads. (116-31)
These agencies continue to base their decisions predominantly on a substandard
1997 study of just 2 female bears which used limited technology and underwent no
credible scientific peer review. The outdated reports, touted by agencies as "best
available science", are being used to close and obliterate public access roads, restrict
recreational activity, shut down natural resource industries, cripple our economy,
and allow catastrophic wildfire fuel loads to build up on millions of acres of public
lands.
A study of sound levels from OHV use was found to be less than the background
noise of the wind in treetops (Nora Hamilton, Mendocino National Forest,
memorandum to the file, November 17, 1992). Also, the USDA FS Technology and
Development Program in a report prepared in 1993 and titled "Sound Levels of Five
Motorcycles Traveling Over Forest Trails" found that at distances over 400 feet,
motorcycles do not raise the ambient sound level (they are no louder than
background levels of noise). Absolute quiet is not a reasonable expectation. Sound
from motorized sources such as airplanes exists even in the most remote areas. It is
not reasonable to expect absolute quiet in areas intended for multiple-use. The sound
level of motorized recreation use is not greater than natural sounds, and therefore,
sound level should not be used as a reason to justify motorized recreation and access

A study of National Park elk habituated to human activity and not hunted were more
sensitive to persons afoot than vehicles (Shultz, R.D. and James A. Bailey
“Responses of National Park Elk to Human Activity”, Journal of Wildlife
Management, v42, 1975). Therefore, hikers disturb elk more than motor vehicles
and “disturbance of wildlife” should not be used as a reason to justify motorized
recreation and access closures. Additionally, when there are concerns with wildlife
disturbance, restrictions on hikers should be given a greater emphasis than
restrictions on motorized visitors. (116-33)
Hikers disturb nesting birds (Swarthout, Elliott and Steidl, Robert, Journal of the

Hiking, cross-country hiking and wilderness uses also causes trail impacts yet these

There are many double-standards in the impact analyses and decision-making. If the
issues surrounding motorized travel are significant enough to justify closures, then,
in order to avoid introducing a bias to the evaluation and process the same issues
and restrictions should also be applied to hiking, mountain climbing, cross-country
hiking, wilderness users, etc. (116-35)
A study of the heart rate of elk found that humans walking between 20 to 300 meters
from the elk caused them to flee immediately 41% of the time while an OHV
passing within 15 to 400 meters of the elk caused them to flee 8% of the time
(Ward, A. L. and J. J. Cupal. 1976. Telemetered heart rate of three elk as affected by
activity and human disturbance. USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and
Range Experiment Station. Laramie, WY. 9 pp.). Therefore, hikers disturb elk more
than motor vehicles and “disturbance of wildlife” should not be used as a reason to
justify motorized recreation and access closures. Additionally, when there are
concerns with wildlife disturbance, restrictions on hikers should be given a greater
emphasis than restrictions on motorized visitors. (116-36)
A study of mule deer found that 80% fled in reaction to encounters with persons
afoot while only 24% fled due to encounters with snowmobiles (David J. Freddy,
Whitcomb M. Bronaugh, Martin C. Fowler, “Responses of Mule Deer to Persons
Afoot and Snowmobiles”, Wildlife Society Bulletin, 1986). Therefore, hikers
disturb deer more than motor vehicles and “disturbance of wildlife” should not be
used as a reason to justify motorized recreation and access closures. Additionally,
when there are concerns with wildlife disturbance, restrictions on hikers should be
given a greater emphasis than restrictions on motorized visitors. (116-37)
A lynx study completed in the Seeley Lake area found no adverse impact to Lynx
from winter snowmobile use. The results of this study and the data that was
collected must be used in evaluating areas open or closed to snowmobiles. The
closure of any area because of winter motorized impact to lynx is not valid and,
therefore, must not be used to initiate closures. (116-38)

bears will avoid egularly traveled roads and the higher the
density of these roads, the less suitable habitat is available for the
bears to use on a regular basis (Wildife Background Report, p.

habitat sites that tend to focus bear activity (riparian areas, wet

79. The wildlife/visitor interaction in national parks demonstrates that the manner in
which visitors coexist with wildlife is the most significant factor
in the interaction between wildlife and visitors. The manner in which visitors coexist
with wildlife in national forest can be shaped by adequate use of mitigation
measures including seasonal closures, educational programs and trail rangers.
Therefore, reasonable alternatives to the closure of motorized roads and trails exist
and can be used to address wildlife concerns. (116-40)
We request that these sorts of reasonable alternatives to closure of roads and trails to
motorized visitors be adequately considered and incorporated into the preferred
alternative.

(116-31) New patterns of use by grizzly bears in the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) are discussed in the
Wildlife Background report ( p. 82) and the equivalent wildlife
section in the FEIS. Bears will travel on Forest roads—
especially low-use roads, and they typically use them at night.
Those bears that frequent areas of regular human use around
roads, dwellings, campgrounds, etc. are inevitably the ones that
are removed by management action (killed or removed to other
locations).

The road density criteria is not valid because hundreds of deer in Helena and elk in
the Montanan City area exist just fine with road densities far in excess of the targets
for the project area. Obviously there are other factors that have a far greater
influence on deer and elk populations and the analysis must uncover and use those.
The actual zone of influence of motorized trails on wildlife is very small.
“Present day populations of white-tailed deer and elk are at their highest levels
recorded in recent history” (Montana Wolf Conservation and Management Planning
Document, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, January 2000
(http://www.fwp.state.mt.us/wildthings/wolf/wolfmanagement011602.pdf ).
Additionally, “nearly 60 percent of Montana's original elk management units exceed
elk-population objectives, while only 31 percent exceed harvest objectives”
(www.fwp.state.mt.us/hunting/elkplan.html ). (116-41)
Additionally, the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE), outside of
Glacier National Park, has grizzly bear population densities of about 1 bear per 2030 square miles and has human recreation consisting of motorized access, motorized
recreation, hiking, fishing, camping, horseback riding, and big game hunting.
Glacier National Park annually receives approximately 2-3 million visitors, does not
allow hunting, and has grizzly bear population densities estimated at about 1 bear

(116-32) There is a reasonable expectation for hikers and others
who wish to experience the National Forest as a natural
environment that there will be areas where unnatural noises are
not a constant part of the equation. Those sounds are all around
us all day long in most of the rest of our world. The combination
of non-natural motor sounds along with the intrusion an
unnatural, fast-moving machine is a problem for a number of
key wildlife species. We expect to maintain parts of the Forest
where this is not a problem.

(116-33) This has been discussed above: people afoot cause
greater increases in heart rate/pulse than motor vehicles.
However, the effect is much more local. Motor vehicles have
been shown to generate slightly lower increases in pulse rate, but
the effect covers a much broader area over a much longer
distance—and thus is disruptive of more wildlife in any given
area within a given time period.
(116-34) Wherever humans on foot have proven a problem for
local wildlife in the past, we have restricted all use or taken other
measures to discourage human presence during the critical time

per 8 square miles. The Yellowstone Ecosystem (YE) which is comprised of
Yellowstone Park and surrounding National Forests, receives more visitation than
Glacier Park and has an increasing grizzly bear population estimated at 1 bear per
30-50 square miles (http://www.r6.fws.gov/endspp/grizzly/bittereis/deischp2.htm ).
All indications are that grizzly bear habitat is fully occupied and that additional road
closures and obliteration will not produce any more bears and, therefore, motorized
closures are not reasonable or productive. Further evidence of this condition is the
fact that grizzly bears are moving out onto the prairies around Valier and Choteau.

reason to close roads and trails to motorized recreationists to increase grizzly
populations because the most significant constraint is their need for so many acres
between other grizzly bears. (116-42)
Furthermore, Kate Kendall's Greater Glacier Bear DNA study (includes all the
North Fork of Flathead), (116-43) which identified 367 unique individual bears with
one years data not yet analyzed. The recovered population target was 600 bears for
the entire Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, so there is already known that
about 2/3 of that target exist on about 1/4 of the habitat. Completion of DNA study
of the rest of the ecosystem is certain to show that bear populations far exceed the
recovery goal and should be de-listed. The study was released in December 2006
and indeed did confirm that there was more than 545 bears in the ecosystem

85. As of 2007, the grizzly bears in the Yellowstone region were delisted by the
agencies.

86. The number of hunters is declining (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1996

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/03/national/printable3228893.shtml ).
Therefore, there are no compelling reasons “to elevate the level of elk security in the
project area and…enhance elk populations” as frequently suggested by wildlife
biologists (example; Fish, Wildlife and Parks letter dated February 27, 2002 to
Helena National Forest on the Clancy-Unionville Travel Planning Project, bottom of
page 9). Additionally, there are no compelling reasons to justify reduced road
densities as a sought-after or necessary wildlife management criterion. Lastly, there
are reasonable alternatives including permit hunting and seasonal travel restrictions
that can better accomplish the outcome sought by reduced road and trail densities.
NEPA requires consideration and implementation of all reasonable alternatives. Not
considering and implementing reasonable alternatives demonstrates a predisposition
in the process.
87. In the past many of the impacts associated with motorized recreation were based
on opinions about the impacts on wildlife. The courts have clearly established the

in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that expert testimony must be based on a

has reliable results. In part, the Daubert ruling was triggered by the proliferation of
experts and professional witnesses who expressed their opinion in reports and

disturb deer more, they disturb them in a different way than
snowmobiles.
A snowmobile will disturb many more deer over a much broader

(116-38) This issue is discussed in the Wildlife Background
Report in sections on “Canada Lynx” (p. 91, 98, 193-194) and in
equivalent Wildlife sections of the FEIS. Most recent studies
have concluded that lynx generally do not avoid packed
snowmobile trails and often use them as travelways. The
problem is that they also serve as travelways for competing
carnivores (coyotes, bobcats, foxes, mountain lions) that would
otherwise not be able to access winter lynx habitat through deep
unpacked snow. For this reason, the Northern Rockies Lynx
Management Direction (NRLMD)—now part of the Helena
Forest Plan—has a standard that allows no net increase in packed
over-the-snow routes in lynx habitat within a given lynx analysis
unit (LAU).

Bull/cow ratios, however, are just at minimum desired levels and
the percentage of mature bulls is far below what would be

(116-42) This issue has been discussed above. As noted in the
Wildlife Background Report (p. 83, 85-89, 184-187) and
equivalent sections of the FEIS, grizzly bear populations in the
NCDE (including Glacier NP) are much more robust than in the
Divide landscape because of the availability of much larger
blocks of non-motorized habitat in and around the Bob Marshall
Wilderness complex. The same is true of Yellowstone NP. In
the National Parks, grizzlies contend with humans in vehicles
only along narrow ribbons of road corridor. Most of the parks
consist of vast areas of wilderness. This is what allows the
populations to flourish. If we are to maintain a small resident
grizzly population in the Divide landscape, we need to follow
suit to the degree possible and provide large blocks of non
motorized habitat in amongst the road and motor trail network.
The goal is not to build and sustain populations of the order of
the NCDE, but to accommodate a few local bears in an
environment that will allow them to stay out of trouble with
humans.

closest opportunity to Helena and many recreationists used it extensively for short
trips and high school aged recreationists use it after school and because they cannot
travel far. Now all of these visitors seeking recreation in close proximity to Helena
rely on motorized recreation in the Sweeny Creek area. It would be a very
significant impact on our youth to close the Sweeny Creek area. In fact, it has the
potential to be a positive demonstration project of good things that kids can occupy
their time with. These facts must be evaluated as part of the Divide alternative
development and decision. (116-52)
8. We enjoy dispersed camping and riding opportunities in the Divide project area.
Some of our favorite trails include Ontario Creek, Meyers Hill loop, and the
Tenmile Historic mining loop. We frequently use the Sweeney Creek area, and road
227 past the Kading Campground including the ATV trail up the Kading Grade to
Baggs Creek, the Limburger Springs to Baldy Ridge loop, and the Hope CreekCDNST loop. We also use all motorized segment of the Continental Divide National
Scenic Trail including the Helmville-Gould trail all the way to Dalton Mountain and
the Flesher Pass to Stemple Pass route. We use all of the routes shown on the
attached set of maps prepared from information from our members. Please note that
these maps are not intended to show all of the existing routes. We do not have
enough resources to complete that level of investigation and we must rely on the
Forest Service to provide a complete inventory. These maps are intended to
demonstrate the type of loops and destinations that OHV recreationists enjoy today
and have a need for. The loss of any of these routes would be a significant issue with
our members because of the significant impact on our members. This need must be
addressed as a significant issue in the analysis. (116-53)

its 20 pages of References Cited (p. 290-310) will attest to the

14. Many of the existing routes are unimproved 4x4 routes which are now used by
smaller OHVs. These routes have been used by the public for decades and are
largely grassed in and stable as shown on the following photograph. Continued use
as unimproved 4x4 and OHV routes is a reasonable course of action.

15. Many of the motorized trails are in one small area, Sweeny Creek. Bottom-line,
we would like to see a Pro-Recreation alternative included with 30 to 50 miles of
OHV route so that there is a reasonable motorized trail system to use. (116-58)

(116-49) The reason for the later opening date is that the trail
runs through a well-documented elk calving area. The initial
request for the extended closure came from MFWP, and Helena
NF wildlife field surveys corroborated their information in the
late 1990s. the current closure dates were put in place shortly
thereafter.

access to these historic features. Very little of this type of sites have been preserved
in the Helena National Forest. EPA work and time has removed many of them. The
legacy of the pioneers, early settlers, and miners are being removed from the
landscape. We recommend that interpretative facilities be provided for future
generations by construction a kiosk at parking lots and installing trail

(116-59) The Tri State OHV Environmental Impact Statement
defines site specific analysis in Appendix B page 216 as
relatively detailed information, including the location, condition
and current uses of individual roads and trails and the
identification of when and where individual roads and trails will
be open or closed to various types of use. It is dependent of on
the availability of funds and resources. Site specific analysis was
conducted in the development of the preferred alternative.
(116-60) The agency selected alternative will meet applicable
laws, regulations, and standards. Project design features and best
management practices would apply to any alternative selected,
and are discussed in the EIS.
(116-61a&b) The Helena National Forest currently manages 945
known cultural resources, of those, 238 cultural resources
represents quarries, mines, homesteads, etc. The Helena National
Forest also has 14 Historic Mining District that cover large
landscape which include multiply associated features, such as
building ruins, adits, shafts, ditches, roads, and trash piles. Of
those 945 cultural resources, 7 sites are listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (3 of them are on the Helena Ranger
District), 839 sites have not received eligibility determination,
therefor they are treated as Eligible. Forty-eight sites have been
determined Eligible for listing, but have not been formally listed

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 559

Response to Comments
and 51 sites have been determine Not Eligible for listing in the
National Register.
A total of 181 cultural resources are identified within or adjacent
to roads and trails in the Divide Travel Plan area. These cultural
resources were discovered and documented as a result of prior
cultural resource reconnaissance and project inventory in the
travel plan area. On-the-ground inventory of each road and trail
affected by the proposed Divide Travel Plan has not been
undertaken because the Forest Service is considering only
whether a road or trail will remain open or closed in this land use
decision. Specific road closure methods, and their effects, will be
the subject of separate environmental analyses. NHPA Section
106 compliance (including historical research) survey will be
completed then, as necessary, for roads and trails proposed for
obliteration.
The proposed motorized route closures would be beneficial to
cultural resources by preventing easy vehicle access to sensitive
cultural resources which helps to abate vandalism and artifact
theft. For example, historic mining buildings accessible by
motorized routes located in the planning area have been
dismantled to obtain antique wood for various decorative uses
such as in home remodeling and picture frames. Mining
equipment, such as ore carts and old equipment parts, have found
new homes as lawn and landscaping ornaments. Prehistoric and
historic properties are a non-renewable resource. They represent
a resource base that cannot be replenished. For this reason
several federal laws and regulations have been established that
require federal agencies to identify, monitor, protect, and
preserve cultural resources under their jurisdictions. Through the
final NHPA Section 106 process, all undertakings would be

identified and addressed, and any necessary mitigation measures
incorporated into the project design or other appropriate heritage
resources agreement. The goal is to avoid, minimize, or mitigate
impacts to significant cultural properties.
Since the late 1970s, cultural resource inventories have preceded
all ground-disturbing Forest Service projects on the Helena
National Forest, including vegetation treatments, livestock
grazing, restoration, and recreation development. The majority of
the cultural resources described in this travel plan analysis were
discovered as a result of these compliance inventories. In fact,
many archaeological sites were found because they were exposed
in old road and trail beds. In most cases, project boundaries and
treatments would be reconfigured to avoid impacting significant
cultural resources so they could be preserved and the effect of
these actions on cultural resources would be relatively minor.
All forest actions require NHPA compliance and consultation
therefore the effects on cultural resources would be mitigated
through project redesign and/or avoidance. Roads and trails have
been constructed through archaeological and historic sites over a
period of many years. Regardless of alternative, road use has the
potential to degrade cultural resources, particularly prehistoric
archaeological sites.
Any federal actions that poses an adverse effect to cultural
resources (for example EPA cleanup) is required to consult with
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Tribal Historic
Preservation Office (THPO) to mitigate those effects (36 CFR
800). A few examples of mitigations are public interpretation,
data recovery, or site relocation.

The Helena National Forest has in the past and will continue to
manage the Montana legacy for future generation through
scientific investigations, preservation, restoration, rehabilitation,
adaptive reuse (historic rental cabins), public interpretation and
overall cultural resource management.
The 1939 Helena National Forest Visitor Map is the map we
currently use to determine the baseline age of trails and roads
across the forest. The “existing and historic route” RS 2477 does
not appear on the 1939, 1959 or 1969 Helena National Forest
Visitor map; therefor we do not consider it a historic route or
cultural resource.

A full NHPA Section 106 analysis is not needed at this time
because the proposed Divide Travel Plan decision in an
administrative planning effort that does not have the potential to
cause effects to historic properties. The Advisory Council on
Historic Preservations national policy on cultural resources and
road and trail designations states…
“the following categories of proposals shall be considered
undertakings with the potential to affect historic properties,
triggering evaluation under Section 106 of the NPHA, 36 CFR
part 800 and the applicable programmatic agreements:
construction of a new road or trail; authorization of motor vehicle
use on a route currently closed to vehicles; and formal
recognition of a user-developed (unauthorized) route as a
designated route open to motor vehicles. Existing, formally
established system (classified) roads and trails, already open to
motor vehicle travel, generally need not be re-evaluated for
purpose of this rule. Their designation on a motor vehicle use

map will not generally be considered an undertaking for the
purpose of NHPA and not subject to Section 106 review.”
FSM 2364.35 states one of the administrative measures to protect
cultural resources from human-caused and environmental
damage is “Closure to public and motor vehicle access”. The
closure of historic routes or routes that lead to sensitive cultural
resources is considered a protection and preservation measure.
Cultural resources (included historic routes) could be directly
affected by permanent use and maintenance. Specifically, these
routes provide access to cultural resources and thus invite
vandalism, artifact collecting, arson, and other resourcedeceptive behavior. For example, old access roads to the late
19th Century granite quarries in Sweeney Creek have been
converted to a network of OHV trails. Because these trails now
draw attention to the old quarry ruins, many have suffered
various kinds of vandalism and abuse.

helps me stay sane even when I live thousands of miles away. We have very few
opportunities to keep areas throughout the lower 48 roadless and wild. We must
think of the lasting implications the decisions we make today have on the
environment and humans mental states in the future. I demand the designation of the
proposal Nevada Mountain and Electric Peak Wilderness, and support the nonmotorized prescription in Alternative 3. People are going to always want to ride
their snowmobiles and OHV’s in pristine landscapes, others are going to want to
extract resources in sensitive habitats, and people are just going to continue to want
to conquer. But only when the last trout has been caught and the last tree stands

Response to Comments

My family and I have lived at 7500 Priest Pass Rd since early 1993. I am a
professional geologist/hydrogeologist, and we are all avid outdoor enthusiasts.
In the 21 years that we have lived in the Sweeny Creek area we have witnessed
many changes. Most of the changes we have witnessed are the result of an increase
in motorized use and traffic in the Sweeny Creek Area. In particular, in the past 5-10
years, motorized use on motorized trail roads (MTR) and in many instances,
unauthorized trails in the Sweeny Creek area has increased several fold. The results
have been erosion of topsoil, encroachment of noxious weeds, excessive garbage,
firearm violations, destruction of private property, trespassing, harassment of
livestock on private property, noise, dust, contamination of waterquality in the
Sweeny Creek drainage just to name a few. We are increasingly saddened to watch
the assault of a publically owned natural resource by self-serving motor enthusiasts
who have the general attitude that an ATV or trail-bike gives them the right to blaze
a path on public land, and in some instances, private land where none existed. I have
witnessed numerous times during the last 5 years motorcycles and ATVs traveling
behind our property (near its east boundary) using a fire-line as an undesignated trail
to connect the network of trails such as MTR-008 with a former footpath that was
part of the Sweeny Creek Nature Trail (NE4NW4 section 27). During this time we
have experienced a bullet traveling overhead as we worked on our deck attached to
our home. We have seen aspen trees on our property vandalized and ‘cut-in-two’ by
a shotgun blast by an unknown trespasser. We have experienced trampled and/or cut
fence by hunters dragging deer across our property to access Priest Pass Road from
forest service land. We have found more than one ‘poached’ moose carcass lying
next to Priest Pass Road on USFS land in section 28 (NW4NW4). We have seen
garbage dumps of roofing shingles, wood pallets, computer parts, beer cans and
bottles at sites next to or at the end of numerous MTRs and Priest Pass Road. A

We think motorized use in the Sweeny Creek Area has reached a ‘tipping point’.
Thus, we support a decision selecting Alternatives 3 and 4, which will close all

how the USFS can allow the current system of motorized recreational use in the

on MTRs in the Sweeny Creek Area, but think strict enforcement is necessary to
change the public’s perception. Gates, fencing, and signs posting restrictions
(similar to the gate at 1802-B2) and imposing fines are needed to restrict access and
use at each trailhead location on Priest Pass Road.

Re: DEIS Comments Divide Travel Plan
Dear Mr Avery,
I offer the following comments for consideration of your Decision on the
Divide Travel Plan.
The trails (OHV) in the Rimini Road/Hwy 12 area have been used for many years. I
know the area is winter range, thus the trails must be managed with winter range
values intact. However, those trails need to remain open- May 1- Sept 30 for the
legal and reasonable use by OHV users.

(122-1) Refer to Alternative 5.

The multiple braded roads roads in the area of Blassbry, North to Hape Creek area
need closure. Please leave access, but eliminate unnecessary roads.
Consideration for access in the Spotteddog to Hat Creek Area must include access
for OHV’s. However I would urge them access be limited to –May 1 – Sept 15.
Many bow hunters abuse the closures and enforcement is lacking.
The crossing on the Little Blackfoot River needs to remain. This has been historic
use. Open the bridge if you find a ‘ford-type’ crossing excessive. However the
access to Negro Mtn needs to remain as is.
Dual-use roads needs to be on this landscape. The lack of use trails for young riders
(< legal driving age) is disgraceful. Provide opportunity.
Open the roads on Bison for a limited time.
FOIA – all correspondence with M.WA. and State of Montana.
Keep access to Kading Grade. Historic use. Older hunters want to access Forbidden

Re: Comments to the Continental Divide Travel Plan.
I am Matt Christiansen, a resident in the Sweeney Creek neighborhood and reside at
7295 Priest Pass Rd. This is across the road from the “parking area” by the cattle
guard crossing Priest Pass Rd. In recent years, this area has become a hotbed of
recreational use and unfortunately, great abuse, of our public land in the Helena
Regional Forrest.
The proximity to town has made this an easy place practice behaviors that are not
generally not acceptable in civilized society. It has become a dumping ground for
trash, old furniture, appliances, carcasses, and what I assume to be waste oil. Where
there were few roads and trails through the area, these have been multiplied into a
senseless network of roads and it now has the look and use of a motocross track.
Noxious weeds are now widely spread across the area and in spite of there being an
abundance of dead standing wood in the area, each weekend morning we find the

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 571

Comments
remains of what were healthy living trees smoldering in the abandoned fires that
burned the night before. This has become the party spot and on any weekend night
the Sheriff and
USFS law enforcement could cite dozens of illegal underage drinkers partying
around the bonfires. Unfortunately, these fires are abandoned while still burning
leaving all of us at great risk of a wildfire outbreak.

Response to Comments

Along with the noisy partying and drinking goes a lot of four-wheeling and “MudBogging” throughout the night until dawn which destroys our sleep and further
deteriorates the condition of the land and fauna. It is not uncommon to find an
overturned vehicle up there or on the road leading to the area in the mornings,
apparently the drivers too drunk to navigate even the graded roadways. I have seen
several. With the Paint -Ballers and motorcycles there all day, and the trucks and
partiers there all night there is no peace in what was once a peaceful neighborhood.
And then there are the firearms and automatic weapons that are often in use in close
proximity to homes and livestock. It is now often not safe to walk through the area
because of the indiscriminate and irresponsible use of firearms. This is something
that happens in the afternoons, after work when it would be nice to take the dogs for
a walk, but is now not safe to do so. I have confronted some who are firing very
close to our houses, some are reasonable and move on but others are not. As is so
often the case, alcohol is involved and reason is not possible.
I think it is time that something is done to bring this area back under the control of
law and order and prevent the further abuse and degradation of the forest. Many of
the residents here make trash runs through there after the parties to pick up the cans,
bottles and other trash left behind but it is getting to the point that we can’t keep up
with it. It is not an occasional occurrence, it is constant. I use the forest myself to
ride my own quad, collect firewood, walk my dogs and ride horses. I realize that
restricting access and uses of this area impacts my own freedoms to enjoy and use
our national heritage and public lands. I am however willing to give up that
privilege in this case for the better good to be done by restricting this area. Most of

the real abuse seems to come along with vehicular access, which may be the
simplest way to resolve the problem. I believe that option 3 of the Travel Plan does
that and I urge the Forest Service to adopt that action for the common good and
preservation of this portion of the Helena Regional Forest.

To Whom It May Concern:
As residents on Priest Pass Road for over 20 years (1987-2010) we support
Alternatives #3 and #4 of the Draft Divide Travel Plan. When we moved to Priest
Pass Road, it had some recreational use from off road vehicles, but over those 20
years, the damage to natural resources, threats to wildlife habitat and destructive
motorized trails multiplied. Noise from off road vehicles, and litter from users was
clearly evident in all seasons. We strongly urge expansion of a non-motorized
corridor from the ski trails on MacDonald pass north to Priest Pass and Mullan Pass,
designating Sweeney Creek-Priest Pass Road as the year round motor vehicle route.
It will take time and effort to mitigate the damage already present and we hope that
rehabilitation will occur. The recreational potential of Sweeney Creek-Priest Pass as
a non-motorized corridor is substantial and worth saving. We appreciate the
opportunity to comment on this issue.

After reviewing the proposals, and the alternative plans, I note that FS Trail 227-B 1
would be opened for winter use by snowmobiles, in alternatives 2 ,3, and 4..
Currently trail 227 B-i is used for access to the Charter Oak Mine, and is closed
year-round to motorized vehicle use, except for the occasional public tour.
In the winter it is used by skiers and snowshoers. If changed to a snowmobile trail
there would be, in my view, a conflict between the two uses. It could also lead to
vandalism, and theft at the Charter Oak Mine Site.
I also note in the alternatives the trails further up the mountain, 1857 A-3 and 1857
A-5 would be open to winter use by snowmobile.
That particular area is frequently used in the winter time by wolverine and could
possibly be used as den site.
It also is used heavily by moose during the winter.
I hope that your staff would take that information in consideration when making you
decisions.

State and Federal agencies as the state association representing off highway
recreationists in Montana.

Response to Comments

The Great Falls Trail Bike Riders Association (GFTBRA) is a MTVRA charter club
and represents the interests of motorcycle riders, ATV riders and snowmobilers
recreating on the public lands throughout Montana.
MTVRA and GFTBRA actively works to educate the public about good ethics and
the responsible use of motorized vehicles on public and private lands. We believe in
shared, multiple-use of public lands, with a reasonable balance between the
protection of the natural resources and maintaining a variety of opportunities
currently available to the people of Montana. We participate in local and state
sponsored trail maintenance projects and have served as willing and committed
partners to the multiple Forest Service Districts, The families and diverse groups of
visitors to public lands are one of Montana’s most valuable resources and thus
deserve recognition and consideration.
Comments on the DEIS:
MTVRA and GFTBRA a5ks that the trail specific comments from OHV
recreationists and CTVA be given consideration. These are the people that know the
area and are familiar with the specific trails.
MTVRA and GFTBRA asks that when developing the proposed action the OHV
component in the proposal be considered as with a ‘positive’ attitude to the potential
opportunities. This is a travel plan, not an ‘eliminate motorized recreation’.
Past USFS proposals and actions have recognized the cumulative affects the
decisions have caused, including the pressure the closures put on existing areas with
OHV trails, but do not examine or address solutions or opportunities available in

their action to mitigate the issues. Wildlife management never address the many
areas where the numbers are at their ‘objective’ or over and have a history of 50+
years of motorized recreation. Many studies are ignored as they do not support the
agency bias. To many, these managers appear to support elimination of motorized
recreation while creating a larger herd that only supports the sale of hunting license.

Response to Comments

MIVRA and GFTBRA request a fair and balanced approach to OHV management
for the Divide Area.
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on proposed actions and thank you for
your attention.

Re: Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement, CEQ # 20140069
Dear Mr. A very:
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 8 (EPA) has reviewed the
Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared by the

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 578

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
USDA Forest Service (USFS). Our comments are provided for your consideration
pursuant to our responsibilities and authority under Section 102(2)(C) of the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Section 309 of the Clean Air Act
directs the EPA to review and comment in writing on the environmental impacts of
any major federal agency action. As provided in more detail at the end of the letter,
our review has resulted in a rating of EC-l (Environmental Concerns - Adequate
Information).

Response to Comments

Project Background
The Helena National Forest (HNF) is proposing changes to the existing system of
designated motorized public access routes and prohibitions within the Divide travel
planning area for wheeled and over-snow motorized vehicles. This Draft EIS
describes the anticipated direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that
would result from the proposed changes and from the three alternatives. The area
this travel plan includes is approximately 155,500 acres of National Forest System
(NFS) lands and lies within Lewis and Clark and Powell Counties in the state of
Montana.
The Divide Travel Plan Decision will include only open or closed determinations;
decommissioning would not be specified in this decision. Any decommissioning
action resulting from this planning decision would require additional NEPA
analysis. None of the alternatives would prohibit non¬motorized activities. The
proposed changes would determine where wheeled and over-snow motorized
vehicles could access the Forest System roads and trails.
Comments and Recommendations
The EPA supports the HNF's efforts to analyze changes to the existing motorized
public access routes within the Divide travel planning area for wheeled and oversnow motorized vehicles. We also understand the usefulness of being consistent
with adjacent forest plans where roads connect. The Draft EIS appears to present

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 579

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
many trade-offs as related to potential environmental impacts. For instance, more
roads will be open to motorized over-snow vehicles, but the time period for this type
of motorized access will be shortened. In addition, a number of the roads being
opened for this use are within areas where motorized over-snow vehicles are already
allowed next to the roads. Therefore, our comments are focused on the broader
water quality impact of the general actions.

Response to Comments

The Draft EIS states that there are no effects or no easily quantifiable indirect effects
of the decision on water resources and no effort has been made to estimate sediment
delivery from the road network under each alternative. The Draft EIS also
recognizes that unpaved roads are a dominant source of sediment in streams and that
roads crossing or running alongside streams generally deliver higher sediment to
streams than roads without a hydraulic connection to a stream channel (page 148).
As shown in Draft EIS Tables 3.19 and 3.20 there are a number of streams that have
a large number of road crossings and many of these streams are already listed by the

The EPA supports the USFS in moving forward with the decommissioning of closed
roads to remove them from the landscape, which should have a positive impact on
streams near these roads. Additionally, we encourage the USFS to take steps to
prevent the use of the roads and trails not designated as system routes and move
these unauthorized routes into decommissioning.
Rating
Consistent with Section 309 of the CAA, it is the EPA's responsibility to provide an
independent review and evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of this
project. Based on the procedures the EPA uses to evaluate the adequacy of the
information and the potential environmental impacts of the proposed action, the
EPA is rating this Draft EI8 as Environmental Concerns-Adequate Information,
(EC-l). The "EC" rating indicates that the EPA review has identified environmental
impacts that need to be avoided in order to fully protect the environment. The" 1"
rating means the Draft EIS provides adequate information and analyses to disclose
project impacts. A full description of the EPA's rating system can be found at:

Dear Ranger Degeest;

Response to Comments

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Divide Travel Plan DEIS. We
believe the Divide Travel Plan Project DEIS analyses of impacts on water quality
are inadequate.(129-1)

(129-1) The Hydrology Specialist Report discusses the water
quality of streams impacted by this decision using current
available data, including water quality reports published by the
EPA and monitoring performed by Forest Service hydrology
staff. The water quality analysis in the Hydrology Specialist
Report used riparian habitat conservation areas specified by
INFISH standards intended to protect bull trout. Please see the
Fisheries Specialist Report for further discussion of impacts on
fish habitat.

The Divide Travel Plane DEIS fails to facilitate recovery of bull trout and maintains
degraded conditions in bull trout critical habitat in violation of the Endangered
Species Act. (129-2)
The DEIS does a good job describing the needs and threats to bull trout and bull
trout habitat but the Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: 1) failed to
take a hard look at all of the Project impacts on bull trout and westslope cutthroat
trout, 2) failed to ensure bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout survival and
recovery, and 3) failed to ensure a viable population of bull trout and westslope
cutthroat trout (WCT), in violation of the Helena National Forest Plan, ESA, NFMA
and NEPA. (129-3)
Bull trout are listed as a threatened species under the ESA.
WCT is designated as a Sensitive Species by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and a
Special Status Species by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
The Endangered Species Act requires that all Federal departments and agencies
shall seek to conserve endangered species and threatened species and shall utilize
their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this Act. The terms “conserve”,
“conserving”, and “conservation” mean to use and the use of all methods and
procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened
species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no
longer necessary.
Agencies did not analyze or disclose current condition of the INFISH Riparian

(129-2,129-3)The DEIS discusses the threats to bull trout and
westslope cutthroat trout habitat on pages 10 – 18 with special
attention given the spawning and rearing needs of salmonids.
Given its purpose to make an administrative decision to
designate routes as open or closed to motorized use, the scope of
the project is not focused on fish habitat recovery. However,
coordination with fisheries and watershed specialist in the
development of the project proposal and all its alternatives
focused on roads to close that likely affect fish habitat and water
quality. The fish report for the FEIS concludes that Alternatives
3 and 5 would result in closing 21.3 miles and 29.2 miles
respectively of roads deemed high risk to fish habitat in the
project area. Additionally, 46 more crossing under alternative 3
and 67 crossings under Alternative 5 would be closed. This
decision, therefore, sets the stage for fish habitat improvement
projects under a separate analysis. By doing so, this then serves
to improve and protect salmonid habitat thereby minimizing
ongoing impacts from the transportation system on the viability
of native species. Follow up formal bull trout consultation with
the USFWS is expected to result in terms and condtions outlined

By authorizing this project the Helena N.F. is not facilitating recovery of nor
“conserving” bull trout in the project area and is instead either maintaining or
further degrading bull trout habitat.
The impact of the intense sedimentation predicted across much of the watershed is
significant and substantial on fish populations. (129-8) Fish suffer many effects
from increased sedimentation. These effects range from physiological and
behavioral, where gills are injured by the passage of a high volume of abrading
sediment and foraging habits altered or interfered with due to changes in visibility in
the water, to the actual death of fish. Bull trout are very sensitive to sediment. Their
fry and juvenile stages, those that rely on interstitial habitats within the stream
gravels for protection from predators and adequate food and oxygen, suffer higher
mortality as sediment increases. Westslope cutthroat are also noted to be sensitive
to sediment for much the same reasons. Thus, the cold water fishery beneficial use
is further damaged and results in a CWA violation.
The DEIS does not model retention, which is key to estimating the impact on fish
population health in the creek. In essence, it only models the sediment coming into
the stream and ignores the length of time it might continue to degrade water quality
and fish habitat. Even so, any increase measurable in tons that is not related to an

transportation system in the context of other cumulative landuse
activities. This requires the Forest to formally consult with the
USFWS as directed in the 1998 Biological Opinion (BO) for
continued implementation of Forest Service Land and Resource
Management Plans. The 1998 BO states: “where proposed
actions likely adversely affect bull trout…the Service will need
to identify measures, associated terms and conditions, and
prepare a BO to conclude formal consultation (USDI 1998 page

the scope that would be authorized by the decision memo. The Forest Service and
the Fish and Wildlife Service are required by the ESA to recover populations not

Is there any bull trout critical habitat in the project area? If so, please re-initiate a

PACFISH/INFISH in Bull Trout Critical Habitat since critical habitat for bull trout
was designated after PACFISH and INFISH were adopted and the impact of these

INFISH were adopted before bull trout were listed so the Forest Service needs to
reinitiate a programmatic consultation on PACFISH/INFISH effect on bull trout.

The DEIS does not disclose how this project supposed improvements meet INFISH
objectives. (129-13)
According to the USFWS, four elements are necessary to asses long-term viability
(extinction risk) of bull trout populations: 1) the number of local populations, 2)
adult abundance, 3) productivity (reproductive rate), and 4) connectivity (presence
of migratory life history form). The DEIS fails to address any of the above
parameters either at the project level or the watershed level. Nor has the agency
provided documentation or discussion of the impacts threshold that the local bull
trout population can sustain. Please fix this. (129-14)
The DEIS did not adequately examine the cumulative impacts on bull trout from
grazing, it did not demonstrate that it consider the significant grazing impacts in this
watershed. A 2013 BiOp for the Mill Creek grazing allotment in the Salmon N.F.
admits that cattle will trample up to 16 bull trout redds annually, plus cause
significant habitat degradation such as sedimentation. The DEIS did not show that
the Forest Service consider this. This is a violation of NEPA, NFMA, the Clean
water Act, the APA and the ESA. There is an inadequate analysis on the cumulative
impacts on streams and bull trout and bull trout critical habitat from motorized use.
There is also an inadequate direct and cumulative impacts analysis on bull trout
from brook trout. (129-15) The DEIS did show that the Forest Service considered
brook trout expansion. Sedimentation and high temperatures exacerbate brook trout
expansion, because brook trout are more tolerant of poor water quality.
There is also an inadequate Cumulative impacts analysis on Bull Trout from all past,
present and future HNF timber sales in the watershed in violation of NEPA, NFMA,

previously consulted on with the USFWS following the species

have been reserved for the Biological Analysis, which includes

values of land are hindered or lost by conversion of native vegetation to invasive
and noxious plants. The ecological threats posed by noxious weed infestations are so
great that a former chief of the Forest Service called the invasion of noxious weeds
“devastating” and a “biological disaster.” Despite implementation of Forest Service
“best management practices” (BMPs), noxious weed infestation on the Forest is
getting worse and noxious weeds will likely overtake native plant populations if
introduced into areas that are not yet infested. The Forest Service has recognized
that the effects of noxious weed invasions may be irreversible. Even if weeds are

travel plan serves to meet elements of these recovery documents
by closing roads that risk impacts to bull trout habitat or identify
those kept open in need of mitigation or measures to eliminate
their impacts.

Invasive plant species, also called noxious weeds, are one of the greatest modern
threats to biodiversity on earth. Noxious weeds cause harm because they displace
native plants, resulting in a loss of diversity and a change in the structure of a plant
community. By removing native vegetative cover, invasive plants like knapweed
may increase sediment yield and surface runoff in an ecosystem. As well knapweed
may alter organic matter distribution and nutrient through a greater ability to uptake
phosphorus over some native species in grasslands. Weed colonization can alter fire
behavior by increasing flammability: for example, cheatgrass, a widespread noxious
weed on the Forest, cures early and leads to more frequent burning. Weed
colonization can also deplete soil nutrients and change the physical structure of
soils.
The Forest Service’s own management activities are largely responsible for noxious
weed infestations; in particular, logging, prescribed burns, and road construction and
use create a risk of weed infestations. The introduction of logging equipment into
the Forest creates and exacerbates noxious weed infestations. The removal of trees
through logging can also facilitate the establishment of noxious weed infestations
because of soil disturbance and the reduction of canopy closure In general, noxious
weeds occur in old clearcuts and forest openings, but are rare in mature and old
growth forests. Roads are often the first place new invader weeds are introduced.

ensuring the protection of soils and native plant communities. Additionally, the
omission of an alternative that includes preventive measures would violate NEPA
because the Forest Service failed to consider a reasonable alternative. (129-25)

Rare Plants
The ESA requires that the Forest Service conserve endangered and threatened
species of plants as well as animals. In addition to plants protected under the ESA,
the Forest Service identifies species for which population viability is a concern as
“sensitive species” designated by the Regional Forester (FSM 2670.44). The
response of each of the sensitive plant species to management activity varies by
species, and in some cases, is not fully known. Local native vegetation has evolved
with and is adapted to the climate, soils, and natural processes such as fire, insect
and disease infestations, and windthrow. Any management or lack of management
that causes these natural processes to be altered may have impacts on native
vegetation, including threatened and sensitive plants. Herbicide application –
intended to eradicate invasive plants – also results in a loss of native plant diversity
because herbicides kill native plants as well as invasive plants. Although native
species have evolved and adapted to natural disturbance such as fire on the
landscape, fires primarily occur in mid to late summer season, when annual plants
have flowered and set seed. Following fall fires, perennial root-stocks remain
underground and plants emerge in the spring. Spring and early summer burns could
negatively impact emerging vegetation and destroy annual plant seed.
The DEIS does not adequately examine what threatened, endangered, rare and
sensitive plant species and habitat are located within the proposed project area in

The Endangered Species Act requires the FS to insure that the Divide Travel Plan
project is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical

critical habitat are those that alter the physical and biological features to an extent

Management Direction (NRLMD).
Because of instructions in the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction appeal
decision the Forest Service is required to consult with the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service (USFWS). The Forest Service did not consult with the USFWS
regarding lynx, which is a violation of the Endangered Species Act.
The NRLMD as applied in the Divide Travel Plan project violates the ESA by
failing to use the best available science to insure no adverse modification of critical
habitat. The Forest Service must consult on the NRLMD in lynx critical habitat
before this project can be approved. (129-28) The NRLMD carves out exemptions
from Veg Standards S1, S2, S5, and S6. In particular, fuel treatment projects may
occur in the WUI even though they will not meet standards Veg S1, S2, S5, or S6,
provided they do not occur on more than 6% of lynx habitat on each National
Forest. See NRLMD ROD, Attachment 1, pages 2-3. Allowing the agency to
destroy or adversely modify any lynx critical habitat has the potential to appreciably
reduce the conservation value of such habitat. The agency cannot simply set a cap at
6% forest-wide without looking at the individual characteristics of each LAU to
determine whether the project has the potential to appreciably reduce the
conservation value. The ESA requires the use of the best available science at the
site-specific level. It does not allow the agencies to make a gross determination that
allowing 6% of lynx critical habitat to be destroyed forest-wide will not appreciably
reduce the conservation value.

all standards and guidelines of the NRLMD [Wildlife
Background Report, p. 203
(129-27) The ESA does not require, nor does it desire that the
Forest Service consult on multiple alternatives in NEPA
documents. Consultation applies only to the final decision (as
presented in the ROD). In this case, a Biological Assessment
(BA) will be prepared and submitted to the USFWS once a
decision has been developed. This is the standard form of
informal consultation between the Forest Service and the
USFWS that has been ongoing since the inception of the
Endangered Species Act. Informal consultation is appropriate,
since the BA will follow the EIS in concluding that the Travel
Plan “may affect but is not likely to adversely affect” the lynx
[Wildlife Background Report, p. 194-201, 203-204].

(129-28) No alternative in the Travel Plan proposes to alter
vegetation. The VEG standards in the NRLMD do not apply.

connectivity, and snow compaction are discussed in Wildlife

The FS also states that the project will result in disturbance to lynx in the project
area and that lynx will move to an undisturbed area of the home range during project
implementation.
In December 1999, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management completed
their “Biological Assessment Of The Effects Of National Forest Land And Resource
Management Plans And Bureau Of Land Management Land Use Plans On Canada
Lynx” (Programmatic Lynx BA). The Programmatic Lynx BA concluded that the
current programmatic land management plans “may affect, and are likely to
adversely affect, the subject population of Canada lynx.” The Lynx BA team
recommended amending or revising Forest Plans to incorporate conservation
measures that would reduce or eliminate the identified adverse effects on lynx. The
Programmatic Lynx BA’s determination means that Forest Plan implementation is a
“taking” of lynx, and makes Section 7 formal consultation on the HNF Plan
mandatory, before actions such as the proposed project are approved. (129-29)
Continued implementation of the Forest Plan constitutes a “taking” of the lynx.
Such taking can only be authorized with an incidental take statement, issued as part
of a Biological Opinion (B.O.) during of Section 7 consultation. The HNF must
incorporate terms and conditions from a programmatic B.O. into a Forest Plan
amendment or revision before projects affecting lynx habitat, such as this one, can
be authorized.
The Programmatic Lynx BA’s “likely to adversely affect” conclusion was based
upon the following rationale. Plans within the Northern Rockies:
generally direct an aggressive fire suppression strategy within developmental land
allocations. …this strategy may be contributing to a risk of adversely affecting the
lynx by limiting the availability of foraging habitat within these areas.
allow levels of human access via forest roads that may present a risk of incidental
trapping or shooting of lynx or access by other competing carnivores. The risk of
road-related adverse effects is primarily a winter season issue. (129-30)

(129-29) The 1999 Programmatic Lynx BA was produced in
anticipation of the Lynx being listed as a threatened species in
2000. It documented the conditions that had made it necessary to
list the lynx, and it was followed in 2000 by the Canada Lynx
Conservation Assessment and Strategy (CLCAS), which detailed
the conservation measures that the National Forests needed to
adopt in order to recover the lynx. The Helena NF has been
following the CLCAS standards and guidelines since 2000 and
their modified version in the Northern Rockies Lynx
Management Direction (NRLMD) since 2007. These latter
standards and guidelines were amended into the Helena Forest
Plan in 2007. By following this guidance, Forest Plan
implementation does not represent a “taking” of the lynx.
See the discussion in the NRLMD ROD (2007) (p. 1-3, 42)and

forest management has resulted in a reduction of the area in which natural
ecological processes were historically allowed to operate, thereby increasing the
area potentially affected by known risk factors to lynx. The Plans have continued
this trend. The Plans have also continued the process of fragmenting habitat and
reducing its quality and quantity. Consequently, plans may risk adversely affecting
lynx by potentially contributing to a reduction in the geographic range of the
species.
The BA team recommends amending or revising the Plans to incorporate
conservation measures that would reduce or eliminate the identified adverse effects
to lynx. The programmatic conservation measures listed in the Canada Lynx

The Programmatic Lynx BA notes that the LCAS identifies the following risk
factors to lynx in this geographic area:
Timber harvest and precommercial thinning that reduce denning or foraging habitat
or converts habitat to less desirable tree species
Fire exclusion that changes the vegetation mosaic maintained by natural disturbance
processes
Grazing by domestic livestock that reduces forage for lynx prey
Roads and winter recreation trails that facilitate access to historical lynx habitat by
competitors (129-33)
Legal (in Montana) and incidental trapping and shooting
Predation
Being hit by vehicles
Obstructions to lynx movements such as highways (129-33)and private land

As evidenced by the fact that the Canada lynx is now listed under the Endangered
Species Act and has potential critical habitat in the project area, it is clear that the
HNF must do more that follow its Forest Plan’s weak protections provided for lynx.

If the landscape has been fragmented by past management activities that reduced the
quality of lynx habitat, adjust management practices to produce forest composition,

historical disturbance regimes.
The LCAS sets mandatory Standards that would modify or amend the Forest Plan—
steps the HNF has thus far not accomplished. Important Programmatic Standards
include:
Identify key linkage areas that may be important in providing landscape
connectivity within and between geographic areas, across all ownerships. (LCAS at

north and south centered on the Continental Divide, and a second
crossing private land in the upper Prickly Pear valley connecting
the Divide with the Elkhorn Landscape to the east. The first of
these is in the Divide Travel Plan Area, the second is not. The
Wildlife Background Report discusses linkage through the Plan
Area in terms of wildlife species in general (p. 30-40, 138-146)
and for lynx in particular (p. 92, 96-97, 192-194, 198-201, 201203). The Divide Travel Plan, the primary thrust of which is the
closing of Numerous Forest roads, will not negatively impact
habitat linkage for lynx. Nor is it the role of a travel planning
project to tackle and solve programmatic issues of vegetation
management.

the logging activities have stopped. These roads/access routes can also impact lynx
habitat during all seasons because of increased access for humans.

are discussed specifically with regard to lynx (p. 91, 98, 192196).

From Ruggiero, et al. (1999: “Lynx metapopulation dynamics operate at regional

(129-40) These effects are discussed in the Wildlife Background
Report (p. 98, 193-197). All Travel Plan action alternatives
would reduce the mileage of over-the-snow routes in lynx habitat
and the acreage available for off-route snowmobile riding

Wolverine
The wolverine was recently determined to be warranted for listing under the ESA.

The wolverine, which was chosen by the Forest Service as a management indicator
species for the project area, was recently determined to be warranted for listing
under the ESA. (129-42) 75 Fed. Reg.78030 (Dec. 14, 2010). It is currently a
candidate species, waiting for work to be completed on other species before it is
officially listed. The USFWS found that “[s]ources of human disturbance to
wolverines include . . . road corridors and extractive industry such as logging …”
The Forest Service admits that the wolverine and/or its habitat are present within the
project area and would be impacted by the project. The ESA, APA, NFMA and
NEPA require that the Forest Service must go through ESA consultation for the
wolverine for this project.
Attached is the Forest Service's Region 1 guidance to its wildlife biologists
regarding wolverine. It directs them not to analyze wolverine in a biological
assessment and not to send their analyses to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. (12943)
This is illegal because the ESA regulations require that proposed species be
addressed in a biological assessment to reach a jeopardy/no jeopardy conclusion,
and then the Forest Service must give the biological assessment to FWS for their
concurrence.

(129-42) The wolverine is no longer a candidate for listing under
the ESA. After an 18 month review of the latest scientific
information, the USFWS withdrew its initial proposal to list the
woverine as a threatened species in August 2014. The wolverine
remains a sensitive species in USFS Region 1, but it is not a
management indicator species for the Divide Travel Plan Area or
elsewhere on the Helena NF (Wildlife Background Report, p.
100).

(129-43) The USFS guidance is from March 2013, shortly after
the USFWS released its proposal to initiate a review of the
wolverine and its suitability for listing under the ESA. In this
proposal, the USFWS indicated that climate change was the
primary threat to the species: management activities of the USFS
and other agencies were not identified as threats—and in all but
extraordinary cases such activity would result in “no jeopardy”
determinations. USFS guidance was not to forgo analysis of the
wolverine, but simply not to include those that reached “no
jeopardy” determinations in Biological Assessments. This
guidance was developed at the request of the USFWS and
applied to the period prior to the listing of the wolverine. After
listing, the analyses were to be included in Biological
Assessments regardless of the determinations. In the end, the
wolverine was not listed—and the 2013 guidance has been moot
since August 2014.

Wolverines generally scavenge for ungulates along valley bottoms and forage and
den in remote, high-elevation areas (Hornocker and Hash 1981; Morgan and
Copeland 1998). Thus if mangers wished to provide habitat for wolverines, they
could pay particular attention in the planning process to ungulates winter range and
other aspects of habitat quality for ungulates to provide a consistent supply of
carcasses for wolverine to scavenge. In addition, wolverines generally avoid areas of
human activity. To limit the threat of human-caused disturbance or mortality,
managers could restrict access to portions of the landscape where wolverines are
most likely to occur.

effects were documented in a USFS Biological Assessment (BA)
in December 2006, which determined that they were “not likely
to adversely affect” the lynx. The USFWS BO concurred with
that determination [see transmittal letter for USFWS biological

The 2012 NFMA planning rule “requires the use of best available scientific
information to inform planning and plan decisions." Please demonstrate you are
following this requirement.
This final planning rule requires that land management plans provide for ecological
sustainability and contribute to social and economic sustainability,
using public input and the best available scientific information to inform plan
decisions. How are you complying with this?
The new planning rule says that Responsible officials will use the best available
scientific information to inform the plan components and the monitoring program.
Are you doing this?

The rule states, “Third, Modified Alternative A requires the responsible official to
develop coarse-filter plan components, and fine-filter plan components where
necessary, to provide the desired ecological conditions necessary to maintain viable
populations of species of conservation concern within the plan
area, or to contribute to maintaining a viable population of a species of conservation
concern across its range where it is not within the Agency’s
authority or is beyond the inherent capability of the plan area to provide the
ecological conditions to maintain a viable population of that species within
the plan area.”Are you meeting this requirement?
The rule says, “Species of conservation concern are those plant and animal species
whose long-term persistence within the plan area is of known conservation concern.
The rule requires that species of conservation concern must be ‘‘known to occur in
the plan area’’ and that the regional forester identify the species of conservation

concern for which ‘‘the best available scientific information indicates substantial
concern about the species’ capability to persist over the long term in the plan area.’’
The rule states, “The Department has considered the concerns raised by many that
the requirement for maintaining viable populations of species of conservation
concern on the plan area is an impossible task and that attempting to meet this
requirement will come at the cost of all other management of the NFS lands. The
Department concludes that Modified Alternative A provides a more holistic,
consistent, realistic, and effective approach to maintaining native fish, wildlife, and
plant species on national forests and grasslands than provided under the 1982 rule,
while meeting restoration goals and the mandate of multiple use.
Modified Alternative A recognizes that there are limits to the Agency’s authority
and the inherent capability of the land, whereas the 1982 rule required management
prescriptions to ‘‘[p]rovide for adequate fish and wildlife habitat to maintain viable
populations of [all] existing native vertebrate species,’’ (See 1982 rule at § 219.27
(a)(6)) regardless of whether there are circumstances outside of the authority or the
control of the Agency. Examples of circumstances that may be outside of the
Agency’s authority or the inherent capability of the plan area are provided above in
the rationale for non-selection of Alternative B.
The Department concludes the management emphasis on species of conservation
concern is more focused than the viability provisions under the 1982 rule, which
included all vertebrate species whether there was concern about their persistence in
the plan area or not. Since these species may be wide ranging or may occur on
multiple units, the regional forester, in coordination with the responsible official,
will identify species of conservation concern. Requiring that the regional forester
identify species of conservation concern will increase consistency across units and
build efficiency into the Agency’s collective efforts to maintain the diversity of
plant and animal communities.
The Department also considered the challenges the Forest Service has faced in
monitoring management indicator species (MIS) under the 1982 rule. MIS
monitoring has been the subject of much of the legal debate around the species
provisions of the 1982 rule. Modified Alternative A does not include requirements
to designate MIS or monitor their population trends. The concept of MIS as a

surrogate for the status of other species is not supported by current science, and
population trends are difficult and sometimes impossible to determine within the In
the final rule, MIS monitoring has been replaced with monitoring of focal species.
The concept of focal species is well supported in the scientific literature and
community. Focal species are not surrogates for the status of other species. Focal
species monitoring provides information regarding the effectiveness of the plan in
providing the ecological conditions necessary to maintain the diversity of plant and
animal communities and the persistence of native species in the plan area." Modified
Alternative A does not require or prohibit monitoring of population trends of focal
species. Instead, it allows the use of any existing or emerging approaches for
monitoring the status of focal species that are supported by current science.
Monitoring methods for evaluating the status of focal species may include measures
of abundance, distribution, reproduction, presence/absence, area occupied, survival
rates, or others.”
"Section 219.3 of the final rule requires the responsible official to document how the
best available scientific information was used to inform the
assessment, plan decision, and design of the monitoring program. Such
documentation must: identify what information was determined to be the
best available scientific information, explain the basis for that determination, and

Response to Comments

The issue for elk is not population levels, but vulnerability. This is addressed in the
Helena Forest Plan by measuring the harvest of bulls the first week of hunting, and
by the MFWP by the post-season bull/cow ratio. Yet there is basically no analysis of
how the project will affect elk vulnerability. The current situation is unknown. The
expected changes in vulnerability are not identified.
The Helena Forest Plan grizzly bear standard of 0.55 miles per section in occupied
habitat is a poor measurement of road densities, as local areas of high road densities
are washed out by roadless areas. A more meaningful analysis could be provided by
addressing the current best science for grizzly bears whereby road densities outside
security areas are measured separately. Smaller analysis areas would also enable the
agency to identify areas where road densities between security areas are excessive,
and where they could be reduced through travel planning.
The DEIS did not indicate why the moving windows analysis was not also
completed for the grizzly bear distribution area. This could show areas that need
improvement, as in #2 above.
There is no discussion in the DEIS as to what the current level of incidental take of
grizzly bears is within the recovery zone as well as the distribution area. What is the
criteria for measuring incidental take in these two areas, and is it being met with
either action alternative?
The DEIS noted that the elk security areas will benefit grizzly bears. However, it
was noted that grizzly bears are dependent upon dense cover, and the Forest Plan
amendment for elk security areas does not require any hiding cover. This should be
addressed in effects.
There does not appear to be any access requirements for grizzly bears in the
distribution zone. How can incidental take of grizzly bears be addressed without

this?
Are there any management recommendations in the Biological Opinion for grizzly
bears in the Helena Forest Plan for grizzly bears in the distribution zone? It seems
unlikely that these don’t exist, however they are never mentioned.
The low elevation areas required by grizzly bears in the spring are also the areas
most likely to be impacted by roads. The DEIS did not address potential problem
areas for bear spring use versus motorized routes, except for snowmobile use.
It is not clear why the snowmobile use of grizzly bear spring use is allowed when
core habitat is deficient in the Red Mountain subunit.
There is no discussion as to how mountain bike use could affect grizzly bear
security, even though many areas will have new bike trails constructed through
them. How do you know this will have no effect of grizzly bear security, and how
were these new trails planned in regards to grizzly bears? (129-48)
The DEIS notes that lands acquired from Plum Creek and the Nature Conservancy
will have increased motorized use. The location of these lands is not mapped. The
impact on grizzly bear security is not identified. The actual plans for motorized
access in these new lands is never discussed. If public access has not been allowed
previously, why is new access planned when it will harm grizzly bears? (129-49)
The definition of open and total roads is never provided in the DEIS as per grizzly
bears. If a road is simply closed, and not obliterated to prevent any type of human
use, then it is still a road. There was no information in the DEIS as to whether
decommissioned roads are considered a road or not a road. The Interagency Grizzly
Bear Committee (IGBC) criteria for roads identifies a road as a road unless it has
been obliterated. The DEIS should be more clear in this regard. It appears that the
DEIS has provided false information on the change in total roads, as roads put in
cold storage are not being counted as roads, as far as we could tell, when they are
still roads as per the IGBC criteria. (129-50)
The IGBC criteria for roads also require that gated roads count as open roads due to
administrative use. Yet this was not clarified in the DEIS. In order to classified as a
restricted road, it has to have some type of barrier so that no use occurs, including
administrative use. (129-51)

grizzly bears?
The open road density in the distribution zone may be very high, since the total
landscape, including roadless lands, averages 1.6 miles per section. The
management of roads in key areas between security areas was not addressed, which
as we noted previously, is important for making security areas functional to bears.
The DEIS never provided an analysis of the effect of keeping road on the system (in
cold storage) versus obliterating them. This is important to grizzly bears as roads in
cold storage will be intermittently opened for use, which this will not occur if roads
are obliterated. We are not sure how the DEIS would get at this, but there is clearly
a need to address the longer-term management of roads. How did the agency make
the decision to keep a road in cold storage versus obliterating the road for long term
grizzly bear security?
The grizzly bear linkage areas were not mapped. Please map them. The travel
management decisions for these particular areas are thus never outlined to the
public. It would seem that closure of motorized access routes within linkage areas
would have a higher priority that closures in other areas. The effect of opening
newly-acquired lands to motorized access, as well as the new construction of
mountain bike trails could also impact linkage zones, and should have been
addressed. (129-50)
The DEIS notes that road management decisions were based on long term
management objectives, including timber harvest. Yet the rationale for various
closures in regards to future timber management was never addressed. This is an
important part of the travel plan, as the agency is basically outlining areas where
they want to maintain road access for future timber harvest, including the numerous
foreseeable projects outlined in the DEIS. The tradeoffs required in deciding
whether to keep or obliterate a road in order to have timber harvest in the future was
never addressed in the DEIS. The public has basically no idea of why certain roads
will be kept on the system. The travel plan is basically a land use plan, without any
underlying information being provided as to why the future land uses were
determined to be more important than long-term improvements for wildlife.

Approximately 116 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail are
managed by the Helena National Forest, with most of the unfinished trail sections
located on the Helena Ranger District in the area covered by the Divide Travel Plan.
The long-delayed Divide Travel Plan is of pivotal importance to Montana High
Divide Trails Partnership; directly affecting the future of proposed wilderness,
proposed quiet trail and wildlife conservation areas and the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail.
THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE NATIONAL SCENIC TRAIL
Of special importance to county residents is the future of the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail and the special values of the Helena National Forest lands
traversed by America's longest and most scenic mountain trail.
- Lewis and Clark County Board of Commissioners
For nearly a thousand miles, the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail twists
from Yellowstone north to Canada. It's a rugged and majestic mountain landscape,
big enough to alter weather systems and send streams and rivers rushing to Oceans
on opposite sides of the Earth.
The CDT links national parks, wilderness and national forest wild lands harboring
vibrant and rare communities of wildlife along the backbone of the Continent.
As our western valleys fill and grow, this great mountain chain will only remain as
strong as it's weakest links. Nowhere is this more true tl1an on the Helena Ranger
District where national forest lands along the Divide narrow and surrounding private
lands and inholdings are increasingly developed.

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE TRAVEL PLAN
In the 14 years since the Helena National Forest initiated Travel Planning along the
Continental Divide years of neglect have damaged resources, scarred the land,
sanctioned illegal use1 and diminished wild lands.
We recognize that you and Supervisor Avey inherited the consequences of past
neglect and wish to offer our assistance and cooperation in moving forward to
restore responsible recreation and stewardship along the Divide.
With this in mind we offer the following unified recommendations for the Draft
Divide Travel Plan. Thank you for your time and consideration.

BACKBONE OF THE HELENA NATIONAL FOREST
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDT) is the longest and wildest of
America's "triple crown" congressionally -designated mountain trails.
The CDT enters the Helena National Forest in the headwater s of the Little
Blackfoot and runs north along the Continental Divide into the Scapegoat
Wilderness.
In recent years, the Helena National Forest, with the enthusiastic support of
volunteers from Montana High Divide Trails, Back Country Horsemen, mountain
bikers, Prickly Pear Land Trust and the Montana Wilderness Association's CDTMontana has made welcome progress toward completing and protecting the
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.

Response to Comments

When completed, the CDT will be the longest trail on the Helena National Forest,
offering public access to quiet mountain trails and untrammeled open spaces. Just as
highways become corridors that link development, trails can serve as corridors of
conservation; linking special places and cherished values with people and
communities along the way.
The Draft Divide Travel Plan is a long-awaited decision setting the future of nearly
75 miles of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and majestic surrounding
wild lands:

Response to Comments

The Divide Travel Plan affects 74 miles (nearly two-thirds) of the CDNST on the
Helena National Forest, making pivotal decisions on surrounding area travel
management and trail segments.
The Draft EIS (Appendix A) mistakenly states that forest plan direction for the
Continental Divide Trail is "not applicable" to the Divide Travel Plan. (See Table
A-1 Forestwide Standards and Forest Plan Consistency (page 1, Appendix A).
Here is the CDNST forest plan standard applicable in the Divide Travel Plan:
Once the comprehensive plan is approved, management direction will be
incorporated further into this plan. Based on the Comprehensive Plan, a more
detailed analysis will be completed showing trail segments, objectives and specific
route locations
Forest Plan direction is to incorporate and follow management direction in the
approved CDNST Comprehensive Plan, with "detailed analysis" including travel
management of trail segments and surrounding area "objectives" "Based on the
Comprehensive Plan."

The (revised) CDNST Comprehensive Plan was signed by Chief Tidwell in October
2009.2
This Plan:
"..Sets forth direction to guide the development and management of the
CDNST...and replaces the 1985 CDNST Comprehensive Plan." (page 1)
The 2009 Comprehensive Plan require that:

The Divide Travel Plan will make decisions affecting both recreation and
conservation purposes of the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail on the
Helena National Forest.
The CDNST and the natural, cultural and historic resources along its corridor are
year­ round resources intended to provide "high-quality" non-motorized recreation
and to conserve natural values within the CDNST corridor in all seasons.

The "nature and purposes" of the CDNST are spelled out in the 2009 Continental

The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail was established by an Act of Congress
on November 10, 1978 (16 USC 1244(a)). The nature and purposes of the CDNST
are to provide for high-quality scenic, primitive hiking and horseback riding
opportunities and to conserve natural, historic, and cultural resources along the
CDNST corridor. (emphasis added)

Response to Comments

The Continental Divide Trail includes recreation and conservation purposes:
"to provide for high-quality" non-motorized recreation
"to conserve natural, historic, and cultural resources along the CDNST corridor."
Decisions made in the Divide Travel Plan -management of trail segments and
surrounding area travel management- directly affect recreation and conservation
purpose of the CDNST.
The CDNST and the special values of its surrounding corridor are year-round
resources . Quiet winter recreation is expressly cited in the Comprehensive Plan as
meeting the nature and purposes of the CDNST. 4 Natural, historic and cultural
values likewise require conservation in all seasons.
As a year-round travel plan, the effects of Divide alternatives on CDT purposes
must be evaluated year-round.
To fulfill these purposes, the Comprehensive Plan directs forest managers to
evaluate the effects of proposed alternatives using the Recreation Opportunity
Spectrum (ROS) which measures the effects of area travel decisions on CDT
landscapes, as well as trail segments.
"Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management managers will classify the
CDNST opportunities based on the existing or proposed ROS classes through which
the trail passes. Both agencies will use ROS inventory and management processes to
develop management prescriptions ..."
(2009 CDNST CP, page 15)
Recognizing that the 3100-mile CDNST must cross roads and highways where it is
not possible to modify settings, the 2009 Comprehensive Plan directs forest
managers to evaluate and make decisions that result in non-motorized ROS settings
"where possible."

The Divide Travel Plan EIS lacks a "detailed analysis" showing the effects of area
travel management surrounding specific CDNST segments, as required by the
Forest Plan, EO 11644 and the 2009 CDNST Comprehensive Plan.
A first step in the analysis of area management surrounding the CDNST is to
determine where it is "possible" to provide area non-motorized settings. Alternative
travel scenarios can then be evaluated to determine which best meets CDNST
purposes and direction. Table 1 illustrates this:

motorized users which can be successfully implemented, easily understood by
recreationists, and more enforceable with delineations between motorized and non­
motorized use. The establishment of non-motorized use will benefit various natural
resources including wildlife habitat, wildlife populations as well as ensure quality
winter quiet areas and protection of pristine areas. Implementation of motorized
areas will benefit users with lands that provide a high quality experience of both a
trail system and "play" areas.

Response to Comments

A great deal of discussion has occurred between the Forest Service and user groups.
In May 200S, the Montana Snowmobile Association, Ponderosa Snow Warriors,
Helena Snow Drifters, Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks and the Montana Wilderness
Association developed a Winter Use Agreement where the groups agreed to areas in
the project area where motorized and non-motorized use would be allowed for
winter travel in the Blackfoot, Continental Divide landscapes. The Helena National
Forest committed to considering the Winter Use Agreement ...

Before the Winter Travel Plan was signed by Supervisor Avey (Sept. 2013), Helena
Ranger District lands were dropped from the winter plan; with the promise to
analyze these lands and the winter agreement in the Divide Travel Plan.
The Draft DEIS, however does not include any alternative that reflects HRD lands
from the OS Winter Recreation Agreement . There is no map, analysis or
explanation of the North Divide Winter Agreement Area on the Helena Ranger
District. 12
Chapter 3 of DEIS entitled "Consistency with Adjacent National Forest Travel
Planning" (page SS) contains no map or description of travel management on
adjoining Lincoln Ranger District.

Trail 4401-El has been closed to snowmobile use for decades to protect wildlife. 13

Response to Comments

The DEIS fails to disclose how opening closed trail 4401-El and the Nevada
Mountain Roadless Area to snow vehicles will affect wildlife, proposed wilderness,
adjacent Non­ motorized lands and the historic natural character of the Continental
Divide.
The Nevada Mountain Roadless Area and adjoining winter ranges include the
highest diversity of wildlife species anywhere on the Helena Ranger District
including lynx, wolverine, fisher, moose, denning grizzlies 14 and elk herds which
may be adversely affected by the failure to limit over snow motor vehicle travel.
Nevada Mountain provides ideal lynx habitat including "boreal forest landscapes
supporting a mosaic of differing successional forest stages," and "winter snow
conditions that are generally deep and fluffy for extended periods of time..."
Lynx are sensitive to expansion of over snow vehicle tracks and use areas.

13 DEIS page 292 para.I .discloses that 77 miles of roads "closed to motorized use
year-round, have been regularly used by snowmobilers" and that this illegal vehicle
use "has not been challenged by the HNF." The DEIS proposes to reward lawbreaking by opening 77 miles of currently non-motorized trails and roads for
snowmobile and tracked ORV driving including the Continental Divide Trail and
Trail 4401-El in the Nevada Mountain proposed Wilderness.

Both Alternative #4 and #3 rehabilitates extensive motor vehicle damage to natural

degradation over the years. Motorized tracks have grown and expanded without
authorization or public involvement (therefore, illegally); it has developed into a
backyard "kegger" site with resulting trash and litter prevalent; trees and vegetation
cut, damaged or destroyed. While a variety of interests have created these problems
there is one common denominator behind these illegal, resource-damaging activities
-they are all stem from abuse by motor vehicles.
We highly recommend not rewarding illegal vehicle use and activities.

SUMMARY RECOMMENDATIONS
Montana High Divide Trails respectfully requests a new alternative (3A) be devised
for the Final Divide Travel Plan that corrects major oversights and fully recognizes
and conserves the outstanding long-term values of the Continental Divide on the
Helena Ranger District including the Nevada and Bison Mountain Roadless Areas,
and the CDT Corridor Between MacDonald Pass and Greenhorn Mountain. (13021)
While we support and commend specific elements of alternatives 3, 4 and 1 (no
action), we cannot endorse any as a result of significant flaws and the failure of the
DEIS to evaluate and conserve the full range of values of the Continental Divide and
Continental Divide Trail; so greatly affected by the Divide Travel Plan. (130-22)

Montana High Divide Trails - PLEDGE OF COOPERATION
Our common goal is to participate fully in the public process with the goal of
significant improvements for managing the Continental Divide in the final Divide
Travel Plan.
The nine member groups of Montana High Divide Trails offer our continuing pledge
to work cooperatively to:
Assist Helena Ranger District District to secure new funds and partnerships that help
achieve goals of Montana High Divide Trails.
Enlist volunteers from conservation, hiking, equestrian, bicycling and other
communities to cooperate with national forest managers to maintain, restore and
construct quiet mountain trails for public use and enjoyment.

I am writing to provide my input for the Divide Travel Plan. Thank you for this
opportunity.
There are several aspects of this plan that are very disappointing. My
recommendation is to begin with alternative #3 and then work to improve it.
Specifically, consider making all of the Continental Divide Trail, not already on an
approved vehicle road, non-motorized. I have recently hiked this entire segment
with visiting friends. We saw much vehicle damage and were looking forward to the
USFS following Congressional direction and making the CD trail quiet and nonmotorized. It appears under your plan not even one-third of the trail in your District
will be non-motorized. You can do better. (132-1)

(132-1) Refer To Alternative 5.

(132-2) Refer to Alternative 5.
-Please keep all of Nevada Mountain roadless all year long. Nevada Mountain is
one of the few large roadless areas left in the Helena area. Keep the CD trail and the
trails in that area which access the CD trail non-motorized. (132-2)
-For many years many of us in Helena have fought to protect all the roadless land in
the Electric Peak – Little Blackfoot area. Frequently we witness vehicle damage in
this area.
Recently I have discovered major damage done by motorized vehicles in your area.
Examples are Bill Creek Trail, Crystal Creek in the Elkhorns, Sweeney Creek, the
list goes on. The USFS response is always, “We don’t have adequate law
enforcement.” No doubt this is true. But, why would you increase motorized use if
you know it will lead to more damage. Better to close roads if you can’t protect the
Forest.
Thanks for the opportunity to weigh in. The general sentiment among those who
have reviewed your plan is that you have failed to protect our Forest.

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
From: Leonard A. Walch, 1229 Hollins Ave., Helena, Mt. 59601
Below are my comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the
Divide Travel Plan.
1. The decision to limit designations to open and closed for the Forest Service
system existing routes and the unauthorized routes does not give the public a clear
picture of how resources such as water and fisheries will benefit; rather most of all
the ongoing negative effects to watershed and fisheries will continue. From the
initial comments from the public which are mentioned in the DEIS it seems the
public wants to see how the Forest plans to protect natural resources while providing
for the travel network. With the current open closed approach in the DEIS, both the
hydrology and fisheries effects sections acknowledge that there is only a small
benefit to be gained from the re-vegetation that may occur on a closed road, but both
discussions also point out that all the crossings and sediment delivery sites will
remain in place for the time being. Without determining whether some of the closed
roads will be: decommissioned, placed in long term storage with crossings removed,
or left in place for administrative needs it is hard to say how this project is moving
forward to address problems for native and listed fish needs or TMDLs. I suggest
that wording be added to the Features Common to All Alternatives and the
cumulative effects appendix specifically stating that it is reasonably forseeable that
planning will begin to determine such things as: which roads will be
decommissioned, which roads may be put in long term storage, which roads will be
left in place for admin needs, and the priorities for upgrade and maintenance of open
and closed roads to reduce their effects on watershed and fisheries.(136-1) Without
commitment to complete that additional planning I would maintain that the Forest is
not meeting the intent of the minimization statement for the project or the Inland
Native Fish Strategy which was amended to the Helena Forest Plan. (136-2) The
Biological Opinion that was completed for bull trout on the Helena Forest’s
Blackfoot Winter Travel Plan required the type of detailed planning discussed above
be completed in a timely manner upon implementation of the Blackfoot Winter

4. Relative to this project to administratively chose whether a
route is open or closed to motorized use, tables on pages 205,
210, and 214 summarize the miles of high risk roads and
crossings that would be closed under alternatives 2, 3 and 4
respectively to help meet these standards. Additionally, a new
alternative 5 was added in the FEIS to respond to comments for
the DEIS in order to more aggressively addressthe issue of road
erosion/sedimentation as a function of high risk roads identified
throughout the project area.
(136-3) Refer to Appendix E in the EIS.
(136-4) Refer To Alternative 5.
(136-5) Alternatives 1 and 2 would keep road 227-E1 open above
Kading Campground. All other alternatives close this extension.
In maintaining consistency with mitigation for open fords in
listed bull trout habitat, measures to protect the channel from
direct vehicle disturbance until a bridge or similar structure can
be installed would be considered as part of the decision for the
Divide Travel Project.Hydro/Fish – Design Criteria
(136-5) We agree with this comment. Route 227-E1 is
hydraulically connected to the Little Blackfoot River and has an
increased potential to deliver sediment. In Alternative 5, FSR#
227 would be closed at the turnaround above Kading
Campground yearlong to all wheeled-motorized travel.
(136-7) Refer To Alternative 5.

concerns over snowmobile trails and wheeled motorized access

Travel Plan. Given the importance of many of the drainages in the Divide Travel
Project Area to native fish species, the Forest Service should specify the sort of
planning discussed above be required to be completed within one year rather than
waiting for the Fish and Wildlife Service to require it.
2. I feel it would be useful for the summary of the EIS to address how the issues
are addressed by the proposed alternative as well as the other alternatives presented
in the document. Regarding concern over effects to natural resources (one of the
issues), the DEIS does include the info in the individual specialist reports for a
person to sort through. It would be helpful to include some narrative in the
summary as to the degree natural resources are protected in the narrative instead of
only stating that the laws, regulations and forest plan will be met with the
alternatives.
3. Regarding Alternative 2--In the summary (page 6) there is a statement that there
are 40 miles closed yearlong, but it is unclear as to how that figure is determined.
Are these an overall net miles of closure? It seems like there should be inclusion of
some statement that a number of currently closed roads are going to be opened and
how those miles compare to miles of road that are open which will be closed. It
would be good to try to clearly explain in the narrative the magnitude of full closure
and partial closure compared to how much road is fully open and partially open.
(136-3) I could not find a clear explanation in the narrative addressing my concern
in the main DEIS either. It is left to the reader to try to sort through the tables to
determine how the numbers vary by alternative. For clarity to the readers it would
be good to include all the alternatives on a single table in the summary chapter with
that table showing all the various categories of closures and openings rather than
having each alternative shown against the no action alternative in separate tables.
Then a narrative could refer to the table and discuss the significance of various
changes.
4. Of the four alternatives presented in the DEIS Alternative 3 as presented is the
best in that it closes the most roads that pose risk to watershed and fishery resources.

to get to snowmobile unloading points were brought forward into
planning. A product from those internal discussions resulted in a
map displaying locations of all designated snowmobile parking
areas to ensure none would be located that would risk rutting of
the road prism on high risk road segments. There are five
designated snowmobile parking areas with only one located in
the Little Blackfoot River. This parking area is located in the
vicinity of the Charter Oak turnoff to avoid high risk road
segments beyond that point where rutting due to wheeled vehicle
use to reach snowmobile routes would be avoided.
(6-136-8) The Hydrology Specialist Report assumes that all
routes traveling through the INFISH RHCA have the potential to
negatively affect water quality, regardless of vehicle or seasonal
restrictions. Without full decommissioning or stabilization, even
routes closed to all motorized travel have the potential to deliver
sediment to adjacent streams. The Fisheries Specialist Report
discusses the increased risk associated with combined over-snow
and wheeled vehicle use on routes during winter/spring time
thaws.

(136-10) Concerns about the Bison Mountain 4104-A1/A2 road
were considered in the development of Alternative 5 for the FEIS
in that this route and all its stream crossings remain closed to
wheeled motorized traffic. Road 495-D1 would remain open
with provision to replace the ford crossing on an unnamed
tributary to Ontario Creek with a bottomless structure because
this tributary supports westslope cutthroat trout. An ATV route
would be opened on the north side of the Ontario Creek corridor

Alt 3 lays the groundwork for potentially reducing the money needed to maintain
roads in the long term. As disclosed in the DEIS there is not enough money to
adequately maintain the existing road system. Given the guidance to meet
minimization of effects, alternative 3 requires the least amount of maintenance
funding over the long term since it has the fewest miles of open roads. However,
Alternative 3 should be modified to include closure of FS road 227 above Kading
Campground and the Kading Grade to eliminate the need to install a stream crossing
at an existing ford. Closing the road above Kading will eliminate problems with
some of the dispersed camping that occurs above Kading Campground. (136-4) It is
important to note is that if an alternative is selected that keeps FS Road 227 open
above the Kading Camppground turnaround, then it should be closed at the stream
crossing until a crossing structure can be installed in place of the ford to remain
consistent with reducing risk for sediment effects to bull trout located downstream
in the Little Blackfoot River. (136-5)

Response to Comments
to avoid using road 4104-A1. The ATV route is an extension of
495-D1 that eventually crosses Ontario Creek using a bridge or
similar structure. The current crossing would remain closed until
a bridge is in place.
(136-11) Thank you for your comment.
(136-12) Best management practices and project design
features/mitigation measures would apply to the alternative
selected for implementation and would become part of the
decision and therefore, non-discretionary. Monitoring,
Implementation and Enforcement would be implemented for this
project and is discussed in DEIS. We recognize that monitoring
motorized use is important to ensure resource impacts are
minimized. During the implementation phase of the travel plan, a
more detailed implementation plan would be developed to
prioritize actions and monitoring. Many of our internal processes
(e.g. contract management) automatically build in monitoring.
The decision and implementation phase would comply with
Forest Plan monitoring requirements for applicable resource
areas – particularly those where we are trying to minimize
impacts (e.g. recreation/user conflicts, wildlife).

5. There is at least one very serious concern with Alternative 4. The use of the 300
foot corridor in alt 4 allows for much more liberal use of the 300 foot area adjacent
to open roads such as cutting firewood. Although the mitigation measures specified
for use in the 300 foot area suggests there would be acceptable risks for effects, the
transportation report in the DEIS (page 115) brings out that off route wood cutting
road proliferation is a problem currently. Off route road proliferation would be
exacerbated under alternative 4. All alternatives should maintain the restriction that
off route travel be limited to dispersed camping and follow the restrictive measures
outlined for Alternatives 1-3. If the Alt 4 wording for the 300 foot area is adopted
then there will be a need to develop site specific closures to firewood cutting along
some streams where the road is close to the stream to fully meet Infish and avoid
negative effects to woody debris recruitment to the streams. On the other hand
Alternative 4 includes closure of FS road 227 above Kading campground. This is
good and would eliminate a ford crossing on the unnamed tributary to the Little
Blackfoot River. The selected alternative should include this closure. (136-7)

(136-14) Comment addressed in Alternative 5 for the FEIS,
which designates trail #359 (Larabee trail) closed to motorized
use with no parking lot proposed on the east side of the current
crossing at the trailhead. A bridge is proposed for foot/stock
traffic at the trailhead to avoid fording the Little Blackfoot River.

6. I have a concern over the assumption that winter use poses no risk for negative

effects to fish resources from overwinter snow travel. With regard to the use of the
snowmobiles that is a reasonable assumption. However, use of the open Forest
roads by wheeled vehicles to get to snowmobile roads and trails can lead to erosion
of roads and sediment delivery to streams depending on the snow cover on the roads
and weather conditions. This point was addressed in detail in the previously
completed fish report and Biological Assessment for Blackfoot Winter Travel.
There may be concerns that should be addressed if any roads are open to wheeled
vehicle traffic during the snowmobile period that are near bull trout streams and
have sediment delivery points. (136-8) With bull trout spawning in March and April
there may be eggs in the stream gravels during a period of time when accelerated
sediment delivery can occur from snow ruts in the road due to wheeled vehicle use
to reach the snowmobile routes. There may be a need to provide some sort of special
mitigation measure such as additional erosion control features if there are situations
on the ground where the situations I mention above may be applicable for the Divide
Travel Project.
7. Opening roads that have long been closed should be reconsidered. For example,
given the lack of adequate maintenance funding it is unwise to open a road north of
Bison Mountain (4104 A1) which will necessitate crossing Ontario Creek to connect
in with FS Road #495D1 as an ATV route. Implementing the opening of this route
to ATVs will require substantial capital expenditure for stream crossing structures
that provide full aquatic passage on Ontario Creek (which supports bull trout) as
well as an unnamed tributary to Ontario Creek on 495D1 that supports cutthroat
trout. (136-10) It would be much more protective to the native fishery as well as
more efficient and less costly in terms of maintenance over the long term to keep
4104A1 closed and to close 495D1 so high cost stream crossings and maintenance
dollars for those crossings will not be necessary. I encourage the Forest to refrain
from opening this route. (136-11)
8. Regarding the effectiveness of road closures using signs, monitoring is prescribed
for the Divide Project Area—it was also prescribed for the North Belts Travel Plan.

Response to Comments
(136-16) Thank you for your comment.
(136-17) We agree with this comment. The statement in the
Forest Plan Consistency section of the Hydrology Specialist
Report has been changed to reflect the assumption that there will
continue to be a backlog of road maintenance projects. However,
a decreased number of open routes will allow for road
improvements to be concentrated on roads with water quality
concerns.

(136-18) Thank you for your input.
(136-19) Route improvements will be addressed during
implementation.
(136-20) To maintain compliance with INFISH standards and the
HNF Forest Plan, analyses within the Hydrology Specialist
Report have been changed to consider roads within 300 feet of
fishbearing streams and 150 feet of non-fishbearing streams
when determining road impacts to water quality.
(136-21) The statement in the Methodology and Scientific
Accuracy section of the Hydrology portion of the final EIS that
refers to sediment modeling has been removed. No attempt was
made to model sedimentation in the hydrology analysis due to
uncertainty in predicting future sedimentation as a result of
changes to the open/closed status of roads.

North Belts Travel Plan which was implemented a number of years ago? Was a
summary report prepared for the North Belts? How can we be sure sign closures
will work in the Divide area unless they have been demonstrated to be effective
elsewhere on the forest? Please address the likelihood for the effectiveness of sign
closures. (136-12)
9. Specific to the ford crossing at Larabee Gulch on the Little Blackfoot. Given that
the road is closed on the east side for all the action alternatives there should be no
need for a stream crossing except to provide for parking to access the trail.
Development of a parking area at Larabee Gulch has been considered by the forest
for a substantial period of time. There should be inclusion of a statement that a
parking area will be constructed as a cumulative effect in the final EIS. Due to the
nature of the site near the crossing, construction of a parking area will require
substantial disturbance within the Infish RHCA very close to the Little Blackfoot
River and will have long term adverse effects to bull trout. The Infish amendment
to the Forest plan states that new developments should not occur in RHCAs unless
adverse effects can be avoided. (136-13) Please address how a parking area is
compatible with the Infish amendment to the Forest Plan. (136-14)

Response to Comments
(136-23) Since the original DEIS analysis, updates in the
National Hydrography Data forced re-analysis of high risk roads
for the FEIS. During that analysis errors in buffering the original
stream coverage were discovered, which applied 150 foot buffers
for all streams in the fisheries analysis instead of using 300 foot
buffers for fishbearing streams and 150 feet for non-fishbearing
streams. The FEIS corrects this error to apply the correct INFSH
buffers relevant to fishbearing and non-fishbearing streams.
(136-24) Thank you for this comment. The values in the tables
reporting road miles within 150/300 feet of stream channels have
been changed in both the Hydrology and Fisheries specialist
reports to reflect recently updated National Hydrography Dataset
(NHD) stream spatial data.
(136-25) Refer to Alternative 5.
(136-26) Refer to the Fish Specialist report. Future site specific
analysis will determine closure methods, including
decomisioning.

Roads Analysis when it really was only the conclusion of the transportation group.
There were many roads that were considered to be high risk that could be closed to
benefit natural resources. It would be good to clarify this statement to show that it
was not an interdisciplinary conclusion that these were the only two roads that

Response to Comments

Page 115- with statements in the DEIS that maintenance funding is not adequate to
maintain the currently open roads (page 113 includes a statement that many local
and collector roads receive little maintenance) it seems extremely unlikely that best
management practices (BMPS) can be implemented for all road maintenance
projects as discussed in the hydrology section on page 160 of the DEIS. With
limited funding what would be considered reasonable BMPs? (136-17)
Page 115- The statement that most routes are in good condition does not match with
statement on page 113 where there is a statement that “ many of the older roads are
in disrepair” (136-18)
Page 116 – the statement that adequate surface and drainage conditions are present
on open and closed roads in Area 1 with the exception of Dog Creek is flawed for at
least one instance-- Drainage and surface conditions on the road in Spring Gulch
(trib to Dog Creek) are very poor. I suspect there are numerous instances where
conditions are not good. Discussion for other areas also imply conditions are
reasonably good when I know there are specific problems on sections of some roads
such as Telegraph Creek and closed roads in the Sally Ann Creek area. I suggest
that there should not be general statements suggesting that most of the roads are in
good condition when many times the drainage features on the roads have not been
maintained for years or even decades (in the case of closed roads). A good way to
address specifics of roads in each of the areas would be to include either an
appendix or reference to a project file document which summarizes the conditions of
each road and when it last received maintenance. (136-19)
Page 147 As I commented in the Blackfoot Travel Plan, use of 150 foot as a
sediment delivery parameter from roads is not appropriate for streams supporting
fish west of the divide where the Infish Amendment to the Forest Plan is in place.
Site specific information can be used to adjust the 300 foot Infish buffer. I’d
suggest considering using roads within 300 feet as a measure of risk in the

hydrology section or use site specific information that supports rationale on any
specific road; doing otherwise would seem to be a violation of Infish which is
amended to the Helena Plan. If the Forest insists on using the 150 foot parameter
for sediment delivery risk I think there needs to be an explanation as to how use of
that distance without site specific information meets the intent of the Infish
amendment. (136-20)

Response to Comments

Page 147- There is a statement that sediment modeling was done by the Forest
Hydrologist yet on page 144 there is a statement that no sediment modeling was
undertaken. Since no sediment data is presented it is assumed that the first
statement should be taken out of the DEIS. (136-21)
Page 155 -The discussion suggesting benefit from the POTENTIAL for
decommissioning should be considered a benefit is flawed. Later NEPA evaluations
after the Divide Project is implemented could determine that all closed roads might
be necessary for administrative purposes. The closing of roads in the Divide Project
would only be beneficial to watershed and fisheries if a decision were to be made in
the later nepa evaluations to put the roads in long term storage with crossings
removed or the roads were to be decommissioned. (136-22)
PageS 149-151. It is confusing that the hydrology report includes tables (3.19 and
3.21) that depict miles of roads within 150 feet of streams and the mileage matches
up with table in the fish report (Table 3.27) that show the miles of road within 300
feet of streams. This does not seem very feasible; it would make sense that there are
some miles of road between 150 and 300 feet . So are the miles shown in the
hydrology and fish reports within 150 or 300 feet? As pointed out elsewhere in my
comments the roads within 300 feet of fishery streams should be of concern unless
there is site specific information that justifies eliminating them from concern. (13623) (136-24)
Page 188- The inventory of dispersed camping sites in Infish RHCAs should be
completed for all the 6th code HUCs. It doesn’t seem likely that monitoring of

Page 191- It would be useful to know how many of the culvert crossings are barriers
to fish movement as part of the existing condition, how many are on high risk roads
that will remain open, and how many are on high risk roads that will be closed by
alternative. This information would help give a feel for the potential benefit or lack
of benefit arising from possible decommissioning or long term storage on roads
currently closed in this decision.(136-26)

Re: Draft Environmental Impact Statement for Travel Management Planning for the
Divide Area of the Helena National Forest
Dear Heather DeGeest,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Helena National Forest’s Divide
Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). Defenders of Wildlife
(Defenders) is a national non-profit conservation organization with more than 1.2
million members and supporters nationwide, over 5,000 of whom reside in Montana.
Founded in 1947, Defenders focuses on conserving and restoring native species and
the habitat upon which they depend. The DEIS is important to several of our focal
species—including wolves, grizzly bears, lynx and wolverines— because the area
provides significant habitat and serves as linkage between large blocks of
undeveloped public lands on either side of MacDonald Pass and Highway 12. With
these comments we urge the Helena National Forest (HNF) to ensure that its travel
plan maintains and restores these values, fundamental to this area.
It is clear that this travel planning area presents some unique management
challenges. Blocks of Forest Service lands and several townships north and south of
Highway 12 are connected by a thin tendril of national forest right where it crosses
the highway, and right along the Continental Divide itself. Looking at the broader
landscape north and south along the Divide, the fragility of this connection is even
more evident, and in fact this is one of very few east/west “fracture zones” that
interrupt otherwise contiguous national forest lands between Yellowstone and
Glacier National Park. The outstanding importance of this area far transcends its
immediate area and we strongly agree that “Options for movement in the valleys
have been substantially reduced and often eliminated by human development. This
has placed an emphasis on NF lands along the Divide mountain ranges to provide
connectivity” (DEIS p.249). The Divide has the ability to support connectivity for
myriad species and this travel plan can provide the right direction in moving
towards that goal. We have some specific concerns related to the planning area’s

Comments
ability to serve as a linkage area, providing long-term connectivity. We are also
alarmed at the level of winter over-snow motorized use proposed within the plan—
though we also recognize there are some areas with significant road and over-snow
motorized use closures as well. Below, we detail some specific areas and issues
where we have concerns.
We broadly support road closures, closures of over-snow motorized vehicles, and
increased seasonal restrictions to over-snow motorized vehicles for several roads
within various alternatives. However, the seasonal closure date for over-snow
motorized vehicles should be moved from the currently proposed May 15 closure to
April 1 to protect emerging grizzly bears. Additionally, we are concerned that the
DEIS indicates that closure methods would be limited to signs (DEIS p.15). Sign
closures have shown to be ineffective at stopping illegal use of closed roads. It is
well known that budget constraints on all forests have made it very difficult to
effectively monitor and enforce illegal activity on closed roads. Using only signs to
close roads would increase the need for effective enforcement and monitoring. The
HNF should consider more effective methods that may require less staff time to
enforce such as gates, earth moving, etc. (137-1)
Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless Area
The Nevada Mountain IRA has the highest diversity of wildlife species on the
Helena Ranger District, and it provides important denning habitat for grizzly bears
and essential winter snow conditions for lynx and wolverines. It offers crucial
habitat connectivity for those species. Roadless Areas serve as important wildlife
refugia and have ever-increasing value to maintaining wildlife populations and
enhancing fisheries. IRAs should be managed at their maximum acreage as roadless
and motorized vehicle use should not occur in such locations. The Nevada Mountain
IRA and all roads within it (including 4044-E1, proposed for opening to snow
vehicles) should be closed to all motorized travel, including snowmobiles. This
would protect this high value movement corridor and wildlife habitat. This should
include portions of Threemile Creek, Georgia Creek, Black Mountain, roadless
areas north of Meyers Hill, and Helena Ranger District acres on the east side of the
Divide. (137-2)

Response to Comments

(137-1) Closure dates were set primarily to accommodate elk,
deer, and other ungulate movement patterns. Currently, we do
not know of any grizzlies denning anywhere in the Divide
landscape, and so have not built closure schedules around them.
The most likely denning areas—the upper Little Blackfoot and
upper Little Prickly Pear watersheds –are protected by
snowmobile area closures. Closure dates can be modified for
areas that in the future reveal themselves to be grizzly denning
areas.

Alternative 3, which closes routes and acres to motorized vehicles in the Nevada
Mountain IRA, is preferable to Alternative 1, 2, and 4, which do not close the IRA.
We support that Alternative 3 reflects the Blackfoot-North Divide Winter Travel
Plan, unlike Alt 1, 2, or 4. Alternatives 2 and 4 propose to open non-motorized trails
#4044-E1, 4401, 136D-1 (Continental Divide Trail) and 136 007. We oppose the
opening of these roads to motorized use, as increasing motorized access in these
areas could constrict and prohibit safe travel of wildlife and reduce security. These
alternatives also designate the entire Nevada Mountain IRA as snow vehicle
(unofficial) play area and thus we do not support those alternatives. (137-3) The
DEIS fails to evaluate the combined and cumulative effects of opening those roads.
(137-4)
Additionally, Nevada Mountain is a strong candidate for recommended wilderness
in HNF’s pending forest plan revision in 2015. The forest planning process will
evaluate suitable areas for wilderness potential and recommend areas for wilderness.
Wilderness candidate lands that contain motorized travel tend to be negatively
affected in their prioritization level for recommended wilderness in forest plan
revisions. The Divide Travel Plan will have an important effect on whether Nevada
Mountain exists as a viable candidate for wilderness. Alternatives 1, 2 and 4 would
likely dramatically reduce the ranking Nevada Mountain would receive as a
proposed wilderness. (137-5)
Under the final selected alternative, the HNF should ensure that the Nevada
Mountain IRA is closed to over-snow motorized vehicle routes and areas to support
increased habitat security and movement patterns for grizzly bear, lynx and
wolverine. (137-6)
Other Areas
Additionally and for similar reasons, we urge the HNF to manage all Electric Peak
roadless lands along the Continental Divide between Bison Mountain and Ontario
Creek headwaters as a year-round non-motorized area. Logging roads in Monarch
Creek should remain/be closed (FR#4104). Thus, Alternative 3 is the better
alternative selection since it closes the number of miles open to wheeled motorized
vehicles. However, no alternative offers a reduction of over-snow motorized

vehicles in the Electric Peak IRA. (137-7)
In the Jericho Mountain IRA, we support the reductions in the numbers of acres
open to over-snow motorized vehicles in Alternative 3 and 4. (137-8)
The MacDonald Pass area is an important linkage zone for lynx, wolverines, and
grizzly bears and other wildlife. We support road closures and seasonal restrictions
to over-snow motorized vehicles in that area, and we do not support areas opened to
over-snow motorized vehicles in this habitat pinch point region. (137-9)
Minimization
Executive Orders (EO) 11644 and 11989 require the Forest Service, when
designating ORV trails and areas, to minimize harassment of wildlife, including
grizzly bears, lynx, and wolverines, and significant disruption of their habitat. The
Travel Management Rule (TMR) at 36 C.F.R. § 212.55(b) echoes this minimization
requirement.
Courts have found that the Forest Service has an affirmative obligation to actually
show that it aimed to minimize damage when designating motorized trails and areas.
Critically, the agency must demonstrate that proposed management decisions
comply with ORV EOand TMR policy, rather than simply disclose anticipated
impacts from the designation. Specifically, in this case the Forest Service must
document and explain how the alternatives meet the criteria to minimize harassment
of grizzly bears, lynx, wolverines and disruption of their habitat. (137-10)
Instead of providing a thorough analysis of how it will minimize impacts from
motorized use, the DEIS states: “For the purposes of this planning effort, the HNF
interprets the term ‘minimize’ to mean meeting the Forest Plan standards, moving
forest resources toward the goals and objectives described in the Forest Plan…”
(DEIS p.15). This interpretation incorrectly conflates the minimization duty with
other substantive standards set forth by NFMA and the Forest Plan.
The minimization duty is a unique mandate and not satisfied through the use of
other standards as a proxy. First, the Helena Forest Plan was not designed to
minimize impacts as contemplated by the ORV EOs. Rather, the Forest Plan was
developed under the separate and independent authority established in Section 6 of
the NFMA which establishes that a Forest Plan is to provide for multiple use and
sustained yield of goods and services from the National Forest System. Indeed the

TMR specifically segregated the travel management process from the forest
planning process in order to ensure that the minimization criteria were adequately
addressed, something that had not been done in prior planning processes.
Promulgating a separate regulation to specifically manage motorized use on national
forest lands indicates that providing for multiple use and sustained yield is not the
same thing as minimizing motorized recreation impacts. The ORV Executive Orders
and the Travel Management Rule place an additional layer of restrictions upon that
multiple use mandate. Minimizing motorized recreational impacts is, in fact, an
additional analysis that must be completed on a site specific level before designating
motorized use.
Furthermore, by law, all action alternatives must be consistent with the Forest Plan,
thereby making it impossible that mere compliance with the forest plan standards
and guidelines would also necessarily mean that the minimization criteria were
adequately applied. If we apply the FS’s logic that merely achieving consistency
with the Forest Plan equates to minimizing impacts, we must then conclude that
every action alternative presented in travel management plans necessarily minimize
impacts, which on its face is absurd and ignores the fact that each substantive
requirement of federal law is written differently and requires a different type or level
of compliance. Clearly, an alternative that designates many more motorized routes
near streams would have more impacts to water, fish, wildlife, and aquatic systems
than an alternative that has few routes in these sensitive locations, even if both
alternatives are consistent with the Forest Plan. Similarly, an alternative that
designates many more motorized routes in ungulate habitat will have greater impact
on wildlife habitat than an alternative that does not, even if both alternatives meet
Forest Plan standards.
As opposed to using the Forest Plan as a proxy for compliance with the ORV EOs,
the FEIS should demonstrate how each alternative is consistent with minimization
criteria. The DEIS acknowledges that alternatives will have a range of potential
effects on grizzly bears, wolverine, lynx and their habitat. The FEIS should present
analysis that justifies how each alternative meets the ORV EOs and TMR, instead of
relying on the Forest Plan as proxy. Gradation of harm to grizzly bears, wolverines
and lynx must be contemplated and minimized in the FEIS and subsequent decisions

to demonstrate compliance with the ORV EOs and TMR. (137-11)
Grizzly Bears
Alternative 3 most appropriately recognizes the needs of grizzly bears. However,
there are some specific concerns we have with this alternative. The planning area
encompasses the southern expansion range of the occupied Northern Continental
Divide Recovery Zone and Ecosystem (NCDE). This area provides vital linkage
between core grizzly bear habitat in the NCDE and undeveloped public lands south
of Highway 12 and onwards towards the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE).
Genetic (male) and eventually functional (female) connectivity is imperative to long
term sustainable recovery and resiliency of lower 48 grizzly bears. In regards to
grizzly bear security we are concerned that significant portions of the area are
proposed for over-snow motorized vehicle use until mid-May. Female grizzly bear
activity and denning has been documented in the Nevada Mountain area and
extensive OSMV of the area is currently proposed. Grizzly bears can be susceptible
to disturbance at their den sites, can be easily awakened and disturbance has been
found particularly in the spring when females and cubs of the year are still present
(Mace and Waller 1997). Grizzly bears in the NCDE typically den from October or
November, with females and cubs emerging from their dens early April-early May.
To avoid den disturbance, abandonment and area avoidance of females with cubs in
the spring, the seasonal closure date for over-snow motorized vehicles should be
moved from the currently proposed May 15 closure to April 1. We reiterate that
allowing extensive snowmobile and winter access in areas where grizzly bears are
denning is detrimental to grizzly bear security. (137-12)
IGBC Guidelines – Use of MS5 We are concerned that the HNF assumes that it is
appropriate to use Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee (IGBC) Management
Situation #5 (MS5) as the appropriate management situation for southern
distribution. As stated in the IGBC Guidelines “The value of the Management
Situation concept for grizzly bear management is most fully realized with the proper
stratification and implementation.” Given the Divide’s potential to act as a corridor
or linkage area between the NCDE population and the Yellowstone Ecosystem we
highly recommend that that the HNF reassess the use of MS5 and appropriately
consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Montana Fish, Wildlife and

Parks on the most appropriate Management Situation. The use of MS5 flaws
baseline analysis of the planning area, specifically in regards to the Nevada
Mountain area. Alternative 3 does appear the most compliant with the needs of
grizzly bears and reflects potential management direction under a more appropriate
MS situation. (137-13)
Food Storage Order The Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest implemented a
Food Storage Order June 1, 2014 for the “purpose of minimizing adverse
interactions between bears and humans…” This order is effective March 1December 1. While it is not within the scope of this planning document, it would be
prudent for the HNF to institute a similar order. This portion of the Helena National
Forest is within the Draft Northern Continental Divide Grizzly Bear Conservation
Strategy identified Zone 2 and the only Forest area without a Food Storage order
(137-14). Additionally, dispersed camping and motorized use is allowed within 300foot buffers of roads and trails, increasing potential for camping sites with
uncontained attractants to be scattered throughout the planning area. It is widely
known that a primary source of conflicts between people and grizzly bears is
correlated to the availability of anthropogenic attractants like coolers, garbage and
game. Dispersed camping as is present in the HNF, invites conflict. Food Storage
Orders on other Forest lands have successfully minimized these conflicts resulting
in a safer environment for wildlife as well as forest-users.
Wolverines
The HNF and the Divide travel planning area is an important area for wolverines,
particularly as an important component of core wolverine range and travel in the
Northern Rockies region (Inman 2013). This underscores the potential of this travel
plan to significantly affect wolverines.
The wolverine analysis of biological factors, habitat, and occurrence, while accurate
in most areas, does not use the most recent best available science.(137-15)
Numerous sources that provide additional and perhaps improved information were
not included (i.e. Schwartz et al. 2009; Copeland et al. 2010; Inman 2013). We have
attached those for inclusion into the public record.
We support the statements within the DEIS that impacts to wolverine natal denning
habitat typically come from snowmobile activity (and likely other dispersed

activity has been documented is not part of the Divide Travel

Area, adjustments to snowmobile closure dates can be made.
Currently, we have no indication of grizzly bear denning in areas
used by snowmobiles anywhere in the Travel Plan Area.
(137-13) The rationale for using IGBC management situation
(MS) 5 is discussed in the Wildlife Background Report (p. 84).
As noted, this MS is an imperfect fit for the Divide landscape as
it now exists. But, this is not the driving management instruction
for the landscape, which is provided by more recent research and
direction associated with the recognition of the expanded Grizzly
Bear Distribution Zone (Wildlife Background Report, p. 84-89,
184-187).

backcountry recreation activities such as skiing). The best available science reveals
that dispersed recreational activities, particularly winter recreational activities, have
the potential to result in negative impacts of wolverine because they disrupt and
limit use of wolverine natal denning areas (Carroll et al. 2001, Rowland et al. 2003,
May et al. 2006, Copeland et al. 2007, Krebs et al. 2007).
The DEIS notes that “Locally, a number of potential wolverine safe havens exist in
the travel planning area both as Inventoried Roadless Areas and as undesignated
blocks of non-motorized habitat where human presence is minimal for much of the
year. Such blocks larger than 1,500 acres occupy roughly 67% of the travel planning
area (see discussion of Habitat Connectivity in the Divide Landscape)” (DEIS
p.303). It should be asserted that wolverines have vast home ranges between 73 sq.
km and greater than 950 sq. km (Schwartz et al. 2009), so it is important to
recognize that wolverines use areas far beyond inventoried roadless areas and other
such regions. (137-16) Similarly,
while wolverines may be “drawn to relatively large blocks of habitat, abundantly
forested, in which human presence is minimal” (DEIS p.383) it does not mean they
do not regularly use other areas that do not meet that definition, as they continually
traverse across their home ranges that contain a range of levels of human activity
and impacts (Heinemeyer and Squires 2013). It is thus important that the FEIS
considers impacts to wolverines beyond those just within the habitat blocks. This is
particularly true when “wolverines are renowned for their vulnerability to trapping
and susceptibility to over-harvest (Claar et al. 1999)” (DEIS p.383). It is not just
roads but any access via snowmobiling that puts wolverines at risk from trapping
(whether direct or incidental), since the trapping season is during the winter and
snowmobiles are frequently used by trappers. Additionally, while natal and maternal
denning habitat is essential to protect, denning female wolverines will undoubtedly
have home ranges that extend beyond those USFS-modeled denning habitat acres
(Heinemeyer and Squires 2013), so impacts to denning can extend beyond those
denning habitat acres. The statement “A perusal of these areas on Divide travel plan
alternative maps indicates that none of them supports snowmobile trails or known
snowmobile play areas close enough to potential denning sites to be of concern”
(DEIS p.383) must include some level of measurement to provide the reader with

what the USFS considers and does not consider a distance ‘of concern.’ We expect
the FEIS to address this issue. (137-17) Similarly, wolverines near the Divide travel
plan area in the Dalton Mountain, Beaver Creek, and Nevada Creek areas of the
Lincoln Ranger District have been documented by Wild Things Unlimited in a
unique, relatively low-elevation habitat for wolverines (Gehman et al. 2014).
Wolverine kits have been documented, indicating reproduction happening in that
region. Thus, denning habitat may be more extensive than represented within
models and previous literature.
The DEIS states that “The HNF has mapped natal denning habitat for wolverines
across the Forest using a model developed by the USFS Northern Regional office
(Missoula). The model focuses on identifying high mountain basins, rockslides,
steep slopes, and other alpine terrain where woody and rocky debris along with deep
snow are likely to accumulate [sic]”(DEIS p.303). This model must be referenced.
What model is this? When was the model created? When did the modeling occur?
This information would help us better understand the next component of the
wolverine analysis, which notes that “as the current Regional habitat model has not
identified any wolverine denning habitat in the Divide landscape, this parameter has
been approached qualitatively. (137-18) Fieldwork suggested areas that might
provide viable denning sites, and the potential for snowmobile presence was then
inferred from travel plan alternative maps and the Helena RD Snowmobile Trail
map (2003)” (DEIS p.233). We support that the HNF recognized that wolverines
persist on the landscape despite the model indicating there may be no denning
habitat there. The accuracy of the model, however, perhaps should be called into
question. More information about this model should be included within the FEIS.
(137-19)
Finally, the DEIS indicates that wolverines have persisted on the landscape for
years, and they may appear to be increasing. The HNF concludes that therefore
refuge habitat appears adequate and that circumstances under Alternative 1, No
Action indicate “no wolverine denning habitat is threatened by current patterns of
snowmobile use or other winter recreation in the Divide landscape” (DEIS p.384).
The DEIS goes on to assert that since active snowmobile trails would remain
unchanged in each of the travel plan alternatives, there is therefore no threat to

Response to Comments

(137-16, 137-17, 137-18, 137-19, 137-20) The Wildlife
Background Report (p. 100-104, 204-209) and equivalent
sections of the FEIS address most of these issues. We know we
have wolverines resident in the Divide landscape—2 adult
males—but we have no evidence of breeding so far. We do not
rely on the Regional model of potential denning habitat for
identification of sites on the Helena NF because it is generalized
and not geared to “eastside” habitats. Field observation indicates
that a number of species (goshawks, lynx, and wolverines among
them) deviate from standard “Westside” norms in behavior and
habitat use. So, we expect that we have wolverine denning
habitat in the landscape, but because there has been no detectable
breeding/denning so far, we don’t know what it looks like. But,
as noted in the Wildlife Background Report , there is no
snowmobile use in the most likely areas. If breeding is
detected,we may need to adjust snowmobile routes accordingly.

wolverine denning habitat. Whether or not changes are proposed in the travel plan
alternatives, the DEIS is obligated to consider the effects of the proposed action on
wolverines across the planning area overall. If harm is occurring under current
conditions, this should be analyzed in the NEPA process and alternatives
considered. We urge that monitoring and research is used to come up with such
conclusions of no impact from snowmobile use, rather than a potentially false logic
pattern. (137-20)
With wolverines in mind, we support the increases in each alternative of areas
closed to off-trail snowmobile use, and we particularly support Alternative 3 for its
increase of non-motorized refuges. Alternative 3’s significant reduction of Nevada
Mountain IRA to over-snow motorized vehicles is particularly important. (137-21)
Connectivity
The DEIS provides a connectivity analysis, grizzly bear analysis, and elk security
analysis of non-motorized habitat blocks of different sizes, then qualitatively
compares the number of acres of ‘potential refuges’ in the planning area per
alternative (i.e. DEIS p. 384). Yet, there is no mapping that allows a visual
comparative analysis of where these blocks occur and whether they support quality
habitat for wildlife, for which these ‘potential refuges’ are analyzed for effects in
this DEIS (i.e. wolverines). Our concern is that these ‘refuges’ could become
islands if they are not sufficiently connected. The FEIS must include mapping that
shows where these habitat blocks occur, and how they are connected for each
alternative. (137-22)
Lynx
The planning area is undoubtedly an important region for lynx, acting as core habitat
and important linkage movement areas. Lynx are also undoubtedly impacted by
over-snow vehicle use.
We are concerned about the phrasing in the assessment of impacts by each
alternative that states: “no expansion of existing non-designated play areas is likely”
or “is foreseen,” then referenced with a personal communication (DEIS p.375). This
does not indicate a comprehensive analysis was considered regarding the likely
increase of snowmobile use and capacity of over-snow machines with increasing
technologies. (137-23)

With lynx in mind, we support the increases in each alternative of areas closed to
off-trail snowmobile use, and we particularly support Alternative 3 for its increase

Conclusion
We extend our appreciation to the Forest Service for the opportunity to provide
these comments regarding the DEIS for the Divide TMP process. Your efforts to
engage and educate the public in this process through meetings, phone conversations
have been truly appreciated. Our intent in providing these comments is to work
cooperatively with the Forest Service and the larger interested public to ensure that
the HNF–as a public trust resource–is properly managed for the long-term public
interest for the benefit of existing and future generations.
The Divide TMP effort offers an important opportunity to provide connectivity for a
myriad of species and real restoration of a fragmented landscape. We urge the HNF
to make the improvements to Alternative 3 that we’ve suggested in this letter and
pick this alternative in the record of decision. This would ensure that effective
habitat protections are in place while also providing sufficient opportunities for
variable types of recreation and access.
We look forward to working with the Forest Service as the TMR implementation
process moves forward. We are available to discuss our comments and concerns
raised in the letter.

provided in the FEIS and the Wildife Background Report
(Figures 7-11, p. 168-173) give a sense of how unroaded
enclaves are distributed—although this is the most restricted
version of these non-motorized areas (Table 36). A perusal of
Travel Plan maps for different alternatives also provides an
indication of how unroaded blocks are situated. Some of these
blocks are more island-like than others, depending on the use
levels of intervening roads. Roads such as Highway 12 or the
Rimini Road are obvious impediments, but other routes, such as
those illustrated in photos 6, 8, an 9 in the Wildlife Background
Report are much less problematic to wildlife on the move. As
discussed in the Background Report (p. 142), developing larger
unroaded habitat patches is more effective than trying to
maintain pristine corridors between them.

Dear Ms. DeGeest:
We appreciate the opportunity to submit the attached comments in response to the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for travel management in the Ten
Mile drainage, Little Blackfoot drainage, and area towards Meyers Hill of the
Helena National Forest (HNF). The area in question is approximately 155,500 acres
within the Lewis and Clark and Powell Counties. The Divide Travel Area is popular
for recreation throughout the year due to the close proximity to local communities.
WildEarth Guardians is a non‐profit conservation organization that works to protect
and restore the wildlife, wild places, wild rivers, and the health of the American
West. Guardians has over 35,000 members and e‐activists. Travel management
decisions in Montana, and particularly those that impact sensitive species such as
grizzly bear, lynx, and wolverine, are key elements to our on‐going work in
Montana, and on the Helena Nationa lForest.
I. Summary of comments
For true minimization of motorized recreational impacts to take place, the HNF
must go beyond the Proposed Action‐Alternative 2, and adopt more roads for
decommissioning, rather than just closure or conversion to motorized trail, as well
as provide increased protections for wildlife and roadless areas from motorized use.
Public comments made during the scoping period should be better incorporated into
any proposed action to achieve management objectives. Minimization efforts and

II. Executive Orders 11644 and 11989 and the Travel Management Rule
Minimization Requirements
Throughout our comment letter, we will be invoking the minimization requirements
in Executive Orders (EOs) 11644 and 11989 and the Travel Management Rule
(TMR). We want to bring your attention to numerous important judicial decisions
that impact your analysis and decision making on the Divide TMP process. The
Eastern District Court of

California issued a decision regarding off‐road vehicle (ORV) designations that has
application to the TMP process.1In addition ,in the past two years, three other
decisions have been issued that also are relevant to your ongoing planning efforts:
two Idaho district court decisions related to TMP challenges issued on the Salmon‐
Challis and Sawtooth National Forests2, and a Montana district court decision
issued in 2012 ruling on challenges to the Beaverhead‐ Deerlodge National Forest
Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP).3
Back ground EOs 11644 and 11989 require that the Forest Service, when
designating ORV trails and areas, minimize damage to forest resources, disruption
of wildlife, and user conflicts.4 The TMR at 36 C.F.R. § 212.55(b) echoes this
minimization requirement for both summer and winter off‐road vehicle use,5 stating
that:
...[I]n designating National Forest System trails and areas on National Forest System
lands, the responsible official shall consider effects on the following, with the
objective of minimizing:
(1) Damage to soil, watershed, vegetation, and other forest resources;

(2) Harassment of wildlife and significant disruption of wildlife habitats;
(3) Conflicts between motor vehicle use and existing or proposed recreational uses
of National Forest System lands or neighboring Federal lands; and
(4) Conflicts among different classes of motor vehicle uses of National Forest
System lands or neighboring Federal lands.

4 Executive Order 11644 as amended by 11989 states that: [Forest
Service]regulations shall direct that the designation of[off‐ road vehicle]areas and
trails will be based upon the protection of the resources of the public lands,
promotion of the safety of all users of those lands, and minimization of conflicts
among the various uses of those lands. The regulations shall further require that the
designation of such areas and trails shall be in accordance with the following—(1)
Areas and trails shall be located to minimize damage to soil, watershed, vegetation,
or other resources of the public lands. (2) Areas and trails shall be located to
minimize harassment of wildlife or significant disruption of wildlife habitats. (1381) (3) Areas and trails shall be located to minimize conflicts between off‐road
vehicle use and other existing or proposed recreational uses of the same or
neighboring public lands, and to ensure the compatibility of such uses with existing
conditions in populated areas, taking into account noise and other factors... The
Executive Orders define off‐road vehicles as “any motorized vehicle designed for or

allowed, including over‐snow vehicles. New regulations to address over‐snow
vehicle management are currently being promulgated by the Forest Service. In the
interim, the Executive Order minimization criterion applies.
The California and Idaho cases involved challenges to TMPs where plaintiffs
charged that the Forest Service failed to comply with the minimization requirements
in the TMR and the EOs. The Montana case involved a challenge to an LRMP
where plaintiffs charged that the Forest Service, in designating over‐ snow vehicle

Court Findings
Travel Management Rule Minimization Requirements. Related to the TMR
requirement to minimize impacts when designating ORV trails and areas, the
California and Idaho courts found that the Forest Service has an affirmative
obligation to show that it aimed to minimize damage and conflict when designating
trails and areas. Specifically, the Eastern District Court of California concluded that:
This court reads the language of Subpart B [of the Travel Management Rule] as
imposing an affirmative obligation on the Forest Service to actually show that it
aimed to minimize environmental damage when designating trails and areas. While
the final outcome of the Forest Service’s designation process may not necessarily
minimize environmental damage to the greatest extent possible, the Forest Service
must show that it satisfies the objective of minimizing environmental impacts. This
means the Forest Service must do more than merely consider those impacts.
Opinion p. 20.
The opinion goes on in detail about why NEPA analysis, by itself, is not necessarily
sufficient to meet the showing of minimization required by the TMR:
Unlike NEPA, which requires agencies to assess environmental consequences of
their decisions but does not obligate agencies to take actions that minimize those
consequences, the TMR requires the Forest Service to aim to minimize

environmental damage when designating routes. Opinion. 23.

Response to Comments

In the Salmon‐Challis case, an Idaho district court similarly concluded that the
Forest Service must consider the “minimization” criteria set out in 36C.F.R. §
212.55(b) and document how the agency applied the criteria in its designations on
the record:
The language “with the objective of minimizing” means that the whole goal or
purpose of the exercise is to select routes in order to minimize impacts in light of the
agency's other duties. Simply listing the criteria and noting that they were
considered is not sufficient to meet this standard. Instead, the Forest Service must
explain how the minimization criteria were applied in the route designation
decisions. 766 F.Supp.2d 1074
Enforceability of Executive Orders. In the Sawtooth and Beaverhead‐Deerlodge
cases, the issue of whether EOs 11644 and 11989 are enforceable through a private
right of action was raised. In both cases, the courts found that they were. From the
Sawtooth case:
Having reviewed these Executive Orders and based on the reasoning in Western
Watersheds, the Court finds the Plaintiffs can challenge the Defendants’ compliance
with Executive Orders 11644 and 11989. Opinion, p. 42.
The Beaverhead‐Deerlodge case addressed the enforceability issue in the context of
winter designations in an LRMP, and ruled that the EOs are enforceable by private
parties. See Opinion, p. 31‐21.
Application to the Divide TMP Process
Multiple district courts have found that the EOs and the TMR require the Forest
Service to demonstrate that it minimized – not just considered – impacts when
designating ORV trails and areas.

In the DEIS, the Forest Service purports to address the minimization criteria, stating
that it has considered the potential effect of the trail designations with the objective
of minimizing those effects as required under 36 C.F.R. § 212.55(b). DEIS at 15. It
goes on to say that its approach of complying with the minimization criteria is to
ensure the TMP is meeting Forest Pan standards, moving forest resources toward the
goals and objectives described in the Forest Plan, and complying with all state and
federal regulations which would diminish the impacts of the effects on Forest
resources. Summary at 15. It goes on to say that because all of the action
alternatives considered would meet these requirements, the effects on Forest
resources would be satisfactory minimized by any of the plans. DEIS at 15‐16.
These conclusory statements re: minimization is insufficient to meet the
requirements of the Executive Orders and TMR, and must be remedied before a
final decision is reached.

Response to Comments

We reject this reliance on other substantive standards as a proxy to satisfy 36 C.F.R.
§ 212.55(b). First, we reject the assumption that the agency’s decision comports
with these other substantive standards, in particular the Endangered Species Act.
Second, the Forest Service makes the mistake of conflating the minimization duty
with other substantive standards. Each substantive duty is written differently and
words mean different things, in particular relative to the agency’s responsibilities.
For example, a route designation might conform to a water quality standard
providing that sediment loading must be reduced below a particular threshold. But
designating that route may not, in fact, minimize impacts because it could be better
sited (or managed through, e.g., installation of a culvert) to reduce impacts even
further, thereby protecting (i.e., minimizing impacts to) water quality even more
than is required by the Clean Water Act. The Forest Service’s conflation of separate
and independent duties into a muddled, indistinct ‘soup’ is thus problematic and,
ultimately, arbitrary and capricious.
Building on this point, the Helena Forest Plan is not designed to minimize impacts
as contemplated by the ORV Executive Orders. Rather, the Forest Plan was
developed under the separate and independent authority established in Section 6 of

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 677

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
the National Forest Management Act; Section 6 provides that a Forest Plan is to
provide for multiple use and sustained yield of goods and services from the National
Forest System. Indeed, the Travel Management Rule segregated the travel
management planning process from the forest planning process, hinting at the fact
that providing for multiple use and sustained yield is not the same thing as
minimizing motorized recreation impacts.

Response to Comments

(138-2) Thank you for your comment.
The ORV Executive Orders and the Travel Management Rule place an additional
layer of restrictions upon that multiple use mandate. Minimizing motorized
recreational impacts is, in fact, an additional analysis that must be completed before
allowing recreational use on as ite specific level, even if that use is in an area
allocated as potentially appropriate for that use in a programmatic forest plan. And,
by law, all action alternatives—or at least those action alternatives that can be
chosen for implementation—must necessarily be consistent with the Forest Plan.
Accordingly, there may be several different alternative management regimes, all
consistent with the Forest Plan, but only one, upon comparative analysis, that
actually “minimizes” impacts. (138-2)
If we apply the Forest Service’s logic that merely achieving consistency with the
Forest Plan equates to minimizing impacts, we must then conclude, as the HNF has
done here, that every action alternative presented in travel management plans
necessarily minimize impacts, which on its face is absurd and ignores the fact that
each substantive requirement is written differently and requires a different type or
level of compliance. Clearly, an alternative that designates many more motorized
routes near streams would have more impacts to water, fish, wildlife, and aquatic
systems than an alternative that has few routes in these sensitive locations, even if
both alternatives are consistent with the Forest Plan. Similarly, an alternative that
designates many more motorized routes in ungulate habitat will have greater impact
on wildlife habitat than an alternative that does not.
In addition, even if compliance with forest plan standards could show that
minimization criteria have been met, the HNF has failed to comply with all relevant

(138-3) Refer to Alternative 5.
The Forest Service must show that it has actually minimized impacts per the
minimization criteria, and not rely merely on consistency with the Forest Plan as a
proxy for compliance with the separate and independent duty to minimize impacts.
This requires the agency to, at the very least, conduct a comparative analysis of the
action alternatives considered and to then, on the basis of the District Court
decisions and a hard look analysis, and provide a rationale for how and why the
alternative selected meets these mandates.

III. Motorized Dispersed Camping and Game Retrieval
This decision would allow cross‐country motorized big game retrieval (MBGR) for
all hunters and motorized dispersed camping to occur up to 300 feet from a
designated route. This exception to the ban on cross‐country travel is not applied
sparingly and is thus in violation of Forest Service guidance and the TMR. We are
extremely concerned that the exception to the ban on cross‐country travel for
motorized game retrieval and camping does not address the need to prohibit
motorized off‐road travel to protect natural resources and does not adequately
protect wildlife and wildlife habitat. (138-3)
The expansive application of the exemption for MBGR and motorized camping does
not meet the requirement that the Forest must “[a]pply the provision for big game
retrieval and dispersed camping sparingly . . ..” FSM 7703.11(4) (138-4) (emphasis
added). As explained in
the Federal Register notice announcing the dispersed camping rule: “Responsible
officials may include in the designation the limited use of motor vehicles within a
specified distance of certain designated routes, and if appropriate within specified
time periods, solely for the purposes of dispersed camping or retrieval of a downed
big game animal . . ..” 73 Fed. Reg. 74,612, 74,612‐13 (Dec. 9, 2003) (emphasis

added). Similarly, the “Department expects the Forest Service to apply this
provision sparingly, on a local or Statewide basis, to avoid undermining the
purposes of the final rule…” 70 Fed. Reg. 216 68285 (Nov. 9, 2005). The Forest
may not simply designate a motor vehicle exception for all, or a large number, of
routes. The Federal Register notice also makes clear that the use of this exception to
the ban on cross‐country travel is in no case required to be used. Id.
The plain language of the rule, the “sparing” and “limited” application of this
exception to the ban on cross‐country travel must necessarily be with the
designations themselves, not the anticipated use. This understanding is also
supported by the fact that the anticipated use of MBGR areas is hypothetical and
largely out of Forest Service control, while the restriction within the designation is
within the control of the Forest Service. Center for Biological Diversity et al. Page
14 of 46 11/05/012
Even if the proposed expansive MBGR and motorized camping provisions could be
adopted as a substantive matter, the procedures required to do so would be onerous
and far beyond what has either been completed or contemplated. First,
complementary to the requirement that MBGR be designated sparingly, the rules
mandate that the Forest “[a]pply the provision for big game retrieval and dispersed
camping sparingly after conducting travel analysis and appropriate site‐specific
environmental analysis and public involvement.” FSM 7703.11(4) (emphasis
added). Accordingly, the Forest Service would have to do site-specific analyses
under NEPA for all these areas that are within 300 feet of a motorized trail or road,
not just for designated roads and motorized trails. This would require the standard
“hard look” under NEPA analyzing direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to all
these areas. Substantive protections under NFMA for streams, including
sedimentation, impacts to fish habitat, etc., would need to be analyzed. This hard
look is not evident in the EIS. (138-5)

IV. No Action / Baseline
NEPA was enacted to ensure that information on the environmental impacts of any
Federal action is available to the public before decisions are made and before
actions are taken. Projected impacts of alternatives are compared in the EIS to those
impacts projected in the no action alternative. How the no action alternative is
defined, therefore, determines the intensity of environmental impacts in each
alternative.
(138-8) Thank you for your comment.
The Divide’s DEIS glosses over the true environmental impacts from each
alternative because the no action alternative was not designed appropriately. We
reiterate our concern from our previously submitted scoping comments that any
environmental analysis would incorporate the 11.6 miles of non‐system roads and
trails into the baseline for comparison of alternatives, and thus fail to create a
comparison with the current designated system of roads and trails. If the existing
system is the baseline then there would be no point of comparison; you would just
be evaluating different action alternatives without using the designated system as a
point of reference. In this case all the identified non‐system routes would be treated
as if they had already been authorized through previous analysis, but that is clearly
not the case since the 2001 Tri‐State ROD directed land managers to conduct site‐
specific analysis for all existing non‐ system routes before they could be designated
for off‐road vehicle (ORV) use. That detailed analysis of the impacts from the
nonsystem routes and continued motorized use of those routes has not been
completed in this DEIS. (138-7)
Our request that the HNF redefine the no action alternative is not without purpose. It
is important that the public understand the projected environmental impacts from

making changes to the transportation system, particularly the addition of new
motorized trails to the system that is maintained and legally accessible to the public.
Using only the currently designated system as the baseline condition will ensure that
the HNF accurately discloses impacts as it proposes changes to the designated
system. Additionally, if you demonstrate that you are carefully evaluating those
routes in the action alternatives, it will be easier to explain why specific ones were
not included in the final designated system. (138-8)

Response to Comments

Forest Service direction supports our position of what constitutes the baseline open,
designated system:
11.1 – Baseline System
Consolidate existing direction on travel management for the area under
consideration into a single location. This step should not create new direction.
Rather, this step involves compiling past decisions that guide motor vehicle use,
including maps, travel atlases, road and trail management objectives (FSM 7714),
maintenance records, and monitoring reports for National Forest System (NFS)
roads and NFS trails on the administrative unit or ranger district.

(138-9) Thank you for your comment.

FSH 7709.55, Ch. 10. [Emphasis added.] The Forest Service Handbook clearly
shows that only system roads and trails are appropriate for the baseline system, and
therefore it is this direction that should also define the no action alternative and the
situation to which all alternatives should be compared.
The HNF’s official motorized transportation system is comprised of designated
roads and trails. The designated transportation system does not include non‐system,
unauthorized routes. The Forest Service’s 2001 Tri‐state Off‐Highway Vehicle EIS
and Forest Plan Amendment Decision (Tri‐state decision) did “not change current
road or trails designations” on the HNF. Tri‐state FEIS at 1. Rather, the purpose of
the Tri‐state decision was to simply “restrict motorized wheeled cross‐country
travel.” Tri‐state FEIS at 1. The Divide TMP process is proposing to make changes

impacts from these proposed changes to the designated transportation system,

V. Range of Alternatives
a. DEIS Action Alternatives unreasonably narrow, with few real distinctions
NEPA requires a “hard look” at “all reasonable alternatives,”6which in this case
would include one or more alternatives emphasizing different conditions under
which motorized access for dispersed camping would be allowed. The Forest
Service Handbook guides managers to:
Develop other alternatives fully and impartially...[and] ensure that the range of
alternatives does not prematurely foreclose options that might protect, restore, and
enhance the environment.7
NEPA further “mandates that agencies ‘study, develop, and describe appropriate
alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves
unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.” Pit River
Tribe v. U.S. Forest Service, 469 F. 3d 768, 785 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting 42 U.S.C.
§ 4332(2)(E)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(iii) (agency must consider
“alternatives to the proposed action”). Given the proposed dispersed camping
provisions of Alternatives 2 and 3 would result in potentially unresolved impacts
(i.e., conflicts) associated with the protection of as‐ yet undiscovered heritage
resources, the HNF failed to give meaningful consideration to alternatives as they
relate to unmitigated impacts to forest soils, vegetation and heritage resources
resulting from the motorized cross‐country allowance for dispersed camping. (13810)

(138-10) Heritage The Helena National Forest currently manages
945 known cultural resources, of those, 238 cultural resources
represents quarries, mines, homesteads, etc. The Helena National
Forest also has 14 Historic Mining District that cover large
landscape which include multiply associated features, such as
building ruins, adits, shafts, ditches, roads, and trash piles. Of
those 945 cultural resources, 7 sites are listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (3 of them are on the Helena Ranger
District), 839 sites have not received eligibility determination,
therefor they are treated as Eligible. Forty-eight sites have been
determined Eligible for listing, but have not been formally listed
and 51 sites have been determine Not Eligible for listing in the
National Register.
A total of 181 cultural resources are identified within or adjacent
to roads and trails in the Divide Travel Plan area. These cultural
resources were discovered and documented as a result of prior
cultural resource reconnaissance and project inventory in the
travel plan area. On-the-ground inventory of each road and trail
affected by the proposed Divide Travel Plan has not been
undertaken because the Forest Service is considering only
whether a road or trail will remain open or closed in this land use

by modifying an existing alternative to address concerns expressed by nonmotorized recreationists. (138-12)

the subject of separate environmental analyses. NHPA Section
106 compliance (including historical research) survey will be
completed then, as necessary, for roads and trails proposed for
obliteration.
The proposed motorized route closures would be beneficial to
cultural resources by preventing easy vehicle access to sensitive
cultural resources which helps to abate vandalism and artifact
theft. For example, historic mining buildings accessible by
motorized routes located in the planning area have been
dismantled to obtain antique wood for various decorative uses
such as in home remodeling and picture frames. Mining
equipment, such as ore carts and old equipment parts, have found
new homes as lawn and landscaping ornaments. Prehistoric and
historic properties are a non-renewable resource. They represent
a resource base that cannot be replenished. For this reason
several federal laws and regulations have been established that
require federal agencies to identify, monitor, protect, and
preserve cultural resources under their jurisdictions. Through the
final NHPA Section 106 process, all undertakings would be
identified and addressed, and any necessary mitigation measures
incorporated into the project design or other appropriate heritage
resources agreement. The goal is to avoid, minimize, or mitigate
impacts to significant cultural properties.
Since the late 1970s, cultural resource inventories have preceded
all ground-disturbing Forest Service projects on the Helena
National Forest, including vegetation treatments, livestock
grazing, restoration, and recreation development. The majority of
the cultural resources described in this travel plan analysis were
discovered as a result of these compliance inventories. In fact,
many archaeological sites were found because they were exposed

The HNF failed to adequately take into account public comments made during the
scoping period. Public comments supported further closing of trails and roads to off
highway vehicles in order to protect wildlife security issues and general resource
concerns. After the scoping period, the HNF created alternatives 3 and 4 in response
to these comments, and then failed to adequately consider these alternatives when
proposing an alternative for implementation. (138-13)
Alternative 3 would implement further closures in the Kading‐Limburger Springs
Area. During the summer months, three existing routes would be closed, but open to
over‐snow travel during the winter months and one route would be shortened. In the
Sweeny Creek Area, the existing unauthorized routes would be closed to motorized
travel all year round, with exception of Priest Pass Road. In this alternative, almost
nine miles of identified unauthorized routes would be added to the Forest Transport
System. Additionally, there would be no consideration given for motorized access
during the big game rifle season. While this is an improvement, and, with changes,
could be a viable option, we cannot fully support this alternative as written. (138-14)
VI. Comments on Specific Alternatives
a. Sweeney Creek Primitive Area – Special Case
The 7,800‐acre Sweeney Creek Primitive Area is proposed as a “quiet trails and
wildlife area” in the Montana High Divide Trails agreement,8 and the area is unique
national forest tract, connecting high‐quality wildlife winter ranges in the Helena
Valley to the Continental Divide near Priest Pass. Proximity to town and law
enforcement allowed off‐road vehicle traffic to alter the once‐quiet nature of
Sweeney Creek. The proposed action would legalize a dense maze of approximately
10 miles of unlawful off‐road vehicle tracks during the summer months for vehicles
smaller than 50”.During the winter months, the proposed action would close the area
to over‐snow travel, which we support. (138-15)

in old road and trail beds. In most cases, project boundaries and
treatments would be reconfigured to avoid impacting significant
cultural resources so they could be preserved and the effect of
these actions on cultural resources would be relatively minor.
All forest actions require NHPA compliance and consultation
therefore the effects on cultural resources would be mitigated
through project redesign and/or avoidance. Roads and trails have
been constructed through archaeological and historic sites over a
period of many years. Regardless of alternative, road use has the
potential to degrade cultural resources, particularly prehistoric
archaeological sites.
Any federal actions that poses an adverse effect to cultural
resources (for example EPA cleanup) is required to consult with
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Tribal Historic
Preservation Office (THPO) to mitigate those effects (36 CFR
800). A few examples of mitigations are public interpretation,
data recovery, or site relocation.
The Helena National Forest has in the past and will continue to
manage the Montana legacy for future generation through
scientific investigations, preservation, restoration, rehabilitation,
adaptive reuse (historic rental cabins), public interpretation and
overall cultural resource management.
The 1939 Helena National Forest Visitor Map is the map we
currently use to determine the baseline age of trails and roads
across the forest. The “existing and historic route” RS 2477 does
not appear on the 1939, 1959 or 1969 Helena National Forest
Visitor map; therefor we do not consider it a historic route or

The majority of the roads are not currently legally defined on the forest transport
system, and have never been proposed, analyzed or identified for public input in
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. These routes, when
designated for future motorized use, must be fully analyzed and efforts that have
been taken to minimize the impacts from these routes must be fully disclosed.
Failure to do so is a violation of law and policy.

A full NHPA Section 106 analysis is not needed at this time

cause effects to historic properties. The Advisory Council on
Historic Preservations national policy on cultural resources and
road and trail designations states…
“the following categories of proposals shall be considered
undertakings with the potential to affect historic properties,
triggering evaluation under Section 106 of the NPHA, 36 CFR
part 800 and the applicable programmatic agreements:
construction of a new road or trail; authorization of motor vehicle
use on a route currently closed to vehicles; and formal
recognition of a user-developed (unauthorized) route as a
designated route open to motor vehicles. Existing, formally
established system (classified) roads and trails, already open to
motor vehicle travel, generally need not be re-evaluated for
purpose of this rule. Their designation on a motor vehicle use
map will not generally be considered an undertaking for the
purpose of NHPA and not subject to Section 106 review.”
FSM 2364.35 states one of the administrative measures to protect
cultural resources from human-caused and environmental
damage is “Closure to public and motor vehicle access”. The
closure of historic routes or routes that lead to sensitive cultural
resources is considered a protection and preservation measure.

routes contribute to the existing condition and how each route would change under
the various alternatives. (138-18)

disclose the impacts of increased miles of motorized trails on lynx habitat
connectivity. Calculating net reductions is not sufficient to assess local habitat
connectivity in areas that support lynx. The DEIS makes no attempt to assess the
degree of fragmentation. (138-19)
With respect to grizzly bears, the DEIS fails to adequately address the recognized
expansion of the distribution zone in 2013. As the bear population increases, there
have been further accounts of bears outside of their traditional area on the upper
reaches of the Little Blackfoot watershed, moving south. Because of the vagueness
of the defined area of grizzly bear habitat, we raise serious concerns that efforts to
minimize effects on this endangered species. Increasing roads endangers both the
species and any humans who interact with them. (138-20)

Response to Comments
(138-19) This analysis is provided in the Wildlife Background
Report in sections on “Canada Lynx” (p. 192-204) and “Grizly
Bear” (p. 184-192).
Changes in connectivity and the size of non-motorized areas
available to lynx and other species under different alternatives
are discussed in the Wildlife Background Report (p. 91, 139-146,
192-193, 194-204). As discussed in the Background Report,
lynx can have problems with highways (such as Highway 12 in
the Divide landscape) but are little fazed by the low-use Forest
roads characteristic of most of the Travel Plan Area. Nor do they
have problems with snowmobile trails per se (as problems with
snowmobile trails stem from access provided to competing
carnivores).

VIII. Conclusion
We extend our appreciation to the Forest Service for the opportunity to provide
these comments regarding the DEIS for the Divide TMP process. Your efforts to
engage and educate the public in this process through meetings and phone
conversations have been truly appreciated. Our intent in providing these comments
is to work cooperatively with the Forest Service and the larger interested public to
ensure that the HNF – as a public trust resource – is properly managed for the long‐
term public interest for the benefit of existing and future generations.

(138-20) The Wildife Background Report discusses the expanded
Grizzly Bear Distribution Zone and its implications for bear
management (p. 86-89, 184-187). All action alternatives reduce
open rod density.

(138-21) Thank you for your comment.

To summarize our comments, we have serious concerns with Alternative 2 and its
recommendation to add previously unauthorized trails to the forest travel map
without NEPA analysis. Alternative 2 is not supportable. We appreciate the HNF’s
development of Alternative 3 – it’s clear that you took our concerns into account as
many of the concerns we raised in our scoping letter are reflected in this alternative.
Alternative 3 proposes to decommission roads, prohibit motorized travel on
previously unauthorized trials, protect and improve water quality, restore wildlife
habitat, and enhance the ecological integrity of roadless areas. Although Alternative
3 is a much better proposal, we do not support it in its current form, although it is

still preferable over the current Alternative 2. (138-21)
The Divide TMP effort offers an extraordinary opportunity for real restoration. We
urge the HNF to make the suggested improvements to Alternative 3 and pick this
alternative in the record of decision so that the Divide area is on a path to true
restoration, ensuring effective protections are in place while also providing
sufficient motorized access.

Response to Comments

We look forward to working with the Forest Service as the TMR implementation
process moves forward. We are available to discuss our comments and concerns
raised in the letter.

Dear Heather and Jamie,
My family and I hike, hunt, fish, and pick berries and mushrooms on the Helena
National Forest (HNF) lands of the Helena Ranger District. Sometimes we cut
some firewood too. We value quiet foot and horse trails and wildlife, above all else.
Our family generally supports Alternative #3.
The state of travel management on the Helena Ranger District (HRD) has been sadly
deteriorating for years.

Figure 1. Vandalized Road Closure sign on USFS Road #335.

Unfortunately, the HRD has put off the Divide Travel Plan for well over a decade…
a decade in which motorized use of areas like Sweeny Creek and Priest Pass, has
exploded. The vast majority of this increasing motorized use is in the form of

illegal, user-created routes that damage soil and water quality, spread weeds, and
compromise wildlife security. As an avid conservationist, hiker and hunter, this
exploding network of illegal roads and trails on the HRD sickens me. This is
country I have hiked and hunted in since the early 1990s. Lack of effective travel
management is written all over this area in the form of undeniable resource damage.

Response to Comments

Please close and rehabilitate the maze of illegal tracks and trails north of the USFS
boundary cattle guard in Sweeny Creek. Also please close the illegal roads in
Sections 20, 21, and 28, Township 10 North, Range 5 West, identified as “divide
non-system roads” identified by your HNF Watershed Team. (139-1)

Figure 3. Illegal road and ford across Sweeny Creek in Section 28, T. 10 N., R. 5
West. The HRD placed a jack leg fence across this track after this damage occurred,
but as of two years ago, insisted that this was indeed a ROAD and therefore could
not be permanently closed without NEPA analysis. Yet no analysis has been done
on many miles of user created routes that the HRD has put forward to legitimize via
the travel planning process. PLEASE DO NOT LEGITIMIZE illegal motorized
use on the HRD. (139-2)

(139-2) Thank you for your input.

Much of the HRD has been hard-hit by the mountain pine beetle. The canopy is
more open than it has been in many years, and big game security (hiding cover) is at
a real low point. Combine these factors with unregulated motorized travel, and the
ill-thought-out hazard tree removal project and there is no place for an elk to hide!
The travel management situation is especially frustrating to me (and many other

in Sweeny Creek/Priest Pass area to the attention of the HRD repeatedly over the
last 15 years.

well over half a mile. Now, thanks to the hazard tree project, firewood is further
from main roads than it used to be and people are pushing even further off of system
routes to get it.

The few photos I have included illustrate HNF travel management failures in a very
small part of the HRD, but many other parts of the divide planning area have
suffered the same problems in the last 20 years.
Lastly the rugged, rocky (Boulder batholith) ground in Sections T. 10 N., R. 5 W.
Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, and 23 is actually ROADLESS and has

MONTANA FISH, WILDLIFE & PARKS COMMENTS ON THE
HELENA NATIONAL FOREST DIVIDE TRAVEL PLAN DEIS
Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (MFWP1) submitted detailed comments on the
Helena National Forest (HNF) travel planning effort for the Helena Ranger
District’s (HRD) Divide Travel Plan area in 2009, during the “Proposed Action”
phase of the Travel Plan (TP) revision (MFWP 2009a, 2009b). Earlier, in 2003,
MFWP submitted comments during the HNF’s start at revising its individual Travel
Plans (MFWP 2003). At one time, a portion of the Divide TP was being reviewed in
conjunction with the Blackfoot TP, under the title “Blackfoot-North Divide” TP,
and MFWP submitted comments at that time (MFWP 2007). Many of those
comments remain relevant today; hence we have enclosed copies of each.

INTRODUCTION/GENERAL
MFWP recognizes that the Helena Ranger District is a highly fragmented landscape
(roughly 70-80% roaded), with numerous private land inholdings, numerous roads
and an urban population center situated in the middle of its eastern slope. Pressure
to develop inholdings, to increase recreational opportunities (both motorized and
non-motorized), and to manage the wildland-urban/suburban interface and exurban
areas is expected to continue, and to increase. Recreational use will also continue to

increase. The extensive amount of tree mortality due to mountain pine beetle
infestations will change the character of the forest with attendant impacts to wildlife,
district wide, for many years to come. All together, these factors present
management challenges for the Helena RD as a land manager and for MFWP as
manager of Montana’s fish and wildlife populations.
MFWP greatly appreciates the HRD’s efforts to include our biologists in discussions
on how to best improve wildlife habitat through both the travel plan and the big
game security Forest Plan amendment. We look forward to continuing this work.
Our comment below is organized by topic, with a discussion section and specific
recommendations listed numerically under each topic. Some of our
recommendations are iterative between topics because they apply to more than one
area or wildlife issue.
While MFWP has significant comment related to the DEIS, and in particular habitat
management for big game and grizzly bears, the extent and thoroughness of the
proposal necessitates focus. In light of this we offer a number of central principles
that drive our comments and specifically apply to proposed travel management in
the Divide landscape. It is our hope that the Helena National Forest will consider
these under all alternatives.
Roads and their effects are one of the most significant drivers of ecosystem health;
minimizing their footprint on the landscape is necessary to retain high quality and
functional habitats (Foreman et al. 2003). Roads can fragment habitats and
adversely impact landscape connectivity (Lindenmayer and Fischer 2006). We
generally suggest that overall road densities (open and closed) be minimized and
that route density is ultimately lower than currently proposed under any of the
alternatives. In principle we recommend minimizing habitat fragmentation by
retaining and consolidating secure habitat blocks, clustering existing road networks,
closing spur roads, arresting the expansion of user-created routes, and protecting
critical habitats like meadows, riparian areas, and grassland parks. To be most
effective, changes to travel management should minimize complexity and be

consistently enforced. (140-1)

Response to Comments

1 The Divide Travel Plan DEIS variously refers to Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks
as FWP, MDFWP and MFWP. We usually use the abbreviation FWP, but are using
MFWP in our letter for consistency with use in the Reference section of the
DEIS.(140-2)

(140-2) Thank you for your comment.

REDUCE HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, INCREASE CONNECTIVITY AND
HABITAT SECURITY
Under Alternatives 3 and 4, the DEIS proposes to reduce routes open year round to
highway legal vehicles by 24 and 21 miles, respectively (total motorized route
reduction of 71 and 57 miles, including unauthorized roads and trails). While this
reduction would marginally improve habitat for wildlife in a few areas, the impacts
of the motorized footprint would remain largely unchanged throughout the Divide
planning area. The Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless Area (IRA) south to the
Sweeny Creek Area and from Black Mountain IRA south to the boundary with the
Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest (BDNF) as well as the Electric Peak
Inventoried Roadless area are of particular interest. These portions of the HRD are
highly fragmented, with limited functional secure habitat and connectivity.
In order to improve the effectiveness of proposed closures, MFWP agrees that to the
extent practicable, while still serving resource needs, that “the complexity of the
Forest visitor use maps would be emphasized by reducing the number of different
travel restriction types including seasonal restrictions; this would assist in making
travel management simple and concise (i.e. current plans have 12-15 different
closures)” (DEIS Summary pg 5, 4th bullet under Sideboards Used to Develop the
Proposed Action). In contrast to the DEIS existing direction (Summary pg 1, para

5), MFWP recommends: (140-3)

Response to Comments

Specified decommissioning of roads should be part of the decision space for the
Divide Travel Plan. (140-3)
All travel restrictions should be clearly signed.
Where necessary, closed roads should be gated and/or otherwise blocked to deter
illegal trespass. (140-3)
All closures should be consistently enforced.
Focal Areas
In addition to the closures proposed in the DEIS, MFWP recommends that
additional year-round closures be enacted in certain focal areas. That is, where it is
possible to close enough routes within a given area such that functional secure
wildlife-habitat blocks could be established and/or expanded, more closures should
be implemented. (140-4)

(140-4) This has been the focus of some of the route closures
proposed under different alternatives. Site-specific examples are
provided in the wildlife Background Report, “Local Effects in
Key Areas” (p. 242-282).

As FS and MFWP biologists have already discussed, areas such as the southern
portion of the Jericho Mountain IRA (and potentially from there south along the
Divide) have inherently greater wildlife habitat values and could provide additional
habitat connectivity along the continental divide (CD) as well as habitat for resident
wildlife, including big game security during fall hunting seasons (9/1-12/1). MFWP
supports closure of route 527-B1 as proposed under Alternatives 2-4 and
recommends closure of 1863 north from its juncture with the Minnehaha Creek
Road (route 527), and closure of 1863-E1. MFWP recommends year-round closure
to motorized use of these routes. (140-5)

(140-5) Route 527-B1 would be closed yearlong in Alternative 25. Road 1863 south of Bulllion Parks runs directly atop the
Divide—a route traditionally used as a travelway by numerous
wide-ranging wildlife species. However, it’s use as an access
route for several purposes (including private property) has made
it a difficult route to close—and it would remain open under all
alternatives. Field surveys (2013) indicate that the road is still
being used as a travel route by elk, deer, coyotes, mountain lions,
and probably others.
Road 1863-E1 would be closed in Alternative 5.

The Greenhorn Mountain area and the 10-Mile Creek-Prickly Pear Creek divide
should also be considered for additional route closures. At Greenhorn Mountain,

(140-6) Alternative 5, route 622 and part of 1853 would remain
open year-round. All of the others would be closed. Alternative

closure of routes 622, 1850, 1851, 1853, 1853-B3, 1853-B4, 1853-C1, and 1853-D1
would bridge two blocks of habitat into an area ≥1000 acres. (140-6)

Response to Comments
5 would close routes 1876-A1, -C1, and –E1 would be closed.
The others would remain open.

The Quartz Creek area is the most fragmented area on the HRD. At the 10-Mile
Creek-Prickly Pear Creek divide, we recommend closure of 1876 and its sub-routes
(-A1, -B1, -B3, and -E1), which do not connect to routes on the BDNF adjoining the
HRD at this divide. This would add or expand an unfragmented block of habitat
within the Quartz Creek area. MFWP does not support the opening of sub-routes
1876-C1 and 1876-D1 as proposed under all the action Alternatives. (140-7)

(140-7) Thank you for your comment. Refer to Alternative 5 for
sub route closures.

On the 2006 HNF Travel Plan Map, route 1876 appears to be a light-duty gravel
road, and route 218 (just to the west of 1876) is depicted as an unimproved dirt road.
On the maps provided with the DEIS, route 218 is listed as a state or county road.
Which of these designations are correct? (140-8)

(140-8)218 is a county road.

to over-snow motorized vehicles, and 1801, 1801-A1, 1801-A2, and 1801-A3 are
closed yearlong to all motorized use. Under all the action alternatives, the 1801
road system would be open to snowmobile traffic, and in Alternatives 2 and 4, 4104A1 and 4104-A2 would be opened to vehicles with 50-inch-or-less width from 5/16
to 10/14. Opening the road networks, to either winter or summer travel in this area
bounded by the continental divide and Electric Peak roadless area would
compromise existing security for elk, grizzly bear, forest carnivores, and other
species. We advocate a winter area closure south of 4104-A1 and 4104-A2 to the
CD. This closure would, block up two portions of the Electric Peak IRA. (140-9)
Under Alternative 2, roads 314-A1 and 314-E1 just south of Elliston--which are
currently closed yearlong to all motorized travel--would be opened to highway-legal
vehicles year-round, creating a parallel travel route to 314 itself. For these roads, we
support Alternatives 1, 3, and 4, which retain the existing condition whereby

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 701

Comments
snowmobile access only is allowed on roads 314-A1 and 314-E1 (140-10)
Closures of roads and trails west of Kading campground in the North Fork of
Spotted Dog Creek and Limburger Spring would, depending on which Alternative is
selected, expand a secure block of big game habitat adjoining Spotted Dog Wildlife
Management Area (WMA) from 28,080 to 33,046 acres. This is the only HNF land
south of Highway 12 that has “lesser travel restrictions,” and it is an important
linkage between elk summer range in the Little Blackfoot and winter range on the
Spotted Dog WMA. Road 314 provides good access to this area--the three parallel
travel routes across T8N, R7W, Sec 7 and 18 are unnecessary and compromise big
game security. Yearlong closure of 314-J1 and 314-J3 would be appropriate. (14011)
Non-system trails MTR-501, -502, -503, and -504 are shown on the existing
condition map (Alternative 1) as “trails open to vehicles 50” or less in width[,] 5/1610/14,” but Table E.2 (Appendix E, pp 20, 25) indicates they are category M-07,
“trails open to vehicles 50” or less in width, no seasonal restrictions.” Under
Alternative 3 and 4, they would be closed to motorized vehicles yearlong. Closure
of these 4 “MTR” routes--as well as 314 where it meets T8N, R7W, Sec 7, 314-J1,
314-L1, and 314-J3--would merge two existing big game security areas and create
the largest big game security area in the Divide planning area (33,046 acres). Given
the high hunting pressure and open landscape on the Spotted Dog WMA, these
closures would improve habitat security in the Spotted Dog/Little Blackfoot area,
where it is critically important. (140-12)

MFWP urges the HNF to close routes in and adjacent to the Nevada Mountain IRA

vehicles--in addition to permanently closing authorized and unauthorized routes
there--in order to protect and expand one of the few remaining blocks of secure
habitat in this portion of the Divide Travel Plan area. (140-13)

Creek , all routes in this area would be closed in Alternative 5.
Benefits to wildlife of closures in the Black Mountain/Ophir
Creek area are discussed in the Wildlife Background Report (p.
278-282).

MFWP recommends that such closures be implemented year-round for public
wheeled-motorized use to the maximum extent possible. If seasonal closures are
considered, MFWP recommends closure from 9/1-5/15 to increase functional habitat
during spring and fall and, in particular fall big game habitat security. (140-15)
(140-14) Refer to Alternative 5.
Wildlife Movement Corridor, Habitat Connectivity

(140-15) Refer to Alternative 5.

The entire Divide Travel Plan area is important as a wildlife movement corridor
connecting the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem (NCDE) and areas further
south of Helena. (140-16) This connectivity is particularly important for grizzly
bears and forest carnivores along the continental divide and through the Greenhorn
Mountain/McDonald Pass and the Spotted Dog/Little Blackfoot areas. In the Divide
Travel Plan area, there are four areas on the Helena Ranger District north of
Highway 12 where forested habitat becomes constricted, but still provides direct
wildlife connectivity between the northern and southern portions of the District.
Because there are few land conservation measures on surrounding private lands near
these constrictions, MFWP places particular emphasis on improving connectivity
there. These four areas are the:
Round Top Mountain/Dago Gulch/American Gulch area,
Pauly Springs/Dog Creek/Mullan Pass area,
Mullan Pass/Greenhorn Mountain/Priest Pass area, and
McDonald Pass area. (140-17)

(140-16) The Helena NF rcognizes the importance of the Divide
landscape as a linkage zone—as discussed in the Wildlife
Background Report (p. 30-40, 138-146) and in equivalent
sections of the FEIS.

(140-17) Thank you for your input. Refer to alternative 5.

MFWP encourages consideration of additional road closures and the
decommissioning of illegal user-created trails in these areas in order to enhance
wildlife connectivity to and through these especially important habitat blocks.
Therefore, MFWP specifically recommends:
Close, add restriction to, or decommission roads in the area between Meyers Hill

and Roundtop Mountain. For example roads 1811, 1852-B1, 1852-A1, 1852, and
trail 136-007 should be decommissioned. MFWP does not support designation of
unauthorized route 136-007 as a motorized trail, as proposed under Alternatives 2
and 4. (140-18)
Close, add restriction to, or decommission 1888-002 (an illegal road south of Dago
Gulch in the headwaters of Dog Creek). (140-19)

MFWP supports the Helena Ranger District’s proposal to restrict motorized use year
round at MacDonald Pass under both Alternatives 3 and 4, closing route 1802 and
designating the area as closed to snowmobile use. (140-22)
The current and proposed motorized network on the Helena RD is more than
adequate to provide access for big game hunting. In fact, the existing network
severely fragments secure habitat blocks and this lack of fall big game security is
likely limiting bull elk survival and retention of elk on the Helena RD. Thus,
leaving routes 335-A1 and 335-A2 closed, as proposed under Alternative 3, would
help to maintain connectivity and would expand a block of unfragmented secure
habitat. (140-23)

(140-23) Refer to Alternative 5.

MFWP does not support the opening of routes 335-A1 and 335-A2 during the fall

to provide motorized access during the fall hunting season.

management and monitoring efforts necessary to maintain a recovered grizzly bear
population in the NCDE.
This Conservation Strategy provides a cohesive umbrella for all signatories to
operate under and reference but each signatory has their own legal process and
authority to implement the Strategy. This Conservation Strategy would remain in
effect beyond recovery, delisting, and the five year Monitoring period required by
the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The agencies are committed to be responsive to
the needs of the grizzly bear through adaptive management actions based on the
results of detailed annual population and habitat monitoring (pg ii, para 1).
The overall goal for habitat management under the CS on public Federal lands is to
maintain or improve habitat conditions that existed as of 2011, while maintaining
options for resource management activities at approximately the same levels that
existed in 2011. When adopted, these standards would replace existing regulatory
standards included in all agency management plans. The Draft CS document is
under final review and targeted to be released during the fall of 2014, with the hope
of starting the delisting process some time in 2015.

MFWP recommends that the HNF include the CS (USFWS 2103) in the regulatory
framework section and the policy sections of the Final EIS (FEIS) and that the HNF
use the CS as a guiding document in the travel planning process. The CS and all its
recommendations for the Zone 2 grizzly bear distribution area should also be
incorporated into the FEIS’s version of Appendix A (Forestwide Standards, Forest
Plan Consistency and Management Area Direction). (140-28)

(140-28) All proposed Travel Plan alternatives are consistent
with the recommendations.

A forest-wide food storage order is also necessary. (140-29)
To adhere to the CS it is imperative that any Helena National Forest management
actions affecting inventoried roadless areas falling within the NCDE Management
Zone 2 (CS, Figure 1, pg 6) be consistent with the CS standards and be in place
before the grizzly bear delisting process begins. (140-30)
Under the Conservation Strategies agreement, IRAs in Zone 2 are considered
advantageous to and vital for grizzly bear conservation. Therefore, any changes to
an IRA that allow for motorized access to these areas are not recommended. (14031) Within the Divide Travel Plan area there are four Inventoried Roadless Areas,
several smaller blocks of unroaded lands, and additional blocks of habitat that
provide the opportunity for grizzly bears to safely move between the NCDE and
adjacent ecosystems (e.g., the Greater Yellowstone Area; GYA). In these areas
management should emphasize maintaining CS habitat standards, reducing
motorized activity, and maintaining and enhancing wildlife security. Generally,
inventoried roadless areas should be maintained or expanded.

(140-29) The food-storage order currently applies to the Lincoln
Ranger District. The Helena District has been considering
applying it to the Divide landscape—but it will not be done as
part of the Divide Travel Plan. A decision will be made once the
forest amendment to the Conservation Strategy is in place.
(140-30) No new roads or motorized trails are proposed in
inventoried roadless areas under any alternative.

of Forest Plan standards governing big-game security provision. It is imperative that
the Divide Travel Plan adequately provide and protect secure fall big game habitat
on the Helena Ranger District. Any reduction of fall big game habitat security or
lifting of restrictions as a result of the big game security forest plan amendment for
the Travel Plan, as it relates to the Helena Ranger District and Zone 2, is
incompatible with the goal of maintaining or enhancing 2011 habitat conditions
under the Draft NCDE Grizzly Bear Conservation Strategies Agreement for grizzly
bears. MFWP suggests that the Helena NF work closely with MFWP biologists to
accommodate grizzly bear habitat standards during amendment of the Forest Plan to
address fall big game habitat security. If security needs for big game are ultimately
met on the Divide Travel Plan area, grizzly bear habitat needs will also largely be
met for this portion of the CS Zone 2. (140-33)

Focal Areas
Under Alternatives 3 and 4 the DEIS proposes to reduce or eliminate certain routes
open year-round to Highway Legal Vehicles, including unauthorized roads and
trails. While these route closures would marginally improve habitat for wildlife in a
few areas, the overall impacts of the motorized route system would remain largely
unchanged in the Divide Travel Plan area under any action alternative. DEIS
Appendix C (Additional Wildlife Information) states on page 15 about Alternative 3
(arguably the most beneficial to wildlife) that this alternative would add only 97
acres of functional habitat, “not enough to measurably augment local wildlife
populations.” From Nevada Mountain IRA south to the Sweeny Creek Area, and
from Black Mountain IRA south to the boundary with the BDNF, the HNF would
remain severely fragmented with limited functional secure habitat and connectivity.
In addition to the closures proposed in the DEIS, MFWP recommends that
additional, year-round closures be implemented in and near the focal areas we
identified above. Where route closures can create or expand functional secure
wildlife habitat blocks more closures should be implemented. (140-34)

Any changes to the Forest Travel Plan on the Helena Ranger District that will

Response to Comments

Habitat Security & Closure Dates
The DEIS proposes seasonal motorized closure dates on trails and roads throughout
the plan area that allow travel through October 15th. Roads open during the fall
hunting seasons (9/1-12/1) reduce big game and grizzly bear security. CS
management criteria for grizzlies in Zone 2 are fundamentally tied to existing
habitat recommendations and closure dates for maintaining big game security.
MFWP has noted (MFWP 2009a; pg 6, Seasonal Restrictions, para 2) that motorized
traffic/access in remote areas during fall hunting seasons significantly reduces big
game security and that motorized-closure dates on trails and roads with restrictions
should begin on September 1, not October 15. (140-35) This earlier closure date for
motorized roads and trails in remote areas is especially important if the Helena
Ranger District adopts the policy of allowing motorized use, game retrieval and
dispersed camping within a 300-foot buffer along both sides of all motorized roads
and trails.
Consistent with the consensus of the Joint Working Group--a group of MFWP and
FS biologists who prepared the “Collaborative Overview and Recommendations for
Elk Habitat Management on the Custer, Gallatin, Helena, and Lewis and Clark
National Forests” (MFWP and USDAFS 2013)--MFWP urges that seasonal closures
extend from 9/1-5/15 in order to increase functional secure habitat during the fall.
(140-36)

(140-35) Alternative B in the Forest Plan amendment has been
developed in response to comments regarding closure dates.
“Security is defined as a proportion of an elk herd unit within the
administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District that
consists of an area of at least 1000 acres in size that is at least ½
mile from a motorized route open to the public between 9/1 and
12/1.” See Forest Plan amendment, Alternative
Description/Alternative B.

(140-36) Alternative 5 proposes the 9/1 closure date for all but a
couple routes.

Attractants/Food-Storage Order
Securing potential attractants is the single most effective way to prevent black bears
and grizzly bears from becoming food conditioned and developing subsequent

grizzly bear mortalities, grizzly bear human encounters and other grizzly bearhuman conflicts. The CS states that “the Helena National Forest and the BDNF are
in the process of implementing a food storage order on all lands in Zone 1 and Zone
2.”

Response to Comments

MFWP recommends that the Helena Ranger District implement a food-storage order
(140-37) Food closure orders are outside the scope of the Divide
and suggests it be addressed in the Divide Travel Plan. (140-37) We encourage the
Travel Plan.
Helena Ranger District to implement food storage standards for all of the District’s
developed campgrounds, dispersed camp sites, trail heads, grazing allotments
(carcass management), administrative sites, rental cabins and USFS cabin lease sites
at the Moose Villa Tract along the Rimini Road, the Forest Heights Tract at
McDonald Pass, the Prickly Pear Sportsman Association’s target range at McDonald
Pass, and the Lion’s Sunshine Camp along the Little Blackfoot River. This will be
especially important if the Helena Ranger District proceeds with plans allowing
wheeled motorized access for camping within 300 feet on either side of designated
system routes (roads and trails).

FOREST CARNIVORES
Marten, fisher, lynx, and wolverine (which we collectively refer to as forest
carnivores) utilize habitats with high structural complexity for both foraging and
denning (Ruggerio et al. 1994). The persistence of these populations is tied to the
availability of secure refugia in habitats that maintain a variety forest types and
terrain. Denning habitat is likely a limiting factor for both fisher (Powell 1993) and
wolverine (Copeland 1996).
MFWP recommends minimizing road networks and over-snow travel in potential
wolverine habitats (Copeland and Harris 1994). (140-38)

OFF-ROUTE TRAVEL
Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 would allow OHV use within 300 feet of any motorized trail
or road. MFWP believes this policy will be abused and will encourage off route
travel, excessive road braiding and resource damage, especially in areas with open
ridge lines and meadows. In addition to causing greater disturbance to wildlife, the
policy will ultimately lead to more dispersed camping, more poor camping etiquette,
and ultimately more attractant-related bear conflicts. If a 300-foot use-buffer is
allowed on either side of a road or trail right-of-way, then the HNF should formally
analyze expected impacts associated with a 600-foot corridor (~1/10-mile wide)
along open motorized roads and trails (140-40) Impacts would vary, but the areas
where impacts are most likely to occur--open meadows, grassland parks and riparian
habitats--are some of the most vulnerable and are important areas for wildlife on the
HNF. Edge affects--including microclimatic drying, introduction of invasive
species, and increased nest predation-- will be greatly increased by such a broad
human-use buffer (Hartley and Hunter 1998, Lindenmayer and Fischer 2006).

Comments
Response to Comments
MFWP appreciates the clarification in the Summary (Public Comments and Agency
Clarifications, pg 10, item 1; emphasis DEIS) that, “The routes the HNF are
proposing to open are in areas that are currently open to over-snow motorized travel;
however, the road prism in the open areas is currently closed which was an
oversight when the original forest plan and maps were approved and produced. The
original intent was for roads to be closed to wheeled motorized use, not over-snow
motorized use.”
We understand the desire to allow winter use of roads for snowmobiling where offroad use of snowmobiles is also allowed. In past comment (MFWP 2009b; pg 6,
General section, #2), we therefore supported managing motorized over-snow travel
by designating areas closed to such travel, rather than designating specific winter
road closures. Some provision to allow snowmobilers to pass through closed areas
on main arterial routes may be acceptable in some cases.
MFWP supports closing additional areas to over-snow use as proposed under
Alternatives 3 and 4 (such as Nevada Mountain to Meyers Hill).
MFWP supports the concept that roads designated closed to wheeled motorized use
yearlong but open to motorized over-snow use under this Travel Plan Decision may
still be considered for full decommissioning in a separate NEPA analysis and
decision (Ch 3, pg 154, Alternatives 2, 3, 4, “Direct and Indirect Affects,” para 2).

MFWP recommends that identified big game winter ranges and the edges of winter
ranges be closed to all motorized use, with the exception of main, arterial routes

These roadless areas serve as important wildlife refugia and have ever-increasing
value to maintaining wildlife populations and enhancing fisheries.
Within the Jericho Mountain IRA, MFWP supports closure of route 527-B1 as
proposed under Alternatives 2-4) and supports the additional area restriction to oversnow use. However, MFWP recommends closure of route 1863 north from its
juncture with the Minnehaha Creek Road (route 527), closure of 1863-E1, and
expansion of the area restriction to include the entire Jericho Mountain IRA.
MFWP strongly recommends closing the Nevada Mountain IRA, and all roads
within it, to all motorized travel, including over-snow travel. This would be
consistent with adjacent Lincoln Ranger District’s travel planning and protect this
high-value movement corridor and wildlife habitat (including grizzly denning
habitat). For this Travel Plan area, these closures should include portions of
Threemile Creek, Georgia Creek, Black Mountain, and roadless areas north of
Meyers Hill.

Closure Dates
North of Montana Highway 200, MFWP strongly recommended that snowmobile
seasons end April 1st (with a single exception for the “Copper Bowls” area of the
Lincoln RD). A standard April 1st closure date north and south of Highway 200,
within the Lincoln and Helena RDs, would benefit to grizzly bear, wolverine
(Copeland 1996), and other wildlife. April 1st is the date commonly accepted by
land managers as the spring emergence date for grizzly bears in the Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystem. There may be specific areas in the Divide Travel
Plan area that may be appropriate for later spring closures but these should be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. (140-50)
MFWP recommends that April 1st be the closure date for off-road snowmobile use
across the Divide Travel Plan area in order to protect wildlife (including denning
grizzly bear and wolverine, spring survival for ungulates, etc.) and reduce user
confusion. (140-51)

(140-50) Currently, the only grizzly bear denning areas known or
suspected to be situated in the Divide landscape are in the
headwaters areas of the Little Blackfoot River and the Little
Prickly Pear watershed. The upper Little Blackfoot is in the
electric Peak Roadless Area and is entirely off-limits to
snowmobiles. Most, but not all of the upper Little Prickly Pear
drainage is also closed to snowmobiles. Additional restrictions
may be applied as more specific information on grizzly deanning
emerges.
(140-51) There is no known wolverine denning habitat in the
Divide landscape, and in those areas that appear to hold some
potential as such, there are no snowmobile routes and no known
off-route riding (see Wildlife Background Report, p. 205).

BIG GAME WINTER RANGE
The Sweeny Creek area is important big game winter range. Designating this area
as non-motorized year round will result in a substantial block of unfragmented
habitat (4,185 acres; >2,500 acre increase from Existing Condition) for big game
and other wildlife species. These 4,185 acres will provide the only block of secure
habitat on public land east of the continental divide and north of Highway 12 within
the project area, unless additional motorized route reductions are also implemented
in the vicinity of Greenhorn Mountain.

BIG GAME SECURITY
MFWP generally supports the Forest Service’s proposal to amend Standard 4(a) to
instead use the “security area” concept (“Hillis Paradigm”; Hillis et al. 1991) as the
basis for providing and monitoring effective big game security on the HRD.
However, we disagree with how the framework was applied in the Proposed Forest
Plan Amendment for Big Game Security (hereafter, the Amendment). We will
explain why we disagree and offer alternatives.

District (MFWP 2007) for its travel planning (relative to the Blackfoot-North Divide
Winter Travel Plan proposal, 2nd scoping):
The Habitat Conservation Plan for Grizzly Bear, developed by the Montana
Department of Natural Resources and Conservation for Forested State Trust Land

1993, Proffitt et al. 2013), clearly demonstrated that motorized route density,
location, and timing of use are the most important factors affecting public-land bull
elk survival. Hillis and his coauthors recommended retaining large, non-linear,
strategically located, and well-distributed patches of non-motorized habitat during
the fall hunting season to both protect bulls and prevent displacement of elk from
public lands.

Response to Comments

The objective of a big game security standard should therefore be to ensure that
adequate and well-distributed secure, big game habitat is retained within Travel Plan
Elk Herd Units5, so that such provision will both protect a defined proportion of
bulls from harvest and prevent the displacement of public elk from public lands
during the fall hunting season. The correct measure of the standard’s adequacy is not
elk population counts or trends within MFWP Hunting Districts or FS Elk Herd
Units, although these are referenced in the discussion of big game security in the
DEIS and the Amendment.
Across the HRD, big game habitat security is first and foremost a function of fall
motorized-route density and location. However, forests on the HRD are more
naturally open, hiding/screening cover is not ubiquitous, and tree regeneration is
slower following disturbance, compared to either the Superior6 or the Lincoln
Ranger District. Therefore, specific provisions quantifying and protecting “cover”
may be a necessary component of a big game security standard for the HRD.
A complete application of the Hillis Paradigm requires that managers specifically
designate large and well-distributed security areas within Elk Herd Units. We think
the current proposal selectively, and incorrectly, applies portions of the Hillis
Paradigm as a basis for amending the Big Game Security Standard on the HRD.
Minimum Security Area Patch Size
The field research that led to the development of a minimum “security area” patch
size recommendation (Hillis et al. 1991, Lyon and Canfield 1991) was conducted in

the Lower Clark Fork drainage of western Montana. That study area’s topography,
forest composition, and public-private land matrix were significantly different than
those on the HRD. The authors explain that in the Lower Clark Fork, “conditions are
favorable for elk to elude hunters: cover is dense, terrain is steep, and forest
communities are largely unfragmented” (Hillis et al. 1991:39). Although the authors
recommended that, on their study area, secure patches are a minimum of 250 acres
in size and comprise at least 30% of a herd unit’s fall home range (EHU), they were
clear that where forests are more sparse and where terrain is less formidable (as in
the HRD), the size of security areas must be significantly larger in order to provide
similar security to resident elk.

boundaries should be defined…specifically by the local herd home range during
hunting season.” The FS-FWP Joint Working Group Recommendations take the
definition of an Elk Herd Unit from the literature: “Ideally, herd unit home ranges
are defined by animals, typically on the basis of radio relocation data collected over
enough time and for all seasons that the annual use patterns of elk form a pattern
(Hillis al. 1991, Lyon and Christensen 1992).” Therefore, MFWP uses the term Elk
Herd Unit to capture the area used by elk on a year round basis, regardless of
ownership. MFWP uses the term Elk Analysis Unit to indicate that portion of an
Elk Herd Unit within the FS administrative boundary.
6 The field research that led to the development of a minimum “security area” patch
size recommendation (Hillis et al. 1991, Lyon and Canfield 1991) was conducted in
the Lower Clark Fork drainage of western MT. That study area’s topography, forest
composition, and public-private land matrix were significantly different than those
on the HRD.
HRD forests are drier and have sparser understories than those in the Lower Clark
Fork; there are more natural openings, the topography is generally less severe, and
the District is highly fragmented due to the extensive network of motorized routes
and private land inholdings. Nevertheless, in the DEIS the HNF proposes only the

minimum recommended security area patch size , 250 acres, and an even lower
proportional retention of secure habitat, 30% of an Elk Herd Unit within the FS
boundary, as the new standard for Big Game Security on the HRD. This proposed
standard is not adequate and not supported by the literature. (140-54)

Response to Comments

In order for security areas on the HRD to adequately protect bull elk and reduce
displacement of elk to private land refuges during hunting season, individual
security areas need to be much larger than those proposed in the Amendment and
the proportion of secure habitat must be increased. In addition, some consideration
of cover is likely warranted, perhaps in the form of a limited amount of disturbance
to cover or specific regeneration or restorative plans.7 (140-55)

(140-55) Refer to Alternative 5.

On the HRD, MFWP supports using a standard 0.5-mile buffer around roads, trails,
and private land inholdings open to motorized travel during the fall season (9/112/1) as the basis for security area analysis. Because the effectiveness of a security
area is necessarily a function of distance to its unsecure edge, patches with
constrictions ≤0.5 mile in width should be separated at that constriction and
analyzed individually. The USFS/MFWP Joint Working Group strongly
recommended that 9/1, rather than 10/15, should be considered the beginning of the
fall hunting season because the number of archery hunters, and their use of forest
roads, has grown substantially in recent decades. (140-56)

(140-56) Thank you for your input.

Preliminary analysis of the application of these criteria to each proposed Divide
Travel Plan Alternative indicates that implementing any of the action Alternatives
will only marginally improve big game habitat security. Under all of the proposed
alternatives, none of the EHUs contain enough large blocks of secure habitat to
sufficiently provide functional big game security at minimum recommended levels,
and this lack of fall security likely limiting both survival of bull elk and retention of
elk on public lands during the fall hunting seasons.

(140-57) Thank you for your comment, refer to Alternative 5.

In addition, blocks of secure habitat are not well distributed, resulting in significant
expanses of unsecure habitat. All six EHUs on the HRD would require more road

Alternatives, in order to substantially improve big game security during fall and to
move them toward any minimum recommendation. (140-57) In most EHUs, it will
be challenging to increase the amount of functional secure habitat to minimum
recommendations as proposed by the literature, the Joint Working Group, and FS
and MFWP biologists, who are continuing to work together to develop a habitat
security standard that would be appropriate and effective for the HRD.

Response to Comments

(140-58) Thank you for your comment, refer to Alternative 5.

On the HRD, MFWP and FS biologists agree that, at minimum, a 1,000-acre patch
size (closed to public motorized access 9/1 – 12/1) is likely necessary in order to
function as secure habitat, and effectively retain elk on HNF lands despite increases
in disturbance associated with hunting or other human activity (Lyon and
Christensen 1992, Christensen et al. 1993, Stalling et al. 2002). This patch size
represents a minimum effective patch size and this recommendation in no way
justifies reducing patch sizes to meet this level (Hillis et al. 1991). (140-58)
(140-59) Thank you for your input.
Intermittent Refuge Areas
MFWP and FS biologists also recognize that smaller patches of non-motorized
habitat may serve as “intermittent refuge” for elk and other big game in the HRD
and recognize the importance of retaining these smaller patches because of the
limited ability to add patches, or expand patches to ≥1,000 acres. While these
smaller habitat patches are unlikely to provide effective big game security, in some
EHUs these smaller patches are all that is available (be they truly functional security
patches or not). (140-59) As such, these patches may play a role in big game
security in an EHU and should be protected and enhanced wherever possible. Under
all of the action Alternatives, preliminary analysis indicates that 3 of the 6 EHUs
would have only one block of habitat meeting the security definition described
above.

Response to Comments

Security Area Design and Distribution
The size of a security area is just one predictor of its effectiveness (Hillis et al. 1991,
Christensen et al. 1993). Topography, open road locations, patch shape, and forest
structure all help determine how large these areas need to be in order to provide
similar benefits in different areas.
(140-60) Thank you for your input.
The Hillis Paradigm is most effective when managers can manipulate the density,
specific location, and seasonal use of motorized routes “so results make biological
sense in a local setting” (Hillis et al. 1991)-- i.e., during Travel Plan development.
At present, MFWP and FS biologists are working together on both the Divide Travel
Plan and the Big Game Security Amendment. We hope that this collaboration will
result in an effective big game security standard--one that effectively improves bull
survival and increases retention of elk on public lands during fall hunting seasons.
MFWP supports travel management that increases big game security on the HRD.
To successfully implement this approach to elk security management, road closures
must be effective and effectively enforced. When possible, permanent closures or
decommissioning are preferable to relying on signage or gates. (140-60)
Displacement of elk from National Forests can result in increased damage to crops
and grazing pressure on rangelands, which can be costly to land-owners, decrease
their tolerance for wildlife, and cost MFWP political and financial capital to
mitigate. Hunter opportunity and MFWPs management capabilities generally
decrease as elk are displaced from public to private lands. Large herds of
inaccessible elk on private lands challenge the very concept of public ownership of
wildlife.

In order to correctly apply the Hillis Paradigm the Forest Service would need to
analyze, and ensure provision of, security areas across the full fall range of the
District’s EHUs. Hillis et al. (1991) stress that, “to be biologically meaningful,
analysis unit boundaries should be defined . . . specifically by the local herd home
range during hunting season” and should not be adjusted for land ownership. (14061)We understand why this is not practical on the HRD and why the Forest Service
proposes to limit its analysis of elk security to lands within the National Forest
boundary.
The boundaries of several of the EHUs presented in the Big Game Security standard
analysis in the DEIS are incorrect and do not include off-Forest elk herd-use areas
(year-round, winter, or fall). The boundaries of the EHUs east of the Continental
Divide were not generated with input from MFWP biologist(s) for at least the last
two iterations mentioned in the DEIS, and the actual EHU boundaries are
incorrectly truncated within private lands, arbitrarily 1.5 miles beyond the Forest
boundary. Several of the Helena Ranger District’s actual EHUs are underrepresented.(140-62)

(140-62) Forest Plan Amendment – analysis

(140-63) Thank you for your comment.

All HRD EHUs include non-Forest Service (primarily private) lands; in some cases,
the Forest Service manages only half of a herd unit’s actual fall range. The Forest
Service cannot restrict, nor effectively analyze, fall motorized-use of private land
within (actual) HRD herd units. Therefore, these private lands must be considered
unsecure for the purposes of any security standard compliance analysis. (14063)The Hillis Paradigm recommends that a minimum of 30% of an Elk Herd Unit be (140-64) Refer to Divide Travel Plan Alternative 5 and

standard given unequal distribution of private lands within and among HRD EHUs.
Finally, because both the proportion of National Forest land and the functional
security of private lands within herd units vary across the District’s herd units,
application of a single, uniform, security area retention standard for all herd units is
impractical. The HRD should develop security area and intermittent refuge area

retention standards for each individual HRD EHU. MFWP recommends that those
standards be tiered directly to the relative acreage of secure areas and refuge areas in
each EHU, as developed collaboratively by FS and MFWP biologists8.(140-64)
Because the Forest Service has no authority or ability to monitor fall motorized
travel within significant (mostly private) portions of the HRD EHUs, a full
application of the Hillis Paradigm is not possible. For an amended Helena Ranger
District Big Game Security standard to both meet management objectives and allow
consistent project-level analyses, it should only consider security areas within the
National Forest boundary over which it has motorized travel management authority.

(140-66) Refer to Amendment Alternative B.

Fall Hunting Season Dates
Hillis et al. (1991) and others suggest that for habitat patches to be considered
“secure” there should be no motorized routes open near or through them during the
fall hunting season. The proposed amendment incorrectly identifies the fall hunting
season as 10/15-12/1. Archery big game, fall black bear, fall mountain lion,
mountain grouse, and other hunting seasons open in early September. Big game are
vulnerable in and displaced from unsecure habitat during September and early
October. All routes that are open to public motorized travel at any time between 9/1
and 12/1 should be considered when identifying security areas. MFWP agrees with
the USFS and MFWP Collaborative Elk Habitat Working Group recommendation
that low intensity and occasional administrative travel and management activity on
fall closed routes should not change their status for the purposes of the security area
analysis. (140-66)

Game Security Standard Amendment. We are explicitly considering the habitat
needs of a suite of fish and wildlife species, including big game, during this process.
MFWP biologists consistently state that fall motorized-route density is unacceptably
high throughout most of the HRD and that specific routes and motorized-use areas
unacceptably compromise elk habitat security. MFWP supports the maintenance or
establishment of some motorized trails in areas where such trails would have fewer
impacts on fish and wildlife habitat, and are outside of focal areas important as
wildlife habitat, habitat connectivity, and big game security. (140-67)
While MFWP supports the designation of big game security areas as a means to
both manage and measure functional big game security within established Helena
Ranger District EHUs, we believe the approach was incorrectly applied in the
original Amendment proposal. As an alternative, MFWP recommends the

The proportional area of individual EHUs that meet the above security area criteria
should be substantially increased from Existing Condition, as determined by FS and

Game Security standard.

Response to Comments

Smaller blocks of unfragmented habitat (“intermittent refuge areas,” 250-999 acres
in size) within the NF boundary should be defined as HNF lands >0.5 miles from
roads, trails and private lands open to public motorized travel during the fall season
(9/1-12/1).
Patches meeting the intermittent refuge area criteria above should be reviewed by
FS and MFWP biologists to determine whether or not these patches are likely to
provide intermittent refuge for big game species. MFWP recommends that patches
that are determined to likely provide such intermittent refuge be incorporated in an
amended big game security standard.
MFWP and FS biologists continue to collaborate on how to best incorporate cover
into any amended big game security standard.(140-69)
Status of Elk Herds within the Divide Travel Plan Area
MFWP no longer collects data tracking the percentage of bulls harvested during the
first week of the rifle season; therefore, no recent data are available to assess habitat
security using this metric. Instead, MFWP uses harvest data and post-season aerial
classification surveys to monitor HRD elk herds.
For all MFWP elk Hunting Districts (HDs) overlapping the HRD, MFWP’s bull
survival objective is to “Maintain bull:cow ratios observed during post-season aerial
surveys above a minimum of 10 bulls:100 cows.” In recent years, three of the four
hunting districts overlapping the HRD fluctuated both above and below MFWP’s
minimum bull survival objective. Limited security habitat on the HRD may be
affecting bull survival.

HD 215
During general rifle season, brow-tined bull elk may be taken with a general elk
license in HD 215, and antlerless harvest is allowed with a B license. Surveyed elk
populations in this HD have been well over the population objective of 1400 elk
since 2009. The observed elk count went from 953 in 2006 to 1122 in 2007 when
spring surveys were converted to winter surveys. Subsequently observed elk
numbers have continued to increase significantly to 2234 in 2014. Some wintering
elk use other HDs for portions of the year, but at this time we do not have data from
marked elk to determine what proportion of wintering elk migrate outside the HRD.
The predominant winter range in HD 215 is on MFWP’s newly acquired Spotted
Dog WMA, a portion of which is within the Little Blackfoot/Spotted Dog EHU.
While overall numbers of elk are far above objective, bull numbers, in particular
mature bulls, are low. In 2011, 87% of the observed bulls during late winter surveys
were spikes. Bull:cow ratios were slightly above the objective of 10:100 (14:100 in
2012 and 12:100 in 2013), but the disproportionate numbers of spikes demonstrate
that hunting pressure is significant in the area and security could be improved to
increase survival of bulls. High numbers of antlerless elk licenses (500 B licenses in
2013) likely contributed to increased harvest of bulls because prior to the 2014
hunting season, hunters who had harvested an antlerless elk could remain in the field
to hunt bulls. Substantial bull harvest in 2012 occurred on the newly acquired
WMA. There is concern that a reduction of security on the WMA as well as
increased hunting pressure on the HNF in the Little Blackfoot/Spotted Dog EHU is
displacing elk onto private lands. MFWP will gather additional data and inputs from
our publics, which could result in restricting bull harvest within the WMA in 2016.
Our input regarding travel management on the HNF recognizes that MFWP and the
HNF jointly manage habitat for elk in the Little Blackfoot/Spotted Dog EHU.

HD 335
This hunting district is managed for general bull hunting opportunities; brow-tined
bull harvest is legal with a general license. HD 335 remained above MFWP’s
population objective for the past three years, and during the preceding 24 years,
observed numbers have fluctuated both above and below the objective. The bull:cow
ratio has been at or below the minimum 10:100 objective for the past two years
(11:100 and 9:100, respectively). Improvements to habitat security may also
improve bull survival in this HD.
HD 343
This hunting district is managed for general bull hunting opportunities; brow-tined
bull harvest is legal with a general license. The observed number of elk was above
the population objective once in the past 26 years, and remained at the midpoint of
the objective for at least the past 4 years (2011-2014). Prior to 1999, the observed
number was below population objective. This HD has been below the long-term
average for calf:cow ratios in 8 out of the last 13 years. Over the same time period,
the bull:cow ratio has been either right at or below the minimum objective of 10:100
for 6 of 13 years. Thus, the existing levels of big game security have not
consistently yielded bull:cow ratios meeting MFWP’s objective.
Improvements to habitat security may also improve bull survival in this HD.

All six EHUs on the HRD require additional road closures to substantially improve
big game security during fall and to move them toward any minimum
recommendation. Quartz, Greenhorn, Little Prickly Pear-Ophir, and Jericho EAUs,

north from its juncture with the Minnehaha Creek Road (route 527), and closing
route 1863-E1. (140-80)
Functional big game security is highly limited within the Little Prickly Pear

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, MFWP finds that none of the four alternatives reduces overall road
densities enough to appreciably improve wildlife habitat and big game security in
the Divide landscape. While road densities decrease in some areas, these gains are
generally offset elsewhere. Roads open to highway-legal vehicles yearlong are only
reduced by 21 miles (286 miles vs. 265 miles) when the existing condition is
compared to the most dissimilar option--Alternative 4. Overall Alternative 3 is
generally best for wildlife and fisheries, however, that is within the context of 4
Alternatives that (as the Big Game Security Amendment shows) are, in fact, quite
similar. (140-88)
In some areas big game and other wildlife have already shifted their range from
public to private lands and this trend is accelerating. Low security and habitat
effectiveness on the HNF are likely contributing to this problem. While big game
and grizzly bears are management foci for MFWP and those concerns form the bulk
of our comment, we believe that by retaining and enhancing large blocks of secure
habitat and minimizing landscape fragmentation many species will benefit. Our
comments are intended to provide the HNF additional options to improve travel
management in the Divide landscape rather than to specifically critique the existing
DEIS. We hope that our comments reflect that intent and provide MFWP and the

APPENDIX A. PURPOSES OF THE NCDE DRAFT CONSERVATION
STRATEGY

Describe and summarize the coordinated strategies, standards, and guidelines
developed for managing the grizzly bear population, grizzly bear/human conflicts,
and grizzly bear habitat to ensure their continued conservation in the NCDE.
Document the regulatory mechanisms, legal authorities, policies, management
documents, and monitoring programs that will maintain the recovered grizzly bear
population.
Document the commitments agreed to by the participating agencies.
Within the NCDE, the grizzly bear population and its habitat will be managed using
an approach that identifies a Primary Conservation Area (PCA) and three additional
management zones (Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.) Each management zone is a
mosaic of land ownerships, with different types of habitat protections reflecting the
mandates and interests of each agency or Tribal government.
The PCA is currently known as the NCDE Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone. None of
the Forest lands within the Divide Travel Plan area fall under this category. The
PCA is where the most conservative habitat protections would remain, with habitat
conditions that were compatible with the increasing grizzly bear population from
2004‐2011 being maintained. The PCA will be managed as a source area where the

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 737

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
goal is continual occupancy by grizzly bears. Here, secure habitat, road densities,
developed sites, and livestock allotments would be maintained at levels known to be
compatible with a stable to increasing grizzly bear population. In regard to the
Helena National Forest, these would be the Helena NF and other federal and state
lands north of MT Highway 200 in the Lincoln Ranger District. Any major
“developed site” projects within the PCA that are intended to accommodate public
use and recreation are subject to “developed site standards” under the Draft CS.
These are the same standards currently in place to accept or deny proposed projects
within the NCDE grizzly bear recovery area. The intent of these standards is not to
increase the number of “developed sites,” such as ski areas, snowmobile play
grounds, new motorized trail loop systems, and increased capacity trail head/parking
lots within the PCA. Any new projects within the PCA will require an “application
ruling” (as they do now within the recovery area), and if approved will require a
“corresponding reduction” such as the closure of a similar site or some other form of
appropriate mitigation. Again, there are no projects within the Divide Travel Plan
management area that fall under this category.

Response to Comments

Grizzly bears are also expected to occupy habitat outside the PCA in the Zones 1
and 2 portions of the Helena NF (there are Zone 2 forest lands within the Divide
Travel Plan area) where they may serve as a source population to other grizzly bear
ecosystems in the lower 48 States. Habitat protections are less restrictive in Zones 1
and 2. However, there will be a management emphasis to maintain habitat standards
and non-motorized road and trail standards in and around existing blocks of special
management lands that existed in 2011. Bear occupancy will not be actively
discouraged in these two zones and the emphasis for managing habitat will be
maintaining and enhancing existing conditions in roadless areas and special
management habitats.
Zone 1 includes major portions of the Lincoln Ranger District, but there are no Zone
1 lands within the Divide Travel Plan area. As mentioned above habitat protections
in Zone 1 will focus on maintaining and limiting miles of open roads and trails in
current roadless areas as stepping stones to other ecosystems.

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 738

Comments

Response to Comments

Zone 2 includes all the Forest lands within the Divide Travel Plan area.
Management Zone 2 will be managed to provide the opportunity for grizzly bears to
move between the NCDE and adjacent ecosystems (e.g., the Greater Yellowstone
Area, GYA) via the multiple large blocks of habitat with motorized use restrictions
that already exist as of 2011.
There are no Zone 3 designated lands with the Helena Ranger District. Zone 3
primarily consists of areas east of the Rocky Mountain Front where grizzly bears do
not have enough suitable federal land-habitat to support population growth. These
lands are included within the Conservation Strategy because a bear living in Zone 3
most likely originated from the NCDE population. Grizzly bear occupancy will not
be actively discouraged in Zone 3, but there are limited habitat standards associated
with this zone.

Re:
Comments on HNF Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact
Statement
Dear Ms. DeGeest:
I’m writing to submit general and specific comments regarding the Proposed Action
for the Divide Travel Plan. I’ve lived in Helena for 26 years, and I’ve hiked most of
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and numerous other trails within the
travel planning area. I’ve also led group hikes into the Nevada Mountain Roadless
Area. I have a strong interest in this travel planning, I commented at the beginning
of the process, and I appreciate the opportunity to comment again.
GENERAL COMMENTS
The Travel Plan Should Protect the Primitive Values of the Continental Divide
National Scenic Trail:
Hikers come from all around to hike the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
for a primitive hiking experience, away from motor vehicles. 16 USC § 1246(c)
prohibits use of motorized vehicles by the public along any national scenic trail,

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 740

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
with certain exceptions. The intent of Congress, in enacting the National Scenic
Trail System, was to restrict motorized traffic to the extent possible, and national
Forest Service policy has been to try to eliminate motorized use on the CDNST
whenever reasonably possible. In 1997, Deputy Chief Forester Robert C. Joslin
issued a memorandum stating, in part, that: “It is the intent of the Forest Service
that the CDNST will be for non-motorized recreation.”

Response to Comments

To achieve the intent of a primitive trail, and to maintain the Continental Divide as a
meaningful wildlife corridor, please close all trail portions of the Continental Divide
Scenic Trail to motor vehicles, year around, and create as much of a quiet, nonmotorized buffer for the trail as possible by closing to motorized travel those
sections of Helena National Forest roads that lead to the CDNST or intersect it,
except for the roads that have been specifically found to be reasonably necessary for
reasons other than motorized recreation. (141-1)
For example, people have used the Helmville-Gould Trail to access the Nevada
Mountain Roadless Area with motor vehicles. Closing this route to motor vehicles
from the Marsh Creek side should significantly reduce this illegal incursion. (141-2)
The Travel Plan Should Emphasize Quiet Trails throughout the Planning Area:
The travel plan should emphasize the value of quiet areas and the displacement of
wildlife and non-motorized hikers, hunters, and other recreationists by off-road
motor vehicle traffic. Due to the high number of miles of open roads on the HNF, a
reasonable balance of non-motorized and motorized recreation opportunities can be
obtained by closing all trails to motorized use and by closing unnecessary roads.
Maintaining the traditional distinction between roads and trails is necessary to:
maintain high quality wildlife habitat into the future, including protection of
threatened and endangered species; minimize soil erosion; minimize the spread of
noxious weeds and the threat they pose to native vegetation; provide quiet trails for
traditional forest recreation; and to avoid user conflicts. (141-3)

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 741

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
Response to Comments
The Travel Plan Should Protect the Remaining Roadless Areas in the Planning Area:
The travel plan should prohibit all motor vehicle travel, winter or summer, in the
roadless areas within the planning area. According to the Forest Service’s own
studies, a motorized route in a roadless area removes primitive characteristics for
three miles on either side of the route. USDA Forest Service ROS Users Guide, p.
18 (August 1982). (141-4)
The Travel Plan Should Reduce Road Density to Appropriate Standards for Wildlife
Protection:
The DEIS states that elk hiding cover requirements are not being met in most
portions of the planning area, due to road density and tree insect infestations. This
supports closing all trails to motor vehicles year around and reducing road density to
the extent necessary to protect wildlife habitat and security. (141-5)
The Travel Plan Should Protect Traditional Hunting Opportunities and Ethics:
Studies show that the harvest of bull elk increases with increased hunter access.
Eventually, this will lead to reduced elk populations and hunting opportunities. Elk
use and numbers decline in areas adjacent to roads open to motorized vehicles, and
the (141-6) sound of an ATV is likely to chase deer and elk away from other
hunters. Hunters who have walked into a prime location may have their efforts
spoiled by an ATV, and some hunters use ATVs to pursue game off designated
routes. The only way to control conflicts with pedestrian and horseback hunters and
limit off-route motorized pursuit of game is to prohibit motorized use of trails.

SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Please Close Forest Road 227-E1 from Kading Campground to the trailhead for the

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 742

Environmental Impact Statement

Comments
Electric Peak Roadless Area (Trail 329 to Blackfoot Meadows):

Response to Comments

As proposed under Alternative 3, please close to motorized traffic the approximate
one-mile length of road from the turnaround at Kading Campground south to the
northern edge of the Electric Peak Roadless Area. This narrow road is not
maintained and is seriously rutted in wet weather. Off-road motorized traffic in wet
weather also has created deep ruts leading from the road to camping areas near the
river. I’ve walked this road many times, and closing it would create a buffer for the
roadless area and would create a nice quiet, accessible family trail for Kading
Campground users and other hikers. Also, motorized access to the user created
camping area at the end of the road is not necessary because of the close proximity
of the campground and dispersed camping sites off the main road, north of the
campground. (141-7)
Please Close the Kading Grade Trail to Motor Vehicles Year Around:
Please also close the Kading Grade Trail to motor vehicles year around to protect
the primitive qualities of the Electric Peak Roadless Area and wildlife habitat in the
area. I’ve hiked this route, and non-motorized travel is much more compatible with
the primitive nature of the area and wildlife security needs than motorized travel.
(141-8)
Proposal to Adopt Certain Non-System Routes:
The travel plan should not adopt any recently created user-created routes. (141-9)
While off-route travel, in general, may not have been specifically prohibited in some
areas in the past, creation of unauthorized roads and trails constitutes a criminal act
in violation of federal law. Adopting user-created roads and trails in the planning
process only provides an incentive for further user-created routes and continued
destruction of forest resources.
In a February 25, 1997, letter to FWP, Dennis Hart, then Helena District Ranger,

Appendix D – Response to Comments - 743

wrote:

Response to Comments

“Each year, new trails are being illegally constructed on National Forest system
lands by a handful of forest users. These routes were never proposed, analyzed or
identified for public input in compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act.
Although public lands may be open to motorized recreation, federal regulations
prohibit the unauthorized construction or maintenance of trails. Increasingly each
year, new trail routes are being illegally constructed . . . . In many cases, these trails
have been built specifically to accommodate ATVs . . . illegal trails are not
recognized as a segment of the forest transportation system. Unauthorized trails on
National Forest lands often create serious management and resource conflicts . . .
it’s important to close the unauthorized trails before motorized use becomes
established.”
Former HNF Supervisor Tom Clifford repeated the same message in a memo to
HNF District Rangers, dated August 22, 2002, citing the federal regulations quoted
above and stating that: “I am asking District Rangers to please take the steps
necessary to protect our traditional trails system.”
Although some non-system routes may have been historic routes that just weren’t
formally designated as HNF routes when system routes were first designated, all
non-historic user-created routes should be closed year-long to motor vehicle travel
and obliterated as resources allow, in order to deter further illegal motorized traffic
off designated routes. (141-10)

1. Protect Nevada Mountain wildlands along the CDT by adopting Alternative #3,
the only alternative based on a collaborative winter agreement endorsed by the
Montana Snowmobile Association, Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks and the
Montana Wilderness Association in 2005.
2. Protect the CDT corridor between Bison Mountain and the headwaters of Ontario

To Helena District Ranger Heather DeGeest:
Greetings and welcome to Helena if you have come from elsewhere. I hope your
duties allow you to get out of the office and see a lot of the country you are working
with. We are very fortunate here in Helena to live in the midst so many beautiful
places in the Helena Ranger District.
I am writing to urge you to fully protect the Continental Divide Trail corridor all
through the Helena Ranger District. My wife and I have been working on hiking all
the segments of the local CDT for years and I think we have about done it. One of
our favorite areas is Nevada Mountain. It is probably the wildest part of the CDT on
the district. The flowers, the vistas, the quiet, and the solitude remind me of being
somewhere in the Bob, and yet it is within range for a day hike from Helena. So
please continue to protect the Nevada Mountain area from motorized use year
around. (144-1)

(144-1) Refer to Alternative 5.

Another special area is the headwaters of the Little Blackfoot River. We have
camped there in the winter and skied up Bison Mountain and I have walked back to
Helena from Little Blackfoot Meadows. It’s pretty neat to have a virtual wilderness
within a 3‐day walk of my front door.

I always dreamt of hiking the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. The other
two spectacular north-south mountain trails in this country are the Pacific Crest Trail
and the CDT. Every time I walk a segment of any of the trails, including the CDT, I
feel like I'm on sacred ground. They are cherished by thousands. Nevada Mountain
area near Helena is one of the wildest areas around. I have hiked several of the trails
and skied the ridges. Alternative #3 will protect it. The Little Blackfoot Roadless
area is also a nearby gem that has a multitude of wildlife (I've seen moose, bear and
elk), great trails and excellent back-country camping. It is another gem that will be
protected by Alternative #3. And I'm excited to learn that Sweeney Creek is
proposed as non-motorized and will be rehabilitated. These are all local areas that
are loved.

Winter Wildlands Alliance (WWA) is a national advocacy organization representing
the interests of human-powered winter recreationists across the U.S. Collectively,
WWA represents over 50,000 members and 35 grassroots partner organizations in
10 states, including Montana. One of these groups with a strong connection to the
project area is Montana Wilderness Association.
Opportunities for quality, non-motorized winter recreation, are of utmost importance
to our members – many of whom enjoy cross-country skiing and snowshoeing along
the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail on the Helena Ranger District. This
travel plan is one way to ensure such opportunities are protected, and the landscapes
in which they occur are conserved. To that end, we appreciate that the Helena
National Forest is analyzing year-round motor vehicle use.
Here, our comments focus on over-snow vehicle use – including seasonal
restrictions – and also reference, and reinforce, some aspects of DEIS comments
submitted by the Montana High Divide Trails Partnership, of which Montana
Wilderness Association is a member. In particular, we support the development of
an Alternative 3a (or 3+), as detailed in their comments.

Consistency with Forest Plan Direction
The 1986 Helena National Forest Plan offers important direction regarding
Recreational Opportunity Spectrum (ROS), management of Primitive areas,
recommended wilderness and the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail – among
other topics – which are relevant for consideration in the Divide Travel Plan.
The Forest Plan1 standard relating to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
clearly states that:

Response to Comments

“Once the comprehensive plan is approved, management direction will be
incorporated further into this plan. Based on the Comprehensive Plan, a more
detailed analysis will be completed showing trail segments, objectives and specific
route locations.”
Travel plans must, in turn, adhere to the relevant Forest Plan, as well as travel
planning regulations. A comprehensive plan for the Continental Divide National
Scenic Trail was finalized in 2009, and is discussed more in the next section.
The Forest Plan also provides important direction for wild lands that would be
impacted by this decision. Nevada Mountain inventoried roadless area – an “R-1”
class (non-motorized) Primitive Management Area – is one such area that deserves
to be protected for its wilderness character. The Divide Travel Plan DEIS has some
critical gaps in its analysis for Nevada Mountain that should be corrected with
respect to over-snow vehicle use, including a cumulative impacts analysis of crosscountry snowmobile use. Also, we encourage utilizing an “all lands” approach to
evaluate user conflict, boundary confusion and other factors related to the adjoining
non-motorized areas on the Lincoln Ranger District. This seems especially relevant
since consistency and simplicity are stated goals of this travel planning process, and
disjointed winter recreation management consistently results in noncompliance.
(146-1)
Please see the included report “Mount Jefferson Snowmobile Monitoring Report
May 2014” as a cautionary tale of what the Helena Ranger District might reasonably
expect if the Nevada Mountain and Electric Peak roadless areas are open to oversnow vehicle use, as proposed in the DEIS.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail

Divide Travel Plan

Comments
The Continental Divide National Scenic Trail – a 3,100 mile route from Mexico to
Canada – was established in 1978, and is one of the some outstanding primitive
recreation opportunities in America. It traverses public lands managed by the Forest
Service, Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service, with overall
direction coming from the 2009 Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
Comprehensive Plan2. Several elements of that plan detail the purpose and
management direction of the CDT bear mention, providing useful context for the
travel management decisions being considered here.
2 2009 Continental Divide National Scenic Trail Comprehensive Plan
http://www.fs.fed.us/cdt/main/cdnst_comprehensive_plan_final_092809.pdf

Response to Comments

The purpose of the CDNST, as stated in the 2009 plan, includes providing a highquality recreational experience for hikers and horseback riders (non-motorized
users) in a relatively unaltered natural landscape. The plan clearly states that “crosscountry skiing, and snowshoeing are compatible with the nature and purposes of the
CDNST” and references a 1997 Forest Service memorandum regarding the
CDNST that “it is the intent of the Forest Service that the CDNST will be for nonmotorized recreation.”
Over-snow vehicle use allowable on the CDNST only if that use is consistent with
the applicable land management plan, and such use “will not substantially interfere
with the nature and purposes of the CDNST.” It is unclear that both of these
standards have been met with respect to the potential environmental and userexperience impacts of over-snow vehicle use for lands both on, and surrounding, the
CDNST. We request that the required analysis of over-snow vehicle impacts be
analyzed in preparing the Final EIS.
At a minimum, recommend that the corrdior of CDNST in Electric Peak Roadless
Area should match year round non-motorized area of adjoining BeaverheadDeerlodge National Forest. (146-2)
Adherence to the 2005 Winter Travel Agreement

Response to Comments

Winter travel planning can be a daunting task – and we again want to commend the
Helena Ranger District for addressing it alongside summer travel planning – but
there are ways to conduct the process such that the result is fair, effective, and
durable. One such approach is collaboration, which requires time, trust and
commitment by all stakeholders.
The Helena Ranger District is fortunate that a group of stakeholders – representing
motorized, non-motorized, conservation and wildlife interests – put in this hard
work, resulting in the Lincoln-Continental Divide Winter Recreation Agreement.
But no Alternative presented reflects all of that agreement, and only Alternative 3
does in part. More troubling is that no analysis or explanation for why is offered.
While the agreement is not binding, the forest has committed to giving it serious
consideration, and is the best blueprint available for what can work for this area. The
agreement deserves consideration, in full, in the Final EIS. (146-3)
Summary Recommendations
We would like to offer the following specific recommendations in addition to the
comments above regarding consistency with the 1986 Forest Plan, Continental
Divide National Scenic Trail Management Direction, and adherence to the 2005
winter travel agreement.
 For the aforementioned reasons, the Divide Travel Plan should fully adopt
recommendations from the 2005 winter recreation agreement. If this does not occur,
provide analysis showing why.
 The small quiet winter area by the MacDonald Pass Cross Country Ski Area
should extend north along the Continental Divide Trail to Priest Pass; and also from
Priest Pass north to Mullan Pass should be classed as a non-motorized recreation
area to protect the high quality quiet winter recreation experiences along the
CDNST.
 The corridor of CDNST in Electric Peak Roadless Area should match the

Forest. (146-4)

(147-1) The Forest Service strives to strike a balance with respect
to resource protection and providing diverse recreation
opportunities.

I will get to the point, just shut it down to motorized use. (147-1) After growing up
on Priest Pass and seeing first hand what it used to be, to what it has become is very
disappointing. Its more like a dump now than a forest. Couches, recliners, TV's, old
vehicles, and even construction materials like dump beds full of shingles and tar
paper. Have even found people taking live trees with heavy equipment to sell for
lumber I would assume. I don't like shutting it down to motorized use as I own dirt
bikes and a quad. But if that means stopping the vandalism, bringing better hunting
back to the area, and especially before a fire gets going up there and destroys homes
and lives...then by all means shut it down, I can walk.

(148-1) Thank you for your comments.

District Ranger DeGeest,
As a year-round forest recreation user and ardent supporter of wild lands, I am
asking that you adopt alternative 3 and protect the CDT corridor from motorized
use.
There is so much of the forest, the state, and the nation's public lands that are open
to motorized use that we need to work to keep the quiet places that remain. Here in
Montana it seems like we have a lot of wild land, but consider how much of that has
been lost in just a couple of generations. We can't let more slip away or in a couple
more generations there will be none left. I've been all over the world and have seen
the remnants that some countries are scrambling to save. They realized too late just
how valuable quiet, wild land is to the community and to the general health and
welfare of the whole population. Here in Montana we still have the opportunity to
do some really good things regarding wild land, wildlife, and ecosystem protection.
Please consider protecting the CDT corridor as much as possible.
Sincerely, Len Kopec

Divide Travel Plan

Appendix F. Response to Comments on Alternative 5 and the Updated Programmatic
Forest Plan Amendment.
In response to comments on the North Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and field reviews, the Helena National
Forest developed an alternative 5. This alternative is designed to increase motorized loop trail opportunities and reduce short spur and redundant
parallel routes. It also improves big game security as well as addresses resource concerns relative to erosion and sedimentation from roads and
stream crossings. Consideration was given to further align the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST) with national standards.
The selection of this alternative would result in the production of a Motor Vehicle Use Map which would identify motorized routes that are open
for use along with corresponding restrictions and designations. In addition, this map would show restrictions regarding dispersed camping. Use
of a motor vehicle other than in accordance with specific designations would be prohibited. The authority for this action comes from 36 CFR 212
and 36 CFR 261.13.
In September of 2014, the Helena National Forest released the draft alternative 5 and an updated proposed wildlife programmatic plan
amendment for public review and an additional 7 day comment period. Approximately 90 comments were received and were considered during
analysis and used to inform this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and the Draft Record of Decision (ROD). These comments will be
considered when making the decision on the Divide Travel Plan.
Comments received during the comment period for alternative 5 ranged from being supportive of the proposal and other comments express
concerns. The following provides a summary of identified issues derived from comments along with associated examples of quotes taken from
comment letters. Also shown below is how the issues were carried forward and addressed in the FEIS. These are organized by the different
components proposed under alternative 5.

Process
Proposal Description: In response to comment on the North Divide Travel Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement the Helena National
Forest Developed an Alternative 5.
Issue Summary: Comments indicated an appreciation for an alternative developed in response to comments received on the DEIS as well as
some questions and concerns on how an alternative could be developed at this phase in the planning process without public meetings.
“Injecting Alternative 5 into the conversation after the comment period and without the benefit of public meetings is dishonest!” (G. Marble).
“I am writing to thank you for the Helena Ranger District's positive responsiveness to comments submitted on the Divide Travel Plan Draft
Environmental Impact Statement. The recently released Alternative 5 represents a major improvement over the previously considered
Appendix F. Response to Comments on Alternative 5 and the Updated Programmatic Forest Plan Amendment. - 800

Environmental Impact Statement

alternatives. The new Alternative 5 goes a long way in addressing my concerns voiced earlier pertaining to: 1) management of the
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail and adjacent wild lands (including the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area), 2) travel management of
the Sweeny Creek area, 3) planning area-wide big game security needs, 4) sedimentation and erosion problems associated with forest roads
and stream crossings, 5) motorized access to dispersed campsites and parking adjacent to designated motor routes, and 6) site-specific
comments pertaining to individual roads and trails.” (Gary Ingman).
Issue Resolution: Forest Service regulations do not limit the amount of public participation opportunities. The Forest Service requested public
comments during project scoping and again during the 45-day comment periods on DEISs (40 CFR 1506.10). Additional comment periods or
extending time past 45-day comment periods can occur when new project information emerges. In the case of the Divide Travel Plan DEIS,
comments received during the 45-day comment period indicated that the original four alternatives left unresolved issues between motorized
and non-motorized forest users as well as the proposed forest plan amendments. Consequently, the Helena National Forest found it
appropriate to develop alternative 5 in order to better strike a balance between forest users and update the proposed forest plan amendment
with potentially more effective elk security measures. In September of 2014, the Forest presented alternative 5 and provided the public with an
opportunity to provide comments. The Forest also held numerous phone conversations and meetings with individuals and groups as requested
to discuss alternative 5.

Handicap and Senior Citizen Motorized Access Needs
Proposal Description: Comments that expressed concerns about access for handicap and senior citizens generally pertain to overall travel
management proposals in alternative 5. There were no travel management proposals made for the purpose of enhancing or decreasing
opportunities for handicap and senior citizens.
Issue Summary: Comments sought additional and in some cases unlimited access for senior citizens and disabled individuals
“Access to HNF is needed for a growing aging population who cannot afford specialized vehicles to access their national forest. This includes
elderly and persons with disabilities.”
Issue Resolution: The purpose of the Divide Travel Plan is to determine a manageable system of designated public motorized access routes and
areas within the Divide area. Determining motorized access for a specific group or population is not within the scope of this planning effort. The
Helena National Forest recognizes the need for access to public lands for people with disabilities and of all ages. The Forest strives in our
proposed alternatives to provide ample recreational opportunities for all while balancing the needs for resource protection. In all alternatives,
motorized opportunities are provided and within these, motorized routes aimed at varying abilities and skill levels are provided.

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA)
Proposal Description: The Divide Travel Plan proposes various travel management decision within four IRAs. The decisions range from
maintaining the exiting travel management status on routes, seasonally restricting routes, and yearlong closures to wheeled motorized use on
routes.
Issue Statement Summary: Comments were received praising the additional wheeled closures in IRA, seeking additional closures, and seeking
fewer closures.
Of particular interest is NFSR MTR501. There were comments requesting that this route remain open beyond the 9/1 date, even yearlong, to
provide a connector between the Little Blackfoot and Spotted Dog and offer trail riding opportunity in this area later in the season. Comments
also suggested the 9/1 closure was a step in the right direction but requested an additional spring snowmobile closure to protect big game
winter range and calving.
“While not perfect, we endorse Alternative 5 for the following reasons... Eliminates most motorized routes in Inventoried Roadless Areas. We
do however request consideration of leaving open as summer motorized MTR -501 in the Limburger Spring area as it dissects an important
roadless area and important elk habitat.” (Backcountry Hunters and Anglers).
“Limburger Springs – this area is much improved through Alternative 5 in that many dead-end roads would be closed. However more could be
done to remove motorized use from calving/fawning areas by retaining the over-snow closure that exists in Alternative 1, and at least
seasonally closing MTR-501 in the spring.” (Gayle Joslin).
“… connectivity between the Black Mountain and Jericho IRA and the Electric Peak IRA is essential for wildlife movement, yet there are few
proposed changes in that area that would improve connectivity by reducing motorized routes. We recommend expanding the OSV area
restriction to include the entire Jericho Mountain IRA – route 1863 should be closed at its junction with route 527 (Minnehaha Creek Road).
Additionally, MTR-501 between Limburger Springs and the Little Blackfoot cuts through the Electric Peak IRA and should be closed to
motorized use yearlong. We encourage the expansion of OSV area restriction of the Electric Peak IRA and Nevada Mountain IRA to include all
the inventoried roadless acreage. Roadless areas are invaluable to wildlife and should be managed at their maximum acreage as roadless and
non-motorized.” (Defenders of Wildlife).
Issue Resolution: Under alternative 5, MTR-501 would be open to wheeled motorized use on a seasonal basis (5/16 to 8/31) and over-snow
motorized vehicles 12/2 to 5/15. Also under alternatives 3 and 4, this route is proposed to be closed year round to motorized use. Therefore,
alternatives 3, 4, and 5 all consider restricting motorized use to varying levels during the spring and will be consider during the decisions for the
travel plan. Only a limited amount of existing wheeled motorized routes were considered to remain open in the IRAs. Seasonal closures for

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

wildlife are considered and balanced with recreation opportunities. The decision for Divide Travel Plan will consider these requests to adjust the
closure seasons on particular routes, weighing recreation and wildlife habitat concerns brought forward in comments.

Seasonal Trail (route) Dates
Proposal Description: All motorized trails with seasonal use open to wheeled motorized vehicles 50” and less in width would be open from 5/16
to 8/31 with the exception of the Lava Mountain connector trail # 4009-A1 which would be open from 5/16 to 10/14. There are approximately
14.5 miles of motorized trails that would have no seasonal restrictions.
Issue Statement Summary: Some comments received expressed concern about wheeled motorized travel routes being seasonally closed
between 9/1 to 5/15 and over-snow routes being closed 12/2 to 5/15. While some comment expressed appreciation for the seasonal restriction
others express concern that access would be limited under this proposal.
“We would support a 9/1 closure date in order to keep these very important routes open for motorized use. This is a reasonable compromise
that should be considered.” (Capital Trail Vehicle Association).
“We applaud recognition of the actual big game hunting season dates of 9/1 - 12/1”. (Helena Hunters & Anglers Association).
“Alternative Plan #5 leaves approximately 2 months in fall without any motor vehicle access beyond 8/31. The only travel left is by mountain
bike or horseback until snowmobile use. August 31st closure on motor vehicles doesn't allow for firewood gathering, hunting, or sightseeing.
Plan is not age friendly.” (Gene Grandy).
“Closure date of August 31st is unreasonable. This is way too early in the year as the public enjoys getting out at the end of summer and in the
fall. The scenery and colors are beautiful and to be enjoyed by all. If a closure date of a trail has to be made, it should be a later time or at
lease keep the same dates of October 15, 2014.” (J. Daugaard).
Issue Resolution: The Helena National Forest Plan requires that we manage for big game security. The primary reason for these closure dates is
to be consistent with Forest Plan standards for big game security, winter range, and calving.
Previous travel management route closures designed to protect big game species during the hunting season covered the time period from
October 15 to December 1 (big game riffle season). Following recommendations by Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks, the Programmatic
Amendment for Elk Security and the security analysis described in the wildlife section of chapter 3, apply an expanded definition of the hunting
season to include both the general rifle season and the earlier archery season – a period extending from September 1 to December 1. In order
to be considered bona fide hunting season closures, routes must now be closed to motorized use throughout this entire period.

Appendix F. Response to Comments on Alternative 5 and the Updated Programmatic Forest Plan Amendment. - 803

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

Primary roads, throughout the Divide landscape are open yearlong with no seasonal restrictions under all alternatives. Many of the motorized
trails would close 9/1 however they would still be accessible for non-motorized use. Licensed drivers can also operate 50 inch and less in width
street legal vehicles on Forest Service Roads that are open later in the fall. There are also motorized trails open later into the fall, providing
opportunity for late season riding, in Divide and other travel plan areas on the Helena National Forest.

Sweeny Creek Area
Proposal Description: With the exception of the Priest Pass Road, all routes in the Sweeny Creek area would be closed yearlong to motorized use
including over-snow vehicles.
Issue Statement Summary: Comments received primarily supported closing Sweeny Creek to motorized use however there were some that
requested it remain open and additional motorized opportunities sought in the Divide area. There were requests for additional 50” and less in
width trails, loop, connector routes, family and youth opportunities as well as a few single track requests. Requests were also received for
motorized routes accessing historic and cultural sites.
“We are very pleased to see that Alternative 5 proposes to consolidate the lands on both sides of MacDonald Pass into a large year-round
non-motorized block. This would protect a large area for non-motorized winter recreation and create a quiet, non-motorized corridor for the
Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. As many of our members enjoy skiing and snowshoeing on the CDNST we support designating this
section of the trail and the surrounding area as non-motorized. In addition, designating the Sweeny Creek area as non- motorized in the
winter provides opportunities for skiers to venture beyond the MacDonald Pass Cross-Country Ski Area to discover untracked snow in a quiet
landscape.” (Winter Wildland Alliance).
“Many important routes and connectors that provide a meaningful OHV experience have been left out of Alternative 5. This alternative would
not provide a satisfying experience for the public as there is not enough miles, loops and destinations. The motorized closures are excessive.
The public will not follow the travel plan if it does not reasonably meet their needs. Routes that need to be added to produce a reasonable
alternative include… All existing motorized sections of the CDNST..” (Capital Trail Vehicle Association).
“Another concern of mine is the loss of Sweeny Creek. That was one of my favorite places to ride!” (Ashton Loomis).
“I am disappointed on the decision to completely close the Sweeny Cr. Recreation area. Total closure is not a compromise.” (Jody Loomis).
“The Sweeny Creek area is important big-game winter range. Designating this area as non-motorized year-round would result in a
substantial block of un-fragmented habitat for big game and other wildlife species. This area would provide the largest block of secure
habitat on public land east of the Continental Divide and north of Highway 12 within the project area.” (MT Fish Wildlife & Parks).

Divide Travel Plan

“Sweeny Creek has been abused for years by unmanaged recreation and illegal motorized abuse. This is critical wildlife habitat and needs to
be protected.” (Diane Tipton).
Issue Resolution: The existing condition of the Divide landscape has approximately 20 miles of 50” or less in width motorized trail. Alternative 5
is proposes up to 60 miles of motorized trail 50” or less in width. Opportunities were sought in alternative 5 to open connecting routes and
increase loop opportunities. Many of these motorized trails are suitable for youth and family riding and do not require riders to be licensed.
Many of the roads and motorized trails in the Divide area access historic mining sites and other culturally significant areas. The trails south of
Elliston are particularly suitable for a scenic ride that travels past numerous historic mine sites. Future interpretation along these trails may be
developed if there is interest from the public to do so.
Sweeny Creek is proposed to be closed to motorized use in alternative 5 because of its high value as wildlife habitat and limited opportunity for
motorized use.

Over-snow motorized use in the Nevada Mountain Area and east slope of Continental Divide adjacent to.
Proposal Description: Expand Divide planning area to include the area on the east slope of the Continental Divide adjacent to the Nevada
Mountain Inventoried Roadless. Restrict over-snow use in the Nevada Mountain area as it is shown in alternative 3.
Issue Statement Summary: Comments received on alternative 5 expressed an interest in expanding the Divide planning area to include the area
on the east slope of the Continental Divide adjacent to the Nevada Mountain Inventoried Roadless. Additional comments also requested to
restrict over-snow motorized travel in the Nevada Mountain area.
“Although the east side of the Nevada Mountain Roadless Area (upper Little Prickly Pear Creek) is not included in this decision, it was
originally part of the Divide landscape before it was split off for the Soundwood decision, so the east face of Nevada Mountain Roadless Area
should eventually receive winter travel management that would be consistent with the adjoining Blackfoot winter travel plan to the west,
and Alternative 5 of the Divide travel plan.” (Helena Hunters and Anglers Association & Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
“Also important to us is keeping the Nevada Mountain wild area, Little Blackfoot headwaters and Continental Divide National Scenic Trail
motor-free. We use these areas for quite recreation--hiking, XC skiing and wildlife viewing.” (Wendy & Gregg Wheeler).
Issue Resolution: Travel management for this area was included in the Soundwood decision which did not include winter travel management
decisions for over-snow motorized travel. Including a winter travel management decision for this area would be out of the scope of the
decisions to be made under the Divide Travel Plan because the area is outside the Divide Travel Plan project area boundary.
The Divide Travel Plan area provides a valuable over-snow motorized opportunity for the Helena community. The snow conditions are generally
very good and it has relatively easy access for all levels of rider. Alternative 5 closes nearly all of the Inventoried Roadless in this area to over-

Divide Travel Plan

snow use. It does leave a small portion open that is in a heavy use and popular area to snowmobilers. Alternative 5 also removed the closure on
the ½ sections running along the west side of the Divide planning area, outside the roadless. Users enter the Divide area from the west, along
private property and enforcing these ½ section closures would be difficult. The perimeter delineation of the over snow closure in alternative 5
will be identifiable on the MVUMs.
Additional over-snow closures were put in place in alternative 5 along the Continental Divide in Sweeny Creek, Mac Pass, Priest Pass, Jericho and
Bison Mountain for wildlife and quiet recreation considerations.

Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDNST)
Proposal Description: NFSR #136-D1 would be closed to wheeled motorized vehicles yearlong. Approximately, one mile of the CDNST trail
located north of NFSR #136, and just south and east of Meyers Hill, would be rerouted and designated as a non-motorized section of the CDNST.
Refer to the CDNST map for information on motorized and non-motorized segments of the CDNST.
Issue Statement Summary: Primarily, comments supported moving the CDNST in the Divide area closer to the National Standard by reducing
motorized use. There were some requests to not restrict motorized use on the CDNST. There was a request to close the microwave tower FSR
1802 yearlong.
“Many important routes and connectors that provide a meaningful OHV experience have been left out of Alternative 5. This alternative would
not provide a satisfying experience for the public as there is not enough miles, loops and destinations. The motorized closures are excessive.
The public will not follow the travel plan if it does not reasonably meet their needs. Routes that need to be added to produce a reasonable
alternative include… All existing motorized sections of the CDNST..” (Capital Trail Vehicle Association).
“MFWP supports the Helena Ranger District’s proposal to restrict motorized use year round at MacDonald Pass under both Alternatives 3 and
4, closing route 1802 and designating the area as closed to snowmobile use.” (Montana Fish, Wildlife, & Parks).
“Road 1802. Have you considered limiting to authorized users (administrative and facility maintenance) motorized vehicle access north of
MacDonald Pass to the radio facilities? … In general, we are pleased by the direction to manage substantial sections of the CDNST for nonmotorized use. Thank you for inviting our comments.” (Continental Divide Trail Society).
Issue Resolution: Road 1802 provides access to the microwave tower and numerous emergency service communication facilities. The facilities
are frequently maintained and improved with advances in technology. This route also provides the public with opportunities for berry picking,
firewood gathering and a scenic route in the fall.
Alternative 5 restricts motorized use along the CDNST when adjacent motorized routes are available in the vicinity for the purpose of reducing
conflict with non-motorized trail users on the CDNST.

Parking, Access to Dispersed Campsites up to 70’ from a designated route, & Access to Dispersed Campsites further
than 70’ from a designated route
Proposal Description:
Parking would be limited up to 30 feet from the edge of a designated route.
Parking and motor vehicle use associated with dispersed camping would be limited to no more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route
as long as:
1. No new permanent routes are created by this activity
2. No damage to existing vegetation, soil, or water resources i.e., damage to live trees and shrubs, rutting, and eroding of stream banks
or bare soil.
3. Travel off-route does not cross streams
4. Travel off-route does not traverse riparian or wet areas
5. Vehicles travel to and parking associated with dispersed campsites would be limited to no closer than 30 feet of a stream or body of
live water.
Dispersed campsites located more than 70 feet from the edge of a designated route that are identified on the alternative 5 map would remain
open for dispersed camping and parking associated with dispersed camping. The five items identified under the access to dispersed campsites up
to 70’ from a designated route section are applicable for this as well.
Issue Statement Summary: Comments were received both supporting and discouraging a 70 foot limit to off route travel for dispersed camping.
Some comments felt this was a good start but could be hard to enforce and maintain over time. Others felt 70 feet wouldn’t be safe or
enjoyable and more room was needed.
“The previous rule that has allowed driving 300 feet off of roads for camping, has resulted in resource damage (mud bogging, riparian zone
damage, erosion, weed spread, fish and wildlife habitat deterioration) along roads throughout the Helena National Forest. Alternative 5
would be a huge improvement over the existing rule for the Divide Landscape in that it would reduce the area of impact to 30 feet for vehicle
parking, and to 70 feet if a camping trailer is involved.” (Helena Hunters and Anglers Association & Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
“It is assumed that those Established Dispersed campsites that occur more than 70’ from a road will all be individually signed. If any of these
existing dispersed campsites are damaging streams or riparian zones, they should be closed and rehabilitated.” (Gayle Joslin).

“The 70 foot from road restriction for camp sites. Who wants to camp that close to road? As I mentioned earlier, Montana still has freedom
and I don't want to lose what we have left. Going camping means getting away, quiet setting, and no dust, place to set dogs and kids loose.
The 300 foot from road is reasonable and safer and makes more sense.” (J. Daugaard).
“The 70 foot from road restriction for camp sites does not adequately consider that campers do not want to camp “right on the road”.
Campers subjected to this restriction would expose kids and dogs to a significant safety hazard from traffic on the forest roads. We are
extremely concerned about the creation of a public safety issue when we have adequate room in the forest to accommodate a more
reasonable rule. Additionally, camping in the dust and noise would make for a far less rewarding experience… A restriction to 70 feet just
does not make good sense.” (Capital Trail Vehicle Association).
Issue Resolution: Numerous historic dispersed campsites have been identified on the alternative 5 map where camping greater than 70 feet
from a designated route would be authorized. These sites are in addition to the parking authorized up to 70 feet from a designated route for
dispersed camping. There are also several campgrounds available in the Divide area.

Updated Programmatic Amendment
Proposal Description:
This programmatic Forest Plan amendment for the Divide Travel Plan project area is needed to more closely align current science, local
conditions, and other information with the needs of big game, particularly elk, which meet the intent of the Forest Plan. The amendment
considers the impacts of open motorized routes on elk security, establishes blocks of secure habitat, and can be measured regardless of changes
in hiding cover. While the proposed amendment decouples hiding cover from security during the hunting season, several Forest-wide and
Management Area standards remain in place that govern management of hiding cover.
The assumptions built into the existing (1986) Forestwide Standard 4a (hereafter Standard 4a) have not proven useful in gauging or guiding
management activities under the Forest Plan. Actual elk populations and trends as monitored over the last twenty nine years simply do not
correlate with this existing standard or its assumptions. Elk numbers have consistently increased during this time period and the existing
standard needs to be revised to address recent elk management challenges.
Alternative B was designed to address best science and local knowledge. It also expanded consideration to all open motorized routes (whereas
Alternative A technically only applies to roads as originally envisioned in the Forest Plan). Alternative B would replace the existing Forest Plan
Standard 4a.
Under the Forest Plan amendment proposed as part of the Divide Travel Plan—and applicable to future projects in the Divide landscape —the
“security area” approach replaces the “road density/hiding cover index” as the Forest Plan standard for gauging the vulnerability of elk to

Appendix F. Response to Comments on Alternative 5 and the Updated Programmatic Forest Plan Amendment. - 808

Environmental Impact Statement

Divide Travel Plan

hunting. The amendment derives from the “Hillis Paradigm” (1991) and adopts specific guidelines for its application from the U.S. Forest Service
and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Collaborative Recommendations for Big Game Habitat Management on the Custer,
Gallatin, Helena, and Lewis and Clark National Forests (MFWP and USDA Forest Service 2013).
The proposed amendment would establish security and intermittent refuge area thresholds as the numeric standard to replace existing Standard
4a. Security would be defined as “a proportion of an elk herd unit within the administrative boundary of the Helena Ranger District that consists
of an area of at least 1000 acres in size that is at least ½ mile from a motorized route open to the public between 9/1 and 12/1…”. Intermittent
refuge areas would be defined as “those areas at least 250 acres in size and less than 1000 acres in size that are greater than or equal to ½ mile
from a motorized route open to the public between 9/1 and 12/1...”. Temporary reductions would be allowed in security blocks and
intermittent refuge areas providing impacts to elk and elk habitat are mitigated at the project level. The proposed amendment also includes a
cover guideline to ensure cover is considered in project level planning and analysis. A goal is also included to increase security when
opportunities arise.
Issue Summary:
Several public comments received during the additional comment period for the updated programmatic Big Game amendment included the
following (Issue summary statements correlate numerically with the subsequent issue resolution section:
1. There was a concern about allowing temporary reductions in security blocks and intermittent refuge areas without specific mitigation
requirements;
“But we note that “security” as defined is not secure in that all manner of “administrative activity” (which compromises security) would be
allowed with unspecified “mitigation” that “may include” certain actions, but there are actually no specific mitigation requirements.” (Helena
Hunters and Anglers Assoc. / Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
2. The existing 1986 Forest Plan standard for big game security is actually a better standard than the one being proposed and that there
were no alternatives demonstrating consistency with the existing Standard 4a;
“We believe that the existing 1986 Forest Plan Standard for big game security is actually a better STANDARD than the amendment being
proposed because unlike the amendment it is actually measurable – as a standard should be.” (Alliance for the Wild Rockies).
3. There is no scientific basis for the proposed amendment;
No scientific basis for the proposed amendment is provided.” (Helena Hunters and Anglers Assoc. / Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
4. A cover requirement should be part of the proposed amendment standard (not just a guideline);

“The claim that the security direction is a standard is also a NEPA violation, in addition to the lack of any motorized route limitations, or
hiding cover requirements, or that security only has to be provided "over the long term," is further eroded, if that is even possible, by the
claim that security levels identified for each EHU do not actually have to be met as long as there is some "mitigation." Almost anything could
be identified as mitigation (as was noted in the list of possible mitigation), allowing short-term reductions of security. The agency does not
provide any actual information to the public that "mitigation" will ensure that elk security levels as per the amendment definition, will be
maintained. This is just another meaningless loophole that makes this amendment totally bogus.” (Native Ecosystems Council).
5. It appears that the proposed amendment is applicable to the entire Helena Ranger District which includes portions of the Elkhorns and
Big Belts;
“We have been of the understanding that the proposed big game security amendment was applicable only to the Divide Travel Plan. Upon
studying the definition of the amendment more closely, the amendment would apply to the entire Helena Ranger District…” (Helena Hunters
and Anglers).
6. The proposed amendment does not meet the definition of a standard as having features that are measurable and able to indicate
trends;
“Neither the Blackfoot nor Divide big game security amendments actually meet the definition of a standard as having features that are
measurable and able to indicate trends.” (Helena Hunters and Anglers Association / Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
7. The proposed amendment should be addressed under Forest Plan Revision, not the Divide Travel Planning process;
“The big game security amendment should be addressed under Forest Plan Revision, and not held hostage to the Travel Plan process. But
because it has been, in order to realize a reasonable Travel Plan for the Divide area, we have cautiously supported the big game security
amendment for the Divide Travel Plan area only.” (Helena Hunters and Anglers Assoc. / Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
8. There was concern about how the proposed amendment would address cover requirements for other species (grizzly, lynx, marten,
goshawks);
“We are left with more questions than answers about the big game security amendment and fear that it does not meet existing Forest Service
regulations, and worse, it will not meet the needs of big game (other big game as well as elk), and it may in fact complicate management for
other species such as lynx, grizzly bear, and various species of sensitive birds and smaller mammals such as marten and wolverine.” (Helena
Hunters and Anglers Assoc. / Clancy-Unionville Citizens Task Force).
9. There was a concern that the 40% canopy cover definition used to map hiding cover was not based on science.

“The definition of 40% canopy cover as hiding cover is not based on any science. The agency's white paper by Canfield (2011) is not science. It
has not been peer reviewed, or provided to the public for review. As such, it is not appropriate to insert it in this Forest Plan amendment. The
two sources cited for this definition are Lonner and Cada (1982) and Canfield (2011). The former has no data as to how this determination was
made, and is therefore not valid science. The latter is not a Forest Service research paper, nor has it had any public or peer review. It is just the
Forest Service creating their own science, which is a NEPA violation.” (Native Ecosystems Council).
Issue Resolution:
1. The proposed amendment describes mitigation including examples as follows: Mitigation is defined as design elements and/or
constraints applied to project level activities that reduce project impacts on elk or elk security. Mitigation measures may include but are
not limited to one or more of the following: timing restrictions of activities in security blocks, confining activities to one security block at
a time, completing as much of the preparatory work as possible prior to the hunting season, reducing the
size/acres/intensity/magnitude of the activity, allowing activities that benefit elk (particularly in management areas with a wildlife
emphasis), limiting activities to one season, temporarily closing roads open to the public to compensate for the activity, etc. Specific
mitigation measures are not built into the definition in order to allow mitigation measures to be tied to a specific project. The proposed
amendment also discusses the existing Forest Plan standards that will remain in place; these standards do provide specific direction that
would be applied to future projects.
2. The proposed amendment includes a discussion of the challenges associated with the existing Standard 4a (See the Background Section
of the amendment). Several public comments received during scoping and during the comment period for the DEIS included the request
that a travel plan alternative be developed to meet Standard 4a (Big Game Security). An analysis was completed to determine if the
Forest had management discretion to close enough Forest System roads to achieve compliance with Standard 4a in the elk herd units
(EHU) in the Divide Travel Plan project area. That analysis indicated that the Forest did have the jurisdiction to close several miles of
open roads during the hunting season to achieve consistency with Standard 4a in 5 out of 6 herd units. However, for one of those five
herd units – Quartz Creek – travel planning has already been completed in a majority of that herd unit; so there is limited opportunity to
close additional roads during the hunting season. The Greenhorn EHU would remain out of compliance with Standard 4a because the
Forest simply does not have sufficient road closure discretion. Meanwhile, Alternative 5 - modified includes sufficient closures during
the hunting season such that 4 out of the 6 herd units achieve compliance with Standard 4a. The two herd units that remain out of
compliance are Quartz Creek and Greenhorn.
3. Information used for the Forest Plan amendment is based on best science and direct knowledge of species use in the project area (See
Big Game Amendment, Section Alternative Description/Alternative B/Discussion and the wildlife analyses in Chapter 3).

4. The proposed amendment describes why the existing hiding cover/open road density metric may no longer be practicable in its
application (See Comparison of Alternatives, Alternative A, Discussion). The proposed amendment also describes the basis for the cover
guideline: “The cover guidelines, along with remaining hiding cover standards, should ensure that cover is provided as part of future
management activities. The guidelines also provide flexibility to promote forest regeneration to offset cover losses associated with the
mountain pine beetle epidemic. Although a majority of security and intermittent refuge areas currently contain hiding cover, this
condition is expected to change over the next several years as trees killed by the mountain pine beetle fall (Keen 1955, Mitchell and
Preisler 1998, Lewis and Hartley 2006, Page and Jenkins 2007, Klutsch et al. 2009). How these changes affect elk populations and
distribution are uncertain; down trees may impede elk movement (Saab et al. 2014) while overstory mortaility could improve forage
opportunities (Stone 1995). Currently, a study is ongoing in the Elkhorn Mountains on the Forest to address this very topic. These data
could be extrapolated Forestwide in similar forested conditions and used to influence management.”
5. The proposed amendment applies only to “the National Forest System lands within those portions of the following elk herd units that
are within the Helena Ranger District, Helena National Forest administrative boundary – Black Mountain-Brooklyn Bridge, Greenhorn,
Jericho, Little Prickly Pear-Ophir, Quartz Creek, and Spotted Dog-Little Blackfoot”. This does not include the Elkhorns or Big Belts.
6. The proposed amendment includes numeric values for the percent of security and intermittent refuge areas within each elk herd unit (as
described above in #5). It also discusses that the existing Forest Plan monitoring components would still be applicable for the proposed
amendment (See the Monitoring section).
7. The HNF has recently initiated Forest Plan Revision and anticipates the process taking at least up to four years. Because we are required
to finalize our travel planning efforts, we are proposing to amend Standard 4(a) now which, upon subsequent revision, could remain in
place.
8. The proposed amendment identifies the remaining Forest Plan standards that govern cover management including existing Big Game
standards and the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (See. Compatibility of Forest Plan Amendment Alternative B-Preferred
Alternative with Existing Wildlife Standards).
9. The proposed amended includes a section that describes the hiding cover methodology used for the amendment (and the FEIS). See the
Hiding Cover Methodology section.
