Abstract

The Shasta-Trinity National Forest proposes to reduce hazards along open roads on National
Forest System lands in Trinity and Humboldt Counties that burned in 2015. The Proposed Action
Alternative is the preferred alternative, and proposes to treat by removing only dead vegetation
within a variable width buffer (maximum width of 300 feet with a minimum of 25 feet on either
side of the road) over approximately 8,000 acres. In addition to the No Action alternative there
were four action alternatives to the Proposed Action analyzed in detail. All alternatives, except the
No Action Alternative, mitigate hazards along all 233 miles of open roads in the 2015 fire
footprints in order to meet the Purpose and Need. The alternatives analyzed a range of issues
raised during scoping, including: the creation of strategic fuelbreaks; treating live trees with a
high probability of mortality; treating the entire area of hazard tree risk; treating on the downhill
side to increase fuel reduction treatment effectiveness; not reducing fuels in important northern
spotted owl habitat; and not reducing fuels in sensitive areas (defined for this project as Riparian
Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas, At-Risk Watersheds and areas with suitable northern
spotted owl habitat).
The Forest Service accepted comments during the comment period on the draft environmental
impact statement. This enabled the Forest Service to analyze and respond to the comments at one
time and to use information acquired in the preparation of this final environmental impact
statement, thus avoiding undue delay in the decision-making process. Reviewers have an
obligation to structure their participation in the National Environmental Policy Act process so that
it is meaningful and alerts the agency to the reviewers’ position and contentions. Vermont Yankee

have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final
environmental impact statement. City of Angoon v. Hodel, 803 F.2d 1016 (9th Circuit, l986) and
Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Comments on the
draft environmental impact statement should be specific and should address the adequacy of the
statement and the merits of the alternatives discussed (40 CFR 1503.3).
The opportunity to Comment ended (May 1, 2017) 45 days following publication of the notice of
availability (NOA) in the Federal Register (March 17, 2017).

Summary

The Shasta-Trinity National Forest proposes to reduce hazards along open roads on National
Forest System lands in Trinity County that burned in 2015. The Proposed Action is the preferred
alternative, and proposes to treat only dead vegetation within a variable width buffer (maximum
width of 300 feet with a minimum of 25 feet on either side of the road) along 233 miles of open

road (approximately 8,000 acres of treatment). Treatment of vegetation would include falling
hazard trees, utilizing the timber (salvage logging), reducing the fuel loading, planting trees, and
maintaining the fuels treatments. These actions are needed to:


Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten
public safety along open National Forest System, County and State roads.



Sustain and establish forest cover; and,



Capture economic value and support the economies of local communities by providing
forest products.

The Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Six Rivers National Forest and adjacent State and private
lands experienced wildfire on more than 221,000 acres as a result of lightning in 2015. The
majority of acres affected are the result of a July 30, 2015 lightning event. Much of the fire
burned through National Forest System lands (approximately 176,000 acres), but a number of
private landowners were also affected. Approximately 144,000 acres were burned on ShastaTrinity National Forest lands.
The areas on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest affected by the 2015 wildfires include vegetation
along 391 miles of road (359 miles of National Forest System roads, 32 miles administered by
state and county). Of these 391 miles, 248 miles are open to the public (including Forest Service
system roads and county and state roads). Of these 248 miles of open roads, 233 miles of Forest
Service system, county and state roads travel through Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands.
Forested lands burned in the fires contain a substantial number of dead and dying trees within
reach of these roads. Structural integrity of fire-killed trees has been compromised and it is
expected many of them will fall during a wind or storm event. Especially considering the steep
topography, many of these trees are likely to fall into open roads, creating a risk to public safety.
A range of issues were raised during public scoping. These issues led the agency to develop
alternatives to the proposed action (also referred to as Alternative 1) including:



iv



Alternative 2: This alternative would treat a consistent buffer 150 feet on each side of the
road and would create fuelbreaks of up to 1200’ wide on 16 miles of those roads to create
more effective fuels reduction treatments. Alternative 2 would remove trees and
vegetation with a 60% chance of mortality as well as the completely dead trees that
would be cut in the proposed action.



Alternative 3: This alternative would treat a wider buffer (up to 300’ on each side of the
road). Alternative 3 would also remove dying trees and vegetation (with a 60% chance of
mortality or more) to address all trees with the potential to pose a hazard to roads.



Alternative 4: This alternative would reduce impacts to the northern spotted owl (NSO)
by eliminating most treatments within suitable habitat.



Alternative 5: This alternative would minimize impacts to sensitive resources by
eliminating most treatments within suitable NSO habitat, riparian reserves, at-risk
watersheds, and Inventoried Roadless Areas.



Alternative 6: This is the-no action alternative. Under this alternative it is assumed that no
areas within the Shasta Trinity National Forest that were affected by the 2015 wildfires
would be treated as part of this project.

Alternative 7a: An alternative that would treat only along high use roads (Operational
Maintenance Level 3 and above) was considered but eliminated from detailed study.
Alternative 7b: An alternative that would only treat trees that overhang high use roads
(Operational Maintenance Level 3 and above) was considered but eliminated from detailed
study.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project

Alternative 8: An alternative that the Trinity County Collaborative group proposed that would
be similar to the proposed action but would include a bulldozer line along the treatment
buffer and would rip soils to decrease hydrophobicity in fire damaged soils was considered
but eliminated from detailed study.
 Alternative 9: An alternative that would salvage and replant on a larger landscape outside of
the road buffer was considered but eliminated from detailed study.
 Alternative 10: An alternative that would treat a buffer along Wildland Urban Interface
boundaries and along private land boundaries was considered by eliminated from detailed
study.
All of the action alternatives considered in detail (Alternatives 1-5) conduct treatments along all
233 miles of open road. The alternatives differ in the type and intensity of the treatments along
those roads.


Under all of the action alternatives, hazard trees would be felled along all 233 miles of road.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would also fell dying trees (trees with a 60% or greater chance of mortality)
within the treatment buffer, thereby reducing the future risk of falling trees once dying trees
become imminent hazards. Alternative 3, which would fell trees within 300’ of either side of the
road, would most completely address the hazard posed by falling trees.
Fuels treatments would vary depending on the alternative and the location. Under Alternatives 1,
2, and 3, treatments along up to 206 miles of road would reduce flame lengths and fireline
intensity to a level that would allow a future wildfire to be attacked by persons using hand tools.
The remaining 27 miles of road have been designated as high value wildlife conservation areas
(HVWCAs) because of their value as habitat for the NSO. Within HVWCAs, the reduced fuels
treatment area and treatment options available would lead to greater flame lengths and fire
intensity in the event of a future wildfire. Within HVWCAs, future wildfires could still be
attacked effectively but would require the use of heavy equipment such as dozers, engines, and
aircraft.
Alternatives 2 and 3 would involve more effective fuels treatments than Alternative 1 for two
reasons. Under alternatives 2 and 3, dying (as well as dead) vegetation would be cut, further
reducing the fuel load. Second, the variable-width buffer in Alternative 1 (as well as Alternatives
4 & 5) would likely be less than 100 feet wide below the road in some locations; fire behavior in
those locations would then exceed initial attack capabilities below the road. This second situation
would likely not arise under Alternative 2 (which treats a consistent 150 feet buffer below the
road) or Alternative 3 (which treats up to 300’ feet depending on the fuel reduction need).
Alternative 2 also prescribes the creation of fuelbreaks which would reduce the risk of crown fire
(fire moving from the ground into the forest canopy) along 16 miles of roads.
Alternatives 4 and 5 would be as effective as Alternative 1 in the areas where fuel reduction
treatments occur, but fuels reduction treatments would occur in fewer areas under Alternatives 4
and 5. Under Alternative 1, treatments along up to 206 miles of road would result in flame lengths
and fireline intensity that would allow a future wildfire to be attacked by persons using hand
tools. Under alternative 4, a maximum of 175 miles would be treated to this level and under
Alternative 5, a maximum of 122 miles would be treated to this level.
Tree planting would occur as part of all action alternatives. Under Alternatives 1, 4, and 5 trees
would be planted to an 18-30 foot spacing. Under Alternatives 2 and 3, trees would be planted to
a 15-30 foot spacing. By using a slightly denser spacing in Alternatives 2 and 3, trees will have an
opportunity to shade out competition as they grow, thereby improving the likelihood of reaching
mature forest conditions.
The economic value of felled trees would be captured and returned to local communities under
Alternatives 1-4 through the use of salvage logging and other timber utilization activities.

Commercial timber sales (salvage logging) is proposed on 4,100 acres under the Proposed Action,
5,300 acres under Alternative 2, 7,700 acres under Alternative 3, and 780 acres under Alternative
4. Assuming that the trees would be harvested in 2017, all of the logging would occur at a net
cost to the government, ranging from a cost of $130,000 under Alternative 4 to a cost of $950,000
under alternative 3 (Alternative 1 would cost $480,000 and Alternative 2 would cost $640,000).
All of the action alternatives would create economic value through employment. Employment
would range from a low of 212 person-years of direct and indirect employment under Alternative
5 to a high of 1,019 person-years under Alternative 3 (Alternatives 1 and 4 would each create
about 300 person-years and alternative 2 would create about 400 person-years).
Two analysis-driving issues were identified during the public scoping process: sediment delivery
to streams and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Total sediment delivery to streams is a function
of both background erosion rates on the burned slopes and erosion caused by project activities.
Looking just at project activities, sediment delivery to streams is estimated to be about 4,000 tons
under Alternatives 1 and 2, or about 0.003 tons per acre of the project area. Project activities
would deliver about 6,000 tons (0.005 tons/ac) under Alternative 3 while activities would deliver
about 2,000 tons (0.001 tons/ac) and 400 tons (0.0003 tons/ac) under Alternatives 4 and 5,
respectively. For comparison, the background rate of sedimentation averaged about 1.6 tons per
acre per year over the period of 1944 to 1990. Additionally, the geology analysis found that none
of the action alternatives are expected to cause new landslides or reactivate existing ones. Finally,
the soils analysis shows that, in areas where the 2015 fires burned with moderate to high intensity,
salvage logging and fuels treatments such as mastication can reduce background erosion rates
(and sediment delivery to streams) by increasing soil cover.
CO2 emissions were also identified as an issue for analysis. The great majority of CO2 emissions
come from prescribed fire. For example, the estimated CO2 emissions from mastication of fuels is
100 times smaller than the emissions from prescribed fire. Under Alternative 1, total CO2
emissions were calculated to be 190,000 metric tons. Under Alternative 2, these same emissions
would be 220,000 tons, under Alternative 3 they would be 360,000 tons, under Alternative 4 they
would be 130,000 tons, and under Alternative 5 they would be 90,000 tons. The project analysis
also calculates tons of CO2-equivalent emissions.
Regarding effects to wildlife, these would be greatest under Alternative 3, which has the widest
treatment buffer (600 feet total). Alternative 2 would have less effect. Although fuelbreaks are
proposed in this alternative, the roadside treatment buffer is only half as wide as Alternative 3
(300 feet total). Alternative 1 would have less effect because it has the same treatment buffer (300
feet) but does not include fuelbreaks. It also limits treatment to dead vegetation. Alternative 4
would have less effect because it would affect fewer acres. Alternative 5 would affect the fewest
acres, and would have the least effect on wildlife of any of the action alternatives. Specific to the
NSO, effects will be negative in the short term but will not downgrade nesting/roosting or
foraging habitat. Some post-fire foraging habitat may be downgraded. These effects will be
greatest with the implementation of Alternative 3, followed by Alternatives 2, 1, 4, and 5 in that
order.
For all alternatives, including the proposed action, there will be no effect to the Multi-habitat or
Cliffs, Caves, Talus, and Rock Outcrops management indicator assemblages. Proposed activities
will affect the Openings and Early Seral, Late Seral, Snag and Down Log, Riparian, Hardwood,
and Chaparral management indicator assemblages. The potential effects will be qualitative, not
quantitative. There will be no acreage changes to any habitat assemblages or conversion from one
assemblage into another assemblage as a result of activities proposed under any alternative.
Proposed activities will have no meaningful influence on Forest-level trends for any management
indicator assemblage habitat or species.
vi

Final Environmental Impact Statement

For all alternatives, including the proposed action, proposed treatments would maintain a
diversity of functional habitats for migratory birds over the short and long-term, and contribute to
long-term sustainability and resilience of migratory bird habitats. Proposed activities will have no
meaningful influence on population trends of any species of migratory bird.
Alternatives 1-4 would result in treatments within Inventoried Roadless Area (IRA) boundaries
and the IRAs would be indirectly impacted by treatments proposed in Alternative 5. Many of the
areas proposed for treatment are the outer edges of buffers originating from roads outside, but
adjacent to the IRAs. However, there are some roads proposed for treatment within the IRA
boundaries as well. Treatments have the potential to impact the Bell Quinby, Chanchelulla, Cow
Creek, Little French Creek, Pattison and Salt Gulch IRAs. The 2001 roadless rule identifies nine
characteristics that are common to most inventoried roadless areas. These serve as the criteria by
which each alternative is evaluated. With the treatments focused on existing road corridors, it is
anticipated that impacts to the nine roadless characteristics will be minimal and will not affect the
ability for that area to continue to function as and meet the intent of an inventoried roadless area.
The analysis above is discussed in greater detail within the following sections of Chapter 3 of this
document: fire and fuels, vegetation, wildlife, hydrology, geology, soils, air quality, economics,
and Inventoried Roadless Areas. Additional analysis of the environmental impacts of the
proposed action and alternatives can be found in the botany, fish, archaeology/heritage, and wild
& scenic rivers sections of Chapter 3. In general, the greatest impacts to resources would occur
with the implementation of Alternative 3, followed by Alternatives 2, 1, 4, and 5, in that order.
Based upon the effects of the alternatives, the responsible official has reviewed the proposed
action, the alternatives, and their environmental consequences, and has decided to implement the
proposed action as described.

Background ________________________________
The Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Six Rivers National Forest and adjacent State and private
lands experienced wildfire on over 221,000 acres as a result of lighting in 2015. The majority of acres
affected are the result of a July 30, 2015 lightning event. Much of the fire areas burned through
National Forest System lands (approximately 176,000 acres), but a number of private landowners
were also affected. Approximately 144,000 acres were burned on Shasta-Trinity National Forest
lands. Wildfires affected most land allocations including designated Wilderness, Adaptive
Management Areas, and Late-Successional Reserve. Inventoried Roadless Areas are also affected.
Five fire complexes and one separate fire burned on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Figure 1-1):

1



The Fork Complex near the communities of Hayfork, Post Mountain, and Wildwood, and
included the Barker, Peak, Rail, Shiell, Blue, and Big Foot fires;



The South Complex north and east of the community of Hyampom, and included the Castle,
York and Pattison fires;



The Mad River Complex near the communities of Mad River, Ruth, and Forest Glen, and
included the Pickett, Lassic, and Gobbler fires;



The Route Complex near the communities of Mad River and Hyampom, and included the
Johnson, Blake and Pelletreau fires;

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage



The River Complex near the Hoopa Reservation, the communities of Burnt Ranch and
Denny, and within the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area; and



The Saddle Fire northwest of the town of Hyampom.

All fires burned in a mosaic of intensities; acres burned have been categorized into high, moderate
and low severity based on RAVG data1. The great majority of the areas that burned at moderate and
high severity had conifer forest cover prior to the fires (other acres were brush, grasslands or oak
woodlands). The acres of conifer and mixed conifer that burned at high severity generally have no
live trees remaining, and the areas that burned at moderate severity also have a high likelihood of
deforestation or large pockets of mortality due to fire-injury (Table 1-1). Many trees showing signs of
live branches or tops immediately following the fire will be lost due to cambium death or secondary
mortality from insects compounded by years of drought.

Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) products provide information that can assist post-fire
vegetation management planning, and are generated by a change detection process using two Landsat Thematic Mapper
(TM) satellite images captured before and after a wildfire. The algorithm uses the Relative Differenced Normalized Burn
Ratio (RdNBR), which is sensitive to vegetation mortality resulting from the wildfire event.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The areas affected by the 2015 wildfires include vegetation along 391 miles of road (359 miles of
National Forest System roads, 32 miles administered by state and county).2 Of these 391 miles, 248
miles are open to the public (including Forest Service system roads and county and state roads). Of
these 248 miles of open roads, 233 miles of Forest Service system, county and state roads travel
through Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. The vegetation along these roads experienced wildfire
at varying degrees of intensity. Forested lands experiencing moderate and high intensity fire has
resulted in a substantial number of dead and dying trees within reach of these roads. Structural
integrity of fire-killed trees has been compromised and it is expected many of them will fall during a
wind or storm event. Especially considering the steep topography, many of these trees are likely to
fall into open roads, resulting in a risk to public safety.
Current conditions within the burned area differ from the desired condition as identified in the ShastaTrinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan; USDA Forest Service,
1995). Trees that were killed by the fire pose a hazard to the public and forest workers visiting,
traveling, and working in these areas. As these snags (standing dead trees) age, they become less
stable and increase the risk to all forest users. Once these snags are on the ground, combined with the
dead brush, fire behavior is likely to increase. Because of the increased fire behavior and the risk
posed by hazard trees, suppression strategies would be limited.
In addition, many areas that burned at moderate to high severity have lost the existing forest cover.
When mature trees are killed due to fire and/or secondary mortality as a result of the fire, the forest
stand loses the seed source needed to naturally regenerate back to conifer. Even if there is a conifer
seed source in an area, spatial arrangement is highly clustered (Crotteau et. al. 2013) and woody
shrubs are very likely to dominate the deforested site for a very long time (i.e., over 100 years).
Dominance of woody shrubs reduces the potential for forests to grow (McDonald and Abbott 1997).
This adversely impacts a stand’s resistance to fire, rates of succession, carbon sequestration, growth
of wood fiber, wildlife habitat, and other ecological and social values associated with mature forests.

Purpose and Need for Action __________________
Within areas experiencing large scale disturbance on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest in 2015 due to
wildfire, the purpose of this project is to:
1. Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten
public safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads.
2. Sustain and establish forest cover; and,
3. Capture economic value and support the economies of local communities by providing
forest products.
Based on the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Shasta-Trinity National Forests (1995)
and post fire assessment, we have identified a need to:





2 These

Provide for public safety and protection of structures by managing natural and activity fuel
loading, distribution and arrangement within Wildland Urban Interface for low flame lengths
and rate of spread (Forest Plan 4-18);
Remove danger/hazard trees (FSH 7709.59 Section 41.7; USDA Forest Service, 1995a;
Forest Plan 4-26);
Reduce surplus activity fuels that remain after meeting wildlife, riparian, soil and other
environmental needs (Forest Plan 4-17);

road mileage numbers refer to National Forest System roads; this does not include unauthorized routes that may be
used by the public.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Manage the fuel loading distribution and arrangement of natural and activity fuels adjacent to
roads for low flame lengths and low rate of spread;
Create conditions that will support the restoration of fire to its natural role in the ecosystem
(Forest Plan 4-4).
Quickly recover the monetary value of wood through salvage and sale, where feasible and
appropriate, to provide economic stimulus to local communities (Forest Plan 4-5).
Implement reforestation activities following wildfire (Forest Plan 4-149, 4-153, 4-157, and 4161).

Proposed Action ____________________________
The action proposed by the Forest Service to meet the purpose and need includes: hazard tree
abatement (dropping of dead trees), fuel loading reduction, utilization of logs (e.g. through a
commercial salvage sale), and tree planting in a 300-foot buffer along 233 miles of roads open to the
public within the areas that burned in the 2015 wildfires (see Appendix A for a roads list). Width of
the buffer on either side of the road could vary but would not exceed 300 feet; e.g. if conditions lend
to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and
the downhill side would be treated 25 feet from the road. The minimum treatment area along either
side of the road will be 25 feet. The maximum area of treatment is approximately 8,000 acres.
Utilization of logs (e.g. through a commercial salvage sale) would occur wherever possible. The
proposed action is described in more detail in Chapter 2 under Alternative 1 - The Proposed Action
(Preferred Alternative), Page 15

Decision Framework _________________________
Given the purpose and need, the deciding official will review the proposed action, the other
alternatives, and their environmental consequences, in order to determine whether to implement the
proposed action as described, select a different alternative, or take no action at this time.

Management Direction _______________________
Management direction includes Forest Plan direction as well as other laws and regulations that apply
to this project, including the Endangered Species Act and the 2001 Roadless Rule. Forest Plan
direction includes designated land allocations. The project area only occurs on National Forest
System lands within the fire perimeters that are within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest).
Table 1-2 describes land allocations and other designations in the project area and Proposed Action
treatments.

Forest Plan Direction
The Proposed Action and alternatives are guided by the Forest Plan. The Forest Plan provides
programmatic management direction for site-specific projects. Goals and Standards & Guidelines
apply to all land allocations and were considered when developing this project. Goals and Standards
& Guidelines that apply include:

Goals

Management of the Forests’ transportation system to facilitate resource management activities,
protect wildlife, meet water quality objectives and provide recreational access (page 4-4).
Implement practices designed to maintain or improve the health and vigor of timber stands, consistent
with the ecosystem needs of other resources (page 4-5).

Standard and Guidelines

Retain open roads on the Forest Service transportation system that will be needed for future activities
such as forest health projects, timber management, fire protection, recreation use and management,
and wildlife management (page 4-17).
Perform road maintenance activities to meet a variety of management objectives…Schedule road
maintenance activities according to the following priorities: (1) to provide for user safety; (2) to meet
contractual and legal obligations; (3) to protect natural resources; and (4) to provide an efficient
transportation system (page 4-16 and 4-17).
Activity fuels3 that remain after meeting wildlife, riparian, soil, and other environmental needs will be
considered surplus and a potential fire hazard (page 4-17).
Natural fuels4 will be treated in the following order of priority: (1) public safety; (2) high investment
situations (structural improvements, powerlines, plantations, etc.); (3) known high fire occurrence
areas; and (4) coordinated resource benefits… (Page 4-18).
Provide for diversity of tree species indigenous to an area, in the course of conducting reforestation
activities, by one or more of the following:
1) plant an appropriate mix of tree species in areas to be artificially regenerated,
2) encourage the regeneration of shade tolerant and intolerant tree species in areas to be naturally
regenerated, and
3) leave manageable, salvable, and suitable residual advanced reproduction in areas planned for
regeneration cutting. (Forest Plan 4-27)

Land Allocations

Land allocations in which treatments are proposed include:






Late Successional Reserves,
Matrix,
Riparian Reserve,
Adaptive Management Area, and
Administratively Withdrawn.

Late Successional Reserve (LSR)

Late Successional Reserves are to be managed to protect and enhance conditions of late-successional
and old-growth forest ecosystems, which serve as habitat for late-successional and old-growth related
species including the northern spotted owl. These reserves are designed to maintain functional,
interacting, late-successional, and old-growth forest ecosystem (Forest Plan 4-37).
The Corral, South Fork, and Chanchelulla LSRs were impacted by the 2015 wildfires. General
management direction for LSR lands is found on pages 4-37 through 4-44 of the Forest Plan.
Supplemental direction may be found in the Shasta-Trinity’s Forest-Wide Late-successional Reserve
Assessment (USDA Forest Service 1999; LSRA).
Forest-Wide LSRA
As directed by the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision Standards & Guidelines (page C-11),
the Shasta-Trinity National Forest prepared a Forest-wide LSRA in 1999. The LSRA’s Chapter 4
includes Activity Design Criterion #7 Fuel Reduction (primarily dead and down) for which the
objective is to remove dead and dying trees in order to protect the remaining existing and developing
late-successional habitat and to facilitate the development of reforested areas toward late-successional
conditions following a stand-replacing event. This criterion applies to areas greater than 10-acres that
have received a stand-replacing event (such as wildfire) resulting in a canopy closure of less than
40%, and includes the following treatment standards:
b. All standing live trees should be retained, including those injured (e.g., scorched) but likely to
survive;
c. Following stand-replacing disturbance, management should focus on retaining snags that are
likely to persist until late-successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again
producing large snags. The biomass left in snags can be credited toward the amount of coarse
woody debris biomass needed to achieve management objectives; and
d. Removal of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and
trails, and in or adjacent to campgrounds. Where materials must be removed from the site, as
in a campground or on a road, a salvage sale is appropriate. In other areas, such as along
roads, leaving material on site may be considered.

Matrix

The purpose of this prescription is to provide for an area where there is moderate evidence of the
sights and sounds of humans, and to obtain an optimum timber yield of wood fiber products from
productive forest lands within the context of ecosystem management. This prescription emphasizes
recreational opportunities associated with developed road systems and dispersed and developed camp
sites. Fish and wildlife management which supports the recreational use of wildlife species (hunting,
fishing and viewing) is also emphasized. Timber stands will be managed to obtain optimum growth
and yields using cultural practices which control competing vegetation, obtain stocking control and
minimize mortality. Vegetation manipulation will provide habitat for those wildlife species primarily
dependent on early and mid-seral stages (Forest Plan 4-65 and 4-67).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Adaptive Management Areas

The overall objective for AMA is to learn how to manage forests on an ecosystem basis in terms of
both technical and social challenges, and in a manner consistent with applicable laws. The AMAs are
intended to contribute substantially to the achievement of objectives for these Standards & Guidelines
as they appear to other allocations. This includes provision of well-distributed late successional
habitat outside of the reserves, retention of key structural elements of late-successional forests on
lands subjected to regeneration harvest and restoration and protection of riparian zones as well as
provision of a stable timber supply (Forest Plan 4-69).

Riparian Reserves

Riparian Reserves are designated to maintain and restore the distribution, diversity and complexity of
watershed and landscape-scale features to ensure protection of the aquatic systems to which species,
populations and communities are uniquely adapted. Prescriptions within Riparian Reserves are also to
be consistent with the other eight Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives for riparian health
maintenance and enhancement (Forest Plan 4-58).
The Riparian Reserve designation overlays the other land allocations including LSR and Matrix, and
generally are designated within 300 feet of both sides of the high water levels on perennial fishbearing streams or 150 feet of both sides of high levels for perennial non-fish bearing streams and 100
feet for intermittent/ephemeral streams that display annual scour. Direction for management of
Riparian Reserves is found in the Forest Plan (pages 4-53 through 4-60) and the Northwest Forest
Plan Record of Decision (pages C-30 through C-38). Management activities may occur in Riparian
Reserves when they are in support of or do not adversely affect maintenance of riparian-dependent
resources (i.e. fish, wildlife and water).

Administratively Withdrawn – Unroaded non-motorized recreation

The purpose of this prescription is to provide for semi-primitive non-motorized recreation
opportunities in unroaded areas outside existing Wildernesses while maintaining predominantly
natural-appearing areas with only subtle modifications. Also emphasized in this prescription is
retention of old-growth vegetation and management of wildlife species requiring late seral stage
conditions. This prescription also applies to designated Wild segments of Wild and Scenic Rivers
outside of Wildernesses (Forest Plan 4-45).

Administratively Withdrawn – Limited Roaded Motorized Recreation

The purpose of this prescription is to provide for semi-primitive motorized recreation opportunities,
while maintaining predominantly natural-appearing areas with some modifications. Recreational and
visual resources are important values; semi-primitive activities are emphasized. Managing for oldgrowth vegetation and wildlife species requiring late seral stages is also an important consideration
(Forest Plan 4-46). This prescription also applies to designated Scenic segments of Wild and Scenic
River.

Inventoried Roadless Areas
Inventoried roadless areas were designated in the 2001 Roadless Rule (66 Fed. Reg. 3272-3273 (Jan
12, 2001)). This designation is meant to provide for semi-primitive non-motorized recreation
opportunities in unroaded areas on National Forest lands outside existing Wildernesses, while
maintaining predominantly natural-appearing areas with only subtle modifications. Special
recreational and visual values, fisheries and riparian resources are emphasized.
Under the 2001 Roadless Rule, timber may not be cut, sold, or removed in inventoried roadless areas
of the National Forest System unless the Responsible Official determines that one of the following
circumstances exists (the cutting, sale, or removal of timber in these areas is expected to be
infrequent):
8

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

1. The cutting, sale, or removal of generally small diameter timber is needed for one of the
following purposes and will maintain or improve one or more of the roadless area
characteristics as defined in Subpart B of the 2001 Roadless Rule.
(i)

To improve threatened, endangered, proposed, or sensitive species habitat; or

(ii)

To maintain or restore the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure,
such as to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects, within the range of
variability that would be expected to occur under natural disturbance regimes of
the current climatic period.

2. The cutting, sale, or removal of timber is incidental to the implementation of a management
activity not otherwise prohibited by the subpart. Examples of these activities include but are
not limited to removal of hazard trees adjacent to classified roads for public safety reasons,
fire line construction for wildland fire suppression or control of prescribed fire. Also,
hazardous fuels treatment in inventoried roadless area is not prohibited by this rule, so long as
road construction or reconstruction is not necessary (66 Fed. Reg. 3273).

Public Involvement __________________________
Shortly after fire suppression efforts were complete, initial public involvement began with public
meetings, including meetings with the Trinity County Collaborative Forestry Subgroup (the
Collaborative). Some of these meetings occurred in cooperation with the Six Rivers National Forest.
The early meetings simply discussed the existing conditions after fire effects and potential
opportunities. The Collaborative provided their “From Fire Killed to Fuelbreaks” proposal shortly
after these meetings occurred. The Forest interdisciplinary team (IDT) added detail to the
Collaborative’s proposal and initiated scoping with that as the proposed action. During the public
scoping period, in the first week of December, five public meetings were held in local communities
(Mad River, Hayfork, Hyampom, Weaverville, and Burnt Ranch) throughout Humboldt and Trinity
Counties.
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Trinity Post Fire
Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project was published in the Federal Register on November 24, 2015.
The notice asked that comments on the proposed action be received by December 24, 2015. The
scoping letter went out to over 800 adjacent landowners, interested public, regulatory agencies, and
tribes. The Forest Service received a total of 22 comment letters and emails during the scoping
period. The comments were submitted by the Trinity County Collaborative, representatives of the
timber industry, the Environmental Protection Agency, members of the public from local
communities, and conservation organizations including Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center,
Environmental Protection Information Center, Conservation Congress, Citizens for Better Forestry,
Safe Alternatives for our Forest Environment, and Wild Nature Institute.
The Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on March 17, 2017
and the legal notice for comment was published in the Redding Record Searchlight (the official
newspaper of record) March 20, 2017. The 45-day comment period for the DEIS ended on May 1,
2017. Timely comments were received from 2 government agencies, 228 private citizens, 1 company,
and 6 organizations. A summary of comments received on the DEIS and Forest Service responses are
found in Appendix H-Draft Environmental Impact Statement Comments and Responses.

Distribution of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
As stated above, the Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS was published in the Federal Register on
March 17, 2017 and the legal notice for comment was published in the Redding Record Searchlight
(the official newspaper of record) March 20, 2017. The DEIS was posted to the Forest Service
website on March 17, 2017. The Draft EIS was mailed to everyone on the project mailing list who
9

Final Environmental Impact Statement

requested a paper copy on March 17, 2017. A list of recipients is included in Chapter 4 of this FEIS.
The Draft EIS was available at the Hayfork and Weaverville Ranger Stations, the Supervisor’s Office
in Redding, and upon request during the comment period.

Issues _____________________________________
The IDT reviewed comments from the public and other agencies in order to identify key issues. Issues
are statements of cause and effect, linking environmental effects to actions (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.41
Considering Issues in Preparation of Environmental Impact Statements). Issues serve to highlight
effects or unintended consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives, giving
opportunities during the analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision
maker and public to understand (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.42 - Considering Issues in Preparation of
Environmental Assessments).
Key issues have been utilized to develop alternatives (alternative-driving issues) or analyze
alternatives (analysis-driving issues) (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4 Identifying Issues). Comments and
concerns were assigned to one of the following categories. Similar issues were grouped by subject
matter.
1. Alternative-Driving Issue (key issue): Alternative-driving issues generally concern
resources that may be impacted by implementation of the proposed action and cannot
be completely resolved through project design. An alternative-driving issue is
addressed by developing and analyzing an alternative to the proposed action or by
creating a modification to the proposed action. Such modifications may take the form
of resource protection measures or mitigation measures that are applied to the
proposed action as well as multiple alternatives. If a new alternative is created, it may
be analyzed fully or, if it does not meet the purpose and need, is illegal, is based on
inadequate scientific evidence or is sufficiently similar to an alternative already
considered in detail, the alternative will not be considered in detail. Some alternativedriving issues are also analysis-driving issues, as described below.
2. Analysis-Driving Issue (key issue): Analysis-driving issues relate to a cause and
effect relationship between the proposed action and its effects. They suggest a
method to measure effects and identify potential effects caused by the proposed
action that are relevant to the decision to be made and suggest how important or
‘significant’ an effect might be. Analysis issues are carried through effects analyses
by project specialists. Analysis issues will be analyzed in the project effects portion
of environmental impact documentation.
3. Procedural Concern (non-key issue): These are issues that may be addressed
through implementation of standard design features, or completion of processes
routinely conducted by the IDT. It is common to receive scoping comments
reminding the agency to consider or conduct certain processes, such as consultation
with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or cumulative effects analyses. Procedural
concerns may also address the methodology behind the analysis and why it is
appropriate. For example, the analysis may include the use of a model or qualitative
discussion of key resource characteristics based on professional expertise.
4. Other concern (non-key issue). Other concerns are designated as such for any of the
following reasons:
The issue is beyond the scope of the project. The issue does not meet the purpose and need for action,
falls outside of the project area, or is beyond the power of the agency to address.
The issue is unrelated to the decision to be made.
The issue is already decided or required by law, regulation, or policy.
The issue is conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence.

The Forest Service identified the following alternative-driving issues from public scoping responses:
1. Removing dead trees will negatively impact native species, habitat, clean water, and
forest resources; therefore, include an alternative that does not include post-fire
logging where it's not directly impacting busy roads. Addressed in Alternative 7.
2. Removal of burned trees would have a negative impact on northern spotted owls;
therefore, analyze an alternative that would not remove burned trees in high value
northern spotted owl areas. Addressed in Alternative 4 and 5.
3. Salvage logging has a negative impact on use of burned areas by northern spotted
owls; therefore, consider an alternative that does not impact areas that would be used
for post fire foraging by northern spotted owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5.
4. The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore,
an alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern

5. Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and
could have a negative impact on Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive species;
therefore, consider an alternative that does not treat in IRAs. Addressed in Alternative
5.
6. The proposed action does not fully address the hazard tree conditions; therefore, an
alternative should be considered that allows a wider treatment buffer where necessary
to address the hazard. Addressed in Alternative 2 and 3.
7. Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed
by the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective
fuelbreaks, including treatments of green vegetation and maintenance. Addressed in
Alternative 2.
8. The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads; therefore,
analyze an alternative that includes silvicultural treatments (including thinning green
vegetation) downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 2.
9. The proposed action is should do more to address traveler safety along roads during
fires; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes wider treatments, especially
downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 3.
10. The proposed action would leave felled hazard trees outside the treatment buffer,
which leads to heavy fuel loading; therefore, consider an alternative with a wider
treatment buffer that would allow all felled hazard trees to be removed. Addressed in
Alternative 3.
11. The proposed action would only remove trees that are dead at the time of
implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire

damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the hazard; analyze an
alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with the
Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines and the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines.
Addressed in Alternatives 2 and 3.
The Limited Operating Periods (LOPs) impact ability to implement salvage
treatments; therefore, consider an alternative that does not include LOPs. Addressed
in Alternative 8.
The proposed planting density is lower than recommended for future timber
management; therefore, analyze an alternative that would have a heavier planting
density. Addressed in Alternative 2.
The project could negatively impact watersheds that are already over the threshold of
concern; therefore, consider an alternative that minimizes treatments in those
watersheds. Addressed in Alternative 5.
Machine piling has a negative impact on soils; therefore, analyze an alternative that
would not include machine piling. Addressed in Alternative 5.
Logging has a negative impact in Riparian Reserves; therefore, analyze an alternative
that does not include logging in Riparian Reserves. Addressed in Alternative 5.

The Forest Service identified the following analysis-driving issues from scoping responses:
1. Project activities will produce sediment that could reach streams; therefore, estimate
the quantity of sediment delivery.
2. The proposed action will generate CO2 emissions; therefore, estimate CO2 emissions
for each alternative.

Decision ___________________________________
Based upon the effects of the alternatives, and comment from the public on the DEIS, the responsible
official (Forest Supervisor) will decide whether to approve the preferred alternative, another action
alternative that meets the identified purpose and need or take no action at this time.

Summary of Substantial Changes Made for the FEIS






12

The areal extent of Alternative 3 is smaller than was disclosed in the DEIS. The acreage for
Alternative 3 is 14,948 not 15,166 as originally stated in the DEIS. With this being a
reduction in acreage from the analyses done for the DEIS, determinations for Alternative 3
effects remain the same. Acres and output calculations have been updated in this document,
as well as the specialist reports.
Alternative 7b was added to address a suggestion during the comment period of the DEIS that
was nearly the same as Alternative 7. However the suggested alternative would only treat
over-hanging branches. Alternative 7 was expanded to address this suggestion, however since
Alternative 7 was not analyzed in detail, no further analysis of this suggested treatment was
conducted.
Resource Protection Measures were updated, a few were eliminated due to duplication of
protections, completion of Watershed Analyses resulted in one not being relevant, and a few
just weren’t protection measures, rather they were project design features.
Tables 3-1 thru 3-6 from the DEIS were combined and expanded. The expansion resulted it in
being too large for inclusion within the Cumulative Effects section of Chapter 3, it can be
found in Appendix G-Cumulative Effects Table. The expansion includes: the types and
acreage of Timber Harvest Plans submitted by private landowners by fire area, the current
status and acreage of other Forest Service NEPA projects (some are now being implemented

that were in the planning stage at DEIS publication), and finally the table includes all the
biotic disciplines covered in Chapter 3.
The Sediment Source Inventory Report (Appendix D in the DEIS) has been renamed Legacy
Sediment Site Plan (Plan of this document). The original report was expanded and now
includes a new section titled “Alternative Legacy Sediment Site Treatment Plan” as well as
an additional appendix, Appendix D-3: Sedimentation and Erosion Feature Descriptions.
Cumulative effects analyses were recalculated to include Timber Harvest Plans received from
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

CHAPTER 2 – ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING THE PROPOSED
ACTION
Introduction ________________________________
This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Trinity Post Fire Hazard
Reduction and Salvage Project. It describes alternatives considered in detail and those eliminated
from detailed study. The end of this chapter presents the alternatives in tabular format so that the
alternatives and their environmental impacts can be readily compared.

Alternatives Considered in Detail ______________
Based on the issues identified through public comment on the proposed action, the Forest Service
developed four alternative proposals that achieve the purpose and need differently than the proposed
action. In addition, the Forest Service is required to analyze a No Action alternative. The proposed
action, alternatives and no action alternative are described in detail below.

Actions Common to all Action Alternatives (Alternatives 15)
Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of a
failure. Hazard trees will be felled (mechanically or by hand) on National Forest System (NFS) lands
along 233 miles of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads and state highways)
that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. Hazard trees5 will be felled along all open roads in all
alternatives. However, differences between alternatives include criteria utilized for identification of
hazards and level of fuel reduction treatments prescribed to treat (or not treat) felled trees.
Open roads crossing NFS lands identified for treatment include:
- 153 miles of NFS Maintenance Level 2 (accessible with high clearance vehicles) roads;
- 34 miles of NFS Maintenance Level 3 (accessible with passenger cars) roads;
- 19 miles of NFS Maintenance Level 4 (paved) roads; and
- 27 miles of state and county roads.
Treatments common to all alternatives include:
Create a control line on the outside edge of treatment areas where necessary to maintain fuel
reductions with prescribed fire.
 Where appropriate, stumps of freshly cut conifers over 14-inches in diameter will be treated
with an EPA-registered borate compound to prevent spread of Heterobasidion root disease.
 Trees or snags that are imminent hazards to the road and/or operations would be felled; those
that are felled outside the treatment buffer would be left onsite.
 Personal-use firewood gathering of felled trees or other down wood would be allowed where
normally permitted.
No treatments are proposed within Wilderness.


The fires burned with variable intensity throughout the fire footprints. Areas within the road buffer
that burned at low severity may need very little or no treatment. As a result, treatments will be

uncommon and will occur intermittently within areas that burned at low severity. However, where
treatments are necessary and merchantable material remains, fuels treatments and small salvage sales
may be utilized within these intermittent zones.

Alternative 1 - The Proposed Action (Preferred Alternative)
Dead trees and vegetation will be treated utilizing up to a 300-foot wide (plus width of road bed) total
buffer on National Forest System (NFS) lands along 233 miles (approximately 8,000 acres) of roads
open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the
2015 wildfire season. Width of the buffer on either side of the road could change but would not
exceed 275 feet; e.g. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the uphill side may be
treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated at least 25 feet from the
road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. Alternative 1 is the
preferred alternative. Maps for Alternative 1 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-4 to F-8.

Roadside treatments

Treatments along open public roads (identified above) are designed to improve public and firefighter
safety by reducing the number of fire-induced hazards along roads and reducing excessive fuels
within the treatment buffer. Treatments along these roads include:
1. Remove or treat only dead6 vegetation (using one of the treatment types listed below) within
the treatment buffer. Dead vegetation will be identified at the time of treatment. Treatment
types could include:
a. Mechanical or hand felling and removal of trees utilizing ground or cable logging
systems.
b. Utilize wood products whenever possible. Utilization can include salvage logs,
commercial firewood, biomass removal, etc.
i. Commercial timber sales (sawlogs) are proposed on approximately 128
segmented miles of the roads (approximately 4,100 acres, displayed in
yellow on project maps) proposed for treatment. Along 105 miles, wood
utilization would occur intermittently and the expected volume is
substantially lower within this area (displayed in cyan on project maps).
ii. No new roads will be constructed. Access ramps (less than 100 feet in length)
may be utilized to access existing or newly constructed landings. Ramps will
be decommissioned following use.
c. Fuels Treatments: Reduction of fuel loading to 10-20 tons/acre. Dead brush will be
reduced by 50-100%. Within areas that burned with low severity, reduction of fuel
loading will be intermittent (displayed in cyan on project maps). Within areas that
burned with medium to high severity, fuel reduction treatments would be more
extensive (displayed in yellow on project maps). The following methods may be used
to reduce the fuel load:

i.

Hand felling, i.e. cutting trees and/or brush using hand tools such as a
chainsaw.

ii.

Mastication, i.e. pulverizes or chops standing trees and logs into small
particles, redistributing surface fuels. This treatment can include mowing,
mulching, or chipping.

green limbs at time of implementation.

2. Provide for future forest cover within the treatment buffer through planting, utilizing a
species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18
to 30 feet.

Fuel Treatment Maintenance

After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire
damage and subsequent insect and disease and fall to the ground. These processes contribute to
increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial implementation is complete. In order to sustain the
desired condition as it relates to hazard mitigation, follow-up treatments may be necessary to maintain
fuel loading levels between 10-20 tons/acre. Conditions will be evaluated and prescribed within 15
years following implementation. Maintenance treatments would be restricted to the following
treatment types:




Prescribed burning (broadcast, jackpot, underburn, piles);
Felling of hazard trees and utilization of dead (at the time of implementation); and
Hand piling excess fuels.

Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks
Alternative
Dead and dying trees and other vegetation will be treated utilizing a consistent 300-foot wide (150
feet on either side of the road, plus width of road bed) buffer on NFS lands along 217 miles
(approximately 7,300 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state
highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. In addition, 16 miles of strategically located
fuelbreaks (approximately 2,200 acres) have been identified along eight roads (3N10, 4N04, 4N24,
4N12, 5N04, 5N13, 5N60 and 6N04). This alternative responds to alternative driving issues, numbers
6-9 and 11. Maps for Alternative 2 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-9 to F-13.

Roadside treatments

Treatments along open public roads are designed to improve public and firefighter safety by reducing
the number of fire-induced hazards along roads and reducing excessive fuels within the treatment
buffer. Treatment methods are consistent with the Roadside Treatments described for the Proposed
Action (Alternative 1) except:

mortality of 0.6.7
Treatments would occur within a consistent 300-foot total width buffer. Width of the buffer
on either side of the road would equal 150 feet.
Commercial timber sales (sawlogs) are proposed on approximately 128 segmented miles of
the roads (approximately 5,300 acres) proposed for treatment (displayed in yellow on project

Approximately 2 miles of existing unauthorized roads may be utilized as temporary roads to
access existing or new landings. Unauthorized roads utilized will be decommissioned after
completion of project activities.

Fuelbreaks

Fuelbreak treatments will create new fuelbreaks along approximately 16 miles of existing open roads
(3N10, 4N04, 4N24, 4N12, 5N04, 5N13, 5N60 and 6N04). Treatment width will extend 600 feet from
either side of the road, for a total width of approximately 1,200 feet. The fuelbreak area overlays
roads identified for roadside hazard tree and fuels treatments, and would be treated utilizing the same
methods of treatment as identified for in Alternative 1 above. In addition to the treatments described
in Alternative 1, treatment within the fuelbreak would vary by distance from the road, and would
include the following modifications:

Remove or treat live and dead vegetation. Treatments could include:
 Thinning live trees up to 10” diameter at breast height (DBH), by hand felling, with the target
of the following canopy covers depending upon distance from the road:
o 0-200’ from road will be thinned to a minimum 40% canopy cover8;
o 201-400’ from road will be thinned to a minimum 60% canopy cover; and
o 401-600’ from road will be thinned to a minimum 80% canopy cover.
 Pruning, which raises canopy base heights.
o 0-200’ from road will be pruned to a maximum 10’canopy base height;
o 201-400’ from road will be pruned to a maximum 8’canopy base height; and
o 401-600’ from road will be pruned to a maximum 6’canopy base height.
Utilize wood products whenever possible. Utilization can include salvage logs, commercial or
personal firewood, biomass removal, etc.
 Commercial timber sales (sawlogs) are expected to be feasible along approximately 14
segmented miles (approximately 1,300 additional acres) of the roads proposed for fuelbreak
treatment. Additional sales would be considered outside of these miles.
 Dead and dying trees would be removed within the entire treatment area, even when they do
not pose a hazard to a road.
 Less than 1 mile of new temporary road construction may be constructed within fuelbreak
buffer to aid in tree removal, and decommissioned after completion of project activities.

Prescribed burning (broadcast, jackpot, underburn, piles)
Hand piling excess fuels
Hand felling of small trees and brush that have grown since implementation in the fuelbreak areas
Felling and utilization of hazard trees.

Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer Alternative
Dead and dying trees and other vegetation will be treated utilizing up to a 600-foot wide (300 feet on
either side of the road, plus width of road bed) buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles (approximately
14, 950 acres) of roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways),
that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. This alternative responds to alternative-driving issues,
numbers 6, 9-11 and 13. Maps for Alternative 3 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-14 to F-18.

Roadside treatments

Treatments along open public roads are designed to improve public and firefighter safety by reducing
the number of fire-induced hazards along roads and reducing excessive fuels. Treatments would occur
within a variable-width buffer not exceeding 600 feet, e.g. areas without hazardous trees due to steep
slopes downhill of the road may have a narrower treatment. Treatment methods are consistent with
the Roadside Treatments described for the Proposed Action (Alternative 1) except:

Hazard trees would be identified utilizing a probability of mortality of 0.6.
Salvage of commercially viable saw logs is proposed on approximately 128 segmented miles
of the roads (approximately 7,700 acres) proposed for treatment (displayed in yellow on
project maps). Along 105 miles, wood utilization would occur intermittently and the expected
volume is substantially lower within this area (displayed in cyan on project maps).
Up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized roads may be utilized as temporary roads to access

Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl Alternative
As described in Alternative 1, dead trees and vegetation will be felled within a variable 300-foot wide
(plus width of road bed) total buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles (approximately 8,000 acres) of
roads open to the public (i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during
the 2015 wildfire season. Roadside Treatments and Fuel Treatment Maintenance (consistent with
treatments described in Alternative 1) would occur on approximately 5,840 acres along roads outside
areas identified as important habitat for northern spotted owls. This alternative responds to alternative
driving issues, numbers 2-4. Maps for Alternative 4 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-19 to F23.

Roadside Treatments

Treatments consistent with Roadside Treatments described in Alternative 1 would occur on
approximately 5,840 acres along roads outside areas identified as important habitat for northern
spotted owls.



Salvage of saw logs containing commercial value is proposed on approximately 20
segmented miles of the roads (approximately 780 acres) proposed for treatment (shown in
cyan on project map). Along 155 miles (5,060 acres), there would be no salvage harvest.
Along 155 miles with no salvage treatments (5,060 acres), fuels treatments would occur
(shown in cyan on project map).
As is the case for Roadside Treatments in Alternative 1, future forest cover within the
treatment buffer would be provided through planting, utilizing a species composition
consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet.

Fuel Treatment Maintenance

Maintenance treatments consistent with treatments described in Alternative 1 would occur on
approximately 5,840 acres along roads outside areas identified as important habitat for northern
spotted owls.

Important Northern Spotted Owl Habitat

Hazard tree mitigation would occur along 58 miles of road on 2,100 acres identified as important
habitat for northern spotted owls. These areas are those which consist of:
Suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and post-fire foraging habitat in northern spotted owl
territories (1.3 miles from current and historic nesting sites); and
- Suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and post-fire foraging habitat in northern spotted owl
Critical Habitat.
Within these areas, treatments would be limited to hazard tree mitigation. Hand felling trees identified
as hazardous to the road or operations would be left on site: there would be no removal, no fuels
reduction, and no maintenance treatments (shown in orange on the project maps). However, tree
planting would occur, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing
between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet
-

Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative
Dead trees and vegetation will be treated within a variable 300-foot wide (plus width of road bed)
total buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles (approximately 8,000 acres) of roads open to the public
(i.e. open NFS roads, county roads, and state highways) that burned during the 2015 wildfire season.
Roadside treatments and Fuel Treatment Maintenance (consistent with treatments described in
Alternative 1) would occur on approximately 4,100 acres to reduce fuel loadings outside of sensitive

areas, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal or machine piling would be allowed
in any treatment areas. This alternative responds to alternative driving issues, numbers 2-5 and 14-16.
Maps for Alternative 5 can be found in Appendix F on pages F-24 to F-28.

Roadside Treatments

Roadside Treatments would occur on approximately 4,100 acres outside of certain sensitive areas
(shown in cyan on project maps). Treatments would be consistent with the Roadside Treatments
described in Alternative 1 with following exceptions:
 No commercial timber sale removal would occur
 No machine piling would be allowed.
As is true with the Roadside Treatments under Alternative 1, future forest cover would be restored
through planting, utilizing a species composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing
between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet.

Fuel Treatment Maintenance

Maintenance treatments (consistent with treatments described in Alternative 1) would occur on
approximately 4,100 acres along roads outside areas identified Sensitive Areas as described below.

Sensitive Areas

Hazard tree mitigation would occur on 3,900 acres identified as sensitive areas. These areas consist
of:
- All northern spotted owl suitable (nesting, roosting, foraging) and post-fire foraging habitat;
- Riparian Reserves;
- Inventoried Roadless Areas; and
- At-risk watersheds.
Within these areas, treatments would be limited to hazard tree mitigation. Hand felling trees identified
as hazardous to the road or operations would be left on site: there would be no removal, no fuels
reduction, and no maintenance treatments. However, tree planting would occur, utilizing a species
composition consistent with historic conditions, with spacing between seedlings of 18 to 30 feet

Alternative 6 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, current management plans would continue to guide management of
the project area. No hazard mitigation would be implemented to accomplish the purpose and need.

Connected Actions
Connected actions are those actions that are closely related and therefore should be analyzed in the
same document. Actions are connected if they automatically trigger other actions which may require
environmental analysis, cannot or will not proceed unless other actions are taken previously or
simultaneously, or are interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their
justification (40 CFR § 1508.25 Scope). The connected actions that are considered in this analysis are
road construction, reconstruction, and maintenance; restoration; temporary road use; and use and
creation of landings.

Road Treatments

The project proposes no new permanent road construction. Existing National Forest Transportation
System roads may receive reconstruction and maintenance activities to bring some sections of road up
to Forest Service standards to protect resources, safely and efficiently accommodate machine and
worker access, and provide for removal of forest products. These road improvements, where they
occur on system roads that are open to the public, would secondarily provide safer roads for public
20

Final Environmental Impact Statement

use. Commercial treatments may require larger vehicles and more frequent trips to haul material offsite; these roads may receive additional maintenance or reconstruction. Road use for non-commercial
hazard reduction treatments would generally be limited to foot traffic or light vehicles (pickup trucks
and off-highway vehicles). Mechanical fuels reduction treatments would include equipment traveling
on roads where possible to reduce impacts, and otherwise may require masticators and equipment
utilized for machine-piling along road corridors and within analyzed buffer widths.
The project also proposes downgrading 1.6 miles of National Forest System road 31N49 from a
Maintenance Level 2 road (open) to a Maintenance Level 1 road (closed). All of the action
alternatives would include closing this road. This road has been identified as having safety concerns
inherent in design and is disproportionately contributing sedimentation to waterways due to its
proximity to the stream bed. Downgrading the maintenance level would be implemented by blocking
access with a barrier after storm-proofing. As this action does not remove the road from the National
Forest Road System, existing permitted uses would be maintained.
A list of roads planned for use during implementation of the project is included in Appendix A.

Road Maintenance

Maintenance preserves the function of the road but generally does not include improvements.
Maintenance generally includes: blading; brushing; felling and removal of roadside hazard trees;
repair and/or replacement of road surfaces; cleaning, repair, or installation of drainage structures such
as culverts, ditches, and dips; dust abatement; removal and installation of closure barriers, and
installation or repair of signs. Maintenance activities generally do not disturb ground outside the
existing roadway (toe of fill to top of cut) other than removal of material around culvert inlets.
Road maintenance activities may occur on all open roads administered by the Forest Service in
connection with implementation of this project. This includes NFS roads within the fire footprint as
well as those planned for utilization as haul routes for log removal outside the fire footprint,
approximately 247 miles of road.

Reconstruction

Road reconstruction would occur as necessary for safe and efficient passage. Road reconstruction to
treat existing sediment sources was made a condition of our Waiver by the North Coast Regional
Water Quality Control Board. 9 Reconstruction generally includes work to improve and restore roads.
Improvements would provide for serviceability for public use as well as project haul vehicles and
logging equipment, proper hydrologic function, and stream protection, in accordance with applicable
Best Management Practices (BMPs). General goals include storm-proofing (USDA, 2011a) to reduce
the potential for road erosion and sedimentation and to help protect riparian and aquatic resources
while protecting the road surface and improving public safety. Storm-proofing reduces stream
diversion potential and minimizes potential fill volume loss at crossings by insuring that if a pipe or
culvert is compromised, any overflow would be directed to an area that is well armored and away
from fill material.
Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage dips to disperse concentrated
surface flows; upgrading and replacing undersized, worn or damaged culverts to withstand 100-year
peak flows and/or debris flows; constructing riprap fills or other drainage or stabilization features
with potential disturbance outside the established roadway (toe of fill to top of cut); construction of
low water crossings (native surface or designed/hardened); construction of fish passage crossings
utilizing natural bottom design; realignment; widening to accommodate vehicles/equipment or when
increasing the size of a culvert; and widening of curves as needed to accommodate off-tracking of log
trucks and chip vans. Reconstruction also includes the actions included in the Road Maintenance

Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region.

category above such as culvert replacement, depending on stream conditions (i.e. wet).
Reconstruction would improve the road conditions as needed for haul of forest products.
Generally, reconstruction is focused around perennial stream crossings or near adjacent perennial
waterways. Specifically, this project includes 47 culvert replacements or upgrades, 1 natural bottom
fish passage crossing and one designed low water crossing, which would occur under all action
alternatives. See Appendix D for more road actions.

Restoration

Approximately 4.7 miles of non-system (i.e. unauthorized) routes in Hyampom and Sulphur Glade
Creek-Waldorf Flat watersheds would be hydrologically restored in order to reduce watershed
impacts in these already sensitive watersheds that experienced substantial wildfire effects.10 All of the
action alternatives would include restoration of these non-system routes. Restoration of these routes
would include installing native material barriers made of log, earth, or rock. Beyond the closure,
measures would be implemented as necessary to reduce sediment delivery from the road surface to
make it hydrologically neutral. Hydrologic restoration of roads includes measures such as partial
recontouring11, loosening compacted soils, and removing all structures such as stream crossing pipes,
over-side drains, trash racks, drop inlets, etc. (USDA, 2011a). Limited sections may be fully
recontoured where it is economically feasible or necessary to camouflage a route where barriers or
gates are likely to be ineffective. Exceptions may occur where removing a pipe involves adverse
effects which outweigh environmental benefits. Cross drain pipes may be left in place (with the inlet
crushed).

Best Management Practices for Road Actions

Road construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be implemented for any roadwork for the
project to ensure proper drainage and control of road related sediment. A list of the BMPs relevant to
this project is available in Appendix C. Roads used for project implementation must meet Forest
Service BMP standards and where necessary would be watered for dust abatement, or dust abated
through the use of a Forest approved dust palliative (suppressant).

Landings

Landings are critical for handling and storing woody material prior to hauling. Landings are located
in and outside of the commercial treatment units. Existing landings, wide spots in the road or other
already disturbed/impacted areas adjacent to roads will be used wherever possible. Some existing
landings will be expanded, and some new short-term (temporary) landings may be needed, generally
not exceeding 0.25 acre each. New landings will not be constructed within Riparian Reserves;
however, landings that currently exist in Riparian Reserves may be reused where reuse constitutes
less ground disturbance than new construction. Further design and specifications of these landings are
addressed in the resource protection measures section in this chapter. The estimated number of new
landings needed by alternative are as follows:
Alternative 1 – 60 landings;
Alternative 2 – 80 landings;
Alternative 3 – 110 landings;
Alternative 4 – 35 landings;
Alternative 5 – 0 landings.

Reforestation Release

Reforestation treatments would be monitored for the need to control competing vegetation such as
grasses, forbs, and shrubs that could inhibit the survival and growth of desirable seedlings. Hand
grubbing of competing vegetation may be implemented within the first one to seven years following
reforestation, depending on monitoring results.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from
Detailed Study ______________________________
Federal agencies are required to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable
alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed
in detail (40 CFR 1502.14 Alternatives Including the Proposed Action). Public comments received in
response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the
purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the scope of the need for the
proposal, duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or determined to contain components
that would cause unnecessary environmental harm. Therefore, a number of alternatives were
considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration for reasons summarized below:

Alternative 7a: Treat Along High Use Roads Only
This proposal was suggested in scoping by EPIC and Wild Nature Institute (WNI), due to the
potentially adverse effects of logging on sediment delivery and northern spotted owl habitat. High use
roads are described in comments as busy, well-traveled roads (WNI), with the assumption that
maintenance level 2 roads (often native surface roads, maintained for high clearance vehicles),
receive less use than maintenance level 3 and 4 roads.
Under this alternative, hazard trees and dead vegetation would be treated utilizing up to a 300-foot
wide buffer on NFS lands along 80 miles (approximately 3,000 acres) of high-use roads open to the
public (i.e. maintenance level 3 and 4 Forest Service system roads, county roads, and state highways)
within the burn perimeter of the 2015 wildfires. Approximately 153 miles of open Forest Service
system roads (maintenance level 2) would go untreated.
Forest Plan direction instructs us to perform road maintenance activities to meet a variety of
management objectives…[such as] (1) to provide for user safety… (page 4-16 and 4-17), and
specifically addresses this need in Late Successional Reserve12, Administratively Withdrawn13 and
Riparian Reserve14 management Standards & Guidelines. Trees impacted by the 2015 wildfires will
continue to fall as trees deteriorate at increasing rates. This poses a direct hazard to vehicles and
people with potential to be hit by a falling tree, but perhaps more likely it poses a hazard of becoming
trapped by trees that fall across the road. Unless cutting firewood, most recreationists do not enter the
forest with a chainsaw. This can lead to entrapment behind logs on remote roads.
Maintenance Level 2 roads provide a recreational opportunity to the public, including OHV use,
which is a popular pastime for Forest recreationists. Maintenance level 2 roads receive varying levels
of use, with some being used daily and others being used less frequently; however, closing roads due
to safety hazards restricts recreational opportunities, and leaving roads open where trees and snags
12 Removal

of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and trails, and in or adjacent to
campgrounds. Where materials must be removed from the site, as in a campground or on a road, a salvage sale is appropriate
(Forest Plan, p 4-38).
13 Through hazardous tree evaluation and control, provide an acceptable level of public safety with the least amount of
damage and impact to the environment (Forest Plan, p 4-48).
14 Fell trees in Riparian Reserves when they pose a safety risk. Keep felled trees on-site when needed to meet coarse woody
debris Objectives (Forest Plan, p 4-58).

pose falling and entrapment hazards would not be consistent with policy or the Forest’s responsibility
to provide safe recreational opportunities to the public.
This alternative was eliminated from detailed study because it does not meet the Purpose and Need to
mitigate hazards on open roads in areas burned during the 2015 fires. This alternative would leave
unsafe conditions on approximately 153 miles of open Forest Service system roads.

Alternative 7b: Treat Overhanging Trees along High Use
Roads Only
This proposal was suggested in comments on the DEIS by Conservation Congress and Wild Nature
Institute (WNI), based on their belief that there is not an urgent need to protect these areas from
hazards and potentially adverse effects of cutting down trees on northern spotted owl habitat. High
use roads are described in comments as busy, well-traveled roads (WNI), with the assumption that
maintenance level 2 roads (often native surface roads, maintained for high clearance vehicles),
receive less use than maintenance level 3 and 4 roads, and are not designated to be accessible by
passenger cars (Conservation Congress).
Under this alternative, hazard trees that overhang high-use roads open to the public (i.e. maintenance
level 3 and 4 Forest Service system roads, county roads, and state highways) on NFS lands within the
burn perimeter of the 2015 wildfires would be cut, along 80 miles. Approximately 153 miles of open
Forest Service system roads (maintenance level 2) would go untreated and any hazard tree that could
strike the road but is not overhanging the road would not be cut.
Forest Plan direction instructs us to perform road maintenance activities to meet a variety of
management objectives…[such as] (1) to provide for user safety… (page 4-16 and 4-17), and
specifically addresses this need in Late Successional Reserve, Administratively Withdrawn and
Riparian Reserve management Standards and Guidelines. Trees impacted by the 2015 wildfires will
continue to fall as trees deteriorate at increasing rates. This poses a direct hazard to vehicles and
people with potential to be hit by a falling tree, but perhaps more likely it poses a hazard of becoming
trapped by trees that fall across the road. Unless cutting firewood, most recreationists do not enter the
forest with a chainsaw. This can lead to entrapment behind logs on remote roads.
Maintenance Level 2 roads provide a recreational opportunity to the public, including OHV use,
which is a popular pastime for Forest recreationists. Maintenance level 2 roads receive varying levels
of use, with some being used daily and others being used less frequently; however, closing roads due
to safety hazards restricts recreational opportunities, and leaving roads open where trees and snags
pose falling and entrapment hazards would not be consistent with policy or the Forest’s responsibility
to provide safe recreational opportunities to the public.
This alternative was eliminated from detailed study because it does not meet the Purpose and Need to
mitigate hazards on open roads in areas burned during the 2015 fires. This alternative would leave
unsafe conditions on approximately 153 miles of open Forest Service system roads and hazards along
the other 80 miles.

Alternative 8: From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks
In September 2015, the Trinity County Collaborative (Collaborative) submitted a proposal to the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest to respond to our post-fire landscape entitled “From Fire-kill to
Fuelbreaks.” This proposal was crafted by a diverse group of local interested parties and largely
supported by the Trinity County Collaborative membership. After working with the Trinity County
Collaborative the Forest modified this proposal to develop the proposed action. While the main
concepts of the proposal were incorporated into the proposed action, certain details were removed
from the proposal and detailed as follows:
24

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

1. To improve drainage on slopes between 10-35 percent, dozers would rip soils 12 to 18inches deep with the contours, 20-feet between dozer passes, outside dripline of
remaining green trees.15
The concept behind ripping soils 12-18 inches deep is to improve drainage within
hydrophobic soils. Following fires, a thin layer of soil at or below the mineral soil surface can
become hydrophobic after intense heating. The hydrophobic layer is the result of a waxy
substance that is derived from plant material burned during a hot fire. This condition repels
water, causing reduced water infiltration, which increases overland and stream flow (surface
runoff) leading to erosion of fertile topsoil and sediment to streams. This condition can persist
for years. Plant roots and soil fauna eventually reduce hydrophobicity, but reduced infiltration
does inhibit plant and root growth, which further slows down the process.
Tilling and ripping are mechanical soil treatments aimed at improving infiltration rates in
machine-compacted or water repellent soils. These treatments increase the amount of
macropore space in soils by physical breakup of dense or water repellent soils, and thus
increase the amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil. However, tilling and ripping are
more effectively used with machine compacted soils (i.e. main skid trails and landings) to
improve site-specific infiltration in compressed and nonproductive soils. Cross-country
ripping can result in excessive reduction in soil productivity, as the subsoil gets mixed with
topsoil. While hydrophobicity and erosion may be reduced in the short term, the soil
disturbance reduces soil productivity in the long term.
Due to the mechanical impact of incorporating dozers across the landscape where terrain
allows, this proposal could create up to 3,650 acres of impact within these already distressed
watersheds, and could result in about 730 equivalent roaded acres (ERA). This will take
Hyampom (about 60 ERA) and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat (about 8 ERA) watersheds
further over the threshold of concern.

Figure 2- 1. Ripping and tilling of forested land following wildfire in the Sierra Nevadas.
2.

To provide fire breaks and facilitate maintenance burning, a one-blade wide dozer trail
would be constructed at outside edge of road buffer.

The concept behind a bladed dozer trail is to take the opportunity (since equipment would already be
on site) to blade a fireline in order to facilitate prescribed burning in the future. While the concept is
logical, there are several challenges associated with this proposal:
Within the Proposed Action, this could result in 466 miles of dozer line (about 600 additional ERAs),
which would further adversely impact sensitive watersheds (see #1 above).

modified by the Collaborative from original scoping comments to “where appropriate”.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The terrain is not consistent. There are many areas or patches where a dozer would not be able to
parallel the road due to slope, thereby making disconnected segments of line.
Since fire severity was variable, dozer line would be built through live and dead stands, thereby
potentially resulting in the removal of viable green trees in an already stressed ecosystem.
Since prescribed burning is controlled and monitored, a handline (which is much less impactive to
resources) is appropriate for use.
3. To provide for future shaded cover, mixed conifer species would be planted at
approximately a 30-foot spacing between planted trees (40-50 trees per acre).
A shaded fuelbreak is generally comprised of enough mature trees to provide shade to inhibit growth
of shrubs and other live surface fuels. Following fire, the landscape generally experiences variable
effects ranging from little change in forest structure, to complete mortality, depending on fire severity
and vegetation type. In areas experiencing full mortality, the seed sources (mature trees with cones)
needed to naturally reforest are lacking or non-existent. Planting mixed conifer in these areas lacking
seed sources would accelerate, by 50-100 years, the natural succession of a forested stand, providing
a forested stand more quickly. A tree planting component is incorporated into the proposed action
(and all alternatives) within the buffer widths.
While the goal of a shaded fuelbreak is to have 40-50 mature trees per acre, planting at a 30-foot
spacing (if all spots are plantable) would result in 48 seedlings being planted per acre. Unfortunately,
it is unlikely that the 48 seedlings will ultimately be contributing to a future shaded fuelbreak due to
seedling mortality. Planting to a denser spacing is preferred for a number of reasons including:
Post-fire reforestation results in 30-80 percent survival within the first 5 years, depending on
species and conditions. There are many reasons seedlings fail. For example, planting in
drought years results in higher seedling mortality, as does planting without adequate site
preparation, near high wildlife/grazing use areas, etc.
Seedlings do not produce much shade. If there are not many conifers contributing to shade, it
is more challenging for seedlings to out-compete the brush/understory species. Generally,
after a few years, the conifers have overtopped the brush. In a denser stand, these saplings can
start shading out the brush. However, even if all seedlings survived, 48 saplings/acre would
not contribute enough shade to outcompete and start shading out the brush, potentially for
decades.
All seedlings are not equally healthy. Even with seedlings eventually taking hold (primarily
from planted trees), seedlings, saplings, poles and eventually mature trees will continue to
die. A denser spacing would allow natural selection to take place, retaining the strongest and
healthiest into the future so that in a few decades, there are 40-50 mature trees to contribute to
a shaded fuelbreak.
Planting 48 seedlings to the acre in mixed conifer is inconsistent with the Forest Plan which
(consistent with Regional guidelines) identifies a minimum of 150 trees/acre (recommended
200 trees/acre) 5 years after planting.
As indicated above, planting to a 30-foot spacing does not provide the forest cover intended for the
future desired condition, so this request was incorporated into the prescribed range of seedling
spacing under the proposed action (18-30 foot spacing). An 18-foot spacing is wider than typically
planted for a managed timber stand; however, the Forest agrees that areas along roads would better be
managed for lower fuel loading levels to allow for safer ingress/egress rather than managed timber
production.

Establish a South Fork Mountain Ridgetop Fuelbreak utilizing the ridgetop as the
centerline for the 300-foot treatment width.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

South Fork Mountain Ridgetop was considered for a fuelbreak. It was removed from the proposed
action for the following reasons:
Ownership of sections along the ridgetop is mixed between private and National Forest System lands.
Since public land within 150-feet of the ridgetop is substantially segmented, a contiguous fuelbreak
would not be implementable. This substantially reduces the value of a fuelbreak for controlling the
spread of fire.
The Route and Mad River Complexes did not connect, resulting in a substantial area of South
Fork ridge that remains green with live vegetation. In addition, where these fires (Johnson
and Pickett Fires) did burn across the ridgetop, the varied fire severity resulted in a mosaic of
fire effects. In order for a fuelbreak to be effective on the ridgetop, both green and burned
areas with live and dead fuels would require treatment; however, the Collaborative proposal
only called for the treatment of dead fuels. This level of treatment does not support a
classification of fuelbreak. Fuelbreak design incorporated into Alternative 2 includes
treatment of live and dead fuels, and strategically located fuelbreaks.
In addition, the 300-foot total width suggested in the Collaborative proposal is not a
scientifically sound width for a ridgetop fuelbreak in heavy timber16 (NRCS, 2005). A
fuelbreak width of 1200-foot total width was utilized in strategic areas in Alternative 2.
These components were ultimately eliminated from detailed study because of the
disproportionate impacts to watersheds or ineffectiveness in treatment as described above.
The remaining concepts included in the “From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks proposal have been
incorporated into the Proposed Action for this project.

Alternative 9: Landscape-Level Treatments and
Reforestation
The 2015 wildfires resulted in nearly 34,000 acres of forested lands burning at moderate to high fire
severity, which resulted in substantial conifer mortality. As soon as these trees died, they began to
deteriorate, losing both structural integrity and economic value. As these trees fall to the ground, they
contribute to substantial fuel loading on the forest floor. Left unmanaged, these large areas with high
levels of fuel loading could result in a greater vulnerability to future high severity wildfire as well as
increasing the potential for type conversions from forest lands dominated by conifer trees to brush
fields. In response to internal input as well as comments submitted by the American Forest Resource
Council, the IDT considered landscape-level treatments that would address this condition. In addition
to treatments proposed under the proposed action, this alternative incorporates landscape-level
salvage (approximately 7,400 acres) and reforestation (approximately 14,000 acres) across the areas
affected by the 2015 wildfires.
All fire areas contained opportunities for larger landscape treatments; however, the South and River
Complexes have the most areas of opportunity. Areas identified for salvage and fuels landscape
treatments were between 5 and 40 acres in size, and consisted of stands of dead to mostly dead
conifer trees of merchantable (greater than 12-inches for fire-killed conifers) size. Units identified
incorporated all logging systems – tractor, cable and helicopter, and were prioritized based on high
estimated residual fuel levels once snags fell to the ground.
Following salvage/fuels reduction treatments, these stands would be planted to a mix of conifer
species (i.e. Douglas-fir, ponderosa/Jeffery pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, red fir)
historically appropriate for the site. Planting after treatment kick-starts the return of forest cover and
sets the stand on a path to forested conditions faster than natural recovery. This is especially true for

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

areas experiencing larger patches of high severity fire, effectively deforesting existing stands and
removing sources of seed. In addition to areas identified for salvage, approximately 6,600 acres of
conifer stands experiencing high to moderate severity fire were also identified for reforestation. These
areas were identified based on fire severity, pre-fire species composition, proximity to roads and
slope.
This alternative was ultimately eliminated from detailed study because it is outside the Purpose and
Need to provide for public safety along roads open to the public. Treatments away from the road
buffer would not be consistent with the road safety-related Purpose and Need for this project. A
separate project focusing on reforestation outside the proposed road buffer associated with this EIS,
but within the post-fire landscape, was analyzed ((2015 Fire Reforestation Project).

Alternative 10: WUI Fuels Treatments
The 2015 wildfires resulted in nearly 12,200 acres of burned National Forest System lands in
Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) Zone 217 and Zone 318. As soon as the trees and brush died, they
began to deteriorate. As the trees fall to the ground and combine with the dead brush, they contribute
to substantial fuel loading on the forest floor. Left unmanaged, these areas with high levels of fuel
loading would have high resistance to control concerns and could result in a greater vulnerability of
future high severity wildfire, further threatening private inholdings. In addition, future wildfire in
untreated post-fire landscapes increases the potential for type conversions from forest lands
dominated by conifer trees to brush fields.
In response to private landowners interest and internal input, the IDT looked at the potential for
treatments on NFS lands adjacent to (within 0.25 miles) private land boundaries or WUI areas, across
all burn severities. In addition to treatments proposed under the proposed action, this alternative
would incorporate fuels treatments including salvage within WUI zone 2 and 3 (approximately
12,187 acres). Fuels treatment goals within WUI Zone 2 are flame length less than 2 feet and no
crown fire potential. Fuels treatment goals with WUI Zone 3 are flame length less than 4 feet and
limited crown fire potential.
Following fuels reduction treatments, moderate and high mortality stands would be planted to a
spacing of 20 feet by 20 feet in WUI Zone 2 and 15 feet by 15 feet in WUI Zone 3 with a mix of
conifer species (i.e. Douglas-fir, ponderosa/Jeffery pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, red fir)
historically appropriate for the site. Planting after treatment kick-starts the return of forest cover and
sets the stand on a path to forested conditions faster than natural recovery. Forested stands structured
and maintained as a shaded fuel break have lower flame lengths, rates of spread, and resistance to
control concerns compared to brush fields, allowing for more fire suppression options in the event of
a wildfire. The wider tree spacing reduces crown fire initiation. Shaded fuelbreaks can be used for
direct suppression actions with handtools.
This alternative was ultimately eliminated from detailed study because it is outside the Purpose and
Need to provide for public safety along roads open to the public. Treatments away from the road
buffer would not be consistent with the road safety-related Purpose and Need for this project. A
separate project focusing on fuels reduction in the WUI outside the proposed road buffer associated
with this EIS, but within the post-fire landscape, may be analyzed.

Resource Protection Measures Common to All
Alternatives ________________________________
To minimize impacts to resources in the area from this project, the following resource protection
measures are incorporated into all action alternatives, unless otherwise noted.

Wildlife and Fish

1. Limited operating periods (LOPs)19 will be implemented to avoid potential impacts to
northern spotted owls, fishers, bald eagles, northern goshawks, peregrine falcons, and
anadromous fish:
a. For northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), limited operating periods
(LOPs) are established in collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to limit
potential disturbance or harm to this species while allowing project activities to
proceed in areas where disturbance is much less likely to occur. In the majority of the
project area, a February 1 through September 15 LOP will restrict activities directly
manipulating suitable nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitat, and a February 1 to
July 10 LOP will restrict activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or
smoke within 0.25 miles of suitable NRF habitat.
i. In the road restoration treatments outside the hazard reduction and salvage
treatment areas, a February 1 through July 31 LOP will restrict activities
causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke within 0.25 miles of
suitable NRF habitat.
ii. Findings from protocol surveys can be used to modify timing of operations.
If subsequent protocol-compliant surveys show no nesting activity within
0.25 miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation or by mutual
agreement with the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), LOPs may be
lifted. If surveys indicate that northern spotted owls are not resident in the
area and LOPs are lifted, the FWS will be informed of the change.
b. LOP Exemption Areas: Treatment areas where less than 10% of the lands within 0.25
mi are preferable to NSO20 were reviewed with FWS to determine the relative
benefits of LOP’s. LOP’s will not apply to the selected areas (see the wildlife section
of Chapter 3 for a map of the areas where NSO LOPs will apply) because disturbance
to NSO is much less likely to occur. Within these areas, pre-disturbance activity
center searches will be conducted where treatments that may produce loud and
continuous noise disturbance are proposed within high-value NSO cores (e.g.,
operations of heavy equipment and chain saws for a period of two hours or more). If
nesting activity is observed, LOPs will be imposed as described in the preceding
paragraphs. If activity center searches are not completed, LOP’s will apply.
c. For bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), a limited operating period (LOP) will be
imposed from January 1 to August 15 within 0.75 miles of all known bald eagle nest
sites. This LOP will apply to all activities causing loud and continuous noise
disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding
season. If a bald eagle management plan has been written for a specific nesting site,
the provisions of the plan will be incorporated into the project design. Surveys to
protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent

protocol-compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.75 miles of proposed
activities at the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted.
d. For peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), a limited operating period (LOP) will be
imposed from February 1 to August 15 within 0.5 miles of all known falcon nest
sites. This LOP will apply to all activities causing loud and continuous noise
disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding
season. If a peregrine falcon management plan has been written for a specific nesting
site, the provisions of the plan will be incorporated into the project design. Surveys to
protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol
compliant surveys show no nesting activity within the nest site management zones at
the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted.
e. For northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), a limited operating period (LOP) will be
imposed from February 1 to August 15 within 0.5 miles of all known goshawk nest
sites. This LOP will apply to all activities causing loud and continuous noise
disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding
season. Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If
subsequent protocol-compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.5 miles of
proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOPs may be lifted.
f. Field personnel and equipment will not enter waterways where anadromous fish are
determined to be spawning or eggs would be incubating,21 as determined and
indicated by a fish biologist. Restricted time periods are generally from October 15
through April 15. Additional restrictions may be appropriate for waterways
containing spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and summer-run
steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), as determined by a qualified fish biologist (focus is
protection of spawning and incubating eggs). Maps will be provided to those
responsible for implementation.
g. To avoid potential watershed-related impacts, including effects to anadromous fish,
timber harvest activities will occur between April 15 and October 15 (Normal
Operating Season). Timber harvest activities may occur outside of the Normal
Operating Season if authorized by the appropriate Line Officer when: 1) weather
conditions are favorable, 2) erosion control work is current, and 3) acceptance of
recommendations from the district fisheries biologist and/or hydrologist. The dates of
operations may also be constrained consistent with Wet Weather Operations
Guidelines.
The approximate percentage of the proposed treatment area that will be subject to wildlife
LOP’s is as follows:
January 1 – August 15: <1%
February 1 – July 10: 38%
February 1 – August 15: <1%
February 1 - September 15: 24%
No wildlife LOP: 38%
h. If during project layout or implementation caves are found in units or within 250 feet
of unit boundaries, an Earth Scientist would be consulted and a buffer flagged on the
ground identifying an equipment exclusion zone, and/or modification of the
prescription in the vicinity if needed. No project activities will take place within 250

feet from caves, mines and mine adits to protect known or potential sensitive bat
species (Townsend’s big-eared bat, pallid bat, and fringed myotis) roost sites.
Activities necessary to address safety threats (e.g. hazard trees to the road or
operations) will prevail over this measure.
2. High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs) are defined as areas preferable22 to NSO
and: 1. Within an NSO Critical Habitat Unit; or 2. Within a core area of an NSO territory that
has a history of nesting or a resident pair, and preferable habitat conditions in at least 40% of
the core area and 30% of the home range;23 or 3. Within an NSO core area that does not meet
these criteria, but has been selected for additional protection in collaboration with the US Fish
and Wildlife Service.24 HVWCAs are displayed on a map in the wildlife section of Chapter 3.
a. Within HVWCAs the following measures will apply in all suitable NSO nesting/roosting,
foraging, and post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) habitat areas:25
i.

Tree removal (salvage) will be limited to trees posing a hazard to open roads and/or
operations. Hazard is determined by factors including tree condition and height, and
terrain (slope). (On flat ground in this area, a typical tree distance considered
potentially hazardous to a road is 150 feet.) Beyond this distance, trees posing a
hazard to operations or haul routes will be cut to abate the safety hazard, and will be
subject to removal only where their retention would pose a safety hazard if left onsite as logs.

ii.

In NSO nesting/roosting habitat within HVWCAs, no mechanical or tractor based
operations, including salvage treatments, will occur.

iii.

Except where it poses a hazard to operations or haul routes, all coarse woody debris
(CWD) in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) will be retained.
Where it is available, at least 15 tons of CWD per acre will be retained for wildlife
benefit (CWD = snags 15 inches or greater in diameter and logs greater than 20
inches diameter and 10 feet long). In the areas where there is a need to retain firekilled CWD in addition to decayed snags and logs to meet this standard, snags and
logs in the size classes listed above that have deformities such as cat faces, broken or
forked tops, hollows or cavities will be prioritized for retention.

b. Outside of HVWCAs, the following measures will apply in all suitable NSO
nesting/roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) habitat areas:

22 Preferable

i.

Tree removal (i.e. salvage) will occur where there is a hazard to open roads and/or
operations, and may also occur beyond that, up to the maximum buffer distance
from the road in each alternative.

ii.

Where it is available, an average of at least 10 tons of CWD per acre will be
retained for wildlife benefit. (CWD = snags 15 inches or greater in diameter and
logs greater than 20 inches diameter and 10 feet long). Snags with deformities such

habitat is defined as “Highly selected for” or “selected for” based on the US Fish and Wildlife Service Relative
Habitat Suitability (RHS) modeling. RHS incorporates NSO survey results and abiotic factors such as slope aspect and
elevation to predict areas most likely to be used by NSO. Databases such as E-veg and field verification efforts identify
NSO habitat suitability at specific sites (nesting/roosting and foraging habitats, as well as dispersal and post-fire foraging
areas). These identify vegetative conditions at specific sites rather than the likelihood of NSO use of any specific site.
23 An NSO core area is all land within 0.5 mi. of an NSO activity center. An NSO home range (territory) is all land within
1.3 mi. of an activity center.
24 These areas have been mapped and are identified in the project wildlife biological assessment.
25 This categorization is based on data collected during field visits, aerial photo interpretation, and the E-veg owl habitat
suitability database. Post-fire foraging type 1 areas are NSO nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitats that were affected
by moderate- or high-severity fire and within 500 feet of currently suitable (surviving) NRF habitats.

3. All plant populations requiring protection from proposed treatments will be flagged on the
ground and some or all treatments may be excluded within those populations. These sites will
be shown on project implementation maps as control areas.
4. If individuals of protected species (see the Botany section of chapter 3 for a full list of
sensitive species and other protected species that occur within the project area) are discovered
after project implementation begins, all off-road ground-disturbing operations will be stopped
temporarily in the area of discovery until a Forest Service Botanist or representative
recommends appropriate protection measures. This measure will be incorporated into the
project design through a sale contract provision or similar language in any service contracts.

Western Waterfan Lichen

5. Stream crossings, rocked or otherwise, will not be constructed on Collins Creek or any of its
tributaries known to be occupied by Goward’s waterfan lichen to avoid potential damage.

Niles’ and Stebbins’ Harmonia

6. Ditch cleaning and brushing associated with project related road maintenance and using
heavy equipment with a blade will be restricted to no higher than 24 inches above the ground
to reduce potential impacts to Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia plants that can occupy cut and
fill slopes. Ditches may be cleaned without restriction up to a height of 24 inches above the
bottom of slopes. Vegetation above 24 inches that obstructs vehicle line of sight will be
manually cut and removed without disturbing the roadside.

Pacific Fuzzwort

7. Standard provisions for protection of residual trees will be included in all implementation
contracts or agreements to avoid accidental scraping of potential Pacific fuzzwort mats at the
base of host trees. Operations shall not unnecessarily damage young growth or other trees to
be reserved.

Umpqua Green Gentian

8. Handline construction will not occur within known populations of Umpqua green gentian
near Pickett Peak.
9. Heavy equipment use will be excluded from naturally occurring grassy or gravelly openings
within late-seral conifer forest.

Canyon Creek Stonecrop

10. Trees will be directionally felled away from rock outcrops or exposed bedrock greater than 10
feet in diameter.

Heavy Equipment Use

11. Machine piling, skid trails, new landing construction, and pile burning treatments will be
excluded from within known Sensitive botanical populations. Locations will be flagged on
the ground and marked as control areas on operational maps.
12. Machine piling will be restricted to landings and areas of pre-fire heavy soil disturbance,
except where field surveys are conducted and absence of Sensitive botanical species is
verified.

32

13. When using tractors to remove felled trees, material will be skidded with one end suspended
wherever possible to minimize soil gouging and potential damage to potential unidentified
Sensitive botanical species.

Burning

14. Burning prescriptions will be developed to result in mortality of no more than 10% of
residual live trees 20 inches DBH or greater in late-seral habitats.

Serpentine Habitats and Species
15. Serpentine Habitat Type #1. Open areas with a high content of serpentinite and peridotite
minerology, sparsely vegetated with occasional shrubs and few or no conifers:
a. Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks,
routes, or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing, or road
construction through these sites. Previously constructed landing sites that are heavily
disturbed may be used after botanist approval.
b. No pile burning.
c. Hazard trees will be left in place after falling.
d. No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist.
16. Serpentine Habitat Type #2. Forest or shrubland habitats with widely spaced trees (30 trees
per acre or less). There may be scattered large conifers, as well as distinct clumps of small to
large shrubs; all of which may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees. Forest
or shrubland habitats with a moderate or high number of openings between trees. There may
be scattered clumps of large mature trees [Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, hardwoods], as well as
distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of which may have burned in concentrations
producing hazard trees.
a. Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks,
routes or roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road
construction through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed
may be used after botanist approval.
b. No pile burning.
c. Felled hazard trees will be left in place unless they can be removed from the site by full
suspension or endlined by equipment that remains on well-established existing roads.
d. No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist

Noxious Weeds/Non-native Invasive Species

17. All heavy equipment operating off roads will be cleaned and inspected before entering the
treatment area to be sure they are free of debris that could contain weed propagules.
18. No herbicides will be used to treat or manage any invasive plant species.
19. Invasive species in high priority weed sites within treatment areas that respond positively to
removal will be physically removed and disposed of off-site (if necessary to avoid leaving
plant parts that can regrow); removed plants with no propagative parts will be left on site.
High priority invasive species sites that cannot be treated effectively with manual removal
treatments (i.e. handpulling stimulates resprouting) will be flagged and vehicles and
equipment will be excluded from those sites to reduce chance of weed spread. Weed removal
in high priority weed sites will occur no more than 30 days before timber operations begin.
20. To discourage establishment of invasive weeds in selected disturbed areas within the
project area, native grass and forb seed and/or non-persistent cereal grains may be spread
where there is heavy soil disturbance. These areas include but are not limited to
temporary roads, landings, and main skid trails. Cereal grains will be restricted to annual

33

Final Environmental Impact Statement

“recleaned” varieties (have been processed to reduce weed seeds and other debris) that
are expected to disappear from sites within 3-5 years.
21. Grass and forb seed will be species that are known from the Klamath Ranges, preferably
species found on similar habitats on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Only seed that has been tested and meets California State standards for noxious weed
content and seed quality will be used. Species selection will ultimately depend on seed
availability, but under no circumstances will non-native perennial species be used. All
seeded areas will be mulched with weed-free straw or on-site organic materials.

greatest.

A distance equal to the height

height of 1 site potential tree
on each side of the channel
or edge of the wetland, or
150 feet on either side of the
channel or edge of the
wetland (300 feet total),
whichever is greatest.

23. Riparian Reserves along perennial flowing streams will be Equipment Exclusion Zones.
Trees within 150 feet of the stream will be felled towards the stream and left onsite. Trees
within the outer 150 feet of fish-bearing stream Riparian Reserves may be removed by
endlining to the road if more than 20 tons/acre of CWD occurs. In the outer 150 feet, 20
tons/acre of the largest CWD will be left. In Riparian Reserves where a road runs parallel to a
perennial stream and/or bisects the Riparian Reserve by winding in and out, trees uphill of the
road may be removed until 20 tons/acre of the largest CWD is left, even if the area uphill of
the road is closer to the stream than 150 feet. Equipment used to remove trees from the uphill
of the road will remain on the existing roadbed.
24. Riparian Reserves along intermittently flowing streams will be comprised of two zones: the
inner Equipment Exclusion Zone (EEZ) and the outer Riparian Reserve treatment zone.
When water is flowing within intermittent streams, the EEZ will be 100 feet on each side of
the channel. When the stream is not flowing, the EEZ will be 50 feet on each side of the
channel. All heavy equipment is excluded from EEZs, except at designated crossings.
25. All EEZs will be identified as "streamside buffer" on project maps.
26. Wetlands (including wet meadows, seeps, fens, and springs), stream inner gorges and
unstable and potentially unstable land features are also EEZs. Where stream inner gorges are
wider than the EEZ, the EEZ is extended to include the entire inner gorge plus the addition of
a 50-foot buffer beyond the inner gorge feature. Unstable and potentially unstable land
features (active landslides) are also protected by a 50 foot EEZ buffer.
27. Hand treatments are permissible in EEZs up to the high water mark; no green vegetation
would be treated. Hand treatments will have limited ground disturbance in the EEZ and will
not disturb riparian plant species such as big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix
spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) except for hazard tree abatement.

28. When snags are felled within the intermittent stream EEZ, they will be left unless there is a
site specific reason for removing them, such as desired coarse woody debris levels are met
and heavy fuel loading occurs (greater than 20 tons/acre), or the tree is within 200 feet
upstream of a culvert and threatens stability of road infrastructure. If heavy fuel loading
occurs, 20 tons/acre of the largest CWD will be left. In the stream channel, the small material
that can clog a culvert resulting from fallen trees within 200 feet upstream will be removed.
29. Riparian Reserves that are unmapped will be identified and protected, prior to and/or during
implementation, in accordance with appropriate protection measures (see Table 2-1). Upon
field review, if ephemeral streams show no sign of annual scour or deposition (i.e., upland
swales) they do not meet the Forest Plan definition of a seasonal or intermittent channel (they
are not Riparian Reserves).
30. Hand piling and pile burning will not occur within the EEZs.26 However fire may be allowed
to back into these areas, providing the fire spread will be controllable.

Landings, skid trails and crossings within Riparian Reserve

31. Existing landings within the Riparian Reserve can be reused; however, the area of disturbance
will not be increased and these features will be tilled27 and seeded28 following use where they
do not need to be retained as part of the road system.29 No new landings will be constructed
within the Riparian Reserve. No existing landings within EEZs will be used unless they are
connected to a system road.30
32. No full bench skid trails will be constructed within the Riparian Reserve.
33. Any designated intermittent and perennial stream equipment crossings (except National
Forest system roads) will be field reviewed and approved by an earth scientist, fish biologist,
botanist, or designee prior to use, and will avoid unstable areas. These features will be rocked
crossings designed to maintain fish passage on existing and potential fish-bearing streams.31
They will be reshaped and stabilized following use. If intermittent stream crossings are left in
place for wet weather operations, they will be removed during the following dry season.
34. During construction of temporary stream crossings disturbance to existing live vegetation will
be minimized to the maximum extent possible. When the crossing is rehabilitated, fill will be
pulled back from the crossing so that the original stream level is re-established when the
culvert is removed.

Water drafting

35. Water drafting will:
a. occur at existing sites with existing access;
b. minimize adverse effects on stream channel stability and instream flows needed to
maintain riparian resources;
c. minimize sedimentation;
d. minimize impacts to fish habitat;32 and

28 See specifications on tilling in the Soils/Hydrology Resource Protection Measure section below and specifications on
seeding in the Noxious Weed Resource Protection Measure section above.
29 Wide areas along roads used as landings are often also used as turn outs for vehicle traffic and are considered part of the
road system. Where these occur within Riparian Reserves, they will be retained.
30 Road pullouts are sometimes used as landings.

e. utilize a fish screen to prevent fish entrapment.
36. Water drafting sites that are not within habitat that is accessible to anadromous salmonids will
be identified first and will be given priority for use. When needed, water drafting may occur
in habitat accessible by anadromous salmonids. In all cases where water drafting occurs
within anadromous salmonid habitat,33 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s (NMFS)
Water Drafting Specifications34 will be adhered to. Any new drafting sites will be approved
by a Forest Service Fish Biologist and/or hydrologist prior to use. In addition, when drafting
water the following rules apply.35
a. Allow drafting from fish bearing streams only where immediate downstream discharge is
maintained at 1.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) or greater.
b. Allow drafting from ephemeral streams, intermittent streams, wetlands or constructed
ponds provided that sufficient water quantity and quality remains to support associated
wildlife species and riparian values.
c. Never allow drafting to remove more than 75 percent of constructed pond water.

Soils and Hydrology

37. Relevant BMPs have been identified for this project and are listed in Appendix C.
38. Retain downed logs in decay classes 3 and 436 (Maser and Trappe 1984) for soil fertility
purposes whenever possible.

Landings and skid trails

39. Mechanical skidding equipment is generally restricted to slopes less than 40 percent. On short
steep pitches (less than 45% slope, and less than 100 ft. in length), mechanical skidding
equipment is restricted to slash covered primary skid trails using flexible track skidders with
low ground pressure equipment.
40. Wet weather logging is permitted on soils with compaction hazard rating of moderate or less
with restrictions (see Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging
Equipment (Rust 2015) and Shasta-Trinity Wet Weather Soil Compaction Hazard Rating
(Rust 2008)).
41. Ground-based mechanical equipment will only operate on fine-textured soils (identified as
medium and heavy soils in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of
Logging Equipment (Rust 2015)) when the top 8 inches of soil are dry (identified as slightly
moist soils in the Field Guide), as evaluated by Forest soil scientist or designee. Areas along
roads proposed for treatments that have this soil type will be identified on a map for use by
the Timber Sale Administrator.

Refer to Figure 4 in the Fish Biological Assessment which illustrates the river or tributary reaches that are accessible to
anadromous fish and are therefore coho salmon Critical Habitat. They include the entire South Fork Trinity River, Hayfork
Creek and its tributaries, and approximately the lower mile of Butter Creek, lower 1.5 miles of Plummer Creek, and lower 2
miles of Rattlesnake Creek.

42. Post-treatment total soil cover should be between 50 and 70 percent averaged across the
activity area on metamorphics with at least 50 percent cover as fine organic matter (duff,
litter, plant leaves/needles, fine slash (<3 inch material), etc.). On granitics, soil cover should
be greater than 90 percent with at least 50 percent cover as fine organic matter. In some cases
in this project area, soil cover has been removed by high intensity fire conditions; in these
areas, soil cover will be retained to the extent practicable during implementation and in some
cases will be increased by treatments. Areas along roads proposed for treatments that have
this soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale Administrator.
43. In treatment areas susceptible to logging-based soil displacement37 (shallow granitic soils)
keep skidders (rubber tired or fixed track) on slopes less than 35%. Avoid displacing topsoil
(typically 2 to 4 inches) and exposing erosive subsoils on areas greater than 15 by 15 feet
outside of skid trails, unless mulched. Only operate on these soils when soil is no wetter than
the moist category identified in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability
of Logging Equipment (Rust, 2015) down to 8 inches. Areas along roads proposed for
treatments that have this soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale
Administrator.
44. All material will be skidded with one end suspended, where possible.
45. No skid trails will be built on active landslides or inner gorges, and no existing skid trails on
active landslides or inner gorges will be used.
46. Reuse existing primary skid trails and landings where available and practical to minimize soil
displacement and concentrated surface flow.
47. Skid trails will not run along the axis of intermittent channels or swales.

48. Till (subsoil to 18 inches) all landings identified for rehabilitation, temporary roads, and main
skid trails (up to 200 feet entering landings) that have fine textured soils with a wingedsubsoiler following completion of all management activities. Tilling will be completed
outside of the tree drip-line so as not to impact root systems. For rocky soil, scarification38
will be used to restore sites. These areas should be mulched (weed free straw, wood chips or
on-site organic material) at a rate of 1.5 to 2 tons per acre (approximately 4 to 6 inches in
depth) over a minimum of 75 percent of the exposed soils, where necessary to prevent
erosion.

49. Minimize soil erosion by water-barring skid trails. Install waterbars on contour at major
breaks in slope along the skid trails.
50. New landings will be located on gentle slopes (<20%) to minimize earthwork, and will avoid
unstable areas, steep slopes below landslide benches, and slope positions where they could
deliver sediment to streams. Cuts and fills would not exceed 5 feet in height, unless field
reviewed and approved by an earth scientist beforehand.
51. Pull organic materials out of fill slope of landings to prevent collapse.
52. Landings will have natural, non-constructed designs. If non-constructed design is not
feasible, landings will be constructed to adequately drain through crowned surface and
directed drainage with catchment structures (rock armoring and/or silt fences with straw bales
may be used as necessary). All new landing fill slopes and access road fill slopes (>100 sq.
ft.) would be mulched initially, and then the mulch would be maintained throughout the life

of the project; mulch may be weed-free straw, or landing slash. Areas with new road and
landing fill will be rehabilitated (tilled and mulched) after treatments are complete.
53. New landings will occur in areas that are generally open or fire deforested, whenever
possible.

General road measures

54. Roads rutted by operations will be spot rocked or otherwise suitably repaired. Drainage
structures will be protected or repaired as necessary. Road surfaces expected to be used
during wet weather, in areas crossing serpentine soils, will be rocked to prevent roadbed
deformation (rutting) during wet conditions as necessary.

55. Dispose of unsuitable slide and excess fill in stable, non-floodplain sites. Fill material will be
inspected by a botanist, weed specialist, or designee prior to moving for presence of noxious
weeds. If noxious weeds are present, they will be treated prior to moving the fill, and the
disposal site will be monitored in the future and treated as necessary.

Fuel Treatment Operations

56. Fuel reduction activities (machine piling using brush rakes or grapple heads) will retain >50
percent of the existing surface duff (Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards), where it currently
exists.

57. For machine piling on fine textured soils, weight restrictions will be set 6.0 PSI ground
pressure or less and operate on dry39 soils less than 40 percent slope.
58. Excess activity-created slash and existing surface fuels (where they exceed 16 inches in depth
and/or are greater than 10 tons per acre) may be machine- or hand-piled, or masticated on
slopes less than 40 percent and hand piled on slopes greater than 40 percent.
59. Ground-based mastication operations on fine-textured soils (clay loams, clays, silty clay
loams) should comply with the following restrictions:
a. Operate with low ground pressure equipment (less than 6 PSI) on slopes less than 40%
when soil moisture is no wetter than the moist category on medium soils and slightly
moist category on heavy soils to 8 inches in depth as identified in the Field Guide to Soil
Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust, 2015; evaluated by
Forest soil scientist or designee).
b. Drive over masticated material to form a cushion to reduce displacement and compaction.
c. For equipment with ground pressure over 6 PSI, operations on slopes less than 40% will
be conducted when the soils are no wetter than the slightly moist category for medium
and the dry category for heavy soils down to 8 inches as identified in the Field Guide to
Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust, 2015).
60. All machine piles shall be reasonably compact (averaging 10 feet high by 10 feet wide in
size) and free of soil to facilitate burning and shall be constructed of such size and at such
distance from green trees so that burning shall not result in unnecessary damage to residual
timber.
61. Outside of landings or roads, machine piling will not be utilized to reduce fuel within the
Hyampom and Sulphur Glade sixth-field (HUC6) subwatersheds.
62. Within the Hyampom and Sulphur Glade sixth-field (HUC 6) subwatersheds, salvage
removal will not be prescribed in areas that burned at very low to low severity.

63. Hand piles will be placed in a dispersed pattern (i.e., not stacked above one another),
averaging 6 foot high by 6 foot wide in size.
64. Fuel loading will be reduced to an average of 20 tons/acre in the Limited Roaded Recreation
prescription, consistent with the Forest Plan (page 4-47).

Naturally Occurring Asbestos

65. Mechanical operations in ultramafic soils should operate on slightly moist or moist soils to
reduce dust levels that could contain naturally occurring asbestos (NOA).
66. All field personnel who will be working near earth-moving, or other dust-producing activities
in areas underlain by ultramafic rock will be informed that NOA commonly occurs in that
rock, and they will be provided with a map showing such areas.
67. Dust production will be prevented/minimized by applying effective dust abatement measures,
such as applying water or other dust inhibitors to materials being worked; operating when soil
conditions are moist enough to limit dust, but not be so wet as to result in rutting or
sedimentation into streams; reducing vehicle speed; and avoiding dust-producing activities on
excessively windy days. Ensure road surfaces are wet. Where needed, wet road surfaces with
water trucks using sprinklers to reduce dust.

68. Where dust prevention in ultramafic areas is not possible, appropriate protection and
mitigation measures will be applied so that Forest Service and contractor field personnel will
not inhale such dust. These include closing windows on vehicles and turning on positive
ventilation systems, or use of appropriate air filtration masks if other measures are not
adequate.
69. If rock/soil waste is generated from ultramafic areas, such waste will be disposed of only
where the underlying rock is also ultramafic, and it will not be mixed with other waste from
non-ultramafic areas. When transporting NOA-containing material, avoid overloading trucks
and cover with tarps to reduce dust. Ensure that piles of excavated material are wet and cover
with tarps to reduce dust.

Air Quality

Prescribed burning will be implemented in accordance with California smoke management and
prescribed burning guideline40 (17 CCR § 80145).
70. A Smoke Management Plan will be completed and submitted to the appropriate Air Quality
Management District for approval prior to implementing any prescribed fire.
71. Use of prescribed fire will comply with Forest Service, California Air Resources Board and
North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District guidelines.
72. To mitigate the potential for significant impacts and nonconformity, the Forest will coordinate
prescribed fire in the airsheds to distribute the burn days appropriately throughout the year.
Activity fuel handpiles will be constructed on average 6 feet high by 6 feet wide. Activity fuel
machine piles will be constructed on average 10 feet high by 10 feet wide. The coordination
will include communication with the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District
(AQMD), personnel for adequate burn days, based on current air quality within the basin and
weather conditions. The South Fork and Trinity River Management Units will develop a plan
that meets the objectives of the management unit and maintain conformity with the State
Implementation Plans (SIP) and Clean Air Act (CAA).
73. Monitor smoke transport and dispersion during prescribed fire.

Cultural Resources

74. All archeological sites shall be clearly delineated prior to implementing any associated
activities that have the potential to affect historic properties. Historic property boundaries shall
be delineated with coded flagging and/or other effective marking.
75. If mechanical equipment is used in treatment buffers, all recorded cultural and archaeological
resources will be flagged and avoided following the site protective guidelines in the Region 5
Section 106 Programmatic Agreement. However, vegetation within these sites can be removed
using tools such as hand tools, a grapple, or a rubber tired skidder so long as ground
disturbance is minimized and features avoided. Treatments within individual cultural and
archeological sites must be approved and monitored by a Forest Service archeologist.
76. Woody material may be chipped within the boundaries of historic properties so long as the
staging of chipping equipment on-site does not affect historic properties and staging areas are
specifically approved by the Heritage Program Manager (HPM) or qualified Heritage Program
staff.
77. Monitoring by heritage program specialists may be used to enhance the effectiveness of
protection measures.
78. The recorded historic properties will be noted in the contract as controlled areas to be avoided.
Contract administrators will insure these protective measures are followed.
79. If new cultural resources are discovered, all work in the vicinity will cease until qualified
Heritage Program staff examines and assesses the resource. Appropriate measures will be
undertaken to protect the new resource as activities resume.

Pathology

80. To prevent the spread of Annosus root disease (also known as Heterobasidion root disease) in
areas where the disease has been documented, all freshly cut living or recently killed conifer
stumps greater than 14-inches (stump diameter) will be treated with an EPA-registered borate
compound (e.g. Sporax® or Cellu-Treat®) within 24 hours after the tree is cut. Whenever
possible, stumps will be treated immediately after cutting. Application will follow label
instructions and will comply with state and federal requirements.
81. Do not apply borate directly to water, or to areas where surface water is present. Do not
contaminate water when disposing of equipment washwaters or rinsate.

General Protection Measures

82. Forest Earth Scientists, contract administrators, and Engineers would maintain contact after
the contract is finalized so that final locations of landings and temporary roads could be
evaluated in the field if necessary. Coordination would also be established between the earth
science and the fuels program concerning burning activities. The project geologist would be
available for consultation during implementation.

83. Implementation shall not unnecessarily damage young growth or other residual live trees.
84. Felling and bucking shall be done to minimize breakage of logs removed during the
commercial operations.

CHAPTER 3 – AFFECTED ENVIRONMENT AND
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES
This Chapter describes aspects of the environment likely to be affected by the proposed action and
alternatives. Also described are the environmental effects (direct, indirect, and cumulative) that would
result from undertaking the proposed action or alternative. Together, these descriptions form the
scientific and analytical basis for the comparison of effects in Chapter 2.

Past, Present, and Reasonably Foreseeable Future
Actions ____________________________________
According to the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations, “cumulative impact” is
the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or
non-Federal) or person undertakes such actions (40 CFR §1508.7-Terminology and Index,
Cumulative Impact). In determining cumulative effects, the effects of the past, present and future
actions (Appendix G) were added to the direct and indirect effects of the proposed action and
alternatives. Due to the nature of variability between resource types, analysis areas may differ
between resources. Analysis boundings for both time and space are described below by resource. The
rationale for these boundings is also included. Appendix G lists projects considered for cumulative
effects are comprehensive for each fire area, but not all of these projects may be included in the
cumulative effects analysis for each resource. The acres listed in the table in Appendix G-Cumulative
Effects Table are acres affected by the fire for each project listed. For reference Table 1-1 shows a list
of the fires and Figure 1-1 shows a map of the fires (both can be found in Chapter 1).

Cumulative Effects Spatial and Temporal Boundaries by
Resource
As each resource is unique, the spatial and temporal extent of the cumulative effects analysis will
vary with each resource. This sections summarizes the boundaries for each resource. For full
descriptions of the effects (cumulative, direct, and indirect) to each resource and/or species, please
refer to the resources sections later in this chapter.
The cumulative effects analysis does not attempt to quantify effects of past human actions that may
have impacted individuals or suitable habitat of sensitive species. Rather, in accordance with the
Council of Environmental Quality (2005), past actions and their effects are reflected in the existing
condition and baseline habitat for each species. Existing conditions reflect the aggregate impact of
prior human actions combined with natural events and conditions. Existing condition and baseline
habitat thus provides the setting within which the proposed action and other reasonably foreseeable
actions potentially join to produce cumulative effects.

Fuels
Spatial Boundaries

The cumulative effects boundary for the fire and fuels analysis is the treatment boundary. Analysis for
this project is done on an individual treatment unit basis, however, when treatments are concentrated
in an area there are additive effects. Treated areas in this project along with past, present and
reasonably foreseeable projects in the vicinity of the project area will be analyzed.
45

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Temporal Boundaries

The fuels cumulative effects analysis covers 20 years, regardless of the alternative. From a fuels
perspective, the number of stand structure possibilities would be difficult if not impossible to quantify
with any type of certainty beyond 20 years. Project implementation is anticipated to take about 5
years, however, fire damage and additional insect damaged trees will continue to die off over time
and additional work would need to be done to mitigate new hazards.

Vegetation
Spatial Boundaries

The cumulative effects for this analysis are bounded by the 163,000-acre fire footprint areas, including
the footprint of all lands (National Forest System and private lands) that burned on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest in summer of 2015, as that is the only area where forest structure would be altered.

Temporal Boundaries

The time period used to analyze cumulative effects regarding forest structure is ten years, as it is
estimated to take this long for vegetation to begin to recover and most trees to fail. In addition, it is
assumed that trees will continue to die (secondary mortality) from factors related to the fires for up to
8 years, depending on species.

Wildlife
Northern Spotted Owl

Relative to the NSO, the action area includes any area within 1.3 miles of a treatment area (the radius
of a typical NSO home range).
Temporal Boundaries
As the project is expected to take up to 20 years to implement all activities, the temporal bounding for
private actions that could contribute to cumulative effects, known at the time of this analysis, is 20
years. Long-term bounding of the effects of this project is defined by the time needed for affected
habitats to recover their pre-project functionality. This bounding encompasses the time needed for
substantial re-establishment of key habitat components such as large woody debris and canopy cover.
The estimated time for this to occur, relative to the habitat needs of the species addressed in this
analysis, is approximately 40 years beyond project implementation.
A time frame of 40 years beyond project implementation (which is expected to take up to 20 years) is
used for this cumulative effects analysis (see the BA for more details). The effects of past actions are
reflected in the description of currently existing conditions in the wildlife BA.

Survey and Manage Species
Spatial Boundaries
To encompass potentially affected individuals of the species analyzed in this report, this analysis is
bounded in space to include any area within 375 feet of all treatment areas for Helminthoglypta
talmadgei and Vespericola pressleyi.
Temporal Boundaries
The analysis for the survey and manage species is bounded in time to include the time needed for
substantial re-establishment of key habitat components such as large woody debris and canopy cover.
The estimated time for habitat recovery to occur, relative to the habitat needs of the species addressed
in this analysis, is approximately 40 years beyond project implementation, which is expected to take
up to 20 years. These bounding parameters are based on species information on H. talmadgei and V.
pressleyi in Duncan and others (1999). Reasonably foreseeable future actions are described in the
Cumulative Effects Table found in Appendix G-Cumulative Effects Table. Past effects are assumed to
46

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

be expressed within the current habitat conditions shown in the analysis, including the effects of the
2015 wildfires.

Sensitive Wildlife Species
Temporal bounding used for all species:
Long-term bounding of the effects of this project is defined by the time needed for affected habitats to
recover their pre-project functionality. This bounding encompasses the time needed for substantial reestablishment of key habitat components such as large woody debris and canopy cover. The estimated
time for this to occur, relative to the habitat needs of the species addressed in this analysis, is
approximately 40 years beyond project implementation.
Spatial Bounds by Species:
Northern goshawks:
The cumulative effects analysis area for this report consists of all lands within 1.3 miles of proposed
treatment areas. This bounding is appropriate because it is likely to encompass the typical home range
of goshawks in this region, based on data in the literature cited above for this species. Data on habitat
conditions are not available for private lands outside the proposed treatment areas. So for the purpose
of this analysis, private lands are assumed to be potentially suitable for goshawks.
Willow flycatchers:
Characteristics of suitable habitat cited in the scientific literature cited in the analysis were combined
with spatial data in Forest vegetative databases to estimate stream miles of potentially suitable habitat
within the proposed treatment areas. A buffer width of 50 feet on each side of the stream defines the
analysis area for this species in this report. This area is appropriate because it encompasses the typical
likely extent of suitable habitat conditions for this species along the streams in the project area. Data
on the prevalence of willow thickets and other suitable habitats for this species are lacking, so for the
purpose of this analysis, all lands within the analysis area defined above are considered potentially
suitable for this species.
Bald eagles:
On the Forest, bald eagles typically utilize large trees protected from disturbance for nesting, and late
successional and old growth forests close to large rivers or lakes for winter roosting sites. Their
primary food source is fish, which are taken live or as carrion (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2013;
Anthony et al. 1992; USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1986). Many large conifers provide potential
nest sites on slopes overlooking Trinity Lake, Lewiston Lake, and the Trinity River. The known nests
in the vicinity of the project area are located along the Trinity River Main Stem and South Fork, and
Hayfork Creek, one of the South Fork’s major tributaries. The analysis area for this species includes
the major waterways listed above, as well as all other perennial streams in proposed treatment areas.
None of the projected post-fire salvage harvest on private lands occurs within 1,000 feet of the Trinity
River Main Stem or South Fork, or Hayfork Creek. Some of these harvests are within 1,000 feet of
smaller bodies of water, but bald eagles are much less likely to use these areas.
Pallid bats:
Keinath (2003) found that for insectivorous bats, “the concept of home range is not clearly applicable
to bat ecology, given the mobility of bats and the apparent plasticity of foraging areas with respect to
prey abundance.” As a proxy, the effects bounding used in this report for northern goshawks and
pacific fishers (1.3 mi. from potentially suitable habitats in proposed treatment units), both larger and
very mobile species, will be used here to conservatively estimate an appropriate scale on which to
assess potential effects to this species. This area is appropriate because the most critical features of
bat habitat, their day and night roosts and hibernacula, are primarily permanent on the landscape, and
47

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

this bounding is large enough to consider the short distances that bats likely typically travel between
roost, hibernation and foraging sites on a regular basis.
Townsend’s big-eared bats:
For the reasons listed above in the pallid bat analysis, the analysis area for this species is all lands
within 1.3 miles of potentially suitable habitats in proposed treatment units. Data on specific habitat
conditions for this species are not available, so for the purpose of this analysis, all lands in the
analysis area defined above are assumed to be potentially suitable for this species.
Fringed myotis bats:
For the reasons listed above in the pallid bat analysis, the analysis area for this species is all lands
within 1.3 miles of potentially suitable habitats in proposed treatment units. Data on specific habitat
conditions for this species are not available, so for the purpose of this analysis, all lands in the
analysis area defined above are assumed to be potentially suitable for this species.
Pacific martens:
Accounts of home range sizes in the scientific literature for this species vary widely (Stone 2010).
Home ranges in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in largely unlogged forest landscapes averaged 1.2–1.9
mi2 for males and 1.2–1.5 mi2 for females, and similar home range estimates were reported in coastal
areas of California and Oregon (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2015). Larger home ranges (>3.9
mi2) were recorded in intensively logged areas. The great majority of lands in the vicinity of proposed
treatments are Forest Service lands that are not being intensively logged. A conservative home range
size of 4 mi2 will be used in this report to define the analysis area for this species. The analysis area
equates to a buffer of approximately 1.1 mile around all proposed treatment units above 3,000 feet in
elevation. This area is appropriate because it encompasses the likely home ranges of martens that may
be affected by project activities, plus additional buffering to account for potentially larger home
ranges for martens with territories that include private lands where more intensive logging may be
occurring.
Fishers:
Accounts of home range sizes in the scientific literature for this species are highly variable (USDI
Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). Zielinski et al. (2004) found average home range size for female
fishers in northern California of 980.5 ha (2,422 ac), while males ranged over larger areas (9,722 ac).
High population levels of fishers in the vicinity of the project area indicate that this area supports
highly favorable habitat conditions (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2014). As a result, home ranges
in the project area are likely to be small compared to those reported in some other parts of this
species’ range. The analysis area for this species consists of all lands within 1.3 miles of the proposed
treatment units. This bounding is appropriate because it is likely to encompass the typical home range
of reproducing female fishers in this area.
Western pond turtles:
Characteristics of suitable habitat cited in the scientific literature cited above were combined with
spatial data in Forest vegetative databases to estimate potentially suitable aquatic habitats within the
proposed treatment areas. Waterways below 4,000 feet in elevation were identified as the likely extent
of western pond turtle activity in the project area, exclusive of nesting and hibernation sites. The
cumulative effects bounding for this species extends out 1,640 ft. from the aquatic areas described
above. This bounding is appropriate because it encompasses the aquatic habitats potentially suitable
for this species plus its potential nesting and upland hibernation sites.
Foothill yellow-legged frogs:
Characteristics of suitable habitat cited in the scientific literature cited above were combined with
spatial data in Forest vegetative databases to estimate stream miles of potentially suitable habitat
48

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

within the proposed treatment areas. A buffer width of 50 feet on each side of all streams below 4,000
feet in elevation was established as the likely extent of foothill yellow-legged frog distribution in the
project area, and defines the analysis area for this species in this report.
Cascades frogs:
Characteristics of suitable habitat cited in the scientific literature cited above were combined with
spatial data in Forest databases to estimate stream miles of potentially suitable habitat within the
proposed treatment areas. A buffer width of 50 feet on each side of all streams above 2,500 feet in
elevation was established as the maximum likely extent of potential Cascade frog distribution in the
project area, and defines the analysis area for this species in this report.
Southern torrent salamanders:
Characteristics of suitable habitat cited in the scientific literature cited above were combined with
spatial data in Forest databases to estimate stream miles of potentially suitable habitat within the
proposed treatment areas. A buffer width of 50 feet on each side of all streams above 2,500 feet in
elevation was established as the likely potential extent of southern torrent salamander distribution in
the project area, and defines the analysis area for this species in this report.
Western bumble bees:
Accounts of foraging ranges for bumblebees in the scientific literature vary widely (Greenleaf et al.
2007). The cumulative effects analysis area for this report consists of all lands within 1.3 miles of
proposed treatment areas. This bounding is appropriate because it is likely to encompass the typical
foraging range for this species, based on data in the literature cited above.
Big Bar [Pressley] Hesperian snails:
Characteristics of suitable habitat cited in the scientific literature cited above were combined with
spatial data in Forest databases to estimate stream miles of potentially suitable habitat within the
proposed treatment areas. A buffer width of 656 feet (200 m) on each side of all streams below 4,000
feet in elevation was established as the likely extent of potential habitats for this species in the project
area, and defines the analysis area for this species in this report.

Migratory Birds

There are no cumulative effects for Migratory Birds. Proposed treatments would contribute to a longterm revitalization of migratory bird habitat and a reduction in future fire hazard potential and will
have no meaningful influence on population trends of any species of migratory bird.

Wildlife Management Indicator Assemblages:

There is no change in the amount of any wildlife management indicator assemblage habitat from any
alternative (the project does not convert any acres from one assemblage to another), so there would
not be cumulative effects on any assemblage habitat.

Hydrology
Spatial Boundaries

The extent (geographic boundaries) of this analysis is each of the hydrologic units (HUC 5 through
HUC 8) in which treatments occur.

Temporal Boundaries

The duration of the analysis is from 2018 through 2022 for the following reasons. First, it is assumed
that that all of the effects will occur in the first year of implementation since an implementation
schedule is not available. Second, the potential for indirect effects is reduced over time and is often
not evident within 5 years after project implementation. Third, there are no foreseeable future projects
beyond 2019. Finally, although a watershed may take more than 5 years to recover from cumulative
49

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

effects, it is expected that significant long term, potentially chronic effects, will be present only in
watersheds over TOC (Table 16 of the Physical Sciences Report).

Fish
Spatial Boundaries

The Action Area is the 5th-field subwatersheds of the South Fork Trinity River, Trinity River, and
their 7th-field drainages that provide habitat for Coho salmon, Chinook salmon, resident rainbow
trout, and Pacific Lamprey that were affected by the 2015 fires and have proposed activities (Maps in
Appendix A of the Project Fish Report). Upstream extent of the Action Area is defined as Upper
Browns Creek in the Trinity River, Farley Creek in the South Fork Trinity River, and Barron Creek in
the New River. Downstream the Action Area extends to the confluence of the Trinity and South Fork
Trinity Rivers.

Temporal Boundaries

The temporal bounding of the analysis includes short-term effects (during implementation or within
one year of implementation) and long-term effect (chronic effect that persists longer than one year
after implementation).

Geology
Spatial Boundaries

The geographic project area is the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route
Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire burn boundaries. The cumulative effects boundary for this
analysis is the project boundary. Treated areas in this project along with past, present and reasonably
foreseeable future projects within the cumulative effects area were be analyzed for cumulative effects.

Temporal Boundaries

For the purpose of the vegetation, fire, and fuels analysis, the temporal bounds include a 20-year
horizon for future direct, indirect, and cumulative effects because modeling indicates that within 20
years, fuels profiles change dramatically after fire. Also, any predictions past 20 years will be greater
than the fire return intervals for much of the project area.

Soils
Spatial Boundaries

The extent (geographic boundaries) of this soils analysis is the project bounding area of the Proposed
Action and each of the alternatives. Soil Quality Standards only apply to the affected soils in regards
to erosion, compaction, and fertility within the project area.

Temporal Boundaries

The duration of the soils analysis is fifteen years from the time of implementation. Typical erosion
recovery rates for soils with 50 to 70% cover is three to five years for areas of very low to low soil
burn severity, and ten to fifteen years for areas of moderate to high soil burn severity (as determined
from the Universal Soil Loss Equation).” DEIS p. 205

Botany
Spatial Boundary

Spatial bounding for Niles’ harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort would be the
boundary of the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane., the 375,000 acre geologic area that bisects the project
area and contains large areas of serpentine soils and endemic plant species. Niles’ and Stebbins’
harmonia and Peanut sandwort grow only within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and this is the only
meaningful spatial area boundary for cumulative impacts.
50

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The spatial area for Umpqua green gentian is South Fork Mountain from Bennett Peak south to the
Yolla Bolly Wilderness and from the ridgeline to approximately 1 mile east. This is approximately the
extent of the soil types the species grows on (entisols, inceptisols).
The spatial area for the other twelve species would be the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Wherever
possible the spatial area is reduced to just the west side of the Forest, the Trinity River and South Fork
Management Units. The entire range of these species extends beyond the Forest, but is capped at the
west side to be a meaningful area of cumulative impacts analysis.

Temporal Boundary

Cumulative effects are bounded in time by the extent of documented ground-disturbing actions we are
aware of in the past, 1900 and later, and planned actions that have been formally published into the
future, 20 years or less. Actions considered are those that are thought to have an adverse impact on
the Sensitive plant species in this analysis or habitat for those species. Those actions can occur on
Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands and on adjacent lands under other ownership or management.
Consideration of present and future actions is limited to those being implemented currently and those
in planning stages that have been publicly scoped in the most current Schedule of Proposed Action
(July-Sept, 2017).

Air Quality

Additional projects within and adjacent to the project area utilizing prescribed burning include USFS
and private timberlands. The USFS projects include The Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire,
Sims Fire Restoration, Mud Springs, Westside Plantation Thin, and South Fuelbreak. Private
timberlands burn biomass piles for prepping their land for planting and to remove non-merchantable
material on landings. California’s Smoke Management Program (Title 17) is designed to prevent
cumulative effects from prescribed fire operations. The program provides allocations of emissions
based on the airshed capacity and forecasted dispersal characteristics. The allocation process
considers all burn requests, meteorological conditions, forecasted air pollution levels (similar to the
BSMPs described by the NRCS 2011) and uncontrollable events like wildfire. Wildfire emissions can
overwhelm air basins and most prescribed burn requests are denied during wildfire events. As a result
of the California Smoke Management Program and agency oversight, none of the action alternatives
are expected to contribute toward significant air quality effects, in other words, there are expected to
be no cumulative effects to air quality as a result of this project.

Affected Resources Analyses _________________

Methodology
Fire and Fuels Indicators


Flame Length: The length of flame measured in feet. Increased flame lengths reduces fire
suppression strategies and effectiveness and increases the likelihood of torching events and
crown fires.



Fireline Intensity: The rate of energy or heat release per unit length of fire front (British
Thermal Units (BTU) per foot per second). Increased fireline intensity reduces fire
suppression strategies and effectiveness.



Suppression Action: The type of suppression resource needed to contain the fire and its
effectiveness.

These are appropriate indicators for this analysis because they give information about potential fire
behavior. Risks to firefighters, workers, and the public can be assessed from potential fire behavior.
Increased flame lengths can increase the likelihood of torching events and crown fires. Flame length
is influenced in part by fuel type, fuel arrangement, fuel moisture, and weather conditions. Flame
length and fireline intensity influence production rates, or how fast firelines can be constructed by
different suppression resources, including hand crews and mechanical equipment. Flame lengths over
4 feet, or fireline intensities over 100 BTU per foot per second, may present control problems. These
conditions are too dangerous to be directly contained by hand crews (Schlobohm and Brain 2002;
Andrews and Rothermel 1982). Flame lengths over 8 feet or fireline intensities over 500 BTU per
foot per second are generally not controllable by ground-based equipment or aerial retardant, and
present control problems including torching, crowning, and spotting. Flame length and fireline
intensity directly affect suppression tactics. Table 3-1 outlines how flame lengths and fireline
intensities influence fire suppression actions (Andrews et al. 2011).

Fires can generally be attacked at the head or flanks by
persons using hand tools. Hand line should hold the fire.
Fires are too intense for direct attack on the head by
persons using hand tools. Hand line cannot be relied on to
hold the fire. Equipment such as dozers, pumpers, and
retardant aircraft can be effective.
Fires may present serious control problems—torching,
crowning, and spotting. Control efforts at the fire head will
probably be ineffective
Crowning, spotting, and major fire runs are probable.
Control efforts at head of fire are ineffective.

Fire Behavior Analysis Methodology

Fuels profiles (i.e. the vertical cross section of a fuel bed down to mineral earth showing fuel types,
size and amount) were gathered and analyzed using 43 representative 1/50th acre random plots
throughout the project area. The data was used to compare current fuel loading to projected future
conditions. Fuels data plots are in the project record. The amount of dead and down woody debris
accumulating on the surface of a given area and what is created by hazard tree abatement is quantified
as tons per acre and diameter size class to determine values for resource needs and fire behavior.

Analysis for fire behavior was calculated using the 90th percentile fire weather factors from Mt.
Elizabeth Weather Station during 1978-2009 (4933’ elevation; May 1-Oct 31). Future predicted fuel
models will also be utilized.
Fire effects analysis used flame length and fireline intensity. Flame lengths and fireline intensities
were based on fuel models under the 90th percentile weather conditions. Dead and live fuels, used in
fuel models, are described by size. For example 1-hour fuels are fine, flashy fuels smaller than 0.25
inches in diameter, 10-hour fuels are 0.25 to 1 inch in diameter, 100-hour fuels are 1 to 3 inches in
diameter, and 1000-hour fuels are often termed coarse woody debris and are greater than 3 inches in
diameter41. Fuel models are described by the volume of 1-hour, 10-hour, 100-hour, and 1000-hour
dead fuels; herbaceous and woody live fuels; fuel bed depth; and moisture of extinction42. Coarse
woody debris (CWD) is 1,000 hour dead fuel, with a minimum diameter (or an equivalent cross
section) of 3 inches at the widest point and includes sound and rotting logs, standing snags, stumps,
and large branches (located above the soil) (Enrong et al. 2006). Fuel conditions resulting from
implementation of each of the alternatives would have associated effects on fire behavior.

FlamMap (Finney 2006) is designed to examine the spatial variability in fire behavior assuming that
fuel moisture, wind speed and wind direction are held constant in time, thereby allowing for more
direct comparison of fuel treatment effects. FlamMap’s features allow the user to easily characterize
potential fire behavior, as well as analyze fire movement and fuel treatment interactions. The fuel
models that are used in this analysis are from publication RMRS-GTR-153 (RMRS GTR 153 2005).
The fuel models that were used are estimates of what the fuel loading and fire behavior currently are
and what is predicted in the future allowing for vegetation regrowth and the falling of dead trees. Fuel
models were assigned based on remote sensing, field review of existing conditions, and observations
of the effects of past fires on fuel model change within the South Fork and Trinity River management
units.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Fire behavior modeling uses three primary input variables (fuels, topography, and weather) to
calculate fire behavior. Because fuels are the primary variable that management activity can influence
it is the variable for this analysis.
For modeling purposes the fire weather adjective defined as High (90th percentile weather) was used
to predict fire behavior in the analysis area. Remote Automated Weather Stations (RAWS) were used
to collect 90th percentile weather data. Due to the fact that RAWS sites in the area have a difficult
time modeling herbaceous and live woody fuels, physical samples of woody fuel moisture samples
have been taken by local fire personnel at 3 sampling sites on the Forest each field season (MayNovember) beginning in 2007: one on the South Fork Management Unit, and two on the Trinity River
Management Unit.

Affected Environment

The frequency of low-intensity fires has decreased throughout the west, including portions of the fire
area, leaving fuel levels in excess of those that occurred in pre-European times. The accumulation of
this woody material may increase the likelihood of severe stand replacing wildfires. Over time, fuels
buildups continue and become more continuous in distribution. There is a positive relationship found
between fuel loading and fire severity (Schoennagel et al., 2004), and the reduction of both coarse
fuels and fine fuels has been found to reduce fire severity during re-burn (Fraver et al. 2011). As a
consequence, high-severity fires result in generally greater changes in plant compositions and
structure than would occur if the communities had been subjected to more frequent low-intensity fires
(DeBano et al. 1998). Uncharacteristically high fuel levels create the potential for fires that are
uncharacteristically intense (Franklin and Agee 2003).

Pre-fire Conditions

As with many areas in the Klamath Mountain Ecoregion, the landscape through which the Fork
Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire
burned has been heavily influenced over the last 150 years by past management activities as well as
natural occurrences, including: mining, grazing, timber harvesting, fire exclusion, and large highseverity fires (Figure 3- 1. Fire History Map.). At the stand level, the combination of past
management activities, fire exclusion, and drought related mortality has created relatively
homogeneous areas typified by small trees existing at high densities (Frost and Sweeney 2000). High
fuel loads were created by overstocked stands with high accumulations of ladder fuels and canopy
fuels (Skinner 1995).

Characteristic Fire Regimes

Forests are characterized by distinct wildfire patterns, defined as fire regimes. Fire regimes are the
combination of fire frequency, predictability, intensity, seasonality, and extent characteristic of fire in
a particular ecosystem (Barrett et al. 2010, Sugihara et al. 2006). The common fire regimes found
within the project area are listed below:
I.

II.

199,917 acres are classified as fire regime I. 0 to 35-year frequency and low (surface fires
most common) to mixed severity (less than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation
replaced);
500 acres are classified as fire regime II. 0 to 35-year frequency and high (stand replacement)
severity (greater than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation replaced);

III.

13,803 acres are classified as fire regime III. 35 to 100 plus year frequency and mixed
severity (less than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation replaced);

IV.

2,914 acres are classified as fire regime IV. 35 to 100 plus year frequency and high (stand
replacement) severity (greater than 75 percent of the dominant overstory vegetation
replaced); and,

56

Final Environmental Impact Statement

V.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

422 acres are classified as fire regime V. 200 plus year frequency and high (stand
replacement) severity.

Fires in Klamath Mountain ecosystems historically burned at moderate to high frequencies with low
to moderate severities (Frost and Sweeney 2000; Skinner et al., 2006; Mallek et al. 2013). During the
wildfires of 2015 all fire regimes burned within their range of severities but the scale of these fires
were larger. Also, since many portions of the fire had far exceeded their fire return interval, post fire
conditions can be expected to still be outside the historic fire return interval.

Post-Fire Conditions

Recently burned forests can have dense patches of snags, abundant downed logs, montane chaparral
patches, and highly variable natural conifer regeneration (Swanson et al. 2010). In the first couple of
years post-fire, the area is expected to have low fire behavior due to the lack of available ground fuels
to support fire. Within 8 to 12 years, fire-killed vegetation will decay and fall, creating excessive
quantities of CWD (Russell et al. 2006, Peterson et al. 2015). Live vegetation would continue to grow
as well, adding to the fuel loading. This type of fuel loading is modeled as a slash-blowdown fuel
type. The rate of accumulation would eventually slow down but the fire behavior would continue to
increase as new live vegetation moves into the area and existing live vegetation sheds needles, leaves,
limbs, and branch wood adding to the total fuel loading. During potential future fire activity, live
vegetation is dried by the fire, making live vegetation available as fuel and further increasing fire
behavior. The dead material from the previous fire along with the live vegetation, brush and
hardwoods growing back on site would create a fuel bed that will support high fire intensities and
flame lengths. Future fire would be expected to burn with high intensities impacting resources and
killing most vegetation. Fire behavior would exceed firefighter direct attack capabilities within a few
years and suppression efforts would have to use indirect tactics.

Fire Severity

Fire severity is defined as the effect of fire on an ecosystem (Agee, 1993; Sugihara et al., 2006).
Often severity is mapped in broad categories such as low, moderate and high representing the sum of
effects in all structural strata in the ecosystem (DeBano et al., 1998). For a forested system those
strata could include soil, surface fuels, herbaceous layer, understory shrubs, intermediate trees, and
dominant and co-dominant trees (Miller and Thode 2007). Table 3-3 and Figure 3- 2 show the Fork
Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire

Fires are generally nonlethal to the dominant vegetation and do not substantially
change the structure of the dominant vegetation. Approximately 80 percent or more
of the aboveground dominant vegetation survives fires.
Severity of fire either causes selective mortality in dominant vegetation, depending
on different tree species’ susceptibility to fire, or varies between understory and
stand-replacement.
Fires kill aboveground parts of the dominant vegetation, changing the aboveground
structure substantially.
Approximately 80 percent or more of the aboveground dominant vegetation is either
consumed or dies as a result of fires.

Following large fires such as those experienced in the summer of 2015, variable severity patterns
leave behind different densities of fire killed trees. As these snags fall, they contribute to elevated
surface fuels (McIver and Ottmar 2007). As a result, areas that burn at moderate to high severity in
one fire are vulnerable to future high severity fires during a reburn event (when one fire burns inside
the perimeter of a previous fire) (Ritchie et al. 2013). This vulnerability is directly correlated to
remaining stand density of fire killed trees, tree species, time since fire, and postfire events on the
landscape (Peterson et al. 2009, Ritchie et al. 2013).
Within the project area in the mixed and high severity portions of the fire there is high tree mortality.
Overtime these snags will fall and increase CWD. High levels of continuous CWD may result in a
fire with high intensity that covers a large area. A fire of this magnitude could result in damage to
homes and property, as well as resource damage, and is costly to suppress (Long et al. 2014). In
addition, fire suppression actions could be hindered by the fire effects associated with a high loading
of CWD (Brown et al. 2003) by slowing fireline production rates and limiting suppression resources
to indirect attack with heavy equipment (Andrews et al. 2011).

The literature concerned with postfire landscapes was synthesized recently in Long et al. (2014).
Generally, there is growing concern for areas that reburn in previously large patches of moderate to
high severity fire for both areas left untreated and areas treated with postfire logging and no postharvest fuels reduction treatments (Long et al. 2014). Studies at a productive site in Oregon
indicated that areas burned at high severity in one fire led to a condition dominated by an early seral
condition characterized by shrubs and tree regeneration. These areas had a tendency to burn at high
severity in subsequent fires (Thompson and Spies 2010). As in many studies that are retrospective,
little knowledge of the first pre-fire area was available and most areas that were considered were
salvaged with no post-harvest fuels treatments.
38T

38T

Van Wagtendonk et al. (2012) found that post-wildfire fuel loading influences fire intensity and places
fire fighter safety at risk by greatly increasing a fire’s resistance to control. Resistance to control, also
called difficulty of control, is the relative difficulty of constructing and holding a control line as
affected by resistance to line construction and fire behavior; also called difficulty of control. For
example, the 2009 Big Meadows Fire escaped control lines as the fire spotted into natural
regeneration and heavy fuels from the 1990 Arch Rock Fire. Snag to snag spotting, well ahead of the
main fire, also occurred, carrying fire well outside the ability of firefighters to control. Heavy fuel
loading and snags were identified in the fire review as a main contributor to fire intensity and spread.
Harrington (1982) and Brown (2003) found that fire-killed trees contribute to extreme fire behavior
through production of large amounts of heat energy, which increases extreme fire behavior such as
torching, crowning and spotting potential. Fire consumption of these larger fuels increases as
decomposition progresses (Knapp et al. 2005, Uzoh and Skinner 2009). Also, once snags and downed
logs start to rot, this wood is frequently a source of embers and receptive to embers, especially when
dry, leading to fire spread through spotting (Harrington 1982; Brown 2003; Estes et al. 2012).
The increased risk of high severity fire in areas that burned at high and moderate severity previously
is due primarily to 1) increased fire residence time as heavy fuels have high heat content and burn
longer and heat deeper into the soil and 2) reduced fire suppression options due to the heavy fuels and
hazard to firefighters from large standing dead trees and logs.
Salvage harvest alone does not significantly reduce fire behavior (Donato et al. 2006). Post-harvest
fuels reduction treatments reduce surface fuels and thus, fire spread and flame lengths. Salvage
harvesting with post-harvest fuels reduction in combination have the greatest effect on reducing fire
behavior. The reduction in fire behavior increases fire fighter and public safety, increases fire
suppression options during wildfire events, and creates safer ingress and egress routes. This project
models fire behavior using flame length and fireline intensity under different treatment types. That
data then can be interpreted to determine potential suppression tactics. The removal of fire dead and
dying trees too include post-harvest fuels treatments will decrease flame lengths and fireline
intensities.
The risk of the high severity patches in the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex,
Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire reburning as high severity patches in future fires is
real and significant. The 2015 wildfires reburned over a total of 24 wildfires. One example of higher
severity reburn in the project area is the Saddle fire. Portions of the Saddle fire burned into the Sims
Fire, in these areas of overlap the saddle fire burned at higher severities than outside the Sims fire
footprint. Other recent examples of reburns in northern California include the 2012 Chips Fire that
reburned the 2000 Storrie Fire on the Lassen and Plumas National Forests. Figures 4 and 5 show
examples of a burned and reburned area on the Chips Fire.
Some lessons may be learned by looking at the overlap between the 2000 Storrie Fire and the 2012
Chips Fire. Following the Storrie Fire, there was some hazard tree removal. There was no salvage
logging or fuels treatment on the remainder of the area. Even though the two fires were only 12 years
apart, the proportion of high severity within this overlap was still relatively high at 32 percent. In part,
some of the high reburn severity in Chips may be a result of the large accumulation of surface fuels
61

and woody debris that resulted from the Storrie fire. Figure 3- 3 shows an area that burned at high
severity in the Storrie Fire after 12 years; this area was not salvage logged or otherwise treated to
reduce fuels post fire. Fuel loads were represented by high snag densities, thick shrubs as high as 5
feet tall, and a complex arrangement of fallen trees, broken tops and branches intermixed and
suspended within a heavy shrub component. It is estimated that overall fuel loading was as high as
200 tons per acre. These elevated fuel loads and the associated risk of high severity reburn can persist
for more than half a century. Figure 3- 4 shows what these same fuel loads looked like 22 days after
the Chips Fire passed through on August 1, 2012.

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects Common to All Action Alternatives

Within the treated areas the aerial hazards to the road or operations will be felled. Hazard tree felling
along road systems reduces the possibility of falling snag strikes during fire incident response and
forest management activities. Vehicle travel safety would increase, and the likelihood of hazard trees
falling and blocking roads would be greatly reduced, decreasing response times to future medical and
wildfire calls. Following treatment, vehicle access to the area would be less hazardous for firefighters
and all forest users.
Fireline intensities and flame lengths along system roads would be lower in areas where the CWD
would be reduced to 10-20 tons an acre. This residual CWD would be discontinuous and would be at
a level that would not significantly influence fire behavior or resistance to control. Suppression
actions would not be restricted by fire behavior in these areas; thus direct suppression actions would
be possible. Decreased fire intensity and flame length allows for greater probability of fire
suppression success, increases fire suppression fire-line production rates, and increases fire
management personnel safety. The scale of these beneficial effects vary by alternative in acres and
tonnage removed.
Removal of hazard trees reduces the amount of available fuels and allows for greater probability of
fire suppression success by utilizing road systems for future fire protection lines. Suppression forces
would not be hindered by the high density of snags or high levels of CWD in the units which would
allow immediate and appropriate action to be taken. Foot travel in the units would be unimpeded
except for the occasional large log that would be retained for resource benefit. The reduction in snags
would also result in reduced spotting that is associated with snags when they burn.
After the initial entry, vegetation (both natural and planted) will continue to grow, and trees will
continue to succumb to fire damage, insects, and disease, and will fall to the ground. These processes
will contribute to increasing fuel loading along roads once the initial implementation is complete;
however, the planned maintenance would address this condition.

Cumulative Effects Common to All Alternatives

Six Rivers National Forest, Trinity County, PG&E, and private land inholdings are currently
managing their fire damaged lands. Fuels are being modified by timber harvesting and removing
hazard trees along roads, power lines, trails, and other infrastructure. These activities will help reduce
the likelihood of uncharacteristically severe fire behavior in the future.
Projects on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest within the cumulative effects analysis area are the
Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community, Mud Springs Fuel Break, Sims Fire Restoration - Roadside
and Landline Fuels Reduction, Hwy 3 and Hayfork South Fuelbreak, Stafford Fire Salvage and
Restoration, Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire, Trinity County Transmission Lines Hazard Tree
Removal and Salvage, and Westside Plantation Thin projects. The ongoing hazard fuels reduction
projects are the Sims Fire Restoration, Mud Springs, Westside Plantation Thin, and South Fuelbreak.
These activities will occur on a total of approximately 15,778 acres and will help reduce the
likelihood that uncharacteristic fire behavior will occur in the future. Removing hazard trees that
threaten infrastructure reduces the excess accumulation of surface fuel loadings. The Burnt Ranch
Fire Resilient Community, Trinity County Transmission Lines Hazard Tree Removal and Salvage,
and the Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire project are in the planning stages at this time. When
implemented, these projects will reduce the likelihood that uncharacteristic fire behavior will occur in
the future.

Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
Direct and Indirect Effects
Treatments outside HVWCA’s (High Value Wildlife Conservation Area) are expected to result in
between 10 to 20 tons per acre of CWD along 206 miles of open roads. A minimum of 100ft of
treatment downhill of the road would be required to contain fires using direct attack with hand tools at
this level of CWD. This should result in conditions in which suppression resources can directly attack
fires, increasing the chance of catching fires in the initial attack phase (Brown et al., 2003).
Treatments within HVWCA’s are expected to result in 15 tons per acre or greater of CWD along 27
miles of open roads. This should result in conditions in which fires can be directly attacked with
dozers, fire engines, and aircraft increasing the chance of catching these fires in the initial attack
phase. Direct attack with handtools is unlikely to be feasible with this amount of fuel loading.
When less than 100 feet of buffer falls below the road, fire behavior will exceed initial attack
capabilities below the road. In these areas suppression actions will be limited and potentially
ineffective. Ingress and egress along these portions of the roads during wildfire events would be
limited or not passable at all because of high fire intensities in close proximity to roads. When the
buffer extends more than 100’ downhill from the road, fire behavior will be reduced along the road
and initial attack suppression capabilities will have a higher probability of success. In these areas
suppression forces can attack these fires using handtools and roads should contain the fire. Ingress
and egress along these portions of the roads during wildfire events would be passable because of
lower fire intensities and flame lengths in close proximity to roads. The variable 300-foot wide buffer
in Alternative 1 is expected to slow fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions.
Table 3-4 and Table 3-5 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 1 within all treatments using
the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program. Table 3-4 displays the projected fire effects in areas outside
HVWCA’s. Table 3-5 displays the projected fire effects in areas inside HVWCA’s. Effective fire

Cumulative Effects
Future wildfires on the landscape level will be affected by the combination of treatments
implemented on privately owned lands and those on National Forest System (NFS) lands, including
those treated by the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage treatment units. Fuels reduction
treatments will occur on 7,968 acres under this alternative, creating a total of 23,746 acres of fuel
reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is more acres treated
than alternative 4 and 5, and fewer acres than alternatives 2 and 3.

Alternative 2 (Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative)
Direct and Indirect Effects
Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in
impacts and effectiveness of treatments are described below.
Under this alternative, the buffer would not vary in distance from the road; it would consistently treat
150 feet below and above the road. Treating the downhill side of roads with a consistent buffer
greater than 100 feet will limit the spread and intensity of fires until initial attack units arrive, provide
firefighter access to other fire defense systems, and provide a line of defense for control of wildfire.
The consistent buffer would allow for safer ingress and egress routes for public and firefighter travel
along a greater number of miles than Alternative 1. The consistent 300-foot buffer treatments in
Alternative 2 are expected to slow horizontal fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions.
In addition to the consistent buffer, this alternate also includes strategic roadside fuelbreaks. Creating
and maintaining fuelbreaks to break up large expanses of continuous fuels would provide for
firefighter access and safety, increase suppression opportunities, increase ingress/egress safety for
communities and provide pre-existing control points to contain fire near communities. Thinning green
trees up to 10” DBH in the fuelbreaks would raise canopy base heights, thereby reducing crown fire
initiation which would increase the likelihood that fire will stay as surface fires and not become
crown fires. If a fire does get into the crown it would be less likely to be an active crown fire (a crown
fire that moves from tree to tree in the crown, consuming the majority of the stand and presenting
serious suppression difficulties). Suppression forces could enter these fuelbreaks and take appropriate
actions as needed to manage fires. The fuelbreak treatments in Alternative 2 are expected to slow
horizontal and vertical fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions.
Table 3-6, Table 3-7, and Table 3-8 display the projected fire effects for Alternative 2 within treatment
units using the FlamMap 5.0 modeling program. Table 3-6 displays the projected fire effects in areas

Direct and Indirect Effects
Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in

Treating the downhill side of roads to wider consistent buffer will limit the spread and intensity of
fires to a greater extent than Alternatives 1 and 2. This reduction in spread and intensity allows more
time for initial attack units to arrive, provides firefighter access to other fire defense systems, and
provides a line of defense for control of wildfire. The consistent buffer will also allow for safe ingress
and egress routes for public and firefighter travel. The consistent 600-foot buffer treatments in
Alternative 3 are expected to slow fire movement under 90th percentile weather conditions.

than all other alternatives.

Alternative 4 (NSO Alternative)
Direct and Indirect Effects
Impacts under this alternative are similar to the impacts described under Alternative 1. Differences in
impacts and effectiveness of treatments are described below.
Treatments outside Important Northern Spotted Owl Habitat would reduce the CWD to between 10 to
20 tons per acre along 175 miles of open roads, similarly to Alternative 1. The 58 miles of roads
within suitable northern spotted owl habitat would not have fuels reduction or maintenance
treatments. These areas would have fire behavior similar to the No Action alternative, with high flame
lengths and fireline intensities limiting fire suppression actions. Wildfires burning in these stands
under 90th percentile weather conditions are expected to result in substantial control problems.
During wildfire events these portions of the roads would not be safe to use as ingress/egress routes.
Aerial hazards to the roads and operations would be felled along all 233 miles of open roads, creating
conditions for safe road use during normal conditions. Maintenance treatments described under
Alternative 1 would only occur outside of suitable northern spotted owl habitat.

phase (Brown et al., 2003). The remaining 111 miles of roads within sensitive areas (northern spotted
owl suitable habitat, Riparian Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas, and At-risk watersheds) would
not have fuels reduction or maintenance treatments. These areas would have fire behavior similar to
the No Action Alternative. Increased flame lengths and fireline intensities would limit fire
suppression actions. These increased flame lengths and intensities are a direct result of fire burning in
dead and down logs, branches, and shrubs. During wildfire events these portions of the roads would
not be safe to use as ingress/egress routes.

reduction treatments when combined with other projects in the analysis area; this is the fewest acres
of fuel reduction treatments of all action alternatives.

Alternative 6 (No Action)
Direct and Indirect Effects
Under Alternative 6, no actions would be implemented to address the objectives and desired
conditions identified in the Purpose and Need. Existing stand conditions would persist and develop
unaltered by active management. Standing hazard trees would remain along roads until they fall by
natural causes, and the site would be rapidly colonized by grasses, forbs, and shrubs within three to
five years.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Figure 3- 6. The 2008 Eagle Fire, photo taken in 2015 showing shrub regeneration and height.
It is a reasonable expectation that non-salvaged stands would develop comparable to that of similar
non-salvaged stands in nearby fires that burned in the recent past. Examples of such fires include the
Lime Complex Fire (2008), Iron Complex Fire (2008), Bake-Oven Fire (2006), Megram Fire (1999),
and the Onion Fire (1999). In those areas, grasses such as cheat grass (Bromus tectorum) and shrubs
such as Ceanothus (C. cordulatus, C. velutinus) and manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula) species
occupy the site. Standing snags dominate the overstory of the high and moderate severity burn areas.
Shrub fuels are established within 7 years after the fire. Figure 3- 5 shows for the 2008 Cedar Fire,
and Figure 3- 6 the 2008 Eagle Fire.
Hundreds of dead trees and very few live trees per acre characterize the forest structure following a
high-intensity fire. Snag fall rates are highest the first ten years within the smaller diameter classes,
while larger snags persist for relatively longer time periods, which is generally documented in
existing scientific literature (Smith and Cluck, 2001). Nearly all snags in the 2015 Fire areas would be
expected to fall by 20 years post-fire, contributing to greater fuel loads. The limbs and boles from
these fallen trees would accumulate as surface fuels. This fuel is expected to increase each decade as
trees fall over. At year 10, surface fuels are projected to average 58 tons per acre. At year 20, surface
fuels are projected to average 72 tons per acre with up to 250 tons per acre. In the event of a wildfire
this would create serious control problems and high suppression costs, and high volumes of smoke
emissions. Increased surface fuels would result in increased flame lengths and higher fireline
intensities. These would lead to increased firefighter and public risk, and higher costs.
Historically, fires in the project area were low intensity with less than 20 percent of the stand being
killed by fire. The scale of historical fires was also much smaller. Fire effects under the No Action
Alternative would result in higher stand loss as seen in the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad
River Complex, Route Complex, River Complex, and Saddle Fire, with over 26% percent of the stand
killed and at larger scales than historical fire size. It is expected that some fires, both human and
lightning caused, would continue to escape initial attack under more severe weather conditions over
the next 20 to 30 years. These fires are expected to kill natural regeneration and residual larger trees.
71

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Both grass-forb cover and shrub cover present formidable competition for water and light with tree
seedlings. This competing vegetation would likely result in decreased survival of tree seedlings and
would inhibit growth for years if not decades. Consequently, the site would likely be occupied by
brush intermixed with grass and forbs. The result would be brush fields with high fuel loads. Over
time, ladder and crown fuels would develop where natural regeneration was established via seed from
surviving mature conifers.
Table 3-15 displays predicted flame lengths and fireline intensities. Under Alternative 6, flame
lengths exceed 4 feet after five years and are projected to exceed 10 feet within 20 years. Fireline
Intensities would exceed 500 BTU per foot per second after five years and are projected to exceed
1,000 BTU per foot per second after 10 years. These increased flame lengths and intensities are a
direct result of fire burning in dead and down logs, branches, and shrubs. Fires burning in stands
under 90th percentile weather conditions in Alternative 6 are expected to result in substantial control
problems.
Access to the fire would be restricted by fallen trees across the roads and by standing roadside danger
trees. Fire engines would not be able to access fires as rapidly as we have come to expect. Fire size
could quickly increase before suppression forces arrive to fight the fire. Fires may be too intense for
direct attack on the head by persons using hand tools. Handline may not be relied on to hold the fire.
Fires may present substantial control problems such as torching, crowning, and spotting. Control
efforts at the fire head will probably be ineffective. Under Alternative 6, the general trend in high
flame lengths (greater than 10 feet) and corresponding high fireline intensities are expected to
continue at least 20 years into the future.

Alternative 6 combined with the high fuel loading left outside the treatment areas would mean that
wildfires would cross boundaries with little chance of containing fires under 90th percentile weather
conditions. Wildfires would burn until weather conditions changed so effective suppression actions
could take place. This is similar to what occurred on many of the 2015 fires. Unmanaged areas will
continue to burn with intensities that perpetuate early seral stage development and hinder the
development of forested ecosystems. Overall, the No Action Alternative would not reduce potential
future surface fuels or predicted fire effects.
72

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects of the no action alternative come from the interaction of continued growth of fuels
and deposition of heavy dead fuels with the reasonably foreseeable actions included in the beginning
of Chapter 3. The high intensity fire supported by the areas left untreated in this project could reduce
the effectiveness of the whole suite of fuel reduction treatments in the event of a future wildfire. If a
fire in this area escapes initial control or cannot be managed appropriately due to access issues and
high fuel loading, the resulting high intensity fire could damage other vegetation management
activities, including destroying recently planted stands, moving around other fuel treatments that
would have linked to the treatments in this project and becoming a large campaign fire event that
damages thousands to hundreds of thousands of acres.
Availability of strategic points to control wildfires on the landscape would be reduced due to extreme
fuel loading from hazard trees that were left to fall naturally. Foot travel for fire suppression would be
hampered due to increased fuel loading and unsafe working conditions along roads. Hazard trees and
large woody debris accumulation may limit fire management suppression opportunities. Alternative 6
would not move us towards meeting the Forest guidelines and direction for fire management

Vegetation
Analysis Area and Existing Condition

The analysis area for this report was determined using the fire footprints, as this represents the greatest
potential for experiencing vegetation mortality resulting from the fire. Of the ~163,000 total acres that
burned east of the Six Rivers National Forest, approximately 144,350 acres (or 89%) were on National
Forest System lands. According to remotely sensed data (Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio
(RdNBR)), 24% of the total fire area (approximately 33,920 acres) killed greater than or equal to 25%
basal area (ft2)44 resulting in considerable losses of forest vegetation. While most of the fire area
experienced very low to low severity (76%), additional loss in forested vegetation is expected in these
stands over the next 3 to 8 years depending on species, due to secondary mortality connected to the fire
stress (Smith and Cluck 2011). Fire impacts are anticipated to have a greater secondary effect on
vegetation since trees were already weakened prior to the fires. Upon field verification, less than three
months after imagery was analyzed, field data collected in November 2015 showed a 40% increase in
basal area45 loss/mortality was observed in field plots within the moderate fire severity class (Class 3; 2575 basal area mortality) indicating greater fire-impacts (65-100%) to existing vegetation (T. Hamilton,
personal communication, March 23, 2016). This secondary mortality may be greater than normally seen
due to over a decade of drought stress.

differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RnDBR) index was used to create the 4-classes of basal area mortality (ft2 acre-1).

RAVG data combined with field data calibration indicates that 24% of the project area is experiencing at
least 65% basal area47 loss and many stands (over 10%) have experienced complete mortality. It is
anticipated that this higher mortality rate will increase with time.

44 Upon

field verification, three months after imagery was analyzed, a 40% increase in basal area loss/mortality (T. Hamilton,
personal communication, March 23, 2016) was observed. This data indicates that 24% of the project area is experiencing at least
65% basal area loss and many (over 10% have complete mortality).
45 In the context of RAVG analysis, basal area loss measures the percent change in basal area or tree cover (relative number of
live trees on the site) from the pre-fire condition. Basal area loss is reported as four classes of percent change in tree cover and is
expressed in square feet. Basal area loss does not describe a permanent loss of basal area within a forest, but simply describes the
amount of change in the live tree cover immediately (approximately 30 days after wildfire containment) after a wildfire that
undergoes RAVG analysis.

Much of the burned area has a hardwood component contributing to vertical structure and species
diversity. Generally, hardwoods and shrubs will respond to surface mortality due to moderate and high
severity fire by basal sprouting from the root collar within one year following the burn. Shrub and
hardwood sprouting, especially oaks, tanoak, big leaf maple, madrone, poison oak, and manzanita was
already evident in spring 2016.

The 2015 fires served to reset a range of stands with varying size classes, densities and vegetation
compositions from mid- to late-seral back to early-seral.

Historic Condition

Due to the linear nature of proposed treatments over a large landscape that is the project area, the
vegetative character varies substantially across treatment units. Vegetation has been modified by past
timber harvest activities as well as large scale wildfires (See Figure 3- 1 and Figure 3- 2).
Pre-Fire Conditions
The project area is broadly located in the Klamath Mixed Conifer forest type which spans the Klamath
Region of northern California and southwestern Oregon. The dominant vegetation types within the project
area include the mixed conifer and Douglas-fir forest types. Species composition tends to follow elevation
and temperature gradients ranging from red fir/white fir at the highest areas to black oak woodland and
ponderosa pine/gray pine/chaparral in the lowest, warmest areas of the project area.
South-facing slopes are often dominated by large areas of hardwood and chaparral vegetation. Ultramafic
sites, such as areas present within the Blue Fire are dominated by Jeffery pine and incense cedar. These
areas tend to have low productivity due to topographic position and geologic parent material. Much of the
remainder of the affected burned area is highly productive forest due to above average soil quality and
high rainfall. Historically, these vegetation types have demonstrated a high capacity to recover from
disturbance; however, seed sources play a fundamental role in natural reforestation, and by extension
future forest recovery. Areas lacking mature live overstory (especially areas larger than 5-10 acres) are
likely to take decades to establish seedlings through natural processes and would benefit from artificial
reforestation (planting) in order to more quickly establish forest cover. Stands dominated by hardwoods
and/or woody shrub vegetation prior to burning would be a lower priority for reforestation efforts.
Table 3-20 shows the existing (pre-fire) acreage by forest type within the 2015 fires’ footprint. Douglasfir comprises approximately 78,600 acres, or 55% of the total area affected. Mixed conifer, Douglasfir/white fir, ultramafic mixed conifer, red fir, and ponderosa pine types total approximately 50,100 acres
or another 35% of the forested area affected by the fires. The remainder is primarily characterized by
hardwoods and/or shrubs, and occurs primarily on southeast-facing slopes. Hardwoods are also a minor
component of many mixed conifer stands throughout the burned area.

Prior to the 2015 fire season, snags existed at natural levels in excess of Forest Plan Standards &
Guidelines. Project level data from within or adjacent areas, as well as LSRA data indicated between 25.5 snags/acre greater than 15-inches in diameter were present across the landscape in mature forest
stands. In areas that burned at very low to low intensity, it can be inferred that snag densities are
consistent with pre-fire conditions, if not a little higher due to secondary mortality. Post-fire plot data
completed in fall of 2015 was collected within the roadside buffer areas that burned at moderate to high
severity. The mean and median number of snags greater than 15 inches diameter at breast height per acre
is well in excess of the 1.5 required by the Forest Plan (average: 65.6/acre; median: 46.6/acre). Similar
conditions can be assumed for moderate and high severity areas adjacent to the treatment buffers.

Insects and Disease

While wildfires immediately kill trees from the heat of fire (crown kill) evident by lack of needles and/or
browned needles, the indirect effects of wildfire on forest landscapes will result in continued mortality of
green trees experiencing root or bole injuries. Fire-injured trees may have a reduced probability of
survival depending on the level of injury. Most tree mortality takes place within five years post-fire, with
the highest levels occurring within the first two years. Fire injuries can also have longer lasting impacts
on tree health and may contribute to mortality beyond this time frame, such as if root disease or decay
gains entrance to the tree as a result of the injury. In addition, insects in the families Buprestidae,
Cerambycidae, and Siricidae are principal colonizers of fire-killed or severely fire-injured trees. Some of
these insects are attracted by smoke and will lay eggs on trees that are still smoldering; because they
colonize trees that are dead or dying from fire injury, they are not considered a direct threat to tree
survival. Bark beetles (primarily Dendroctonus species), in contrast, are more likely to colonize trees that
are lightly to moderately fire injured and may kill some trees that might otherwise have survived. Bark
beetle activity typically increases and may persist for several years in burned areas.
Prior to the 2015 wildfires, the fire area hosted a variety of insects and disease (I&D) agents including Ips,
western, and mountain pine beetles, Douglas-fir beetles, fir engravers, defoliators, dwarf mistletoe, white

pine blister rust, and Annosus root rots on an endemic48 level. Insect and disease levels were monitored
annually with aerial surveys conducted by Forest Health Protection staff as well as documented by Forest
personnel during routine project work.
The post-fire response of insects and diseases within the fire area will vary between species and depend
on a variety of environmental factors including: burn severity, injury to root and bole, residual live tree
density, climate, location, and other environmental conditions. Immediate actions (such as salvage
removal of infested logs) can be taken to minimize the impacts of existing insect and disease agents,
while future actions must be responsive to monitoring results in order to reduce further damage to and
loss of forested landscapes.
The project area has been experiencing elevated populations of bark beetle in ponderosa and sugar pine
populations over the last few years according to annual aerial surveys conducted by the US Forest
Service’s Forest Health and Protection Group. Bark beetles are attracted to stressed trees. Populations of
western pine beetle are expected to increase within the fire perimeter over the next 5 years as evidence of
activity (pitch tubes49 and frass50) is already observable following the initial fire event. Adjacent healthy,
uninjured pine, or green trees experiencing low intensity fire, are also likely to experience mortality due
to increased bark beetle populations. This may also impact the success of natural regeneration in areas if
they attack and subsequently affect potential seed trees.
Wood Borers
Wood borers are beetles or wasps that live under the bark and inside the wood of trees, and their tunneling
activity helps to decompose the tree. Insects in the families Buprestidae, Cerambycidae, and Siricidae are
principal colonizers of fire-killed or severely fire-injured trees. Some of these insects are attracted by
smoke and will lay eggs on trees that are still smoldering; because they colonize trees that are dead or
dying from fire injury, they are not considered a direct threat to tree survival. They do have a substantial
effect on merchantability of the wood as they tunnel into sapwood and sometimes into the heartwood and
may introduce decay fungi further degrading the wood. Based on the rates of deterioration due to wood
borers seen in trees felled for safety reasons, some timber value has already been lost, and the quality of
timber continues to decline as time passes.
Heterobasidion Root disease
Heterobasidion root disease has been documented in mature mixed-conifer stands within and in close
proximity to the burn area. It is likely that root rot pockets will expand and increase after the fire as it is
known to continue spreading through the roots of recently killed trees. Live trees within and adjacent to
these pockets are likely to be infected if injured by other trees falling alongside and down the bole.
Heterobasidion root disease is scattered throughout much of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but is
much more common on the east side of the Forest than on the west side or on the Six Rivers National
Forest. The areas in and around the five fire footprints have not been intensively surveyed for
Heterobasidion root disease, however the California Insect and Disease Atlas (CAIDA) database records
reports of Heterobasidion root disease observations (Table 3-21).

The CAIDA database showed relatively few Heterobasidion root disease reports in or near the fire
complex areas. However, the database showed that the disease has been reported within the perimeters of
the Route and South/Saddle Fire Complexes, and has been reported within three miles of the Fork Fire.
The nearest reports for the Mad River and River Complex Fires were 3.5 and 7 miles, respectively.
Fire suppression efforts cut a considerable number of trees over 14-inches (stump diameter) to reduce risk
of fire spread and improve fire-fighter safety. During this time of emergency, stump treatments designed to
prevent the spread of HRD that is typical during non-emergency felling (i.e. application of borate
compounds) were not utilized. This will likely result in an increase of Heterobasidion root rot through cut
stumps. Within 3 miles of recorded or observed sites, hazard tree reduction activities affecting green trees
(or trees killed by the fire51) greater than 14-inches (stump diameter) within the fire area should utilize
borate-based treatment.
Dwarf Mistletoe
An endemic level of dwarf mistletoe was present in much of the conifer forest stands within the fire area
prior to the fires. While infection levels are relatively low (excluding areas of high infection such as on
South Fork Mountain), it is likely that mistletoe persists in areas that were not completely consumed by
fire. The most important consideration for mistletoe is how it may impact natural and artificial
regeneration efforts. Overstory trees infected with dwarf mistletoe are likely to infect an establishing
understory.
White Pine Blister Rust
White pine blister rust is present in some of the sugar pines within the fire perimeter. It is likely that a
flush of Ribes shrubs (the alternate host species) will germinate in areas with high fire severity could
spread this disease to residual live sugar pines and future regeneration of sugar pine.

Carbon Sequestration and Storage

Forests sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and in so doing can mitigate the effects of climate change.
Coniferous forests contain more than one-third of all carbon stored on land. Forests and long-lived wood
products currently offset approximately 340 million tons (310 million metric tons) of U.S. fossil fuel
emissions of carbon, an estimated 20 percent of the total (Birdsey et al. 2006, Powers et al. 2013).
Effects of fire on carbon sequestration
In the short term, fire can influence the carbon cycle in a number of ways. Fire can affect plant growth
directly by killing plants, thereby preventing them from sequestering additional carbon. When smoldering
combustion occurs, it can produce charcoal or black carbon, which is the result of incomplete fuel
combustion. Carbon in this form is relatively stable and can remain in the system for considerable periods

cambium characteristics.

of time (DeLuca and Aplet 2008). When fire consumes vegetation and detritus it releases carbon back to
the atmosphere, and it can release nutrients to the soil—potentially increasing post fire vegetation growth.
Fire can also provide a competitive advantage for some species, which may have implications for post
disturbance productivity as a function of fire frequency and severity.
Fire intensity tends to correlate with fire severity. As the energy released during combustion (intensity)
increases, the effect that fire has on the system, such as plant mortality (severity), also increases (Keeley
2009). When fire intensity is low and frequency is high, plant mortality rates tend to be low and carbon
assimilation is above the rate that carbon is released back to the atmosphere through decomposition of
dead plant material. However, when fire intensity is high and frequency is low, plant mortality is high and
the balance between carbon assimilation and carbon emission can become negative, making the site a net
source of carbon to the atmosphere (Dore et al. 2008, Meigs et al. 2009, Hurteau and Brooks 2011).
In fire-prone forested systems, fire was more prevalent in the past than it is today (Stephens et al. 2007).
These fires, whether natural or human caused, released considerable amounts of carbon to the
atmosphere. Estimated pre-1800 fire emissions of carbon dioxide from forests in California range from
23.1 to 62.6 teragrams (Tg) carbon dioxide per year (Stephens et al. 2007). The average annual estimate
of carbon dioxide emissions from fire in California from 2001 to 2008 was 17.8 Tg carbon dioxide per
year. However, 2008 had substantially higher emissions (54.5 Tg carbon dioxide) as a result of a large
number of lightning-ignited fires (Wiedinmyer and Hurteau 2010). Generally, California is within its
historical range, even with increased fire activity (Hurteau and Brooks 2011).

Figure 3- 7. Hypothetical cycle of forest carbon through a fire cycle with tree regeneration (Fire
Science Brief, Jan 2010).
In the longer term, stands that burned at moderate to high severity will continue to emit carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere for at least four to ten years following fire, and sometimes much more if poor
regeneration is present. Following high intensity fire, in the absence of tree planting, the potential exists
for type conversion from forest to a different vegetation type (e.g., shrubland or grassland) (McDonald
and Abbott 1997; Savage and Mast 2005). Lack of tree regeneration in favor of shrubs or grasses results
in a diminished capacity to sequester carbon (Savage and Mast 2005). Thus, the long-term effects of highseverity fire and the potential for type conversion have substantial implications for the carbon balance
(Hurteau and Brooks 2011).
Carbon sequestration and storage
Carbon sequestration is the rate of annual transfer between atmosphere and biosphere, while carbon
storage refers to the size of the carbon pool at a point in time. As indicated above, fire killed trees are an
atmospheric source of carbon, and it isn’t until regeneration takes hold that the stands become a sink for
82

Final Environmental Impact Statement

carbon. Large snags and large down wood hold carbon longer than small diameter surface fuels, but
commercially processed wood stores carbon even longer than snags and down wood (e.g. commercially
processed wood has a decomposition rate of less than 1% per year (Birdsey 1996, in Zhang et al. 2008)).
However, however fire-killed trees lose all commercial value within 3 years following fire (California
Stewardship Program 2002, in Zhang et al. 2008), thereby eliminating the most effective method for
carbon storage.
Within the areas affected by the 2015 fires, approximately 22,000 acres have had some kind of
silvicultural activity, including timber harvest, salvage, or mechanical fuels reduction since 1950. Past
timber harvest and wildfires have contributed to creation of approximately 16,000 acres of plantations.
Within these plantations, about 2,600 have been pre-commercially treated.
The combination of fire suppression/exclusion over the last years with limited (recent) vegetation
management actions have led to a marked accumulation of live and dead fuels on the Forest. This
accumulation of fuels and drought conditions contributed to its vulnerability to mortality during the 2015
fire event.

Methodology

As cutting dead trees along linear features with or without removal will not affect directly and/or
appreciably contribute to or detract from ecological restoration, elements that will be followed through
analysis include:


Hazards to Public Safety;



Threats from Insects and Disease;



Future Forest Structure/Productivity; and.



Carbon Sequestration and Storage

Salvage harvests on adjacent private land contribute to the mosaic of habitat, a reduction of down woody
debris (by removing standing dead), improvement of public safety on roads through private land, and are
likely to affect future fire behavior.

Environmental Consequences
Direct and Indirect Effects
Common to all Action Alternative (Alternative 1-5)
Trees identified as hazards along open NFS roads would be selected and felled, improving public safety
along travelways by eliminating threats to human life and/or property. As the 2015 wildfires weakened the
structural integrity of many trees, there is a need to reduce the dangers created by the dead, structurally
defective, or otherwise hazardous trees along NFS roads to allow for safe travel.
While planting following harvest increases carbon sequestration in the long-term to levels exceeding that
of no management, due to the minimal treatment area (<1 to 5% of fire affected area), there will be
minimal overall effect to carbon sequestration across the landscape.
While salvage harvest decreases on-site carbon storage in the short term (prior to establishment of a new
forest with mature trees), in the long-term areas salvaged and replanted are expected to exceed carbon
storage when compared to those areas that are not managed. However, due to the minimal treatment area
(<1 to 5% of fire affected area), there will be minimal overall effect to carbon storage across the
landscape.
In addition, while salvage logging results in the loss of carbon at the stand level, this fails to take in to
account the preservation of carbon storage within processed logs.

Bark Beetles
Large-scale removal of infested trees reduces the overall numbers of bark beetles within areas especially
vulnerable to beetle attack (i.e. post-fire landscapes). However, due to the minimal treatment area (<1 to
5% of fire affected area), there will be a minimal overall effect to bark beetle population reductions,
regardless of alternative.

Alternative 1 – Proposed Action
Forest Structure
Dead trees eventually decay and fall to the ground at varying rates depending on degree of injury, size,
species, etc. (Ritchie et al., 2013). The felling of dead hazard trees expedites the process that would have
occurred naturally, redistributing standing snags as coarse woody debris52.
Salvage is anticipated on approximately 4,100 roadside acres (including approximately 700 disaggregated
acres of concentrated higher density areas. Wood products milled or otherwise utilized, result in reduced
costs to the government (and subsequently the taxpayer) to accomplish project goals, utilization of local
timber industry infrastructure, reduction in surface fuels, and serve as an effective sequestration of
carbon.
Reforestation would occur within the road buffer in forested areas that experienced moderate to high burn
severity, thereby largely losing the overstory (i.e. sources of natural seed).
Within five years after planting, there is an expected mortality rate of approximately 30%, which may
vary depending on weather/drought conditions and site. Live planted seedlings would be manually
released (removal of competing vegetation by hand, not chemically) to aid in seedling survival within ten
years following planting.

Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative
Forest Structure
Effects discussed in Alternative 1 are comparable to Alternative 2 except the scale is greater due to
approximately 5,300 acres (including approximately 950 disaggregated acres of concentrated higher
density) of salvage treatment instead of approximately 4,100 under Alternative 1 due to the addition of
fuelbreak treatments.
Reforestation would occur within the road buffer and fuelbreaks in areas salvaged as well as areas other
historically forested areas
Reforestation spacing could vary between 15-feet by 15-feet to 30-feet by 30-feet depending on site
condition, terrain and existing vegetation.
By utilizing a slightly denser spacing, trees will have an opportunity to shade out competition as they
grow, thereby improving the likelihood of reaching mature forested conditions (Conard and Radosevich
1982; Erickson and Harrington 2006).
Safety
Live fire-injured trees meeting the criteria outlined with a 60% chance of dying within five years would
be felled and potentially removed.
The benefit of utilizing the California Salvage Guidelines (Smith and Cluck 2011) in conjunction with the
Hazard Tree Guidelines is a more thorough reduction of hazard trees by reducing the number of potential
future hazard trees than under Alternative 1. By identifying those trees predicted to expire and create a
hazard in the near future, Alternative 2 will have a lower administrative burden and cost of out-year

maintenance. In addition, more trees (increased volume) of a higher quality is anticipated for salvage
units by including injured trees with some green/live characteristics.

Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer Alternative
Forest Structure
Effects discussed in Alternative 1 are comparable to Alternative 3 except the scale is greater under
Alternative 3 due to approximately 7,700 acres (including approximately 1350 disaggregated acres of
concentrated higher density) of salvage treatments utilizing the wider buffer, instead of approximately
only 4,100 acres of treatment in Alternative 1.
Reforestation criteria and effects would be comparable to Alternative 1, except for increased scale due to
the wider treatment buffer.
Safety
As this Alternative also utilizes the California Salvage Guidelines, utilizing a probability of mortality of
0.6 in conjunction with the Hazard Tree Guidelines, this Alternative would have an increased (more
thorough) level of safety comparable to the effect of implementing Alternative 2 to users of National
Forest System roads

Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl Alternative
Forest Structure
Effects discussed in Alternative 1 are comparable to Alternative 4 except the scale is reduced due to
approximately 800 acres (including approximately 110 disaggregated acres of concentrated higher
density) of salvage treatment instead of approximately 4,100 in Alternative 1. Due to the substantially
smaller area, there will be little carbon sequestration into wood products.
Reforestation criteria and effects would be comparable to Alternative 1, except for increased fuel in the
form of large woody debris in areas not salvaged. This quantity of large wood may result in fewer
available/ appropriate planting locations and increase vulnerability of loss in the event of future fires.

Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative
Forest Structure
Consistent with Alternative 1 (as well as the other action alternatives), dead trees eventually decay and
fall to the ground at varying rates depending on degree of injury, size, species, etc. (Ritchie 2013). The
felling of dead hazard trees expedites the process that would have occurred naturally, redistributing
standing snags as coarse woody debris. What is different under this alternative, is there would be no
commercial removal of these logs. Similarly to the 136,000 acres that burned and are having no
treatments, no salvage would occur in areas of highly concentrated coarse woody debris, even when
levels exceed 100 tons/ac. While available for personal use firewood permits comparable to any other
open firewood area, no wood products would be milled, resulting in excessive fuel loading remaining on
site and higher costs to the government (and subsequently the taxpayer) to accomplish project goals.
Reforestation criteria and effects would be comparable to Alternative 1, except for increased fuel in the
form of large woody debris as this alternative does not include salvage. This quantity of large wood may
result in fewer available/appropriate planting locations. As trees would be inter-planted between large
down logs, there is greater risk of loss to the developing forest as seedlings are subject to loss from future
wildfire, than if fuels had been treated/salvage had occurred (UC Davis, 2009).

Alternative 6 – No Action

There would be no felling of hazard trees to improve safe passage on National Forest System roads.
There would be no recovery of the economic value of any of the fire killed trees.

85

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

There would not be any increased risk of spread of Heterobasidion root rot due to cut stumps.
Sequestered carbon would decompose in the natural elements.

Cumulative Effects

Current and future projects within the areas affected by this project are also largely focused on post-fire
reforestation (i.e. 2015 Fire Reforestation), post-fire hazard tree removal along transmission lines (i.e.
PG&E Hazard Tree Salvage), post-fire removal of vegetation felled during suppression activities (i.e.
Roadside Decks Salvage), and projects aimed at contributing to a more resilient forested condition (i.e.
Westside Plantation Thin, Middle Hayfork Precommercial Thin, Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community,
Trinity Alps Prescribed Burn, Gemmill Thin, Sims Restoration projects). A list of cumulative effects
including projects from the recent (last 20 years) past within the fire footprints, as well as current and
future projects are included in Appendix G-Cumulative Effects Table.
As the 2015 wildfires have had the greatest effect on the current conditions including the purpose and
need for this project and effect the post-implementation desired condition, the existing and compounding
effects of the fires are expanded upon in greater detail below.
Effect of 2015 Trinity Wildfires Common to All Alternatives
Forest Structure
The vegetation impacted during the fire and the vegetation removed by this project would have a
cumulative effect on forest structure in the project area. Natural revegetation of the burned areas within
the project area, especially outside of treatment areas, will occur to a small degree over time, primarily
with forbs and shrubs; forested conditions in areas burned at high severity are unlikely to occur for 20100 years. For the larger, high severity burned areas, reforestation will take a long period of time due, in
part, to the distance from seed sources as well as a potential decrease in soil productivity/fertility (Savage
and Mast 2005). It is expected that hardwoods and shrubs will resprout vigorously throughout the
recovery area.
After fire mortality has ceased, large areas in all land allocations severely-affected by the fires would be
understocked or unstocked for forest development and associated timber production for many decades
(Clark 2009; Ouzts et al. 2015). Reforestation within areas burned in 2015 beyond the project treatment area
is on-going that would reduce the impacts of the 2015 wildfires and begin a trajectory of future stand
recovery. Cumulatively, the number of acres considered for reforestation need between this project and
the reforestation project could incorporate up to 26,700 acres on National Forest System lands across all
fire areas. However, this number includes areas that may regenerate on their own and/or have sufficient
stocking still present after the fires. These areas are considered for reforestation until field examinations
are done, if sufficient stocking has regenerated or is still present from prior to the fire areas are then
categorized as natural regeneration.
Insects and Disease
Additional trees will be killed by insects within and adjacent to the fire area for 3 to 8 years, depending on
species (Smith and Cluck 2011). The perimeter of intensely burned stands and interior islands of partially
scorched trees are most susceptible to attack by bark beetles. Other factors affecting susceptibility
include site quality, tree size, stand density, weather/drought and presence of other pathogens. The amount
of tree removal in the project would slightly decrease bark beetle populations but is not likely to influence
these trends of forest mortality in the burned area due to the small area planned for treatment (and the
large area of burned trees unaffected by this or any other foreseeable project); therefore, it is unlikely that
the project will noticeably reduce bark beetle mortality even when taking into account all salvage efforts
within the fire footprint.
The effects of fire suppression may affect the spread of Heterobasidion root disease, as treatment of
stumps with a borate compound is not required in the event of an emergency. Therefore trees felled during
86

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

fire suppression and management activities may have served as sources of Heterobasidion infection. The
project is not expected to cumulatively add to this increase in Heterobasidion root disease due to the
planned borate treatment of cut stumps.
Climate Change Impacts
Where it is able, the distribution of vegetation in California is expected to move upslope and poleward in
response to climate change (Hayhoe et al. 2004, Loarie et al. 2008). While such long-term shifts are
difficult to observe, observations of short-term shifts in response to drought and climate variability can
offer us insight into the trends we are likely to see under warmer and (potentially) drier climates. In
response to these shifting species distribution predictions, planting associated with this project will
include seed sown from generally one elevational band (500-feet) lower, and within the same seed zone.
This will allow for a more hardy transition to a warmer climate as trees mature (Millar et al. 2007).
In addition, healthy and diverse forest stands have a greater likelihood for adaptability into the future
(Anderson and Palik 2011). Reforestation for this project will include a species mixture consistent with
historic and natural conditions, including a mixture of Douglas-fir, ponderosa or Jeffery pine, incense
cedar, sugar pine, white fir and red fir (South Fork Mountain only).
No Action
Insect and Disease
Alternative 6 (No Action) has the greatest risk of bark beetle population increases, primarily because all
stressed trees remain.
Safety
Alternative 6 (No Action) has the greatest risk to users of the National Forest System lands and roads. As
no hazard trees would be mitigated (except for along PG&E transmission lines analyzed under a separate
project), there is cumulative risk to users as time passes and more trees die, decay and fall.
Forest Structure
The cumulative effect of the no action alternative with the effects of the 2015 fires on forest structure is a
shift from mature forests toward early seral and type conversions to brush fields.
Action Alternatives (Alternative 1-5)
Safety
Cumulatively, implementation of all action alternatives combined with private land salvage and hazard
tree abatement on adjacent timber industry lands would result in a project area safe for travel on roads
open to the public. This is because all action alternatives mitigate the immediate threat of hazard trees, to
varying degrees (Alternatives 2 and 3 are more thorough due to the incorporation of California Salvage
Guidelines and larger treatment footprints).
Heterobasidion Root Rot
While stumps would likely be treated on both NFS and privately managed timber lands, more exposed
stumps increases the likelihood of spread of the root disease. However, by applying borate compound on
stumps greater than 14-inches, the threat of infection is not appreciably greater with implementation of
any action alternative.
Forest Structure
Utilizing artificial reforestation (under this project as well as the post-fire reforestation project) combined
with fuels treatments and taking into account comparable activities on private lands and will result in a
trajectory to maintain forest cover where planted. In addition, projects such as Gemmill Thin, Middle
Hayfork Precommercial Thin, Westside Plantation Thin, Burnt Ranch, etc. will improve diversity of the

landscape by reducing overstocked stands thereby improving the likelihood of future maintenance of
forested conditions in the event of a wildfire.

Wildlife
Endangered Species Act – Northern Spotted Owl

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides for the conservation of threatened and endangered plants
and animals. Under the ESA, the Forest Service is required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service to ensure that actions that the Forest Service undertakes or authorizes are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of any species listed as threatened or endangered. As part of implementing the
ESA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to develop a Recovery Plans and Critical Habitat for
threatened and endangered species. The Shasta-Trinity contains areas that provide suitable habitat for the
threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and Critical Habitat for the northern spotted
owl has been designated on the Forest.

Designated Critical Habitat

The Critical Habitat Rule for the northern spotted owl (NSO) identifies geographic areas that contain
features deemed essential for conservation of the northern spotted owl. The revised Critical Habitat Rule
(USFWS 2012) updated habitat unit and subunit boundaries that had been established by the 2008 rule,
across the range of the northern spotted owl. The areas of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest impacted by
the 2015 wildfires includes 93,588 acres of northern spotted owl Critical Habitat (as designated by the
2012 Critical Habitat Rule) that burned at various intensities. While designated Critical Habitat, it is
important to note that some areas within Critical Habitat Units are not suitable NSO habitat. Also,
wildfire may have reduced the suitability of Critical Habitat for owls both now and in the long term—
especially within areas that burned at high severity.

Northern Spotted Owl
Introduction

A comprehensive analysis of wildlife species occurrence, habitat, and effects of the Trinity Post-fire
Hazard Reduction and Salvage (TPFHR&S) project are included in the following documents53:
 The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Biological Assessment
 The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Biological Evaluation
 The TPFHR&S Project-level Management Indicator Assemblage Report
 The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Survey and Manage Report
 The TPFHR&S Project Migratory Bird Report
 The TPFHR&S Project Wildlife Report
Proposed Actions and Alternatives Analyzed
For a detailed description of the alternatives considered for this analysis, please see Chapter 2, beginning
on Page 14.
Methodology
This analysis is based on species occurrence data documented in National Forest wildlife databases
(Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests) and the California Natural Diversity Database,
53 Note

that each of these reports is responsive to a different set of legal requirements for analysis. Because of this, elements of
each analysis may vary depending on the focus and purpose of the analysis. In the same manner, what is significant in each
analysis may differ depending on the legal requirements. For example, loss of a year’s breeding in a northern spotted owl pair
due to disturbance may be an adverse effect and result in a “take” under the Endangered Species Act, which places thresholds of
effect at the individual level. But at a population level this may not be significant under NEPA or the Forest Service sensitive
species program due to the typical year to year variation in breeding amongst NSO, and the loss of one year’s breeding may have
almost no population level effects. Although we incorporate these reports by reference, determinations under NEPA relative to
significance can be different than those found under the native legal framework of each report.

maintained by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. For this analysis, potential effects were
assessed based primarily on the likelihood and intensity of effects to habitat characteristics beneficial to
these species. The specific methodologies used are the same as those described in the documents listed in
the Introduction. Note: A minor reduction in the areas of potential treatment analyzed for Alternatives 1,
3, 4 and 5 occurred after the analysis in the wildlife reports was nearly completed. Approximately 219
acres were removed from the mapped treatment areas, and no new areas were added. Thus, potential
effects will in all cases be less than that identified in the project wildlife reports.
NSO Determination Criteria
The determination criteria in the wildlife Biological Assessment (BA) uses a systematic approach that
relates NSO survival and reproduction to habitat quantity, quality and distribution. Each territory was
given an effects determination of: 1) “likely to adversely affect” (LAA); 2) “may effect, but not likely to
adversely affect” (MANLAA); or 3) “no effect” (NE) based on the environmental consequences of the
various alternatives. Where the determination criteria were not sufficient to decisively establish an effects
determination, further evaluation of site specific factors were conducted. The primary purpose of these
criteria is to determine if a territory is Likely to be Adversely Affected (LAA) by the proposed activities.
As such, they are termed LAA determination criteria. They determine the changes that may reduce the
potential of a territory to support NSO at the following levels, listed below from highest to lowest
suitability:
1. Capable of supporting successful NSO nesting and reproduction.
2. Capable of supporting a resident pair or single NSO, but not to support successful reproduction.
3. Not capable of supporting NSO.
Changes that would reduce the potential for a territory from a higher to lower level of suitability for NSO,
as defined above, are determined to likely adversely affect NSO. Lesser effects that are not insignificant
or discountable are also determined to likely adversely affect NSO. Any variation from strict application
of these criteria is assessed and documented in the “Rationale for determination” section of the Project
BA.
Post-fire foraging (PFF) habitats are areas that were suitable as NSO NRF habitat pre-fire but no longer
meet the definition of NRF habitat because of the effects of the wildfires. PFF154 is considered to be
useful for foraging by NSO, and impacts to PFF1 are deemed detrimental; therefore, degradation/removal
of PFF1 is considered here to be an important factor in assessing potential effects to NSO and assigning
effect determinations for individual NSO territories.
LAA determination criterion #1: Will treatments result in the core55 falling below 50% NRF+PFF156
and/or the territory falling below 40% NRF+PFF1? If ‘Yes’, then the territory may not contain enough
habitat after project implementation to support occupancy and reproduction. This would result in a LAA
determination for that territory unless otherwise noted.
LAA determination criterion #2: Will treatments result in the core and home range combined falling
below 20% NRF+PFF1? If ‘Yes’, then the territory may be affected to the extent that it can no longer

Post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas are NSO nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitats that were affected by moderate- or
high-severity fire but are within 500 feet of currently suitable (surviving) NRF habitats.
55 “Core” and “core area” are used interchangeably. This is the area within 0.5 mile of an NSO activity center (~503 acres).
Territory (aka home range): The area within 1.3 miles of an NSO activity center (~3,400 acres). The terms home range and
territory are often used interchangeably.
56 Post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas are NSO nesting/roosting or foraging (NRF) habitats that were affected by moderate- or
high-severity fire but are within 500 feet of currently suitable (surviving) NRF habitats.
54

Final Environmental Impact Statement

support occupancy by even non-breeding individual (resident single) NSO. This would result in a LAA
determination for that territory unless otherwise noted.
LAA determination criterion #3: Within a NSO core viable for reproduction (at least 40% NRF+PFF1 in
the core and 30% in the territory), will any area that is designated as “selected for” (or “highly selected
for”) in RHS57 and mapped as suitable NRF be subject to loud and continuous noise disturbance during
the NSO breeding season? If ‘Yes’, then treatment will result in a LAA for that territory, unless otherwise
noted. Project resource protection measures (RPMs) require NSO pre-disturbance searches of all highvalue NSO cores in the designated LOP exemption areas, and application of LOP’s if nesting is observed
or searches cannot be completed. As a result, the LAA determination for disturbance will not apply to
these territories.
Five percent criterion: In addition to the determination criteria listed above, owl territories that have more
than a minimal amount of suitable habitat affected by project activities may be adversely affected even if
little or no habitat is downgraded or removed. STNF and the Yreka Office of the US Fish and Wildlife
Service (YFWO) used ESA criteria to establish a minimum threshold of habitat effects that would merit a
more in-depth analysis. As defined in the ESA, a discountable effect is extremely unlikely to occur, and
based on best judgment, a person will not expect these effects to occur. Insignificant effects relate to the
size of the impact and will not be expected to reach the scale where NSO “take” occurs. A person using
the best available data will not be able to meaningfully measure, detect or evaluate insignificant effects.
Effects meeting these definitions are not likely to adversely affect the listed species. As a result of this
collaborative process, all territories where more than 5% of the core and/or the territory as a whole
consists of NRF or PFF1 habitat that may be negatively affected by project activities receive a more
detailed analysis. Five percent is the minimal figure below which STNF and YFWO determined that
potential effects would be insignificant or discountable.
Primary factors considered in these analyses include the total amount of habitat affected, the distribution
of this habitat in the core and territory, its proximity to the activity center, and its slope position. Other
major factors considered are the RPMs that have been incorporated into the project design. RPMs
decrease the potential effects to NSO habitat suitability in many areas by prohibiting or limiting salvage
opportunities, and requiring a higher level of coarse woody debris (CWD) retention.
Affected environment
The analysis area covers a large portion of the South Fork and Trinity River Management Units, and
vegetative communities are highly variable across this area. The most common vegetation types are
typified by mixed conifers in the overstory, oaks and other hardwoods in the understory, and shrubs, forbs
and grasses comprising the ground cover. The mixed conifer forests in the action area are typically
dominated by Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine and incense cedar. Higher-elevation sites provide favorable
conditions for white fir, and the high-elevation sites on South Fork Mountain support forests dominated
by red fir. Common hardwood trees in the understory of conifer forests in the action area include Pacific
madrone, California black oak, canyon live oak, Oregon white oak and alder. Many sites with shallow,
rocky soils and southerly and westerly aspects have harsh growing conditions. As a result, the primary
vegetation in many of these areas consists of oaks, shrubs, forbs and grasses rather than coniferous trees.
The wildfires of 2015 burned approximately 144,000 acres on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. All
proposed treatment areas are within the perimeters of these wildfires. Proposed treatments are spread
widely across this area, with highly variable vegetative conditions ranging from old-growth conifer forest
57 Relative

Habitat Suitability (RHS) modeling was developed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to identify areas most likely
to support NSO survival and reproduction. It incorporates documented NSO occurrences as well as abiotic factors such as slope
position, proximity to water, and habitat suitability in adjacent areas. RHS modeling was a key component of the review and
revision of the NSO Revised Recovery Plan and NSO Critical Habitat designation, completed by FWS in 2011 and 2012,
respectively. RHS identifies lands as either highly selected for, selected for, selected against, or highly selected against (by NSO).

91

to high-severity fire areas with little living vegetation. Fire severity was typically lower in areas
dominated by late-seral forest vegetation, and higher in early-seral habitats.
NSO habitat needs
The key limiting habitat for this species is nesting habitat, which is generally limited to late seral forests
that contain suitable nesting platform structures such as cavities, broken tree tops, and mistletoe brooms
(Forsman et al. 1984; Gutierrez et al. 1995; Courtney et al. 2004). Many studies conducted during decades
of research have documented that northern spotted owl survival and occupancy are positively correlated
with increased amounts of late-successional forest. Forest stands used by the owl usually have a high
canopy closure and high structural diversity (Dugger et al. 2005, Forsman et al. 1984, Thomas et al.
1990).
Small mammals such as the dusky-footed woodrat comprise the bulk of their diet though other mammals,
birds, reptiles and insects are also preyed upon. Descriptions of foraging habitat range from forest stands
with complex structure to forests with lower canopy closure and smaller diameter trees than those
associated with nesting/roosting habitat (Thomas et al. 1990, USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2008a, Solis
and Gutierrez 1990, Gutierrez 1996).
Dispersal habitat, at a minimum, consists of stands with adequate tree size and canopy closure to provide
protection from avian predators. Fledgling owls disperse from nest territories typically from September to
November (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2008a).
Critical Habitat consists of specific geographic areas that contain features essential for the conservation of
a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection (USDI Fish
and Wildlife Service 2008a). Direct effects to designated Critical Habitat are those effects that would alter
the current suitability of the habitat to maintain Physical and Biological Features (PBFs) or that would
affect the potential of the area to develop and maintain these features. Although indirect effects to a
species through habitat manipulation do not occur if the animal is not present, effects to Critical Habitat
may occur regardless of the presence or absence of the listed species.

Environmental Consequences
Species Addressed and Dropped from Detailed Discussion
The ESA determination for the following species under the preferred alternative is “no effect (see the
project wildlife BA). The rationale is repeated below. It is also applicable to all of the other project
alternatives, which have very similar project footprints. As a result, the appropriate ESA determination for
each of these species under any of the project alternatives is “no effect.”
Fisher, or Pacific fisher (Pekania pennanti, formerly Martes pennanti)
The fisher occurs in the project area and may be affected by project activities. On April 14, 2016 FWS
announced that the fisher does not warrant listing under the federal ESA (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service
2016a) and potential effects to this species are therefore not analyzed under ESA. The fisher remains a US
Forest Service Region 5 Sensitive species, and potential effects to this species is analyzed in the project
wildlife Biological Evaluation.
Gray wolf (Canis lupus)
A gray wolf designated OR7 by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) dispersed from his
home pack in Oregon and entered California in December, 2011. He returned to Oregon in 2013, mated,
and sired pups in 2014. His pack in Oregon is designated as the Rogue Pack. In May and July, 2015
images of an adult wolf were captured on a trail camera in Siskiyou County, California. Additional
cameras were placed in the vicinity and in August, 2015 images of two separate adult wolves and five
pups were recorded. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) designated these animals

92

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

the Shasta Pack. A wolf pack was also recently documented on Forest Service lands in Lassen County.
This pack produced at least three pups in 2017 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2017).
Territory size is a function of several interdependent factors that include pack size, prey size and
abundance, prey migration patterns, prey vulnerability, habitat type and latitude. Territory size is highly
variable, typically ranging from 20-400 square miles, varying year-to-year, and tending to be smaller in
lower latitudes (Mech and Boitani 2003; Fuller et al. 2003; USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2013; Wiles
et al. 2011; Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife 2010). As CDFW stated in their 2016 Conservation
Plan (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2016), there are many uncertainties regarding where and
how quickly wolves will colonize and establish territories in California, and making any predictions about
average territory size at this point is purely speculative.
Although there may be habitats near the project area that are suitable for wolves (e.g., wet meadows),
there has been no confirmed presence of gray wolves in California besides the observations cited above,
and the closest of these wolf sites is approximately 70-90 miles from the proposed treatment areas
(Anderson, pers. comm.). The project area is thus well outside the known range of this species. There is
also no critical habitat designated for the gray wolf in California at this time (USDI Fish and Wildlife
Service 1978). Therefore, this project will have no effect on this species or its critical habitat, and this
species will not be further discussed in this document.
Marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus)
The project lies outside the known range of the marbled murrelet. This species spends most of the time in
Pacific coastal waters and nests in old-growth trees in moist forests near the coast (Madsen et al. 1999,
McShane et al. 2004). The areas proposed for treatment that are closest to the coast are approximately 34
miles from the Pacific Ocean, and all areas proposed for treatment are in drier and less humid forest
ecosystems not suitable for marbled murrelets. Therefore, the species will not be affected by this project
and will not be further discussed in this document.
Western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus ssp. nivosus aka Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)
The Pacific coastal population of this species is listed as threatened. The proposed project is well outside
the known range of the Pacific coastal population, and no observations of this species are recorded within
30 miles of the project area in the Forest wildlife database or in the California Natural Diversity Database
(CNDDB). Therefore, the species will not be affected by this project and will not be further discussed in
this document.
Yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus)
The Western U.S. distinct population segment (DPS) of this species is listed as threatened. The proposed
project is well outside the known range of the Western US DPS of this species (Hughes 2015), and no
observations of this species are recorded within 45 miles of the project area in the Forest wildlife database
or in CNDDB. Therefore, the species will not be affected by this project and will not be further discussed
in this document.
California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii)
The areas proposed for treatment are well outside the known range of the California red-legged frog
(USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2002). This frog’s historic range includes Shasta but not Trinity County,
and is restricted to lower elevation areas in the Sacramento Valley. There are no known populations of the
red-legged frog on STNF. Therefore, the species will not be affected by this project and will not be further
discussed in this document.
Delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys), and steelhead
(Oncorhynchus mykiss)
These fisheries species will be analyzed, if warranted, in the project fisheries reports.
93

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Conservancy fairy shrimp (Branchinecta conservatio), vernal pool fairy shrimp, (Branchinecta
lynchi) and vernal pool tadpole shrimp (Lepidurus packardi)
The proposed project is well outside the known range of these species (UDSI Fish and Wildlife Service
1994), and no observations of these species are recorded within 30 miles of the project area in the STNF
wildlife database or in CNDDB. Therefore, these species will not be affected by this project and will not
be further discussed in this document.
Valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus)
The valley elderberry longhorn beetle is known from locations on the American River, Putah Creek, and
the Merced River, and occurs along the Sacramento River from southern Shasta County to Fresno County
(USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 1984). The areas proposed for treatment lie well outside the expected
range of this species. Therefore, the species will not be affected by this project and will not be further
discussed in this document.
Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), Hoover’s spurge (Chamayesyce hooveri), McDonald’s rock cress
(Arabis macdonaldiana), and slender Orcutt grass (Orcuttia tenuis)
These plant species will be analyzed, if warranted, in the project botany reports.
Effects to Northern Spotted Owls (NSO’s)
The only species listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act and present in the project area is the
northern spotted owl (NSO). The project wildlife Biological assessment includes a detailed description of
NSO life history and habitat needs, and an analysis of the effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) on
NSO and NSO Critical Habitat.
Alternative 1 - Proposed Action
This alternative allows treatments of a 300-foot total width buffer (up to 275 feet on one side of the road,
and a minimum of 25 feet on the other side). The width of the buffer on either side of the road could
change but would not exceed 300 feet; i.e. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the
uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated 25 feet
from the road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. The maximum
area of treatment is approximately 8,000 acres.
Because the exact location of treatment at any given point along a road is unknown, this analysis assumes
treatment of the entire 600-foot width within which treatments may occur. This will result in roughly
twice the number of acres analyzed as will actually be treated, and as a result this analysis greatly
overestimates the potential effects to NSO.
Potential effects of Alternative 1 on this species are analyzed in detail in the wildlife Biological
Assessment and incorporated into this document by reference. Briefly, the determination for 12 of the 92
NSO activity centers in the action area is “May Affect, Likely to Adversely Affect” (MALAA) for one or
more of the following reasons:


Exemptions to the limited operating periods incorporated into the project design may not prevent
disturbance or direct effects to NSO that would affect their ability to nest and rear young
successfully (7 NSO territories).



Effects to nesting/roosting and foraging (NRF) and/or post-fire foraging type 1 (PFF1) habitats
are substantial in scope and scale within the NSO territory, and project resource protection
measures (RPMs) do not reduce these effects to the point that they are insignificant or
discountable (6 NSO territories).

The determination for the remaining 80 NSO activity centers in the action area is “May Affect, Not
Likely to Adversely Affect” (MANLAA) for the following reasons:

Nesting/roosting, foraging and dispersal habitats will be degraded by project activities, but will
not be downgraded or removed.58.



Effects are not expected to reduce any of these NSO territories below their current capacity to
support NSO survival/reproduction (i.e., convert nesting territories to territories supporting only
non-nesting pairs or singles, or convert non-nesting territories to territories not capable of
supporting even single NSO’s).



Project design features will decrease the potential effects of treatments in areas of high value to
NSO’s, especially in nesting/roosting and foraging habitats.



Limited operating periods are incorporated into the project design to reduce disturbance or direct
effects to NSO that would potentially impact nesting and rearing of young.

In 7 NSO territories that had a MANLAA determination due to the preferred alternative alone, the
combination of these activities and reasonably foreseeable non-federal actions may cause effects that are
not insignificant or discountable, leading to an LAA determination. In 2 territories with an LAA
determination due to the preferred alternative, reasonably foreseeable non-federal actions may increase
effects to NSO.
Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative
The actual effects of Alternative 2 on NSO in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of
Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will
actually be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO
habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is
likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats
will be downgraded/removed).
Because this alternative includes fuelbreaks on approximately 16 miles of roads, tree removal will occur
on more acres than under Alternative 1. As a result, CWD in the form of logs and snags will be reduced
on a larger number of acres. However, the project resource protection measures detailed under Alternative
1, including the CWD retention measures, will also apply within the fuelbreak treatment areas. These
measures will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD, an important habitat element for NSO prey
species. The restriction of live tree removal to trees 10” DBH or less in the fuelbreak areas will greatly
limit potential reduction in canopy cover, especially in the late-seral forests that are most suitable for this
species. The canopy in these stands is dominated by large-diameter trees, and removal of small-diameter
trees will have little effect on overall canopy cover levels. Pruning lower branches of live trees is
expected to have no measurable effect on canopy cover or any other habitat element important to NSO’s,
and may increase suitability for dispersal and foraging by leaving the understory more accommodating to
NSO flight.
The NSO territories that include fuelbreak treatments are assessed here individually because the
fuelbreaks are wider than the treatment areas proposed in Alternative 1, and may have a greater effect on
NSO. Those with a LAA determination under Alternative 1 are also assessed here to identify potential
differences between these two alternatives. Although the actual effects of non-fuelbreak treatments will
be very similar between Alternatives 1 and 2, a wider buffer of potential treatments was assessed in
Alternative 1. As a result, the calculation of effects on individual NSO territories may be greater or lesser
under Alternative 2 than under Alternative 1. Overall, two NSO territories (TRI0023 and TRI0258) that
The term degrade signifies when treatments influence the quality of habitat by the removal or reduction of habitat elements but
not to the degree where existing habitat function is changed. The term downgrade applies to treatments that reduce habitat
elements to the degree the habitat will not function in the capacity that exists pre-treatment, but activities will not remove habitat
entirely (i.e., downgrade from nesting/roosting to foraging). The term removed pertains to treatments that reduce habitat elements
to the degree that habitat will no longer function as suitable for NSO.

Alternative 3 - Wider Buffer Alternative
The potential effects to NSO under this alternative are similar to the results of the Alternative 1 analysis.
Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO habitat suitability
compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is likely to be the
same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be
downgraded/removed). All NSO determinations are the same under Alternative 3 as Alternative 1, but the
number of acres impacted would be more under this alternative due to the treatments actually occurring in
the entire buffer. The impacts are not overestimated for Alternative 3 as they are for Alternative 1.
Alternative 4 - Northern Spotted Owl Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, but treatments will be restricted inside suitable NSO habitats.
Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only. No tree
removal or fuels reduction will occur. Identified salvage opportunities will be allowed on 1,831 fewer
acres than under Alternative 1, so the extent of tree removal will be more limited. Fuels treatments are
allowed on 4,404 fewer acres than under Alternative 1, so more CWD will be retained in the project
area61.
This alternative is likely to adversely affect the same NSO territories as Alternative 1, but effects under
this alternative are primarily effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and
PFF1 habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch
trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this
alternative will degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will downgrade/remove PFF1 habitats.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Although the same NSO activity centers that are adversely affected under Alternative 1 will be adversely
affected under Alternative 4, the potential effects to NSO overall will be more limited in magnitude than
the effects of Alternative 1.
Long-term effects of this alternative compared to Alternatives 1-3 include higher residual fuel loading
levels and increased fire hazard. This will result in a higher risk of widespread loss of suitable NSO
habitats to high-severity wildfire.
Alternative 5 - Minimum Impact Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 4, but treatments will be even more restricted (Attachment 3).
The areas where restrictions will apply include all suitable NSO habitats, plus riparian reserves,
inventoried roadless areas, and at-risk watersheds. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard
tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only, and no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Outside of
these areas, treatments proposed are the same as Alternative 1, with the exception that no commercial
timber sale removal will be allowed in any treatment areas.
As with Alternative 4, this alternative is also likely to adversely affect the same NSO territories as
Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF
and PFF1 habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential
perch trees for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1,
this will degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will downgrade/remove PFF1 habitats. Although
the same NSO territories that are adversely affected under Alternative 1 will be adversely affected under
alternative 5, the potential effects to NSO overall will be more limited than the effects of Alternatives 1 or
4.
Long-term effects of this alternative compared to Alternatives 1-4 include higher residual fuel loading
levels and increased fire hazard. This will result in a higher risk of widespread loss of suitable NSO
habitats to high-severity wildfire. The residual fuel levels will likely be the highest of any of the action
alternatives, and the risk of habitat loss will also be higher than any other action alternative.
Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative
This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no direct or indirect effects on NSO’s. Under
this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue
to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be
achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative on NSO include continued limitations on use of the
existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and a higher risk of widespread loss
of suitable NSO habitats to high-severity wildfire.
Cumulative Effects to NSO
Under the Endangered Species Act, cumulative effects “are those effects of future State, tribal, or private
activities, not involving Federal activities, that are reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the
Federal action subject to consultation” [50 CFR §402.02]. Analysis of cumulative effects under the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) addresses the impact on the environment that results from the
incremental impact of the proposed action when added to other past, present and reasonable foreseeable
future actions, regardless of which agency (federal or non-federal) or person undertakes these actions (40
CFR 1508.7-Cumulative Impact). ESA cumulative effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) are
described in detail in the project wildlife Biological Assessment. This analysis differs from the analysis in
the project wildlife Biological Assessment in that it addresses all project alternatives, and includes the
effects of other foreseeable federal actions (Attachment 4 of the Project Wildlife Report).
As with the Biological Assessment, this cumulative effects analysis is bounded in space and time to
properly evaluate whether there will be an overlap of effects caused by this project in combination with
effects of other past, present, or future foreseeable actions. Relative to the NSO, the cumulative effects

A time frame of 40 years beyond project implementation (which is expected to take up to 20 years) is
used for this cumulative effects analysis (see the BA for more details). The effects of past actions are
reflected in the description of currently existing conditions in the). A time frame of 35 years is used for
this cumulative effects analysis to reflect the NSO life span and the potential for effects to NSO that may
currently inhabit the project area. The effects of past actions are reflected in the description of currently
existing conditions in the wildlife Biological Assessment.
Alternative 1 - Proposed Action
ESA cumulative effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) are described in detail in the project
wildlife Biological Assessment. The analysis in Table 3-23. NEPA cumulative effects to NSO Alternative 1. Below is additive to the cumulative effects analysis in the BA, and addresses only the NSO
territories with other foreseeable federal actions with the potential to change the determination Table
3-23. Compared with the ESA cumulative effects analysis, NEPA cumulative effects analysis results in
one additional territory with a LAA determination (TRI0098).
The following foreseeable federal actions are not expected to have any effects on NSO that would result
in determinations that differ from those in the project wildlife Biological Assessment:
1. Grazing - This activity affects grasses and forbs, but is expected to have little or no effect on
factors important to NSO habitat suitability. Grazing on Forest Service lands in the action area is
also very low in intensity. As a result, this activity is not expected to have a meaningfully
measurable effect on habitat suitability for NSO.
2. Plantation thinning and reforestation- The plantations to be thinned are young regenerating stands
that are not suitable habitat for NSO. The NSO determination for the Middle Hayfork Precommercial Thinning project was “no effect” and the Westside Plantation Thin project will also
not affect any suitable NSO habitats. The reforestation of areas burned in the 2015 fires also has a
“no effect” determination for NSO. All NSO activity centers within the TPFHR&S action area
have a MANLAA or LAA determination. The plantation thinning projects addressed here will not
affect any suitable NSO habitats, and will not change the determinations for any NSO territories.
3. Log deck removal – This activity will remove logs that have already been cut and stacked along
roadsides (during fire suppression efforts). These activities will have no effect on any suitable
habitats, and will not cause loud and continuous noise disturbance that would result in a
MANLAA or LAA determination. The ESA determination for these activities is “no effect,” and
they will therefore not contribute to cumulative effects to NSO.
4. Transmission line maintenance – These activities include removal of vegetation encroaching on
established transmission line corridors. These corridors are not suitable habitats for NSO, and
LOP’s prevent loud and continuous noise disturbance that would result in a LAA determination.
All NSO activity centers within the action area for the proposed project have a MANLAA or
LAA determination, and transmission line maintenance activities on federal lands will not change
the determinations for any of these territories.
5. PG&E Hazard Tree Salvage – This project consists of removal of hazard trees felled along PG&E
transmission lines within the area burned in the 2015 wildfires. The ESA determination for these
activities is “no effect” and these activities are therefore not expected to contribute to cumulative
effects to NSO.

6. Mud Springs Fuelbreak – This project has a MANLAA determination for NSO. It is not within
any NSO activity centers affected by the proposed project, and will therefore not change the
determinations for any NSO territories in the TPFHR&S action area.
Projects that may contribute to cumulative effects and potentially change NSO determinations are listed
below and displayed on the Project NSO Habitat Map. Potential foreseeable effects of these actions on
these NSO are addressed in Table 3-23.
1. Private lands harvest – Timber harvest plans and exemptions on private lands in the analysis area.
Effects of these activities on NSO range from maintaining NRF habitat conditions (e.g., treatment
of dead, dying and diseased trees) to habitat removal (e.g., clearcuts). See the Project BA
cumulative effects section and attachment #9 for a more detailed description of potential effects
to NSO.
2. Burnt Ranch – Vegetation management focusing on reducing fuels buildup and fire hazard around
Burnt Ranch, CA. These treatments will reduce NSO habitat suitability primarily by reducing
canopy cover and CWD/ through forest thinning and fuels reduction. These activities may
degrade, downgrade or remove NSO habitats.
3. Gemmill Thin – Vegetation management focusing on fuels reduction and accelerating
development of late-successional forest habitats near Wildwood, CA. These treatments will
reduce NSO habitat suitability primarily by reducing canopy cover and CWD through forest
thinning and fuels reduction. These activities may degrade, but not downgrade or remove NSO
habitats.
4. Roads and Plantations Pilot project – Vegetation management focusing on roadside fuels
reduction and shaded fuelbreak creation between Hayfork and Hyampom, CA. These treatments
may have effects similar to the Gemmill Thin and Burnt Ranch projects, but they are expected to
have less effect on NSO habitat suitability due to less intensive vegetation management and the
restriction of treatments primarily to narrow roadside corridors and plantations.
5. Trinity Alps prescribed Burn project – Prescribed burning in the Trinity Alps Wilderness Area.
These treatments will primarily reduce the density of shrubs and small trees, and decrease fuel
buildup within the Trinity Alps Wilderness. This may affect NSO habitat suitability primarily by
reducing existing levels of CWD/. These treatments will primarily reduce the density of shrubs
and small trees, and decrease fuel buildup within the Trinity Alps Wilderness. This may affect
NSO habitat suitability primarily by reducing existing levels of CWD. However, it is expected to
have little effect on canopy cover, and will reduce the likelihood of future wildfires destroying
NSO habitats. However, it is expected to have little effect on canopy cover, and will reduce the
likelihood of future wildfires destroying NSO habitats.
6. Sims projects – Fuels reduction and thinning in riparian corridors in the 2004 Sims Fire area.
Thinning is limited to small trees (<8” DBH) and is expected to have very minor effects on NSO
habitat suitability.
7. Six Rivers National Forest “From Fire Kill to Fuelbreaks” project - Small-scale roadside salvage
and fuels reduction in the portions of the 2015 wildfires that burned on the Six Rivers National
Forest.
Disturbance: Activities may cause some noise- and/or smoke-disturbance to NSO’s that are also affected
by the proposed project. However, noise- or smoke-disturbance does not accumulate over time in the way
effects to habitat conditions accumulate. NSO’s in this project area are also likely to be well-habituated to
the disturbances associated with roads and forest management activities, and have adapted to these
ongoing types of activities. In addition, LOP’s incorporated into this project and other Forest Service
projects will greatly reduce noise-generating and habitat-altering activities during the NSO breeding

season. NSO’s in the portions of the project areas that are exempt from LOP’s already have a “likely to
adversely affect” determination because of this exemption, and NSO’s in other areas are protected by
project LOP’s. As a result, cumulative noise impacts, should they occur, are not expected to result in any
significant cumulative effects to NSO’s that would change the ESA determinations.

Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative
As stated above, the actual effects of Alternative 2 on NSO in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to
those of Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of
acres will be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to
NSO habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat
functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded, and PFF1 habitats will be
downgraded/removed). NEPA cumulative effects to NSO in the non-fuelbreak areas will also be similar to
those of Alternative 1. NSO territories with foreseeable federal actions with the potential to change the
determination are assessed in Table 3-24. Affected acres in Alternative 2 are less than those reported in
the analysis of Alternative 1, and therefore have the potential for MALAA determinations for some of the
territories with an LAA determination in the BA. To determine whether this is the case, the territories with
LAA determinations in the BA and foreseeable federal actions within the territory are assessed in Table
3-24. Proposed fuelbreaks are wider than other potential treatments (600 feet), and may have greater
effects to NSO. However, there are no NSO territories that include both proposed fuelbreaks and future

foreseeable federal actions other than the proposed TPFHR&S project. Therefore, no additional analysis

treatments.

In the current location of this territory, proposed treatments under
Alternative 2 would affect 22 acres NRF and 11 acres PFF1 in the territory
(none in the core). Cumulative effects would thus be slightly less than
under Alternative 1, but are still likely to adversely affect NSO due to the
same factors cited in Table 3-23.
In the current location of this territory, proposed treatments under
Alternative 2 would affect 102 acres NRF in the territory and 29 acres in
the core. Cumulative effects would thus be somewhat less than under
Alternative 1, but are still likely to adversely affect NSO due primarily to
the extent of treatments in the proposed Burnt Ranch project (see Table 323).
In this territory, proposed treatments under Alternative 2 would affect 94
acres NRF and 9 acres PFF1 in the territory (29 acres NRF and 2 acres
PFF1 in the core). Cumulative effects would thus be somewhat less than
under Alternative 1, but are still likely to adversely affect NSO due
primarily to extensive activities anticipated on private lands (see Table 323).
In this territory, proposed treatments under Alternative 2 would affect 18
acres NRF in the territory and 7 acres in the core. Cumulative effects
would thus be slightly less than under Alternative 1, but are still likely to
adversely affect NSO due primarily to the extent of treatments in the
proposed Burnt Ranch project (see Table 3-23).

Alternative 3 - Wider Buffer Alternative
This alternative allows treatment of the entire 600-foot total width buffer that is analyzed under
Alternative 1. As a result, the potential NEPA cumulative effects to NSO under this alternative are similar
to those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will
increase effects to NSO habitat suitability compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation
habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF habitats will be degraded by the proposed
treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be downgraded/removed); therefore, cumulative effects are similar to
the Alternative 1 analysis, but somewhat more intensive due to removal of dying hazard trees in addition
to dead hazard trees.
Alternative 4 - Northern Spotted Owl Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, but treatments will be restricted inside suitable NSO habitats.
Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only; no tree
removal or fuels reduction will occur. As a result, the extent of tree removal will be more limited and
more CWD will be retained in the project area.
This alternative is likely to adversely affect the same habitats as Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects
of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and PFF1 habitats by effectively converting
snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the availability
of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this alternative will degrade but not downgrade
NRF habitats, and will downgrade/remove PFF1 habitats. Although the same NSO habitats will be

113

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

adversely affected, the potential NEPA cumulative effects to NSO overall will be more limited in
magnitude than the effects of Alternative 1.
Alternative 5 - Minimum Impact Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 4, but treatments will be even more restricted. The areas where
restrictions will apply include all suitable NSO habitats, plus riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas,
and at-risk watersheds. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting
dead trees only, and no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Outside of these areas, treatments
proposed are the same as Alternative 4, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal will be
allowed in any treatment areas.
As with Alternative 4, this alternative is also likely to adversely affect the same habitats as Alternative 1
due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement. This treatment will affect both NRF and PFF1
habitats by effectively converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees
for NSO and modify the availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this will
degrade but not downgrade NRF habitats, and will downgrade/remove PFF1 habitats. Although the same
NSO habitats will be adversely affected as with Alternative 1, the potential cumulative effects to NSO
overall will be more limited than the effects of Alternatives 1 or 4.
Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative
This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no direct or indirect effects on NSO’s. Under
this alternative, no vegetation will be treated, and no reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be
achieved. As a result, this alternative would not contribute to short-term cumulative effects to NSO
habitats.
Long-term effects of this alternative include continued limitations on use of the existing road system for
wildfire suppression. This alternative will therefore likely contribute to long-term cumulative effects to
NSO by contributing to more widespread loss of suitable NSO habitats to high-severity wildfire. The
other foreseeable activities on federal and non-federal lands in the analysis area may ameliorate this effect
by reducing available fuels.
Effects to NSO Critical Habitat
The project wildlife Biological Assessment includes a detailed description of the physical and biological
features (PBF’s) of NSO Critical Habitat, and the effects of the proposed action (Alternative 1) on NSO
Critical Habitat. This section summarizes the effects of Alternative 1, and analyzes the potential effects of
Alternatives 2-6 on NSO Critical Habitat.
For the NSO, the PBF’s essential to the conservation of the species are forested areas that are used or
likely to be used for nesting, roosting, foraging, or dispersing. PBFs provide one or more of the following
life-history requirements:
Space for individual and population growth and for normal behavior;
Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;
Cover or shelter;
Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing (or development) of offspring; and
Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historical, geographical,
and ecological distributions of a species.
Alternative 1 - Proposed Action






Briefly, the Proposed Action is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat for the following reasons:
1. Although project RPMs will limit effects to snags (potential NSO foraging perches and/or shelter
for prey species), particularly to snags existing before the 2015 wildfires, snag density in suitable

114

Final Environmental Impact Statement

habitats within NSO Critical Habitat will be reduced in treatment areas to an extent that may not
be insignificant or discountable.
2. Although project RPMs will limit reduction of CWD in treatment areas, CWD levels in some
suitable habitats within NSO Critical Habitat may be reduced to an extent that is not insignificant
or discountable.
However, the effect on the PBFs of NSO Critical Habitat will be limited for the following reasons:
1. Treatments will degrade but not downgrade or remove any vegetation types designated by the
2012 final Critical Habitat rule as NSO nesting/roosting, foraging or dispersal habitats.
2. Project RPMs will decrease the potential effects of treatments in areas of high value to NSO’s,
especially in nesting/roosting and foraging habitats.
3. Potential effects to NSO’s resulting from treatments in post-fire foraging areas will be greatly
limited by the narrow width of treatments and the proximity of all PFF1 treatment acres to
untreated areas.
Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative
Like Alternative 1, Alternative 2 is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat. The effects of
Alternative 2 on NSO Critical Habitat in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of Alternative 1.
The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will actually be
affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase effects to NSO Critical
Habitat PBFs compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation habitat functionality is
likely to be the same (i.e. NRF and dispersal habitats will be degraded but not downgraded by the
proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be downgraded/removed).
This alternative includes 2,178 acres of fuelbreak treatments, along approximately 16 miles of roads. As a
result, CWD in the form of logs and snags will be reduced on a larger number of acres than under
Alternative 1 in these areas. However, the project resource protection measures detailed under Alternative
1, including the CWD retention measures, will also apply to the fuelbreak treatment areas. These
measures will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD, an important habitat element for NSO prey
species. The restriction of live tree removal to trees 10” DBH or less in the fuelbreak areas will limit the
potential reduction in canopy cover, especially in the late-successional forests that are most suitable for
this species. The canopy in these stands is dominated by large-diameter trees, and removal of smalldiameter trees will have a minimal effect on overall canopy cover levels. These measures will limit the
extent of effects to NSO Critical Habitat. Pruning lower branches of live trees is expected to have little or
no effect on canopy cover or any other habitat element important to the PBF’s of NSO Critical Habitat.
Alternative 3 - Wider Buffer Alternative
This alternative allows treatment of the entire 600-foot total width buffer that is analyzed under
Alternative 1. As a result, the potential effects to NSO Critical Habitat under this alternative are similar to
those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase
effects to NSO Critical Habitat PBFs compared to Alternative 1, but the overall post-implementation
habitat functionality is likely to be the same (i.e. NRF and dispersal habitats will be degraded by the
proposed treatments, and PFF1 habitats will be downgraded/removed).
Alternative 4 - Northern Spotted Owl Alternative
The effects of this alternative on NSO Critical Habitat are likely to be similar to the effects of Alternative
1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement, and this alternative is likely to adversely affect
NSO Critical Habitat. Hazard tree abatement will affect NRF and dispersal habitats by effectively
converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the
availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this alternative will degrade but not
115

Final Environmental Impact Statement

downgrade NRF or dispersal habitats. The potential effects to NSO Critical Habitat PBFs overall will be
more limited in magnitude than the effects of Alternative 1.
Alternative 5 - Minimum Impact Alternative
As with Alternative 4, the effects of this alternative on NSO Critical Habitat are likely to be similar to the
effects of Alternative 1 due primarily to the effects of hazard tree abatement, and this alternative is likely
to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat. This treatment will affect NSO habitats by effectively
converting snags into logs, which will reduce the number of potential perch trees for NSO and modify the
availability of CWD for NSO prey species. As with Alternative 1, this will degrade but not downgrade
NRF or dispersal habitats, and downgrade/remove PFF1 habitats. The potential effects to NSO Critical
Habitat PBFs overall will be more limited than the effects of Alternatives 1 or 4.
Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative
This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no immediate effect on NSO Critical Habitat
Units. Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires
will continue to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard
will be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative within NSO Critical Habitat include continued
limitations on use of the existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and more
widespread loss of NSO habitat within Critical Habitat Units to high-severity wildfire.

Sensitive Wildlife Species

The Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) provides
protection for sensitive wildlife species in the form of management goals to maintain or increase existing
viable populations of sensitive species (Forest Plan pages 3-26, 4-5). Impacts to wildlife sensitive species
are addressed in the project Biological Evaluation and summarized in Table 3-25.

Bald eagles

The Forest Plan requires protection of known bald eagle nest sites (Forest Plan p. 3-27). There is one
known site that may be affected by project activities, approximately 5 miles northwest of Hyampom, CA
(T4N R6E, HM). The existing management plan for this site recommends a restriction on noise
disturbance within 0.75 mi of the nest site. Accordingly, an LOP will be imposed on all activities causing
loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its
breeding season. This LOP will apply from January 1 through August 15 to all areas within 0.75 mi of the
nest site (see Figure 3- 8 and Attachment 5 of the Project Wildlife Report). Surveys to protocol can be
used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol compliant surveys show no nesting
activity within 0.75 miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOP’s may be lifted.

Northern goshawks

The Forest Plan requires protection of known northern goshawk nest sites (Forest Plan p. 3-27). There are
three known sites that may be affected by project activities, approximately 5 miles northeast of
Wildwood, CA (T30N R10W, MDM). An LOP will be imposed on all activities causing loud and
continuous noise disturbance or smoke that will potentially disturb this species during its breeding season.
This LOP will apply from February 1 through August 15 to all areas within 0.5 mi of the nest sites (Figure
3-9). Surveys to protocol can be used to generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol
compliant surveys show no nesting activity within 0.5 miles of proposed activities at the time of
implementation, LOPs may be lifted.

Peregrine falcons

The Forest Plan requires protection of known peregrine falcon nest sites (Forest Plan p. 3-27). There are
no known peregrine falcon nest sites that would be affected by project activities.

White-headed woodpeckers, black-backed woodpeckers, pygmy
nuthatches, and flammulated owls
Requirements for white-headed woodpeckers, black-backed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, and
flammulated owls are designed “to maintain adequate numbers of large snags and green-tree replacements
for future snags in appropriate forest types within the range of these four species “in sufficient numbers to
maintain 100 percent of potential population levels.” “Snags over 20 inches DBH are particularly
valuable for these species. Snags over 20 inches DBH may be marked for cutting only after retaining the
best available snags (considering size, longevity, etc.) in sufficient numbers to meet 100 percent of
potential population levels of these four species. It is recognized, however, that safety considerations may
prevent always retaining all snags. Use of standardized definitions of hazard trees is required. For the
longer term, provide for sufficient numbers of green trees to provide for the full (100 percent) population
potential of each species.” (Forest Plan pp. 4-63/64).
Specific snag levels to achieve this goal are: 0.60 conifer snags >15” DBH per acre (or largest available)
in soft decay stages for white-headed woodpeckers and pygmy nuthatches, and 0.12 conifer snags per
acre >17 inches DBH (or largest available) in hard decay stages for black-backed woodpeckers. These
standards are also assumed to provide adequate snag and snag retention levels for flammulated owls
(Forest Plan pp. 4-63/64).
The project area is outside the known range of white-headed woodpeckers, black-backed woodpeckers,
and pygmy nuthatches, and there are no recorded observations of these species in or near the project area.
Flammulated owls, white-headed woodpeckers, and pygmy nuthatches may occur within the project area
or be affected by project activities. Because of natural mortality and the effects of the 2015 wildfires, the
density of snags in the project area is far in excess of recommended levels. Project activities will remove
snags from a narrow strip of land near existing roads, and these treatments will affect a very small
percentage (5-6%) of the burned area. As a result, the density of snags available to these species in the
project area is expected to remain well above the recommended levels after project implementation.
The project area is outside the known range of black-backed woodpeckers, and there are no recorded
observations of this species in or near the project area.

Survey and Manage Wildlife Species
Introduction

Survey and Manage requirements were established to address little-known species that were believed to
be associated with old-growth and late-successional forest micro-habitats, and for which species experts
were unsure whether the Late-Successional Reserve (LSR) system was sufficient to provide for their
conservation. The purpose of this report is to assess potential effects of the proposed Trinity Post-Fire
Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project in sufficient detail to determine whether it is consistent with
current Survey and Manage requirements. Table 3-26 and the analysis following it address all Survey and
Manage wildlife species assessed, requirements for pre-disturbance surveys and/or protecting known
sites, and determinations of potential effects of project activities.
Of the eleven wildlife Survey and Manage species analyzed in this report, eight are also designated as
Forest Service Sensitive species. These species are addressed in the project Wildlife Survey and Manage
Report using the criteria that apply to Survey and Manage species, and addressed in the project Wildlife
Biological Evaluation using the criteria that apply to Forest Service Sensitive species.

Compliance with Law, Regulations, Policy, and the Forest Plan

Forest Service guidance under the Northwest Forest Plan and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and
Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) requires the agency to analyze projects for potential impacts to
Survey and Manage Species. The Survey and Manage program is a result of the 2001 Record of Decision
and Standards & Guidelines for Amendments to Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other
Mitigation Measure Standards & Guidelines (USDA et. al.2001a). The species listed in the 2001 Survey
and Manage Record of Decision (ROD) were selected “to more efficiently provide the level of species
protection intended in the Northwest Forest Plan...for the management of habitat for late-successional and
old-growth forest related species within the range of the northern spotted owl” (p. 1). Modifications to the
requirements in the ROD included a Settlement Agreement filed on July 6, 2011, in Conservation
Northwest [and others] v. Sherman, Case No. C08-1067-JCC (W.D. Wash).
On April 25, 2013 the 9th Circuit Court reversed the District Court's approval of the 2011 Settlement
Agreement, concluding that "Because the consent decree allows for substantial, permanent amendments
to Survey and Manage, it impermissibly conflicts with laws governing the process for such amendments"
(Conservation Northwest [and others] v. Sherman [and others], No. 11-35729 [9th Cir.] No. 08-1067-JCC
[W.D. Wash]). The 9th Circuit Court remanded the decision to the District Court for further proceedings
consistent with its opinion. The District Court issued a remedy order on February 18, 2014 (Conservation
Northwest v. Bonnie, W.WA No. C08-1067-JCC). As a result, the 2011 Settlement Agreement is invalid
and the order issued by Judge Coughenour (Conservation Northwest [and others] v. Rey [and others] No.
08-1067) on December 17, 2009 is still valid. Consequently, the Forest Service Pacific Southwest and
Pacific Northwest Regions are currently working under the 2001 Survey and Manage Record of Decision
and the December 2003 species list (USDA, 2014).

Proposed Actions and Alternatives Analyzed
For a detailed description of the alternatives considered for this analysis, please see Chapter 2 of this
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

Methodology
This analysis is based on species occurrence data documented in National Forest wildlife databases
(Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests) and the California Natural Diversity Database,
maintained by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. For this analysis, potential effects were
assessed based primarily on the likelihood and intensity of effects to habitat characteristics favorable for
these species, such as high canopy cover levels and moist micro-habitats.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The Survey and Manage program requires pre-disturbance field surveys for some species where
appropriate (Table 3-26). Line officers have discretion to determine whether or not conditions warrant
additional surveys. The ROD Standards & Guidelines (p. 22) stipulate that “The line officer should seek
specialists’ recommendations to help determine the need for a survey based on site-specific information.
In making such determination, the line officer should consider the probability of the species being present
on the project site, as well as the probability that the project would cause a significant negative effect on
the species habitat or the persistence of the species at the site.”
Three evaluation criteria were used to determine whether a proposed project triggers the need for field
surveys: 1. species range, 2. habitat suitability, and 3. the potential for project activities to degrade habitat
or cause disturbance (Duncan et al., 2003). Evaluation of these criteria is presented in Table 3-26 and the
analysis following it. Additional surveys were determined to be unwarranted for the following reasons: 1.)
Areas where intensive treatments are proposed have been heavily affected by wildfire, and habitat
suitability for Survey and Manage mollusk species is very low; and 2.) Areas that are highly suitable for
Survey and Manage mollusk species will have low-intensity treatments and extensive resource protection
measures (RPMs) and these treatments are unlikely to have a meaningfully measurable effect on habitat
suitability or persistence of these species.

Affected Environment

The analysis area covers a large portion of the South Fork and Trinity River Management Units, and
vegetative communities are highly variable across this area. The most common vegetation types are
typified by mixed conifers in the overstory, oaks and other hardwoods in the understory, and shrubs, forbs
and grasses comprising the ground cover.

Environmental Consequences

Table 3-26 displays the management requirements for the wildlife Survey and Manage species on the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The majority of these species do not occur in the project area, and thus
will not be affected by proposed activities under any of the project alternatives.

Alternative 1 – Proposed Action
This alternative allows treatments of a 300-foot total width buffer (up to 275 feet on one side of the road,
and a minimum of 25 feet on the other side). The width of the buffer on either side of the road could
change but would not exceed 300 feet; i.e. if conditions lend to a wider treatment on the uphill side, the
uphill side may be treated up to 275 feet from the road and the downhill side would be treated 25 feet
from the road. The minimum treatment area along either side of the road will be 25 feet. The maximum
area of treatment is approximately 8,000 acres.
Because the exact location of treatment at any given point along a road is unknown, this analysis
considers treatment impacts to the entire 600-foot width buffer to ensure that any suitable habitat or
known locations of Survey and Manage species are addressed in this analysis. This will result in roughly

123

twice the number of acres analyzed as will actually be treated, and as a result this analysis greatly
overestimates the potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife species.
Direct and Indirect Effects

H elminthoglypta talmadgei (Klamath shoulderband snail)
50T

H. talmadgei is classified as a Category D Survey and Manage species. The management objective for
these species is to “Identify and manage high-priority sites to provide for a reasonable assurance of
species persistence.” Pre-disturbance surveys are not required for Category D species (ROD S&G p. 11).
H. talmadgei occurs in stable rock talus and rockslides in limestone substrates, especially near springs or
streams. On moist, north-facing slopes they can also occur under woody debris, moss and leaf mold. This
species feeds on herbaceous plants, and overhead vegetative cover appears to be an important habitat
element for shading and food (Duncan et al. 1999; USDI, 1999). This species is common and welldistributed across the South Fork and Trinity River Management Units, and observations have been
recorded near and within proposed treatment areas. Project activities have the potential to affect H.
talmadgei by directly impacting individuals during project implementation, or modifying habitat in ways
that reduce its suitability for this species. However, the following factors will greatly reduce potential
effects to this species:

124



Only dead vegetation is targeted for treatment. The sites with the most intensive treatments will
therefore be those with the greatest extent of fire-induced mortality, and these sites are least likely
to support habitat conditions favorable to H. talmadgei and other late-successional forest species.
As a result, potential effects to these species are very limited in the areas that were most heavily
affected by wildfire.



Areas where fire severity was low are most likely to still support habitat conditions favorable to
H. talmadgei (where conditions were favorable pre-fire). However, since proposed treatments
target dead vegetation only, areas with low fire-induced mortality will have much less treatment
than areas heavily affected by high-severity wildfire. Treatments in areas that survived largely
intact may reduce woody debris to some extent, but post-fire levels of woody debris are much
higher than pre-fire levels, and RPMs limit removal of woody debris (see below). Also, removal
of dead vegetation will have little effect on canopy cover. As a result, in the areas that were least
affected by wildfire and are likely to be most suitable to H. talmadgei, effects to this species will
be very limited.



RPMs include a prohibition on timber salvage in northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting
habitat in High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCA’s). These late-successional forested
habitats are also likely to be high-quality habitats for H. talmadgei, and this protective measure
will further reduce potential effects to H. talmadgei in these valuable habitats.



RPMs include limitations on timber salvage in NSO foraging habitat in HVWCA’s. Salvage in
these areas will be restricted to hazard trees only. This measure will further reduce potential
effects to H. talmadgei habitat quality in habitats high in value to this species.



RPMs include requirements to leave 15 tons of coarse woody debris (CWD) per acre in suitable
NSO habitats in HVWCA’s. Except where it poses a hazard to operations or haul routes, all CWD
in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) will be retained in these areas. This
measure will benefit H. talmadgei by ensuring retention of large amounts of this important habitat
feature in HVWCA’s. Outside HVWCA’s, 10 tons CWD/acre will still be retained.



Numerous RPMs restrict operations in riparian habitats. These include equipment exclusion zones
for all wet meadows, seeps, fens and springs. Riparian habitats are valuable to H. talmadgei, and
these measures will further reduce potential effects to this species.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage



The project’s connected actions will occur in existing roadbeds and culvert sites. These sites have
been highly disturbed, and have limited potential value to this species. Ground disturbance at sites
with some potential to support this species (e.g., riparian habitats at culvert replacement sites)
will be very limited in spatial extent.



Proposed treatments are specifically designed to reduce the occurrence and extent of highseverity wildfires. They will thus likely reduce the impacts these wildfires may have on H.
talmadgei habitats and populations.



Replanting treatments will accelerate re-establishment of high-quality habitats for H. talmadgei
and other wildlife Survey and Manage species.

As a result of these factors, project activities are unlikely to have any meaningfully measurable effect on
the life requirements or habitat suitability for this species, or on its persistence in the project area.

Vespericola pressleyi (Pressley [Big Bar] hesperian snail)
50T

This species occurs in conifer and/or hardwood forest habitats in permanently damp areas within 200 m.
of seeps, springs, and stable streams, and uses woody debris and rock refugia near water during dry and
cold periods. Recommended protection measures include conserving favorable canopy cover, woody
debris and herbaceous vegetation in suitable habitats (Duncan et al., 1999; 1999). This species is known
primarily from the Big Bar area of the Trinity River Management Unit, but has also been found on the
South Fork Management Unit. It appears to be less common than H. talmadgei, but observations have
been recorded near and within the boundaries of proposed treatment units.
Extensive protection measures for riparian habitats have been incorporated into the project design. These
measures protect the permanently damp areas that are key landscape features for this species, and greatly
decrease the potential for negative effects to habitat conditions around these features. The project’s
connected actions include removal or replacement of culverts to improve overall hydrologic conditions in
the watersheds affected by project activities. Ground disturbance at sites with some potential to support
this species (e.g., riparian habitats at culvert replacement sites) will be very limited in spatial extent. The
other RPMs cited above for H. talmadgei will also greatly reduce the potential for negative effects to V.
pressleyi. As a result, project activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life
requirements or habitat suitability for V. pressleyi, or on its persistence in the project area, and conditions
do not warrant additional field surveys for this species.
Alternative 2 – Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, with three exceptions:
1. The buffer width is consistent throughout treatment areas (150 feet on either side of the road).
2. Both dead and dying hazard trees are subject to removal.

50T

3. Approximately 16 miles of treated roads will be subject to fuelbreak treatments, which have a
wider treatment zone than the other treatment types (600 feet on either side of the road). The
fuelbreak treatments include removing live small-diameter trees (up to 10” DBH), and pruning
live trees to remove lower branches.

H elminthoglypta t almadgei (Klamath shoulderband snail)
50T

50T

The effects of Alternative 2 on H. talmadgei in the non-fuelbreak areas will be similar to those of
Alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of acres will
actually be affected. Removal of dying hazard trees in addition to dead trees will increase the potential for
minor effects to habitat suitability somewhat compared to Alternative 1 by potentially affecting canopy
cover and removing some sources of future CWD. The potential effects to canopy cover are limited and
short-term due to the weakened condition of the living hazard trees that will be removed under this
125

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

alternative, and the likelihood that they will die in the near future regardless of the proposed treatments.
The CWD retention measures incorporated into the project design will ensure retention of large amounts
of CWD.
Fuelbreaks: Observations of H. talmadgei have been recorded within proposed fuelbreak areas, and the
potential for effects to this species may be greater within the fuelbreak areas than in the other treatment
areas. Removal of small-diameter trees in fuelbreaks has a greater potential to affect canopy cover.
However, the restriction of live tree removal to trees 10” DBH or less will greatly limit the potential
reduction in canopy cover, especially in the late-successional forests that are most suitable for this
species. The canopy in these stands is dominated by large-diameter trees, and removal of small-diameter
trees has a very limited potential to affect overall canopy cover levels. Pruning lower branches of live
trees is expected to have no measurable effect on canopy cover or any other habitat element important to
H. talmadgei.
Because this alternative includes fuelbreaks on approximately 16 miles of roads, tree removal will occur
on more acres than under Alternative 1. As a result, CWD will be reduced on a larger number of acres.
However, the project resource protection measures detailed under Alternative 1, including the CWD
retention measures, will also apply to the fuelbreak treatment areas. These measures will ensure retention
of large amounts of CWD, an important habitat element for this species.
In summary, although Alternative 2 has a greater potential to affect H. talmadgei than Alternative 1,
project design features and RPMs will provide for a reasonable assurance of species persistence in
fuelbreaks as well as the non-fuelbreak areas. Overall, project activities are unlikely to have a
meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for this species, or on its
persistence in the project area.

Vespericola pressleyi (Pressley [Big Bar] hesperian snail)
50T

The effects of this alternative on V. pressleyi in the non-fuelbreak treatment areas will be very similar to
those of alternative 1. The same types of treatments will occur, and approximately the same number of
acres will be affected.
Fuelbreaks: Observations of V. pressleyi have been recorded near proposed fuelbreaks. The closest
observation was approximately 1 mile to the east. The extensive riparian protection measures protecting
permanently damp areas will protect these habitats in fuelbreaks as well as other treatment areas. The
many RPMs cited above for H. talmadgei will also greatly reduce the potential for negative effects to V.
pressleyi, both within and outside of fuelbreaks. As a result, project activities will not have any
meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability for V. pressleyi, or on its
persistence in the project area under this alternative, and conditions do not warrant additional field
surveys for this species.
Alternative 3 – Wider Buffer Alternative
This alternative allows treatment of a 600-foot total width buffer, rather than the 300-foot buffer allowed
under Alternative 1. However, because the exact location of treatment at any given point along a road is
unknown under Alternative 1, the analysis for that alternative assumes treatment of the entire 600-foot
width within which treatments may occur. As a result, the analysis for Alternative 1 assumes effects to the
same acres that will be subject to treatment under Alternative 3, and the potential effects to Survey and
Manage wildlife species are very similar to those analyzed under Alternative 1. Removal of dying hazard
trees in addition to dead trees will increase the potential for minor effects to habitat suitability somewhat
compared to Alternative 1 by potentially affecting canopy cover and removing some sources of future
CWD. The potential effects to canopy cover are limited due to the weakened condition of the living
hazard trees that will be removed under this alternative, and the likelihood that they will die in the near
future regardless of the proposed treatments. The CWD retention measures incorporated into the project
design will ensure retention of large amounts of CWD.
126

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 1, but treatments will be greatly restricted inside suitable NSO
habitats. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting dead trees only;
no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. As a result, potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife
species will be similar to but more limited than those of Alternative 1. Salvage treatments will occur on
fewer acres, so the extent of tree removal will be more limited than Alternative 1. Fuels treatments will
also occur on fewer acres, so more CWD will be retained in the project area. In summary, overall effects
will be less than Alternative 1, and project activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on
the life requirements or habitat suitability for Survey and Manage wildlife species, or on their persistence
in the project area.
Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative
This alternative is similar to Alternative 4, but treatments will be even more restricted. The areas where
restrictions will apply include all suitable NSO habitats, plus riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas,
and at-risk watersheds. Treatments in these habitats will be limited to hazard tree mitigation, targeting
dead trees only, and no tree removal or fuels reduction will occur. Outside of these areas, treatments
proposed are the same as Alternative 4, with the exception that no commercial timber sale removal will be
allowed in any treatment areas.
Potential effects to Survey and Manage wildlife species will be similar to, but more limited than, those of
Alternative 4. Fewer acres will be subject to fuels treatments, so more CWD will be retained in the project
area. In summary, overall effects will be the least compared to all other action alternatives, and project
activities will not have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or habitat suitability
for Survey and Manage wildlife species, or on their persistence in the project area.
Alternative 6 – No Action Alternative
Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will
continue to decay and fall without human influence. No reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will
be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative on Survey and Manage wildlife species include
continued limitations on use of existing road system for wildfire suppression due to safety concerns, and a
higher risk of widespread loss of suitable habitats to high-severity wildfire.

Cumulative Effects

Analysis of cumulative effects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) addresses the impact
on the environment that results from the incremental impact of the proposed action when added to other
past, present and reasonable foreseeable future actions, regardless of which agency (federal or nonfederal) or person undertakes these actions (40 CFR 1508.7).
The cumulative effects analysis is bound in space and time to properly evaluate if there would be any
overlap of effects between this project and other foreseeable actions. V. pressleyi is found in permanently
damp areas within 200 m. (656 feet) of seeps, springs, and stable streams (USDI Bureau of Land
Management 1999). H. talmadgei habitat areas are on the order of 10 acres (Duncan et al., 1999), which
equates to a circle with a radius of approximately 375 feet. To encompass potentially affected individuals
of the species analyzed in this report, this analysis is therefore bounded in space to include any area
within 375 and 656 feet of all treatment areas for H. talmadgei and V. pressleyi, respectively. Reasonably
foreseeable future actions are described in the Cumulative Effects Table found in Appendix G. Past effects
are assumed to be expressed within the current habitat conditions shown in the analysis, including the
effects of the 2015 wildfires.
Temporal bounding for this analysis is both short term and long term. The short-term bounding is the time
during project implementation because it is tied directly to the potential for noise disturbance and
immediate habitat alteration. The estimated timeline for hazard tree abatement, fuel loading reduction,

wood product removal and planting implementation is up to 5 years, and maintenance actions may occur
up to 20 years into the future.
Long-term bounding is determined by several factors. In habitats that burned at low severity and have
high levels of canopy cover remaining, bounding reflects the time needed for tree mortality to provide the
habitat functionality of CWD as a habitat component. A time frame of 40 years beyond implementation
(60 years post-fire) will allow for substantial snag recruitment in these habitats, particularly since
significant additional tree mortality from the effects of the 2015 fires is expected to occur in the future.
This tree mortality is also expected to provide ample down logs in these habitats.
In habitats that burned at moderate or high severity and have low levels of canopy cover but high levels of
snags, temporal bounding reflects effects of proposed activities to snags compared to the natural decline
in snag presence. In Idaho the half-life of snags in post-fire areas where salvage logging did not occur was
9-10 years for ponderosa pine, and 15-16 years for Douglas-fir (Russell et al. 2006). Using these
estimates, if no action is taken, less than 10% of the Douglas-fir snags will still be standing 60 years after
the fires, and less than 2% of the ponderosa pines will still be standing. In these habitats, the difference in
habitat functionality of snags between the proposed activities and the no-action alternative is therefore not
likely to be meaningful at that point in time. Down log density in these habitats is also expected to be high
due to significant additional tree mortality in the future from the effects of the 2015 fires. As a result of
these factors, a time scale of approximately 40 years beyond implementation (60 years post-fire) is be
used to bound this cumulative effects analysis.
On the Shasta-Trinity and Six Rivers National Forests, there are 660 and 35 known H. talmadgei and V.
pressleyi sites, respectively. Fifty known H. talmadgei sites are within the cumulative effects analysis area
for this project, and 30 are within potential treatment units. Three known V. pressleyi sites are within the
cumulative effects analysis area, and 2 are within the boundaries of potential treatment units.
Approximately 1.1% of the known H. talmadgei sites (7 sites total) were directly affected by moderate- or
high-severity wildfire in 2015. No known V. pressleyi sites were directly affected.
The effects of activities on private lands and future foreseeable federal actions are addressed in the project
Wildlife Survey and Manage Report. Private lands activities will affect a very small percentage of the
cumulative effects analysis areas for these species. Other federal actions in the analysis area include
vegetation management and fuels reduction projects that will affect existing vegetation. Like the proposed
project, these projects incorporate extensive resource protection measures for riparian areas and other
wildlife habitats. As a result, neither the proposed activities (under all alternatives) nor the other future
foreseeable actions are expected to have any meaningfully measurable effect on the life requirements or
habitat suitability for H. talmadgei or V. pressleyi, or on their persistence in the project area, and they will
not result in significant cumulative effects for either of these species.

Migratory Birds
Introduction
Under the National Forest Management Act, the Forest Service is directed to “provide for diversity of
plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to
meet overall multiple-use objectives” (P.L. 94-588, Sec 6 (g) (3) (B)). The January 2000 USDA Forest
Service Landbird Conservation Strategic Plan (USDA, 2000), followed by Executive Order 13186 in
2001, in addition to the Partners in Flight (PIF), specific habitat Conservation Plans for birds and the
January 2004 PIF North American Landbird Conservation Plan, all reference goals and objectives for
integrating bird conservation into forest management and planning.
In late 2008, a Memorandum of Understanding between the USDA Forest Service and the US Fish and
Wildlife Service to Promote the Conservation of Migratory Birds (MOU) was signed. The intent of the
MOU is to strengthen migratory bird conservation through enhanced collaboration and cooperation
between the Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service as well as other federal, state, tribal and
local governments. Within the National Forests, conservation of migratory birds focuses on providing a
diversity of habitat conditions at multiple spatial scales and ensuring that bird conservation is addressed
when planning land management activities. In early 2016, both USDA Forest Service and US Fish and
Wildlife Service have agreed to extend the MOU as currently written.
The proposed Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage project implements direction contained
within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) (USDA
Forest Service 1995). Opportunities to promote conservation of migratory birds and their habitats were
incorporated into the development and design of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage
project (MOU Section C: items 1 and 11 and Section D: items 1, 3, and 4).

Proposed Actions and Alternatives Analyzed
For a detailed description of the alternatives considered for this analysis, please see Chapter 2.

Affected environment
Proposed treatments are spread widely across a very large area with highly variable vegetative conditions
ranging from old-growth conifer forest to shrub and grasslands. Mixed conifer forests dominate this area.
Overall, the area contains a variety of habitat types and conditions for migratory bird species.
The majority of the Forest is in US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Bird Conservation Region 5 (BCR
5), the Northern Pacific Rainforest. The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction & Salvage project area is in
the western portion of the Forest, and lies wholly within the Northern Pacific Rainforest BCR.

Environmental Consequences
Potential effects to federally threatened bird species are analyzed in the wildlife Biological Assessment;
there are no known/documented endangered bird species within/near the project assessment area.
Potential effects to Forest Service designated Sensitive birds and their habitats are analyzed in the wildlife
Biological Evaluation. In addition, effects to management indicator assemblage habitats, and
representative avian species, are analyzed in the wildlife Management Indicator Assemblage report. That
report assesses the project level effects on birds that represent the management indicator assemblages that
will be affected by the various action alternatives considered in detail.
Many of the resource protection measures (RPMs) that apply to all action alternatives and connected
actions will benefit migratory bird species. A list of RPMs can be found in Chapter 2. Some of the
benefits include: limited operating periods (LOPs) for northern spotted owl (NSO), bald eagles and
peregrine falcons will limit potential disturbance or harm to migratory birds, particularly during the
breeding season. Riparian reserve buffers and equipment exclusion zones (EEZs) will protect riparian
129

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

habitats which are very valuable to many migratory bird species, and these protections will greatly benefit
species that rely on these habitats. Within EEZs, hand treatments will have limited ground disturbance
and will not disturb riparian plant species such as big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix
spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.), unless they are considered hazardous.
In summary, implementation of the proposed treatments and connected actions under all project action
alternatives would maintain a diversity of functional habitats for migratory birds over the short and longterm, and contribute to long-term sustainability and resilience of migratory bird habitats. Potential effects
to individuals and their habitats would be minimized through project design, integrated resource
protection measures, adherence to Forest Plan Standards & Guidelines and the Aquatic Conservation
Strategy.
Conclusions are similar for all project action alternatives. Under the proposed action (alternative 1),
alternative 4 and 5, only dead trees and vegetation will be treated or removed. Under alternative 2 and 3,
dead and dying trees/vegetation will be treated/removed. Live trees (<10” DBH) and shrubs will also be
treated within the fuelbreaks proposed in alternative 2. This fuelbreak slightly increases the total number
of acres compared to alternatives 1, 4 and 5 and would have greater impacts on migratory birds and their
habitat primarily through changes in the habitat. Alternative 3 proposes to treat a wider buffer than the
other four alternatives, therefore it affects the most acres and has the greatest impact on migratory birds
and their habitat. Alternative 4 and 5 include the least intensive treatments and affect the lowest number
of acres and would have the least amount of impacts on migratory birds and their habitats. Alternative 5
only includes fuels reduction and/or hazard mitigation (no salvage) and has the least impact on migratory
birds and their habitat. The no action alternative would not treat or remove any vegetation or trees,
therefore trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human
influence. The project’s connected actions would have minimal impacts to migratory birds and their
habitat because they are located in existing roadbeds and culvert sites which have been previously
disturbed and contain limited vegetation.
Under all action alternatives, treatments would result in a diversity of habitat types that would be
beneficial to migratory bird species in the short- and long-term. Currently, most of the habitat within the
treatment areas has been affected by fire, which resulted in dead and dying vegetation. In general, suitable
habitat for migratory birds has decreased due to decreased cover and structure, particularly in areas that
burned at high or moderate severity. Where fire severity was low, effects to migratory bird habitats was
limited. This was the case in the majority of the burned areas. Under all action alternatives, trees would be
planted to provide future forest cover, which would benefit migratory birds. Proposed treatments would
contribute to a long-term revitalization of migratory bird habitat and a reduction in future fire hazard
potential and will have no meaningful influence on population trends of any species of migratory bird.

Management Indicator Assemblages
Introduction
The purpose of this section is to evaluate and disclose the impacts of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard
Reduction & Salvage (TPFHR&S) Project on management indicator assemblage habitat identified in the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan, USDA 1995). Detailed
descriptions of the project alternatives can be found in Chapter 2.
Management indicator assemblages are groups of wildlife associated with vegetative communities or key
habitat components, as identified in the Forest Plan (page 3-24). The Forest Plan directs resource
managers to monitor assemblage habitat trends at the National Forest scale (Forest level). The Forest Plan
permits the use of habitat components to represent the management indicator assemblages. This project
level report analyzes the effects of the project on habitat of each potentially affected management
indicator assemblage, and describes how these effects to habitat may influence Forest level trends.

Methodology for Effects Analysis of Management Indicator Assemblages
Project level effects on management indicator assemblages are analyzed and disclosed as part of
environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act. This involves examining the
impacts of the project alternatives on the habitat of each management indicator assemblage by discussing
how the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects would change the quantity and/or quality of that habitat in
the analysis area. These project level impacts to habitat are then related to broader scale (Forest level)
habitat trends.
Analyzing project effects to management indicator assemblages involves the following steps:



Identifying which management indicator assemblages have habitat that may be either directly or
indirectly affected by the project alternatives.
Analyzing project level effects on the amount of habitat available for each management indicator
assemblage, and examining how project habitat effects may influence Forest level assemblage
habitat trends.

Project effects to assemblage habitat are assessed using forest stand exam data, aerial photography, burn
severity indexes, and field surveys. Data collected by silviculturists and wildlife biologists at the stand
level are the best available data for project level effects analysis. These data include current tree size (or
shrub size for chaparral), forest canopy cover, snag and log density, and location of cliffs, caves, talus and
rock outcrops. To provide context for the analysis of project effects to assemblage habitat, this analysis
also discusses representative species from the potentially affected management indicator assemblages and
relates project effects on habitat to that species. These are typically species for which the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest is also gathering population data at the Forest level.
Direction for and Implementation of Forest Scale Monitoring for Management Indicator
Assemblages
Forest level monitoring direction for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest management indicator
assemblages is identified in the Monitoring Action Plan of the Forest Plan (USDA 1995, Chapter 5, Page
5-16). The Forest Plan provides direction for Forest scale monitoring of management indicator
assemblages using habitat components to represent the assemblages (Forest Plan, page 5-16). Therefore,
habitat status and trend is monitored at the Forest scale. 65 Population monitoring is not required.
However, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest gathers high quality population data at the Forest level for a
number of species. These types of monitoring are described in more detail below.
Habitat Status and Trend
Monitoring assemblage habitat includes Forest level reporting of habitat status and trend. Habitat status
refers to the current amount of management indicator assemblage habitat on the Forest. Habitat trend is
the direction of change in the amount of management indicator assemblage habitat between the time the
Forest Plan was approved and the present.
The Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan provides direction for Forest scale (Forest level) monitoring of
management indicator assemblages using habitat components to represent the assemblages (Forest Plan,
page 5-16). Habitat components that define each of the nine assemblages are described below in Table
3-27. The habitat components for late seral, openings and early seral, multi-habitat, hardwood, riparian
and chaparral assemblages are categorized using the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship (CWHR)
System (CDFG 2008). The CWHR System provides the most widely used habitat relationship models for

California’s terrestrial vertebrate species (ibid), and is described further in Appendix A of the
Management Indicator Assemblage Report.
The Forest wide quantity and distribution of management indicator assemblage habitat are monitored
using Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) vegetation layers developed for use in Northwest Forest Plan
effectiveness monitoring.66 The GNN vegetation layers are used by regional interagency monitoring
teams to evaluate forest conditions in the Northwest Forest Plan area, under the direction of the Regional
Interagency Executive Committee.67 The GNN layers are developed by integrating data from field plots
(forest inventory data) with satellite imagery and mapped environmental data, using gradient analysis and
nearest-neighbor imputation. To assess changes in proportions of assemblage habitat on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest since the time of Forest Plan approval, the GNN layer developed to reflect vegetation in
1994 is compared to the most current GNN layer (2007).68 A similar analysis, using vegetation layers
produced by regional monitoring teams, was conducted to evaluate the status and trend of latesuccessional habitat since 1994 in the entire Northwest Forest Plan area (Moeur et al. 2005).
The snag and down log assemblage is monitored using data collected at the Forest level by the Forest
Service Forest Health Monitoring Program,69 and by the Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region, Fire
and Aviation Management fire and fuels monitoring project.70 The forest health monitoring program
monitors forest disease and insect outbreaks through annual aerial surveys that pinpoint new areas of snag
recruitment and tracks the progress of previously reported outbreaks. The fire and fuels monitoring
program monitors forest fire severity. Moderate and severe fires add large pulses of snags and down logs
to the landscape. The Forest management indicator assemblage analysis uses data from annual aerial
forest health surveys collected from 1994 through 2009, and wildfire severity data from 1994 through
2008. In addition, the Forest Service Activity Tracking System is used to monitor management activities
across the Forest. These data were used to determine areas that consist of older plantations (generally
created before 1994), which are known to be deficient in snags and down logs due to past forest
management practices.

66 The

Landscape Ecology Modeling, Mapping and Analysis team develops Gradient Nearest Neighbor vegetation layers and
produces GNN maps for Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring. More information is at: http://www.fsl.orst.edu/lemma/

Station for the ability to detect change between years. Each separate year of data used in this analysis has already been assessed
for accuracy. Accuracy reports are available on the website noted above.

influenced by management. For project analyses, presence of these habitat components are recorded
during field surveys to determine whether they are present and may be affected by the project.
Population Status and Trend
As discussed above, management indicator assemblages are groups of wildlife species associated with
particular habitat types. Although population status and trend monitoring is not required by the Forest
Plan, the Forest has selected appropriate representative species for several management assemblages and
collects and/or compiles data regarding population status and trend for these species at the Forest level.
Population status is the current condition of the population measure for the representative species.
Population trend is the direction of change in that population measure over time. Population data are
compiled and discussed in Forest level monitoring reports, which are issued every 3 to 5 years.

Selection of Project Level Management Indicator Assemblages

Each Shasta-Trinity National Forest management indicator assemblage was assessed to determine which
may be affected by the TPFHR&S Project. Each assemblage was then assigned a category for project
analysis (Table 3-28). The categories are: (1) management indicator assemblage habitat type is not in or
adjacent to the project area and would not be affected by the project, (2) management indicator
assemblage habitat type is in or adjacent to project area, but would not be either directly or indirectly
affected by the project, or (3) management indicator assemblage habitat type would be either directly or
indirectly affected by the project. The management indicator assemblages analyzed for the project were
selected as indicated below in Table 3-28.

Category 1 Assemblages
There are no category 1 assemblages for this project.

Multi-habitat
This assemblage is defined by the proportion of each assemblage habitat present, in relation to each
other.73 Six assemblages may be affected by this project: openings and early seral, late seral, snag and
down log, riparian, hardwood, and chaparral; therefore, the multi-habitat assemblage occurs in the project
73 The

snag and down log and cliff, cave, talus, and rock outcrop assemblages are not factored in to the proportions of habitat
used to define the multi-habitat assemblage because these assemblages are defined by physical features and habitat components
that overlay the other assemblages. For example, a snag patch is categorized as openings and early seral and snag and down log
assemblage habitat and a rock outcrop on a ridgetop surrounded by shrubs is categorized as chaparral and snag and down log
assemblage habitat.

units. Since the project would not change the amount or distribution of any assemblage, there would be no
effect to the proportion of assemblage habitats available. Since the proportions of these six assemblages
will not be changed by the project, this assemblage will not be discussed further in this report.
Cliffs, Caves, Talus, Rock Outcrops
These features are present in the project area; however this assemblage will not be affected by project
implementation. The proposed project would not directly or indirectly affect the habitat for this
assemblage and would, therefore, have no impact on Forest level habitat trends. This assemblage will not
be further discussed in this report.

Hardwood
Hardwood stands (montane hardwood) and individual hardwoods exist in the project area and will be
affected by project implementation.
Representative Species:
The white-breasted nuthatch is selected as an appropriate representative species for the hardwood
assemblage because it is strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage
(Table 3-27), and it occurs in the area.
Chaparral
Chaparral habitat (mixed chaparral and montane chaparral) occurs in the project area and will be affected
by project implementation.
Representative Species
The wrentit is selected as an appropriate representative species for the hardwood assemblage because it is
strongly associated with specific habitat components that define the assemblage (Table 3-27), and it
occurs in the area.
The Nashville warbler shows preference for young, second growth conifer stands, a habitat component
that is an indicator for the openings and early seral assemblage. The red-breasted nuthatch shows a strong
association with snags, a habitat component that is an indicator for the snag and down log assemblage.
The brown creeper shows a strong association with mature stands with large trees, a habitat component
that is an indicator for the late seral assemblage. The white-breasted nuthatch shows a strong association
with hardwood tree species, a habitat component that is an indicator for the hardwood assemblage. The
wrentit shows a strong association with shrubby upland vegetation, a habitat component that is an
indicator for the chaparral assemblage. Additionally, population data of high reliability are available for
these species, and are tracked/compiled at the Forest level.7475
Although Alternative 1 is the Proposed Action, all alternatives are included throughout this analysis.
Table 3-29 provides a summary of treatments and CWHR types for each assemblage within each
alternative. Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action (Alternative 1),
Alternative 4 and 5, assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in Table
3-29 for these alternatives, and in subsequent analysis throughout this report. In reality, the total buffer for
the Proposed Action, Alternatives 4 and 5 would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. As a result, the number of acres
of each assemblage affected within the project area would be much lower than those reflected in these
tables (they will be approximately half). Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action, Alternatives
4 and 5 would only be 7,969. It should also be noted that the number of acres of salvage treatments has
been overstated for all alternatives. Only portions of the salvage units would actually be salvaged because
burn severity and subsequent tree mortality is variable throughout the project area. Mortality of
commercial sized trees is scattered in pockets, therefore some areas classified as salvage will not actually
have salvage opportunities. Connected Actions located outside of the project treatment units are
quantified separately and are not included in Table 3-29.

74 The

Forest compiles Breeding Bird Survey data (BBS) for the representative species, and reports them at the regional (BBS
strata), California, and rangewide scales. Four BBS strata occur on the Forest. BBS data have varying degrees of reliability based
upon sample size. Representative species selected for Forest level tracking have data with the highest reliability in at least one of
the 4 strata that occur on the Forest.

Project Effects on Management Indicator Assemblage Habitat
The following section describes the effects of the TPFHR&S Project and its Connected Actions on habitat
components of the openings and early seral, late seral, snag and down log, riparian, hardwood and
chaparral management indicator assemblages. The analysis used forest stand level vegetation and fuels
data obtained from a combination of sources including forest stand exam data, aerial photography, burn
severity indexes, and field surveys. These site specific data are the best available data for project level
analysis. For each assemblage potentially affected by the project, the biologist evaluates a species
strongly associated with the habitat components that define the assemblage. The species analysis is used
to provide further context to project effects and the relationship of project habitat impacts to Forest level
trends. Table 3-30 summarizes the pre- and post-treatment assemblage acres for Alternative 1. As
explained above, due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, the number of
acres of each assemblage within the project area will be much lower than those reflected in Table 3-30
(they will be approximately half). Some Connected Actions are located within the proposed project
treatment units. Additional impacts from Connected Actions that are located outside of the treatment units
will be the same for all alternatives and may impact the openings/early seral and riparian assemblages
only. Potential impacts to those two assemblages are described below in their respective sections.

Openings and Early Seral Stage Wildlife Assemblage (Nashville warbler)
This assemblage is characterized by trees ranging in size from seedlings to small trees (less than 24”
DBH) of blue oak-foothill pine, closed cone pine-cypress, Douglas fir, eastside pine, Jeffrey pine,
Klamath mixed conifer, lodgepole pine, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, sierran mixed
conifer, and white fir CWHR habitat types. Refer to the Management Indicator Assemblages report of
exact CWHR habitat typing specifics.
Habitat/Species Relationship
The Nashville warbler is found in early seral, open, brushy stands of forests and woodlands. The species
is strongly associated with the small tree and brush habitat components that are likely to be affected by
the project. This species nests on the ground under dense brush in openings within young forests and
woodlands (CDFG 2008).

76 The

late seral and openings and early seral assemblages are defined by management indicator assemblage definitions, so
acreages may differ from late seral and early seral habitat in other reports.
77 Due to variable width buffer under Proposed Action, these acreages represent the total amount of assemblage habitat within
300 feet of each side of road. In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action will be 300 feet, not 600 feet, therefore, the
affected acres will be much lower (approximately half). Total acres being treated under Proposed Action will only be 7,969.
78 Snag

and down log assemblage overlaps all other assemblages except chaparral, thus these numbers when summed add up to
more than the total number of treatment acres.

Project level Effects Analysis – Openings and Early Seral Assemblage
This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat
available (quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a
representative species (Nashville warbler).
Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis:
(1) Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat.
(2) Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class.
(3) Qualitative: Acres with changes in tree canopy cover.
Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area
This project occurs on approximately 9,568 acres of openings and early seral conditions. The habitat
consists of Douglas fir, Klamath mixed conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, and
white fir CWHR types with size class 0-4 trees and sparse-dense canopy cover. The openings and early
seral habitat within the project area includes areas that burned at all severity levels in 2015. Openings and
early seral habitat increased as a result of the fires, as some late seral habitats were converted to
openings/early seral when they burned at moderate to high severity.

Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat
The treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage
definition of openings & early seral habitat. The 9,568 acres of proposed treatments would impact
openings and early seral assemblage habitat, including approximately 2,257 acres of high quality
Nashville warbler nesting habitat and 4,297 acres of moderate quality nesting habitat (Table 3-31). Due to
the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all openings/early seral assemblage habitat
within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. The actual treated buffer will only
be 300 feet, not the full 600 feet that was analyzed to capture all potentially treated area. Total acres being
treated under the Proposed Action will only be 7,969, therefore the amount of openings/early seral
assemblage habitat within it will be much lower than 9,568 acres (it will be approximately half).
CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees will be
characterized as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early seral
assemblage. The proposed action would only remove or treat trees and vegetation that are dead (no green
limbs) at the time of implementation, as well as during future maintenance. Fire killed trees and
vegetation have few if any needles/leaves remaining; therefore, canopy cover would not be reduced as a
result of the removal of dead trees and vegetation. As a result, although the treated stands would be more
open in the understory and have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species
associated with early seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another
assemblage directly as a result of this alternative (Table 3-31). Effects involve qualitative changes to
habitat such as more open understory within early seral forests; however, effects are negligible since the
vegetation is already dead.

Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat
There is no change in the amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat as a result of this
alternative (the project does not convert any acres from this assemblage to another), so there would not be
cumulative effects.
Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale
There are currently 801,000 acres of openings and early seral assemblage habitat on National Forest
System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the trend for openings and
early seral assemblage on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is steady at 36% of National Forest lands
(Table 3-32).79
Although not reflected in this recorded trend for assemblage habitat on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest,
Northwest Forest Plan monitoring findings reported a net change over the last decade in the amount of
older forests80 due to the gradual growth of trees into the lower end of the 20 inch diameter class (Haynes
et al. 2006). Across the Northwest Forest Plan area, the actual rate of net increase in older forest was 1.9
percent from 1994-2003, and attributed largely to growth and development of natural stands with
quadratic mean diameter greater than 17.7 inches during the 1990’s.81 Researchers report that the increase
in older forests during this period was due to a bulge in the size-class distribution of forests with
diameters just below the 20-inch class, and estimate the accumulation of older forests will decline as the
bulge moves into the greater than 20-inch class. Because the Forest classification of late seral assemblage
habitat includes stands with mean diameters greater than 24 inches, these data predict that Forest wide
trends would show an increase in late seral and decrease in openings and early seral assemblage habitat in
the near future.

79 Based

on GNN vegetation analysis of assemblages as defined by CWHR habitat types.
Older forest encompasses both mature and old-growth stages and is defined differently than the Forest management indicator
assemblages. Older forests are defined in the Northwest Forest Plan by mean diameter of over 20 inches, and the late seral
assemblage is defined by mean diameter of over 24 inches.

This proposed action would create more fire resistant stands of opening and early seral assemblage with
more open understory. To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects only 1% of the Forest
wide assemblage habitat. Due to the small scale, even if potential unforeseen indirect effects are realized,
these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level habitat trends for management
indicator assemblages.
Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Nashville Warbler
The openings and early seral habitat in the project units is characterized as Douglas fir, Klamath mixed
conifer, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, and white fir CWHR types, with tree sizes 14 and sparse to dense canopy cover. Portions of this habitat provide moderate or high quality Nashville
warbler nesting habitat. The openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the
project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat.
In the short and long term, the proposed action would not decrease habitat suitability for the Nashville
warbler because only dead trees and vegetation would be treated/removed and tree size class and canopy
cover would not be affected (Table 3-31). Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of
treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future.
Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Nashville Warbler Population Trends
As described above, Forest level trend in the amount of openings and early seral assemblage habitat is
steady (Table 3-32). In the long run, it is likely that early seral assemblage will decline slightly and late
seral assemblage will increase slightly due to current and foreseeable forest practices of retaining and
encouraging development of late seral forest. Typical practices on private timber land and the occurrence
of wildfire on both federal and private lands within the Forest boundaries will continue to create early
seral assemblage habitat.
Population trends for the Nashville warbler are tracked and compiled at the Forest level.82 These data
indicate a potential decline in species occurrence within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest, but the decline is weakly supported by statistical analysis (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of
best available population data, the proposed action effects to habitat, and the ongoing contribution of
habitat from wildfires and private timber harvest, the proposed action is not likely to result in any
meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the Nashville warbler.
Effects of Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 6,169 acres of open and early seral assemblage would be treated, with 1,454 acres of
early seral/openings habitat lying within the fuelbreaks (Table 3-29). Within the fuelbreaks, both live and
dead trees and vegetation would be removed or treated, with intensities varying by distance from the road.
Within the fuels treatment road buffers and salvage units, dying trees and vegetation would also be
removed or treated. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on
each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of early seral/opening habitat because its
total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Under Alternative 2, more acres would have a

decrease in canopy cover and understory density. Decreasing canopy cover would improve early
seral/opening assemblage habitat for Nashville warbler because sparse to moderate canopy cover is
considered moderate to high quality habitat. Openings and early seral habitat will persist after treatments,
therefore the project area will continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Alternative 2 is not likely to
result in any meaningful change to population trends for the Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and
young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for
Nashville warblers in the future.
Effects of Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, 9,568 acres of openings and early seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29).
No acres would be converted from early seral to another assemblage habitat. Within the fuels treatment
road buffers and salvage units, dying trees and vegetation would be removed or treated. CWHR tree size
class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized
as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early seral assemblage.
Although the treated stands would be more open, they would continue to provide habitat for species
associated with early seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another
assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is
considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, more acres of early seral/opening habitat would
be impacted by Alternative 3 because its total project footprint is larger. Compared to the Proposed
Action, more acres would have a decrease in canopy cover and understory density under Alternative 3.
Decreasing canopy cover would improve early seral/opening assemblage habitat because sparse to
moderate canopy cover is considered moderate to high quality habitat. Openings and early seral habitat
would persist after treatments, therefore the project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler
habitat. Alternative 3 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for the
Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would
result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future.
Effects of Alternative 4
Under Alternative 4, 9,568 acres of openings and early seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29).
CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would
be characterized as size classes 0-4 after treatment, and these size classes are included under the early
seral assemblage. Although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have
fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with early seral
stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of
this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and Alternative 4 are considered,
instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact about the same number of acres
of early seral/opening habitat and would have similar effects as the Proposed Action. However, fuels
reduction would occur on 246 fewer acres of early seral/openings habitat under Alternative 4 (due to
hazard mitigation only treatments); therefore, in the long term, Alternative 4 would result in some early
seral/open stands that are less resilient to fire (Table 3-29). Future fires in those areas would likely burn
with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased mortality of vegetation and trees.
Openings and early seral habitat would persist after treatments, therefore the project area would continue
to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Alternative 4 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to
population trends and habitat availability for the Nashville warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees
both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville
warblers in the future.
Effects of Alternative 5

seral assemblage. Although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have
fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with early seral
stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of
this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and Alternative 5 are considered,
instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would impact about the same number of acres
of early seral/opening habitat. However, impacts would be less intense because no salvage would occur
and fuels reduction would occur on 3,473 fewer acres of early seral/openings habitat under Alternative 5
(Table 3-29). In the long term, Alternative 5 would result in some early seral/open stands that are less
resilient to fire. Future fires in those areas would likely burn with increased flame lengths and intensities,
resulting in increased mortality of vegetation and trees. Openings and early seral habitat would persist
after treatments, therefore the project area would continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat.
Alternative 5 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for the Nashville
warbler. Regrowth of shrubs and young trees both within and outside of treatment areas would result in an
increase in habitat suitability for Nashville warblers in the future.
Effects of Connected Actions (All Alternatives)
Under all alternatives, road restoration and reconstruction activities may impact the openings and early
seral assemblage. Some connected actions are located within the proposed project treatment units,
therefore the impacts to opening/early seral vegetation in those areas have already been analyzed and
included above. Additional impacts from connected actions located outside treatment units are described
below.
Road Restoration
Road restoration activities that may impact openings/early seral assemblage habitat includes road
restoration. Approximately 4.7 miles of roads are proposed for restoration. Some of these proposed roads
may be partially overgrown, containing opening/early seral habitat; therefore, approximately 8 acres of
openings/early seral habitat may be impacted. Many of these roads lack early seral vegetation, therefore
this is an overestimation.
Road Reconstruction
Road reconstruction activities that may impact opening/early seral habitat includes culvert replacement.
The project proposes replacement of 12 culverts that are undersized, worn, or damaged to withstand 100year peak flows and/or debris flows. As a result, approximately 0.6 acres of early seral/openings habitat
may be impacted.
Summary
No acres would be converted from openings/early seral to another assemblage habitat. CWHR tree size
class would not be changed as a result of this activity because remaining trees would be characterized as
the same size classes after treatment, and the size classes present are included under early seral
assemblage. Connected actions are not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends for
the Nashville warbler under any alternative. Openings and early seral habitat would persist after
treatments, therefore the project area will continue to provide Nashville warbler habitat. Regrowth of
shrubs and young trees within treated areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for Nashville
warblers in the future.
Late Seral Stage Wildlife Assemblage (brown creeper)
This assemblage is defined as: CWHR tree size medium/large (≥24 inches DBH) of blue oak-foothill
pine, closed cone pine-cypress, Douglas fir, eastside pine, Jeffrey pine, Klamath mixed conifer, lodgepole
pine, montane hardwood conifer, ponderosa pine, red fir, sierran mixed conifer, and white fir CWHR
habitat types.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Habitat/Species Relationship
The brown creeper occupies dense, mature stands of conifer and conifer hardwood habitats, with a
relatively closed canopy. The species is strongly associated with large trees and the dense canopy cover
that is likely to be affected by the project. This species nests behind loose bark in large trees, and more
rarely in tree cavities (CDFG 2008). Preferred brown creeper nesting habitat includes moderate or dense
canopy cover and trees greater than 11” DBH (CDFG 2008).
Project-level Effects Analysis – Late Seral Assemblage
This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of late seral assemblage habitat available
(quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative
species (brown creeper).
Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis


Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of late seral assemblage habitat.



Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class.



Qualitative: Acres with changes in tree canopy cover.

Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area
This alternative occurs on 4,310 acres of late seral stand conditions, within the following stand types
Douglas fir, Klamath Mixed Conifer, Montane Hardwood Conifer, Ponderosa Pine, Red fir, and White fir
with large trees (greater than 24’ DBH) and dense canopy cover. The stands currently provide high quality
brown creeper reproductive habitat.
Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat
The treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage
definition of late seral assemblage habitat on approximately 4,310 acres (Table 3-33). Due to the variable
width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all late seral assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each
side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action would be
300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore
the amount of late seral assemblage habitat within it would be much lower than 4,310 acres (it would be
approximately half). Due to Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) for this project, no salvage will occur
within northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation
Areas (HVWCAs), which is late seral habitat. Throughout this report, the acres of treatment in late seral
habitat reflect that fact and therefore, may not match the acres of salvage treatment proposed in other
reports, including the EIS.

definition. The Proposed Action would only remove or treat trees and vegetation that are dead (no green
limbs) at the time of implementation, as well as during future maintenance. Fire killed trees and
vegetation have few if any needles/leaves remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a
result of the removal/treatment of dead trees and vegetation. This would not result in a change in
assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy closure classes of late seral trees. As
a result, although the treated stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large
dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late seral stands. There
would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative
(Table 3-33).
Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat
There is no change in the amount of late seral assemblage habitat from this alternative (the project does
not convert any acres from this assemblage to another), so there would not be cumulative effects on the
assemblage habitat.
Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale
Based on the best available data used to track Forest wide management indicator assemblage habitat, 83
there are currently approximately 790,000 acres of late seral assemblage habitat on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest. Within the last decade, the recorded trend for amount of late seral assemblage habitat on
the Forest is steady at 36% of habitat on Shasta-Trinity National Forest lands. Table 3-34 summarizes the
trend in late seral assemblage over the last decade on the National Forest.
As described above for openings and early seral assemblage, Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness
monitoring findings report a net change over the last decade in the amount of older forests84 due to the
gradual growth of trees into the lower end of the 20 inch diameter class. Analysis in the Northwest Forest
Plan monitoring report found that areas of older forests are stable and expanding, and expectations are for
continued increases.85 Even though this trend reported at the Northwest Forest Plan level is not reflected
definitively in current Shasta-Trinity assemblage habitat trends for early and late seral habitat, it is likely
that Forest wide trends would show an increase in late seral and associated decrease in openings and early
seral assemblage habitat in the near future (Haynes et al. 2006).

To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects less than 0.6% of the Forest wide assemblage
habitat. Due to the small scale, even if potential unforeseen indirect effects are realized, these effects are
not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level habitat trends for management indicator assemblages.
Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Brown Creeper
In the short term, this alternative would slightly decrease habitat suitability for the brown creeper by
reducing snag density by removing dead trees, but the habitat would continue to be suitable after
The Forest utilizes data layers developed for Northwest Forest Plan effectiveness monitoring to track Forest wide assemblage
habitat. More information is in Habitat Status and Trend section near beginning of this document.
84 Older forest encompasses both mature and old-growth stages and is defined differently than the Forest management indicator
assemblages. Older forests are defined in the Northwest Forest Plan by mean diameter of over 20 inches, and the late seral
assemblage is defined by mean diameter of over 24 inches. This analysis uses Northwest Forest Plan data, but categorizes the
data according to Forest management indicator assemblage definitions (Table 32).

treatment. Dense canopy cover in Douglas fir, Klamath Mixed Conifer, montane hardwood conifer,
ponderosa pine, red fir, and white fir CWHR habitat types with tree size class 5 occurs in the project units
before and after treatment and provides high suitability nesting habitat for brown creepers. Habitat
suitability for brown creepers would increase in quality over time as the stand matures.

Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Brown Creeper Population Trends
As described above, Forest level trends show a steady trend in the amount of late seral assemblage habitat
(Table 3-34). In the long run, it is likely that early seral assemblage will decline slightly and late seral
assemblage will increase slightly due to forest practices of retaining and encouraging development of late
seral forest.
Alternative 1 impacts are expected to minimally impact brown creeper habitat as no changes to tree size
class or reductions in canopy cover class would occur. Typical practices on private timber land will
continue, therefore no significant contributions to late seral assemblage are likely to occur outside of
Forest boundaries. Alternative effects are consistent with a stable or increasing trend in late seral
assemblage and brown creeper habitat.
Population trends for the brown creeper are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a
fairly stable population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, with a slight
lean towards a decline, but the decline is not strongly supported by statistical analysis (Sauer et al. 2008).
In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the
project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the
brown creeper.
Effects of Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 2,636 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29: sum of all Alt 2
treatments in late seral). The treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management
indicator assemblage definition of late seral assemblage habitat. The CWHR tree size class would not be
changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would be characterized as size class 5 after
treatment, and this falls within the late seral assemblage definition. Canopy cover would be slightly
reduced as a result of the removal or treatment of dying trees. However, Alternative 2 would not result in
a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all canopy cover classes of late
seral trees.
There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this
alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each
side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of late seral habitat because its total project
footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Although the proposed fuelbreaks increase the size of the
project compared to the Proposed Action, the impacts to late seral habitat would be similar. Removing
small (<10 inch dbh) live trees in the fuelbreaks would not affect the late seral assemblage because it
would not affect late seral canopy cover or tree size class. Under Alternative 2, more acres would have a
decrease in canopy cover; however, canopy cover is expected to remain moderate to dense due to removal
of mostly dead trees. Alternative 2 is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends
and habitat availability for the brown creeper.
Effects of Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, 4,310 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29: sum of all Alt 3
treatments in late seral). Alternative 3 would not result in a change in assemblage type because this
assemblage habitat includes all canopy closure classes of late seral trees. As a result, although the treated
stands would be more open in the understory and would have fewer large trees, which are predominantly
dead, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late seral stands. There would not
be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the

148

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, more
acres of late seral habitat would be impacted by Alternative 3 and more acres would have a decrease in
canopy cover. However, canopy cover is expected to remain moderate to dense due to removal of mostly
dead trees. The late seral assemblage includes all canopy cover classes (sparse to dense), and moderate to
high quality brown creeper habitat includes moderate to dense canopy cover. Alternative 3 is not likely to
result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the brown creeper.
Effects of Alternative 5
Under Alternative 5, 4,310 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated. No salvage would occur in
this alternative. Within sensitive areas (NSO nesting, roosting, foraging, and post-fire foraging habitat,
riparian reserves, inventoried roadless areas, and at-risk watersheds), hazard trees would be hand felled
and left on site and no removal, fuels reduction or maintenance treatments would occur (hazard mitigation
only, followed by tree planting). Therefore, under Alternative 5, the late seral assemblage (which is
comprised of NSO nesting/roosting and foraging habitat) would be subject to hazard mitigation only (and
tree planting). The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because
remaining trees would be characterized as size class 5 after treatment, and this falls within the late seral
assemblage definition. Alternative 5 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the
time of implementation. Fire-killed trees have few if any needles remaining, therefore canopy cover
would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. Although the treated stands
would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with late
seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result
of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and Alternative 5 are considered,
instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would impact about the same number of acres
of late seral habitat as the Proposed Action. However, no fuels reduction or salvage would occur within
late seral habitat under Alternative 5 (due to hazard mitigation only treatments); therefore, in the long
term, Alternative 5 would result in late seral stands that are less resilient to fire. Future fires would likely
burn with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased tree mortality, which would
decrease the quality of late seral habitat.
Snags and Down Log Assemblage (red-breasted nuthatch)
This assemblage is defined as conifer and hardwood habitats with substantial snags and down logs.
Habitat/Species Relationship
The red-breasted nuthatch is strongly associated with snags. This species nests in cavities that they
excavate in rotted wood, especially snags (CDFG 2008). Preferred red-breasted nuthatch nesting habitat
includes stands with canopy cover ranging from open/sparse to dense and trees greater than 24’ DBH
(CDFG 2008).
Project-level Effects Analysis – Snag and Down Log Assemblage
This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat available
(quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative
species (red-breasted nuthatch).
Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis



Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat.
Qualitative: Acres with changes in density of snag and/or down logs.

Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area
The project occurs within the 144,000 acre perimeter of the fires that burned on the west side of the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest in 2015. This project occurs on 14,409 acres of snag and down log
assemblage habitat. Given the mosaic pattern of fire severity across the project area, combined with the
149

Final Environmental Impact Statement

various pre-fire tree densities, the full range of snag density levels is present. The mature stands in the
project currently provide high quality red-breasted nuthatch habitat, with large trees and numerous snags.
Effects of Alternative 4
Under Alternative 4, 4,310 acres of late seral assemblage would be treated. Within important areas
(northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting, roosting, foraging, and post fire foraging habitat in NSO territories
or Critical Habitat), hazard trees would be hand felled and left on site and no removal, fuels reduction or
maintenance treatments would occur (hazard mitigation only, followed by tree planting) on 3,217 acres.
NSO nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat is all considered late seral assemblage habitat, therefore under
this alternative, most of the late seral habitat is subject to hazard mitigation only (and tree planting). The
CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative because remaining trees would
be characterized as size class 5 after treatment, and this falls within the late seral assemblage definition.
Alternative 4 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of
implementation. Fire-killed trees have few if any needles remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be
changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. Although the treated stands would be more
open in the understory and would have fewer large dead trees, they would continue to provide habitat for
species associated with late seral stands. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another
assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and
Alternative 4 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact
about the same number of acres as the Proposed Action of late seral habitat. However, compared to the
Proposed Action, fuels reduction and salvage would occur on 3,217 fewer acres of late seral habitat under
Alternative 4 (due to hazard mitigation only treatments); therefore, in the long term, Alternative 4 would
result in some late seral stands that are less resilient to fire. Future fires in those areas would likely burn
with increased flame lengths and intensities, resulting in increased tree mortality, which would decrease
the quality of late seral habitat.
Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat
The TPFHR&S Project proposes treatments on approximately 14,409 acres of snag and down log
assemblage (Table 3-35). These actions would impact the snag and down log assemblage habitat. Within
6,831 of these acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be salvaged (felled and removed from
the landscape). Within the remaining 7,578 acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be felled
and left on site as logs. Within those acres, wood products may be utilized for commercial or personal
firewood, or biomass removal. Intermittent salvage may also occur in areas outside of northern spotted
owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). Due to
the variable width buffer proposed under this alternative, all snag and down log assemblage habitat within
300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the total buffer for this
alternative is 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under this alternative would only be
approximately 7,969, therefore the amount of snag and down log assemblage habitat within it would be
much lower than 14,409 acres (it would be approximately half).
Due to Resource Protection Measures (RPMs) for this project, no salvage will occur within northern
spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs).
Throughout this report, the acres of treatment in snag and down log habitat reflect that fact and therefore,
may not match the acres of salvage treatment proposed in other reports, including the EIS. RPMs for this
project also include retention of snags and logs. Within NSO nesting/roosting, foraging, and post-fire
foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas in HVWCAs, at least 15 tons of coarse woody debris (CWD86) per acre
would be retained for wildlife benefit, where it is available (CWD = snags 15 inches or greater in
86 CWD

and LWD are used interchangeably.

diameter and logs greater than 20 inches diameter and 10 feet long). Snags and logs in advanced states of
decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5) and/or with deformities such as cat faces, broken or forked tops,
hollows or cavities would be prioritized for retention. Within NSO nesting/roosting, foraging, and postfire foraging type 1 (PFF1) areas outside of HVWCAs, an average of at least 10 tons of CWD per acre
will be retained for wildlife benefit, where it is available. Within Riparian Reserves, 20 tons/acre of large
woody debris would be retained, when possible.
The Proposed Action would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of
implementation, as well as during future maintenance. The treatment units are long thin units along
roadsides and snags and down logs are abundant just outside of the treatment units and throughout the fire
perimeter. The snag and down log density would be reduced as a result of this alternative. Although the
treated stands would be less densely stocked with snags, this alternative would continue to provide habitat
for species associated with snag and down log assemblage (Table 3-35).

firewood, biomass removal etc. Within these areas, intermittent salvage may occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl
(NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs).

Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat
There is no change in amount of snag and down log assemblage from this alternative (the project does not
convert any acres from this assemblage to another), so there would not be cumulative effects on amount
of snag and down log assemblage.
Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale
The snag and down log assemblage is defined as conifer and hardwood habitats with substantial snags and
down logs. The habitat components defining the assemblage (snags and down logs) also occur within the
other assemblages and are evaluated at the project level using site-specific data (forest stand data). At the
Forest level, the amount of assemblage habitat is tracked using annual aerial survey data which provides
information about forest mortality due to insect and disease, and wildfire data. Because snags and down
logs are habitat components found within the other assemblages, the amount of snag and down log
assemblage tracked at the Forest level is known to represent only a portion of the habitat that provides
snags and down logs throughout the Forest.
Since 1994 snags have been recruited in large pulses by disease mortality and fire on 591,100 acres of
National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Snags are not permanent features on
the landscape (Cluck and Smith 2007, Landram et al. 2002), and when they fall they contribute to the log
component and continue to provide snag and down log assemblage habitat. Snags and logs are known to
be deficient in plantations due to past management practices; therefore, there is a deficiency of snags on
67,700 acres of National Forest System Lands. Also, snags and logs are not usually retained on private
timber land, so snag and down log assemblage is likely restricted to National Forest System lands.

As shown in Table 3-36, snag and down log assemblage habitat continues to increase over time due to
wildfire events and insect and disease outbreaks. Contributing forces to the recruitment of snags involves
the overall health and flammability of forests. The Forest Service monitors forest health through field
reconnaissance and annual aerial surveys. Aerial surveys report areas containing current-year conifer and
hardwood mortality, defoliation, and other damage; more information is found at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/spf/fhp/fhm/aerial/index.shtml.
Any decreases in the snag habitat component would be localized and due to vegetation and fuels
management actions such as linear fuel management zones or private forestry where Forest Plan snag
retention guidelines do not apply. The amount of snag and down log habitat may also be reduced due to
intense wildfires that consume snags and logs, and slowly due to natural decomposition.
Implementation of this alternative would not meaningfully reduce the amount of snag and down log
assemblage habitat at the Forest level. While snags would be removed under this alternative, in most areas
snag felling would be limited to roadside hazard trees. There are abundant snags and down logs directly
adjacent to the treatment area throughout the fire perimeter. To put the project’s influence into
perspective, it affects only 3% of the Forest wide assemblage habitat. Typical practices on private timber
land would continue to create a lack of snags and logs on private lands. The occurrence of disease
outbreaks and wildfire are likely to continue at the current rate because there are still large areas with high
fuel loading (due to fire suppression), and management of diseased stands occurs at small scales.
Extensive areas within the 2015 fire complexes adjacent to the project area would remain untreated, and
abundant snags and logs would be available and recruited in the future as trees continue to die. However,
maintenance treatments would fell some of them.
Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Red-breasted Nuthatch
In the short term, this Alternative would decrease habitat suitability for the red-breasted nuthatch by
reducing the density of snags in treatment units. Douglas fir, Klamath mixed conifer, Ponderosa pine, Red
fir, and White fir CWHR habitat types with tree size classes 4 and 5 and sparse to dense canopy cover (as
occurs within units before and after this alternative) provides moderate and high suitability nesting habitat
for red-breasted nuthatches as long as the stands include snags (Table 3-37). Felling and removing snags
and logs may reduce quality habitat for the red-breasted nuthatch.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

While a relatively large number of acres may be impacted by this alternative, not all snags would be
felled and/or removed within the treatment units. In many areas, only trees identified as hazard trees87
would be felled. RPMs would retain some snags (where they are not hazardous) and down logs on site for
wildlife benefit.
In the long term, tree planting would accelerate growth of forest stands and development of old growth
conditions more quickly than the no action alternative. This would cause habitat suitability for redbreasted nuthatches to increase in quality over time as the stand matures. Under the no action alternative,
trees impacted by the wildfires would continue to decay and fall without human influence.
Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Red-breasted Nuthatch Population Trends
Alternative effects to red-breasted nuthatch habitat include decreases in habitat suitability due to reduced
snag density. Forest wide snag and down log assemblage habitat continues to increase over time, and late
seral habitat (which provides recruitment of snags and down logs) has a current trend of steady with
potential for future increases. Because this alternative affects only a small fraction of the red-breasted
nuthatch habitat available Forest wide, it is not likely to have any meaningful influence on Forest wide
habitat trends.
Population trends for the red-breasted nuthatch are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data
indicate a potential increase in species occurrence within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest, and this increase is supported by statistical analysis in the Pitt-Klamath strata and the
South Pacific Rainforest strata that occur on the Forest, as well as range-wide (Sauer et al. 2008). In light
of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the project is
not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the redbreasted nuthatch.
Effects of Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 9,238 acres of snag and down log assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29). Within
4,873 of these acres, dead/dying trees that are felled would be salvaged (removed from the landscape) and
fuels reduction and/or fuelbreaks would occur. Within the remaining areas (4,365 acres), dead/dying trees
would be felled and fuels reduction and/or fuelbreak treatments would occur. Within these areas, wood
products may be utilized for commercial or personal firewood, or biomass removal. Intermittent salvage
may also occur in areas outside of northern spotted owl (NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value
Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs). Trees felled may also be treated for fuels reduction purposes
but 10 to 20 tons/acre (depending on the location) of downed logs would be retained.
In addition to felling dead trees, Alternative 2 would fell trees that have a 60% probability of mortality. As
a result, this alternative’s effects to this assemblage would be greater than those of the Proposed Action,
which would only fell trees that are completely dead at time of implementation. The density of snags and
down logs would be reduced as a result of Alternative 2, however the project units would continue to
provide habitat for species associated with the snag and down log assemblage. RPMs, as described above
under the Proposed Action, include retention of snags and logs on site for wildlife benefit. This
alternative’s effects would not result in the loss of any acres of this assemblage. When the actual footprint
of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would
impact more acres of snag and down log habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the
Proposed Action’s (Table 3-38).

Effects of Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, 14,409 acres of snag and down log assemblage habitat would be treated (Table
3-39). Within 6,831 of these acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags would be salvaged (felled and
removed from the landscape). Within the remaining 7,578 acres, fuels reduction would occur and snags
would be felled and left on site as logs. Within those acres, wood products may be utilized for commercial

In addition to removing/treating dead trees, Alternative 3 would fell trees that have a 60% probability of
mortality. As a result, this alternative’s effects to this assemblage would be greater than those of the
Proposed Action, which would only fell trees that are completely dead at time of implementation, as well

(NSO) nesting/roosting habitat within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas (HVWCAs).

Effects of Alternative 4
Under Alternative 4, 14,409 acres of snag and down log assemblage would be treated (Table 3-40).
Alternative 4 would only remove or treat trees that are dead (no green limbs) at the time of

implementation, as well as during future maintenance. The density of snags and down logs would be
reduced as a result of Alternative 4, however the project units would continue to provide habitat for
species associated with the snag and down log assemblage. RPMs, as described above under the Proposed
Action, include retention of snags and logs on site for wildlife benefit. As a result, this alternative’s effects
would not result in the loss of any acres of this assemblage. When the actual footprint of the Proposed
Action and Alternative 4 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would
impact about the same number of acres of snag and down log habitat as the Proposed Action. The effects
of Alternative 4 would be less intense than the Proposed Action because on 3,496 acres of snag and down
log habitat, snags would be felled and left on site as logs (hazard mitigation only, no fuels reduction or
other removal) (Table 3-40).

Hardwood Wildlife Assemblage (white-breasted nuthatch)
This assemblage is defined as all tree sizes and all canopy cover classes of montane hardwood, blue oak
woodland, and valley oak woodland CWHR habitat types.
Habitat/Species Relationship
The white-breasted nuthatch occupies hardwood habitats and hardwood-conifer habitats. The species
tends to be associated with large oaks. This species nests in cavities in large trees or snags excavated by
themselves or by woodpeckers. Preferred white-breasted nuthatch nesting habitat includes trees greater
than 11” DBH in hardwood woodland or hardwood conifer stands (CDFG 2008).
Project-level Effects Analysis – Hardwood Assemblage
This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat available
(quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative
species (white-breasted nuthatch).
Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis
1. Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of hardwood assemblage habitat.
2. Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class.
3. Qualitative: Acres with changes in hardwood canopy cover.
Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area
This project occurs on 426 acres of montane hardwood assemblage habitat. The hardwood assemblage
habitat in the project area consist of montane hardwood woodland with all CWHR tree size classes and all
canopy cover classes. The project area provides some moderate and high quality nesting habitat for the
white-breasted nuthatch.
Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat
The TPFHR&S Project proposes to conduct fire salvage, roadside treatments (fuels reduction and dead
tree removal or treatment), tree planting, and/or maintenance on approximately 426 acres of hardwood
assemblage habitats (Table 3-42). Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action,
all hardwood assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In
reality, the total buffer for the Proposed Action would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated
under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat
within it would be much lower than 426 acres (it would be approximately half).
Treatment of hardwood trees would be limited to hazard tree abatement and fuels treatments (no
hardwoods would be commercially salvaged). Some hardwood stands have a minor conifer component;
therefore, within hardwood stands, scattered dead conifer trees may be felled. For the proposed action,
only trees and vegetation that are completely dead (no green limbs) at time of implementation, as well as
during future maintenance, would be treated or removed. The CWHR tree size class would not be
changed as a result of this alternative, thus the project would not result in a change in assemblage because
all hardwood tree size classes are included in the hardwood assemblage. Hardwood density would not be
156

Final Environmental Impact Statement

reduced as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage type
because assemblage habitat includes all densities of hardwood trees. Changes in hardwood canopy cover
are expected to be negligible. Fire killed hardwoods have few if any leaves remaining, therefore canopy
cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. The treated stands
would continue to provide habitat for species associated with hardwood stands (Table 3-42). There would
not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative.

Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat

There is no change in the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat from this alternative (the project does
not convert any acres from this assemblage to another), so there would not be cumulative effects on the
assemblage habitat.
Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale
There are currently 323,000 acres of hardwood assemblage habitat on National Forest System lands in the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the trend for hardwood assemblage on the Forest is
steady at 15% of habitat on National Forest system lands (Table 3-43).

In the long term, this proposed action would not affect Forest wide trends in hardwood assemblage habitat
because it would not affect the amount of hardwood assemblage habitat available.
Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for White-breasted Nuthatch
The hardwood assemblage habitat in the project units consists of montane hardwood habitat of all CWHR
size classes and canopy covers. The hardwood habitat would maintain these characteristics after
treatments, thus the hardwood habitat would continue to provide moderate and high quality habitat after
implementation. The proposed action would not decrease habitat suitability for the white-breasted
nuthatch because only dead trees and vegetation would be treated/removed and hardwood tree size class
and canopy cover would not be affected. Regrowth of young trees both within and outside of treatment
areas would result in an increase in habitat suitability for white-breasted nuthatch in the future. There
would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative.
Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger White-breasted Nuthatch Population
Trends
As described above, the hardwood assemblage habitat Forest level trend is steady (Table 3-43).
Implementation of this project would not affect the Forest wide steady trend in hardwood assemblage
habitat, because no change in amount of assemblage habitat would occur. Project effects are consistent
with Forest level trends that indicate hardwood assemblage habitat is being maintained over time. Typical
practices on private timber land would continue, so no significant contributions to hardwood assemblage
157

Final Environmental Impact Statement

are likely to occur outside of Forest boundaries. To put the project’s influence into perspective, it affects
0.1% of the Forest wide hardwood assemblage habitat and it would continue to provide this type of
habitat post-project.
Population trends for the white-breasted nuthatch are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data
indicate a potentially increasing population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National
Forest. This increase is supported by statistical analysis in the Pitt-Klamath BBS strata (Sauer et al. 2008).
In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the
project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the
white-breasted nuthatch.
Effects of Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 378 acres of hardwood assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-29).
Fire killed trees have few if any leaves remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a
result of the removal or treatment of dead trees. In addition to removing/treating dead trees, Alternative 2
would remove or treat trees that have a 60% probability of mortality, as well as other dead and dying
vegetation. Hardwood canopy cover and density would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal or
treatment of dead or dying trees and vegetation, as well as small diameter (<10 inch DBH) live trees in
the fuelbreaks. Hardwoods would not be commercially salvaged. CWHR tree size class would not be
changed and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage
habitat includes all canopy cover classes and all densities of hardwood trees. The treated stands would be
slightly more open and less densely stocked with trees; however, they would continue to provide habitat
for species associated with hardwood stands. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is
considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of
hardwood habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the
Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in hardwood canopy cover and density under
Alternative 2.
Effects of Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, 426 acres of hardwood assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29).
Alternative 3 would remove or treat trees that have a 60% probability of mortality, as well as other dead
and dying vegetation. Hardwood canopy cover and density would be slightly reduced as a result of the
removal or treatment of dead or dying trees and vegetation. Hardwoods would not be commercially
salvaged. The CWHR tree size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, thus this
alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all hardwood tree size classes are included
in the hardwood assemblage. Alternative 3 would not result in a change in assemblage type because this
assemblage habitat includes all canopy cover classes and all densities of hardwood trees. Although the
treated stands would be slightly more open and less densely stocked with trees, they would continue to
provide habitat for species associated with hardwood stands. There would not be acreage change or
conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the actual footprint of the
Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 3 would impact
more acres of hardwood habitat because its total project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s.
Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in hardwood canopy cover and
density under Alternative 3.
Effects of Alternative 4
Under Alternative 4, 426 acres of hardwood assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29). Under this
Alternative, only dead trees and vegetation will be treated and/or removed. No hardwoods would be
commercially salvaged. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage
directly as a result of this alternative. The effects of this alternative to hardwood assemblage habitats

158

Final Environmental Impact Statement

would be about the same as the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and
Alternative 4 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact
about the same number of acres of hardwood habitat.
Effects of Alternative 5
Under Alternative 5, 426 acres of hardwood assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29). Under this
Alternative, only dead trees and vegetation will be treated and/or removed. No hardwoods would be
commercially salvaged. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage
directly as a result of this alternative. The effects of this alternative to hardwood assemblage habitats
would be about the same as the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and
Alternative 5 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 5 would impact
about the same number of acres of hardwood habitat.
Riparian Wildlife Assemblage (yellow warbler)
This assemblage is defined as all tree sizes and all canopy cover classes of Montane riparian, valley
foothill riparian, and aspen CWHR habitat types.
Habitat/Species Relationship
The yellow warbler occupies streamside riparian habitats with shrubby, open canopied structure. The
species is strongly associated with riparian vegetation such as willows, cottonwoods and alders that are
not likely to be affected by the project. This species nests in shrubby understories of riparian habitat
(CDFG 2008).
Project-level Effects Analysis – Riparian Assemblage
This analysis discloses project effects on the amount of riparian assemblage habitat available
(quantitative), and effects of the project on the quality of assemblage habitat in relation to a representative
species (yellow warbler).
Habitat Factor(s) for the Analysis
1. Quantitative: Acres with changes in amount of riparian assemblage habitat.
2. Qualitative: Acres with changes in CWHR tree size class.
3. Qualitative: Acres with changes in canopy cover.
Current Condition of the Habitat Factor(s) in the Project Area
This project occurs on approximately 105 acres of montane riparian habitat with size 1-4 trees and all
canopy covers. Due to the steep terrain of the vast majority of the project area, riparian vegetation is very
limited and highly restricted to the immediate edges of streams, when present at all. The amount of
riparian vegetation calculated and analyzed likely overstates the actual amount within the project area.
Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat
The TPFHR&S Project proposes to conduct fire salvage, roadside treatments (fuels reduction and dead
tree removal or treatment), tree planting, and/or maintenance on approximately 105 acres of riparian
assemblage habitats (Table 3-29). Some habitat within the treatment units now consist of habitat
conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of riparian habitat. Total acres being
treated under the Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of riparian assemblage
habitat within it would be much lower than 105 acres (it would be approximately half).
The Proposed Action would only remove or treat trees and vegetation that are dead (no green limbs) at the
time of implementation, as well as during future maintenance. Treatment of riparian species (examples

include but are not limited to big leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus
spp.)) would be limited to hazard tree abatement (no riparian tree species would be salvaged). This project
contains resource protection measures (RPMs) for Riparian Reserves which would protect the riparian
habitat assemblage. Within Riparian Reserves, Equipment Exclusion Zones (EEZs) exist along perennial
and intermittent streams and wetlands (Riparian Reserve boundaries and EEZs are much wider than the
actual riparian assemblage vegetation). Hand treatments that may occur within EEZs would not treat
green vegetation or disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow
(Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.). Snags felled in riparian areas will typically be left on site unless there
is a site specific reason for removing them, such as heavy fuel loading (greater than 20 tons/acre).
Changes in riparian canopy cover are expected to be negligible. Fire killed trees have few if any leaves
remaining, therefore canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the removal or treatment of dead
trees. The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of this
alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size
classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. As a
result, the project area would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation
(Table 3-44). Although there is a slight possibility that trees felled within riparian areas may fall on
riparian vegetation, there would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as
a result of this alternative.

Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat
There is no change in the amount of riparian assemblage habitat from this alternative (the project does not
convert any acres from this assemblage to another), so there would not be cumulative effects on the
assemblage habitat due to this alternative.
Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale
According to Forest level estimates, there are currently 1,500 acres of riparian assemblage habitat mapped
on National Forest System lands in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. 88 Within the last decade, the trend
for riparian assemblage on the Forest is steady at 0.07% of habitat on National Forest lands. The steady
trend in amount of Forest wide riparian assemblage habitat would be expected due to implementation of
the Aquatic Conservation Strategy since 1994, which focuses on maintaining and restoring aquatic and
riparian ecosystems on National Forest lands (Table 3-45).

Due to the small amount of riparian habitat potentially impacted by the project, even if potential
unforeseen indirect effects are realized, these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest
Since this assemblage is narrowly defined and difficult to track at the Forest level due to the fine resolution required to detect
the occurrence of streamside vegetation, the Forest wide acreage figure is likely an underestimate of actual riparian assemblage
habitat on the Forest.

level habitat trends for management indicator assemblages. Effects of this proposed action are consistent
with the steady Forest wide trend for riparian assemblage habitat as the action would not result in a
change in the amount of riparian habitat. The project would make the riparian assemblage habitat more
resilient to fire damage, and thus more sustainable over time.
Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Yellow Warbler
The riparian habitat in the project units is characterized as montane riparian CWHR type, with CWHR
tree sizes 1-4 and sparse to dense canopy cover. This habitat provides moderate and high quality yellow
warbler nesting habitat, which would persist after treatments because the project is designed to avoid
impacts to riparian vegetation. In the long term, there would be little difference in the quality of riparian
assemblage habitat between the proposed action and no action because of the minimal effects of the
proposed action to riparian assemblage habitats.
Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Yellow Warbler Population Trends
As described above, the Forest level trend for riparian assemblage habitat is steady (Table 3-45). Project
effects are consistent with the steady Forest wide trend in riparian assemblage habitat. Implementation of
this project would not affect the Forest wide trend because it would not increase or decrease the amount
of riparian assemblage habitat available. Qualitative effects to yellow warbler habitat are expected to have
no measurable effect on habitat quality in the short term or the long term.
Population trends for the yellow warbler are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate
a potentially decreasing population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
This decrease is supported by statistical analysis in the California foothills BBS strata (Sauer et al. 2008).
In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and Forest level habitat trends, the
project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends and habitat availability for the
yellow warbler.
Effects of Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 55 acres of riparian assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-29). Treatment of
riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged.
Per the RPMs (see description under Proposed Action above), hand treatments that may occur within
EEZs would not treat green vegetation or disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer
macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.), unless they are considered hazardous.
Overstory canopy cover (above riparian vegetation) would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal
or treatment of dying non-riparian species hazard trees, as well as live non-riparian trees and vegetation in
the fuelbreaks. Only four acres of riparian vegetation exists within the fuelbreaks. Canopy cover of
riparian species would be slightly reduced in some areas because hazardous riparian tree species would be
treated/removed. However, fire-killed trees would have few if any leaves left. The CWHR tree size class
would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in
assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are
included in the riparian assemblage. The treated stands would be slightly more open and less densely
stocked with trees, they would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation.
There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this
alternative. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each
side of the road, Alternative 2 would impact more acres of riparian habitat because its total project
footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a
decrease in canopy cover and density under Alternative 2.
Effects of Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, 105 acres of riparian assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29). Treatment of
riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged.

Overstory canopy cover (above riparian vegetation) would be slightly reduced as a result of the removal

However, fire-killed trees would have few if any leaves left. The CWHR tree size class would not be

the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road,
Alternative 3 would impact more acres of riparian habitat because its total project footprint is larger than
that of the Proposed Action and Alternative 2. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have
a decrease in canopy cover and density under Alternative 3.
Effects of Alternative 4
Under Alternative 4, 105 acres of riparian assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-29). Treatment of
riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged.
Within all treatment units, riparian species would not be removed or treated unless they are completely
dead at time of implementation, as well as during future maintenance. Per the RPMs (see description
under Proposed Action), hand treatments that may occur within EEZs would not treat green vegetation or
disturb riparian plant species such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), willow (Salix spp.) and alder
(Alnus spp.).
The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the alternative,
and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and
canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. The project area
would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. There would not be
acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. The effects
of this alternative to the riparian assemblage would be similar to the Proposed Action. When the actual
footprint of the Proposed Action and Alternative 4 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the
road, Alternative 4 would impact about the same number of acres of riparian habitat.
Effects of Alternative 5
Under Alternative 5, 105 acres of riparian assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-29). Treatment of
riparian vegetation would be limited to hazard tree abatement, no riparian tree species would be salvaged.
The same Riparian Reserve RPMs under the Proposed Action apply to Alternative 5.
The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the alternative,
and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all riparian tree size classes and
canopy cover classes of riparian vegetation are included in the riparian assemblage. The project area
would continue to provide habitat for species associated with riparian vegetation. There would not be
acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. When the
actual footprint of the Proposed Action and Alternative 5 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side
of the road, Alternative 5 would impact about the same number of acres of riparian habitat as Alternative
1. In the short term, the impacts would be less under Alternative 5 because treatments are less intense
within Riparian Reserves. However, in the long term, since fuels reduction, including removal of felled
hazard trees, would not occur within Riparian Reserves, Alternative 5 may result in riparian areas that are
less resilient to fire.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Effects of Connected Actions (All Alternatives)
Under all alternatives, road reconstruction activities, specifically culvert replacement, may impact the
riparian assemblage. Some connected actions are located within the proposed project treatment units,
therefore the impacts to riparian vegetation in those areas have already been analyzed and included above.
Additional impacts from connected actions located outside treatment units are described below. Due to
the steep terrain of the vast majority of the project area, riparian vegetation is very limited and highly
restricted to the immediate edges of streams, when present at all. The amount of riparian vegetation
calculated and described below is likely an overestimate.
Road Restoration
The project proposes to restore approximately 4.7 miles of roads. Beyond the road closures, measures
would be implemented, as necessary, to reduce sediment delivery from the road surface to make it
hydrologically neutral. These measures may include removing all structures including culverts. The
majority of the proposed roads are in dry upland areas, far from waterways. Two of the proposed roads
cross an intermittent creek, however riparian vegetation is not expected to be present due to lack of
consistent or perennial flow. None of the proposed roads cross perennial creeks; therefore, impacts to
riparian vegetation are not expected.
Road Reconstruction
The project proposes replacement of 12 culverts that are undersized, worn, or damaged to withstand 100year peak flows and/or debris flows. Some minor excavation of sediment depositions on the upstream
side of the crossings near the culvert inlets may also be required. Vegetation is generally limited or
lacking on fill slopes above culverts; however, a small amount of riparian vegetation within and outside of
the fill slope may be present. As a result, approximately 0.4 acres of riparian habitat may be impacted.
Road Maintenance
The project proposes maintenance activities at 35 culverts, including clearing culvert inlets and outlets of
debris or installing riprap to remediate erosion. These activities will be conducted by equipment from the
roadway, or by hand, therefore, impacts to riparian vegetation will be very minimal.
Summary
The CWHR tree size class and riparian canopy cover would not be changed as a result of the Connected
Actions, and these activities would not result in a change in assemblage. All riparian tree size classes and
canopy cover classes are included in the riparian assemblage. Impacts to riparian vegetation will be very
minimal; therefore, connected actions are not likely to result in any meaningful change to population
trends or habitat availability for the yellow warbler. The project area would continue to provide habitat for
species associated with riparian vegetation.
Chaparral (chamise-redshank, mixed, and montane chaparral) Wildlife Assemblage (wrentit)
This assemblage is defined as: all shrub sizes and all shrub density classes of chamise-redshank chaparral,

Habitat/Species Relationship
The wrentit occupies chaparral habitats with dense structure (CDFG 2008). The species is strongly
associated with dense chaparral vegetation that is likely to be affected by the project. This species nests in
dense shrubs (CDFG 2008). Preferred wrentit nesting habitat includes moderate to dense chaparral

This alternative occurs on 539 acres of montane and mixed chaparral habitat of all CWHR shrub size
classes and sparse to moderate densities. The 2015 fires burned at all severity levels, however
approximately 60% of the chaparral habitat within the project area burned at moderate to high severity
(25-100% basal area mortality). As a result of the fires, chaparral densities have decreased; however the
project area provides some moderate quality nesting habitat for the wrentit.
Effects of Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
Direct and Indirect Effects to Assemblage Habitat
The TPFHR&S Project proposes to conduct roadside treatments (fuels reduction) and maintenance on
approximately 539 acres of chaparral assemblage habitats (Table 3-29). Some habitat within the treatment
units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator assemblage definition of
chaparral habitat. Due to the variable width buffer proposed under the Proposed Action, all chaparral
assemblage habitat within 300 feet of each side of the road was included in this analysis. In reality, the
total buffer for the Proposed Action would be 300 feet, not 600 feet. Total acres being treated under the
Proposed Action would only be 7,969, therefore the amount of chaparral assemblage habitat within it
would be much lower than 539 acres (it would be approximately half).
Effects to chaparral would be limited to fuels reduction treatments and maintenance and only shrubs dead
at the time of implementation (as well as during future maintenance) would be treated. Dead shrubs
would be reduced by 50-100%. The CWHR shrub size class would not be changed as a result of this
alternative, and this alternative would not result in a change in assemblage because all chaparral shrub
size classes are included in the chaparral assemblage. Chaparral density would not be reduced as a result
of this alternative because only dead shrubs would be treated. Chaparral assemblage habitat includes all
shrub density classes of chaparral vegetation. The project area would continue to provide habitat for
species associated with chaparral vegetation (Table 3-46). There would not be acreage change or
conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. There would likely be an
overall increase in chaparral habitat within the project area (and within the fire footprint outside of the
project area) due to the effects of the fires.

Cumulative Effects to Assemblage Habitat
There is no change in the amount of chaparral assemblage habitat from this alternative (the project does
not convert any acres from this assemblage to another), so there would not be cumulative effects on the
assemblage habitat.
Influence of Project Effects to Habitat Status and Trends at the Forest scale
There are currently 58,000 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat mapped on National Forest System lands
in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Within the last decade, the trend for chaparral assemblage on the
Forest is steady at 3% of habitat on National Forest lands (Table 3-47).

In the long term, this proposed action would not affect Forest wide trends in chaparral habitat because it
would not change the amount of habitat at the project level. To put the project’s influence into
perspective, it affects less than 1% of the Forest wide assemblage habitat. Due to the small scale, even if
potential indirect effects are realized, these effects are not expected to meaningfully influence Forest level
habitat trends for management indicator assemblages.
Direct and Indirect Effects to Breeding Habitat for Wrentit
The chaparral assemblage habitat in the project units consists of montane and mixed chaparral habitat of
all CWHR size classes and sparse to moderate densities. The areas of this habitat that burned at low
severity likely still provide some moderate quality nesting habitat for the wrentit. The areas that burned at
moderate to high severity likely had high shrub mortality and do not currently have enough cover to be
suitable for nesting. Most chaparral species are adapted to fire, responding to moderate to high severity
fires by sprouting from the root collar within one year of the burn (K. McElroy, personal communication,
June 21, 2016), therefore in the long-term, chaparral densities are expected to recover. This alternative’s
treatments would not reduce shrub density because only dead shrubs would be treated, thus habitat quality
for the wrentit would not be reduced. In untreated parts of the project area (and within the fire footprint
outside of the project area) there would likely be an overall increase of nesting habitat for wrentit due to
the effects of the fires.
Relationship of Project-Level Habitat Impacts to Larger Wrentit Population Trends
As described above, Forest level trends show a steady trend in chaparral habitat (Table 3-47).
Implementation of this project would likely not affect the Forest wide steady trend in chaparral
assemblage habitat. Minor effects caused by this alternative are not likely to meaningfully impact Forest
level habitat trends.
Population trends for the wrentit are tracked and compiled at the Forest level. These data indicate a fairly
stable population within the BBS strata that overlap the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Most of the BBS
strata that occur on the Forest show a slight decline, but these declines are not statistically supported. The
population appears to be increasing in the Pitt-Klamath BBS strata, and this increase is statistically
supported (Sauer et al. 2008). In light of best available population data, project effects to habitat, and
Forest level habitat trends, the project is not likely to result in any meaningful change to population trends
and habitat availability for the wrentit.

Effects of Alternative 2
Under Alternative 2, 284 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-29). Some
habitat within the treatment units now consist of habitat conditions that meet the management indicator
assemblage definition of chaparral habitat. Within the fuelbreaks, there are only 19 acres of chaparral
habitat (Table 3-29).
The CWHR shrub size class would not be changed as a result of this alternative, and this alternative
would not result in a change in assemblage because all chaparral shrub size classes are included in the
chaparral assemblage. This alternative treats both dead and dying vegetation, as well as live vegetation in
the fuelbreaks; therefore, chaparral density would be reduced. However, this would not result in a change
in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes all shrub density classes of chaparral
vegetation. Although the treated stands would be more open, they would continue to provide habitat for
species associated with chaparral vegetation. There would not be acreage change or conversion into
another assemblage directly as a result of Alternative 2. Treatments may reduce the density of chaparral,
however, there would likely be an overall increase in chaparral habitat in untreated parts of the project
area (and within the fire footprint outside of the project area) due to the effects of the fires. When the
actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road,
Alternative 2 would impact more acres of chaparral habitat because its total project footprint is larger than
the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres would have a decrease in shrub
density, due to the treatments of dying vegetation as well as live vegetation within the fuelbreaks.
Effects of Alternative 3
Under Alternative 3, 539 acres of chaparral assemblage would be treated (Table 3-29). There would not
be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this alternative. This
alternative treats both dead and dying vegetation; therefore, chaparral density would be reduced.
However, this would not result in a change in assemblage type because this assemblage habitat includes
all shrub density classes of chaparral vegetation. Although the treated stands would be more open, they
would continue to provide habitat for species associated with chaparral vegetation. There would not be
acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of Alternative 3. Treatments
may reduce the density of chaparral, however, there would likely be an overall increase in chaparral
habitat in untreated parts of the project area (and within the fire footprint outside of the project area) due
to the effects of the fires. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action is considered, instead of 300
feet on each side of the road, Alternative 3 would impact more acres of chaparral habitat because its total
project footprint is larger than the Proposed Action’s. Compared to the Proposed Action, more acres
would have a decrease in shrub density, due to the treatments of dying vegetation.
Effects of Alternative 4
Under Alternative 4, 539 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat would be treated (Table 3-29). Only dead
vegetation would be treated. There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage
directly as a result of this alternative and the effects of this alternative to chaparral assemblage habitats
would be the same as the Proposed Action. When the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and
Alternative 4 are considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, Alternative 4 would impact
about the same number of acres of chaparral habitat.
Effects of Alternative 5
Under Alternative 5, there are 539 acres of chaparral assemblage habitat within the treatment units (Table
3-29). Only dead vegetation would be treated. Of the total chaparral assemblage within Alternative 5
units, 146 acres of chaparral would not be affected because it is within units that would only undergo
hazard mitigation (no removal or fuels reduction treatments). Thus, 393 acres of chaparral may be treated.
There would not be acreage change or conversion into another assemblage directly as a result of this
alternative and the effects of this alternative to chaparral assemblage habitats would be the same as the

Proposed Action. However, when the actual footprint of the Proposed Action and Alternative 5 are
considered, instead of 300 feet on each side of the road, fewer acres of chaparral would be impacted by
Alternative 5 than Alternative 1 due to the hazard mitigation only treatments.

Climate Change

The climate in the project area is best classified as Mediterranean, with cool, wet winters and hot, dry
summers. The growing season for forest vegetation is constrained by the cool to cold winter temperatures
and lack of sufficient summer precipitation. California’s statewide average annual-mean surface
temperature increased by 1.03°F during years 1949–1999; with climate models showing winter and spring
warming throughout the state over the last few decades. Additional increases in warming have been
modeled, but there is no indication of change in the state’s seasonal precipitation regime (Cayan et al.
2006). In California climate models, most precipitation continues to occur during winter storm events
(snow and rain). Summer precipitation changes only incrementally, and actually decreases in some of the
models.
Climate warming is projected to reduce snow accumulation in California since warming causes more of
the precipitation to fall as rain and less as snow, and reductions in snowfall will increase as warming
increases (Cayan et al. 2006). Forests in northern California have had substantially increased wildfire
activity since 2000 (Westerling et al. 2006), and wildfire frequency is strongly associated with regional
spring and summer temperatures. Earlier snowmelt dates also correspond to increased wildfire frequency
(Westerling et al. 2006). Temperature increases exacerbate summer drought conditions and, thus,
flammability of forests fuels increases (Westerling et al. 2006).

Because of its very limited scope and scale in relation to the global scale of climatic patterns, the
proposed project is not expected to have any measureable effect on climate, and will thus cause no
measurable climate change-related effects to any wildlife species or habitats analyzed in any of the
project wildlife reports.

Hydrology
The Forest will comply with the Clean Water Act, the California Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control
Act, applicable water-quality control plans and policies enacted by the North Coast Regional Water
Quality Control Water Board (Water Board), and Forest Service Handbook FSH 2509.22 Chapter 10
through enrollment in the Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges
Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities on National Forest System lands in the North
Coast Region. An Alternative Treatment Plan (page 25 of the Waiver, Category B Condition 3) was
developed through collaboration with the Water Board and was incorporated into the project design. The
Alternative Treatment Plan and the Notice of Intent will be submitted to the Water Board following a
decision being made, as mandated by the Waiver (page 28 of the Waiver, Category B Waiver Application
Procedures).
The process for developing the Alternative Treatment Plan started with the identification of all the legacy
sediment sources in the watersheds that this project occurs in. The Forest evaluated these legacy sediment
sources and the Alternative Treatment Plan proposes to treat the moderate and high risk sites. In addition
to treating these legacy sediment sites, water quality will be managed by implementing Best Management
Practices (BMPs).

Methodology

A water quality evaluation is required for all environmental impact analyses to identify the water quality
implications of proposed and alternative land management practices (FSM 2530). This requirement is
satisfied in the analysis below by identifying: (1) designated beneficial uses of the watersheds, (2)
pollutants in the watersheds, (3) sources of the pollutants, and (4) causes of the pollutants. Beneficial uses
are designated by the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board for each of the waterbodies
within its jurisdiction (NCRWQB, 2011). Whether a waterbody meets the needs of designated beneficial
uses is the primary criterion for water quality. Pollutants that are impairing the designated uses are
identified in the State of California’s integrated report to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on
sections 303(d) and 305(b) of the Clean Water Act (NCRWQB, 2015). General sources and causes of
pollution are addressed in the Total Maximum Daily Loads developed by the U.S. EPA. Specific sources
and causes of pollution are addressed in the effects analysis and Appendix D – Legacy Sediment Site
Plan.

Equivalent Roaded Area, Indirect Effects, and Cumulative Watershed
Effects

An assessment of the potential for cumulative watershed effects (CWE) is required for proposed activities
(R5 FSH 2509.22, Chapter 20 Soil Management Handbook). The approach adopted by the Forest Service
Pacific Southwest Region uses the equivalent roaded area (ERA) model developed by Haskins (1983) to
make a preliminary assessment of watershed conditions by comparing the effects of past, existing, and
reasonably foreseeable actions to a watershed threshold of concern (TOC).
ERA disturbance factors used by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest were developed using the coefficients
described by Haskins (1986), surrounding forests, and scientific literature. Disturbance factors for each
type of activity are described by an equation of the form:
𝑦 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∗ ln⁡(𝑥)
where y is the disturbance factor, a is a disturbance constant, b is a recovery coefficient, and x is duration
in years (The duration is the difference of the assessment year from the disturbance year). Activities used
to model the proposed action and alternatives include salvage logging in a high severity burn, salvage
logging in a moderate severity burn, tractor thin, chip and masticate, mechanical pile and burn, hand pile
and burn, and road decommissioning. It is assumed that salvage logging in unburned to low severity
burned areas will be approximately a thin. The constants and coefficients of each of these activities are
169

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

identified in the Physical Sciences Report. The disturbance factor y is multiplied by the activity area in
acres to calculate the ERA for the assessment year. The implementation of an activity with a positive
disturbance constant (such as mechanical piling and burning) will cause the ERA of a watershed to
increase, and a negative recovery coefficient will cause the ERA to decline (the watershed will recover).
The rate of recovery is dependent upon the recovery coefficient. For example, for mechanical piling and
burning, the disturbed area will recover by about 22% after three years and by about 68% after thirty
years.
The total amount of sediment produced by the Proposed Action that will eventually enter surface water
bodies has been estimated for each hydrologic unit. The equivalent roaded area of each alternative was
calculated using the ERA model, and converted to a total in tons based on an estimated 13.6 tons/road
mile calculated from the WEPP model (described in the Soils section of this chapter). Finally, based on
the connectivity of roads and proposed activities to stream courses, it was assumed that about 30% of the
total sediment produced would eventually enter a stream (C. Mai, personal communication, August 10,
2016). We know that stream buffers and other resource protection measures can reduce the amount of
sediment entering a stream, but even approximately predicting the amount of sediment at the watershed
scale is difficult to determine due to the numerous variables. Therefore, the results should be viewed as
best guess approximations of the amount of sediment that may reach the streams, rather than accurate
forecasts of what is known will happen.
CWE were analyzed by estimating the ERA within each hydrologic unit (HUC89 5 to 8). The results were
compared against the TOC established for each watershed that range from 12 to 18 percent ERA
(Appendix H of USDA, 1995b). The cumulative watershed effects in this report are shown as a risk ratio
of the ERA disturbance relative to the TOC90 (Table 3-48). A risk ratio greater than 1 means the watershed
is over the TOC. Effects of the 2015 wildfires, fire suppression, and proposed project activities are
forecast for a five year period. All other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions within the
affected hydrologic units that can be accounted for were also modeled. Past disturbances include: urban
development, agricultural crops and grazing, road construction, railroad and powerline development,
mines, timber harvest (including timber salvage on private lands after the 2015 fires), emergency
exemptions, fuels treatments, and other wildfires. Present and future foreseeable projects that have been
modelled include: Kellogg Fuels Reduction, Burnt Ranch, Sims Fire Restoration, 2015 Fire Reforestation,
PG&E Transmission Line Salvage, Gemmill, Westside Plantation, Trinity Alps prescribed burn,
Rattlesnake, and Trinity County Roads and Plantations Pilot Project.

The hydrologic unit code (HUC) uniquely identifies each hydrologic unit. The number associated with the HUC relates to
watershed size—higher numbers refer to smaller watersheds. Each hydrologic scale is represented by two numbers. A HUC 5 is
a ten digit code, a HUC 7 is a 14 digit code, etc.
90 TOC is developed only for HUC5s and HUC6s. Therefore, for HUC7s and HUC8s, the HUC6 TOC is used to calculate the
risk ratio.

Best Management Practices

Best management practices (BMPs) are required to control nonpoint source pollution related to all
management actions with the potential to affect water quality on National Forest System lands (FSM
2532 Water Resource Management), and all NEPA decisions are to incorporate site-specific BMPs for
protecting water quality (FSH 2509.22). BMPs from the Forest Service National BMPs (USDA, 2012)
have been selected for this project (Appendix C – Best Management Practices). Additionally, project
specific RPMs have been developed for the protection of water quality and Riparian Reserves (Chapter
2). Unless specifically indicated otherwise, all identified BMPs and RPMs apply to all watersheds and all
alternatives.

Sediment Source Identification and Treatment

An inventory of controllable sediment discharge sources and other legacy sites that may affect water
quality within project boundaries and along appurtenant National Forest System roads is required for
NEPA analyses for timber harvest, fuels, and vegetation management actions that include grounddisturbing activities (FSH 2509.22, Chapter 10 Watershed Planning). Sediment Source Inventory (SSI)
reports used to compile this information include: Middle South Fork Trinity River and Upper South Fork
Trinity River SSI (NSR, 2011), New River SSI (NRM, 2012b), Browns Creek, Canyon Creek, Lower
Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River and Upper Hayfork Creek SSI (NSR, 2012). Proposed
treatment areas that were not previously surveyed were field inventoried by USFS in 2015/2016 and sites
previously inventoried with high and moderate priority for treatments were also revisited by USFS. A list
of sites for each subwatershed (HUC 6) is provided in Appendix D – Legacy Sediment Site Plan
developed for this project.

Affected Environment

Portions of ten watersheds (HUC 5) in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest were burned by fires in 2015
(Table 3-49 and Figure 3- 10). Seven watersheds comprise the bulk of the fire area; these include Browns
Creek, Burnt Ranch, Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River, Middle South Fork Trinity
River, New River, and Upper Hayfork Creek. Lower Trinity River experienced only four acres of
moderate to high severity burned area and about 13 acres of total burned area, and is not considered
further in this analysis.

Existing designated beneficial uses of water for the South Fork Trinity River include: municipal,
domestic, agricultural and industrial supply; groundwater recharge and freshwater replenishment;
navigation; hydropower generation; water contact recreation, and non-contact water recreation;
commercial and sport fishing; cold freshwater habitat; wildlife habitat; rare, threatened, or endangered

resulted in non-attainment of water quality standards and is adversely affecting designated beneficial uses
– specifically commercial and sport fishing; cold freshwater habitat; rare, threatened, and endangered

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

A sediment source assessment conducted by the U.S. EPA identified general sources and causes of
sediment in the South Fork Trinity River sub-basin (U.S. EPA, 1998).The dominant source of sediment is
the steep and mountainous, highly erodible terrain located west of the South Fork Trinity River
(predominately in the Lower South Fork Trinity River watershed, and to a lesser degree in the Middle and
Upper South Fork Trinity River watersheds). Major causes of sediment include mass wasting (natural,
timber harvest-related, and road-related), road surface erosion, road washouts and gullies, hillslope
surface erosion (natural and timber harvest-related), and stream bank erosion (U.S. EPA, 1998). Mass
wasting is by far the dominant process, accounting for about 64% of the total sediment. Managementrelated sources (timber harvest, roads, and cumulative/other-mass wasting and bank erosion) account for
about 35% of the total sediment. Roads are associated with about 18% of the total sediment delivery, and
timber harvesting is associated with about 9%. Roads are the most significant cause of managementrelated sediment production.
The South Fork Trinity River sub-basin is also impaired for temperature; it is too high to fully support
aquatic habitat (U.S. EPA, 1998). High temperatures may result from natural conditions, water diversions,
loss of riparian vegetation, and excess sedimentation that has resulted in channel widening and decreased
water depths.

the disturbance level is moderate to low; and for Hyampom, the disturbance level is very high (Physical

Middle South Fork Trinity River
The disturbance level in Middle South Fork Trinity River watershed is moderate (Table 3-50). Middle
South Fork Trinity River is a Key Watershed. For Rattlesnake Creek-Post Mountain sub-watershed, the
disturbance level is moderate to low; for Cave Creek-Miller Springs sub-watershed, the disturbance level
is moderate; and the disturbance level of Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat is very high (Physical
Sciences Report Table 20). Middle South Fork Trinity River is a planning watershed. Planning watersheds
that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved
with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). In the Cave Creek-Swift Creek drainage,
one sub-drainage (1801021202020101) has a very high disturbance level in 2018, but reduces to a high
level of disturbance due to natural recovery by 2020.
Upper Hayfork Creek
The disturbance level is low in the Upper Hayfork Creek watershed for a projected five year period (Table

units have a high or very high disturbance level.
Upper South Fork Trinity River
The disturbance level in the Upper South Fork Trinity River watershed (Table 3-50) and Smoky Creek

2011). Industrial process supply is a potential future beneficial use.

Some portions of the Trinity River sub-basin (HUC 4) are on California’s Clean Water Act Section 303(d)
list because the state has determined that the water quality standards are exceeded due to excessive
sediment and mercury (NCRWQB, 2015). The mercury impairment occurs outside the project area and is
not considered further in this section. New River is not sediment impaired. A portion of Burnt Ranch is
sediment impaired, and Lower Trinity River, Canyon Creek and Browns Creek are sediment impaired.
The sediment impairment has resulted in non-attainment of designated beneficial uses – specifically
commercial and sport fishing; cold freshwater habitat; rare, threatened, and endangered species; migration
of aquatic organisms; and spawning, reproduction, and/or early development.
Sources and causes of sediment in the Trinity River sub-basin were assessed by the U.S. EPA (2001).The
dominant source of sediment is the Lower Trinity River watershed with a total sediment yield about twice
the rate of the other watersheds. For the Upper Middle Trinity River area (including Browns Creek), about
57% of the sediment yield was management related, with roads being a slightly greater cause than timber
harvest. For the Lower Middle Trinity River area (including New River, Burnt Ranch and Canyon Creek),
only about 19% of the total sediment yield was caused by management related activities, with roads
(17%) yielding a much greater sediment supply than timber harvest (1%).
Browns Creek
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects is moderate in Browns Creek for a projected five
year period (Table 3-50). In East Fork Browns Creek, the disturbance level is moderate to low (Physical
Sciences Report Table 23).

Burnt Ranch
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects is moderate in Burnt Ranch for a projected five
year period (Table 3-50). For the sub-watersheds, the risk in Big French Creek and Burnt Ranch Gorge is
low, and moderate in Don Juan Creek (Physical Sciences Report Table 24).
Canyon Creek
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects is low in Canyon Creek for a projected five year
period (Table 3-50), and moderate in Lower Canyon Creek (Table 25-Physical Sciences Report).
New River
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects in the New River watershed is low for a projected
five year period (Table 3-50). New River is a Key Watershed. For the sub-watersheds, the risk is low in
Big Creek-New River, Devils Canyon, Lower New River, and Upper New River; and it is moderate in
Sixmile Creek (Table 26-Physical Sciences Report).

Desired Condition

The Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) objectives in the Forest Plan (Page 4-53) provide direction for
watershed management on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The ACS objectives were developed to
maintain and restore the ecological health of the aquatic ecosystems of the forest. The ACS Compliance
document found in Appendix E of the EIS describes the objectives, the existing conditions, future
improvements, and the relationship between this project’s alternatives and each of the objectives.

Effects Analysis

The extent (geographic boundaries) of this analysis is each of the hydrologic units (HUC 5 through HUC
8) in which treatments occur.
The duration of the analysis is from 2018 to 2022 for several reasons. First, the potential for indirect
effects is reduced over time and is often not evident within 5 years after project implementation. Second,
there are no foreseeable future projects beyond 2019. Finally, although a watershed may take more than 5
years to recover from cumulative effects, it is expected that significant long term, potentially chronic
effects, will be present only in watersheds over TOC (Table 3-48).

Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
Direct Effects
Direct effects include sediment that immediately enters streams as a result of project activities. Examples
include the felling of trees into streams, and sediment directly entering streams at road/stream crossings.
Direct effects may also include a small increase in temperature due to a loss of canopy cover when the
trees in Riparian Reserves are felled.
Riparian Reserves provide a variety of important functions, including the control of sediment delivery to
receiving waters from uplands, and control of streambed and bank stability. Timber harvest activities and
road use accelerate soil erosion and sedimentation in streams by exposing mineral soil to erosive forces. If
sediment delivery from human activities significantly exceeds natural levels, then sediment deposition,
channel instability, and high levels of turbidity can occur.
Estimated required widths of unmanaged near-stream vegetation in forested watersheds needed to control
sediment is about 150 feet (Everest and Reeves, 2007). Due to the fact that Forest Service System roads
often intersect Riparian Reserves, it is not feasible to have an entirely unmanaged vegetation corridor in
Riparian Reserves. However, project RPMs will minimize the impacts of direct effects on the water
quality of the streams (Most notably RPMs 23 and 24, see Chapter 2).

176

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Best management practices (BMPs) have also been identified for the project and are listed in Appendix C.
Road maintenance and addressing legacy sediment sites identified in Appendix D will also mitigate the
impacts of sediment on the water quality of streams.
One notable exception where RPMs, BMPs, and road maintenance and repair are judged to be inadequate
to protect water quality against the direct effects of sediment is Forest Road 31N49. This road is about
three miles long and is located in Natural Bridge sub-watershed (HUC 6). The road lies within the
streambed of Carrier Gulch for much of its length. This road is a former jeep trail that was not designed to
Forest Service standards, and cannot be upgraded to comply with the standards. Therefore, no treatments
are proposed on this road and the portion of this road on National Forest System lands will be closed
under all action alternatives.
Indirect Effects
Proposed project activities that cause soil compaction and erosion may result in the indirect effect of
increased sediment in streams. This indirect effect can be mitigated somewhat by the project BMPs and
RPMs. Organic litter in upland areas and Riparian Reserves can reduce erosion, trap sediment and prevent
it from moving downhill to surface waters. Large woody debris in Riparian Reserves can trap and retain
sediment moving in stream channels, and prevent it from accumulating downstream.
The total amount of sediment produced by the Proposed Action that will eventually enter surface water
bodies has been estimated for each hydrologic unit. The results for fifth-field (HUC 5) watersheds are
presented in Table 3-51, and the results for all hydrologic units are presented in Tables 27 through 35 of
the Physical Sciences Report. The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the
affected watersheds is about 3,000 tons, or about 0.003 tons per acre. For comparison, the background
rate of sedimentation for just the South Fork Trinity River sub-basin averaged about 1.6 tons per acre per
year over the period 1944 to1990 (US EPA, 1998).

Indirect effects of the Proposed Action may also include an increase in stream temperatures. Increased
sediment can result in channel widening and decreased water depths, which can result in temperature
increases. However, increased amounts of large woody debris in streams should result in increased pool
depths, which will result in reduced stream temperatures. Estimated required widths of unmanaged nearstream vegetation in forested watersheds needed to maintain water temperature is about 150 feet (Everest
and Reeves, 2007). By implementing the project BMPs and RPMs, increases in stream temperatures
should be negligible.

Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects have been analyzed for the Proposed Action for each watershed, sub-watershed,
drainage, and sub-drainage in the project area. The results for fifth-field (HUC 5) watersheds are
presented in Table 3-52, and all of the results are presented in Tables 36 through 44 of the Physical
Sciences Report. Although a change in the risk ratio of a few percent relative to the baseline condition is
common (especially for HUC 7s and 8s) these changes are considered to be fairly negligible. Only the
changes that have caused a change in the risk description (e.g. moderate in the baseline CWE and high in
the Proposed Action CWE) are specifically addressed in the text. HUCs that are over the TOC (very high
risk) are discussed in more detail.

Lower Hayfork Creek
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in Lower Hayfork Creek
(Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) (the disturbance level is low for each). For
the sub-watersheds (6th field) and the drainages (7th field), there are no large differences between the
baseline and the Proposed Action.
Lower South Fork Trinity River
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Lower South Fork
Trinity River watershed (Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) (the disturbance
level is moderate throughout the analysis period for each). For Eltapom Creek sub-watershed, the
disturbance level is moderate-to-low for both the Proposed Action and the baseline.
Hyampom sub-watershed (HUC 6) is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation is required if the Proposed
Action is implemented. Hyampom is a planning watershed, and watersheds that are over TOC, regardless
of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with appropriate mitigation
measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). To improve Hyampom, it is necessary to reduce the risk ratio (through
mitigation) more than the Proposed Action increases the risk ratio. Therefore, mechanized piling and
burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to
low severity burned areas in Hyampom is removed from the Proposed Action. With these changes, by
2022, the ERA reduction caused by chipping and masticating (-15.4 acres) will more than offset the ERA
increase caused by salvage logging and piling and burning (+15.0 acres). Additionally, about 1.6 miles of
unauthorized roads will be restored, thereby further reducing the ERA (-2.3 acres). No open system roads
will be decommissioned.

178

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Three of the five drainages (HUC7s) in Hyampom have very high disturbance levels (Big CreekHyampom, Hyampom Valley and Pelletreau Creek), while two do not (Big Slide Creek-South Fork
Trinity River and Grapevine Creek-South Fork Trinity River).
Middle South Fork Trinity River
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Middle South Fork
Trinity River watershed (Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) (the disturbance
level is moderate throughout the analysis period for each). For Cave Creek-Miller Springs sub-watershed,
the risk of cumulative effects is moderate throughout the analysis period. For Rattlesnake Creek-Post
Mountain sub-watershed, the risk of cumulative effects is low by the end of the analysis period.
Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat sub-watershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation is required if the
Proposed Action is implemented. Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat is a planning watershed, and
watersheds that are over TOC, regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be
improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). Mechanized piling and burning
is replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the
unburned to low severity burned areas in in this sub-watershed is removed from the Proposed Action.
With these changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused by chipping and masticating (-1.9 acres) will
more than offset the ERA increase caused by salvage logging and piling and burning (+1.2 acres). About
3.2 miles of non-system roads identified in the Legacy Sediment Treatment Plan (Appendix D – Legacy
Sediment Site Plan will also be hydrologically restored, thereby reducing the ERA further (-4.6 acres).
Only one of the two HUC7s in Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat have a very high disturbance level
(Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat.
One sub-drainage (HUC8) within Cave Creek-Swift Creek (1801021202020101) has a very high
disturbance level if the Proposed Action is implemented.
Upper Hayfork Creek
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Upper Hayfork
Creek watershed (Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) (the disturbance level of
cumulative effects throughout the analysis period is low for each). There are negligible differences for
each of the sub-watersheds (HUC6s) as well. For the drainages (HUC7s), there are no large differences
between the baseline and the Proposed Action. There are no drainages or sub-drainages for which the
disturbance level is high or very high at any time during the analysis period.
Upper South Fork Trinity River
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Upper South Fork
Trinity River watershed (Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) for all hydrologic
units. There are no hydrologic units for which the disturbance level is high or very high at any time during
the analysis period.
Trinity River
Browns Creek
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in Browns Creek (Table
3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) for all hydrologic units. There are no hydrologic
units over the TOC, and there are no hydrologic units for which the disturbance level of cumulative
effects is high or very high at any time during the analysis period.
Burnt Ranch
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Burnt Ranch
watershed (Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) for all hydrologic units. There are
179

Final Environmental Impact Statement

no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC, and there are no hydrologic units for which the
disturbance level is considered high or very high at any time during the analysis period.
Canyon Creek
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action in the Canyon Creek
watershed (Table 3-52) is similar to the baseline condition (Table 3-50) for all hydrologic units. Neither
Canyon Creek nor Lower Canyon Creek are over the TOC, and there are no hydrologic units for which
the disturbance level is high or very high at any time during the analysis period.
New River
The disturbance level of cumulative watershed effects for the Proposed Action (Table 3-52) is similar to
the baseline condition (Table 3-50) for the New River watershed and its’ sub-watersheds and drainages. In
Big Creek-New River, the disturbance level of some of the sub-drainages increases to moderate in 2020,
but in all instances the disturbance levels are reduced to low by 2022. In Lower New-River, the
disturbance level of Bell Creek will temporarily increase to moderate. Neither the New River watershed
nor any of its sub-watersheds are over the TOC. There is one sub-drainage (1801021110040203 in Barron
Creek-Carraway Creek) for which the disturbance level is high in 2018, but it reduces to moderate by
2020.

Alternative 2
Direct Effects
The direct effects of Alternative 2 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed
Action (the number of road miles and road/stream crossings are the same). Direct effects should be
negligible to minimal as long as the BMPs and RPMs are implemented.
Indirect Effects
The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is slightly
more for Alternative 2 (about 4,000 tons or about 0.003 tons per acre) compared to the Proposed Action
due to the increased footprint. Lower South Fork Trinity will increase to about 700 tons of sediment
(about 300 tons for the Proposed Action) (See Physical Sciences Report). Sediment in Lower Hayfork
Creek will increase from about 500 to 600 tons. Sediment entering streams in Burnt Ranch will increase
from about 200 tons to about 400 tons. Indirect effects for the other watersheds will be about the same as
the Proposed Action.
Cumulative Effects
The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 2 is similar to the Proposed Action for most
hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River,
Upper Hayfork Creek, and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds
over the TOC or at high risk.
In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom sub-watershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation
would be required if Alternative 2 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning will be replaced with
hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas
in Hyampom will be removed from Alternative 2. With these changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused
by chipping and masticating (-24.3 acres) will more than offset the ERA increase caused by salvage
logging and piling and burning (+21.3 acres). Additionally, about 1.6 miles of unauthorized roads will be
restored, thereby further reducing the ERA (-2.3 acres). No open system roads would be decommissioned.
The HUC7s and HUC8s that are over the TOC for Alternative 2, are also over for the Proposed Action.
In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat sub-watershed is over the TOC;
therefore, mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur GladeWaldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas in in this sub-watershed is
180

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

removed from Alternative 2. With these changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused by chipping and
masticating (-6.1 acres) will more than offset the ERA increase caused by salvage logging and piling and
burning (+4.5 acres). About 3.2 miles of non-system roads identified in Appendix D – Legacy Sediment
Site Plan will also be hydrologically restored, thereby reducing the ERA further (-4.6 acres). Like the
Proposed Action, Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat drainage and its sub-drainages are at very high disturbance
levels.

Alternative 3
Direct Effects
The direct effects of Alternative 3 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed
Action as long as the BMPs and RPMs are implemented.
Indirect Effects
The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is about
6,000 tons (about 0.005 tons per acre) for Alternative 3 (compared to about 3,000 tons for the Proposed
Action). This increase in the amount of sediment is due to the increased footprint. Sediment entering
streams in the Lower Hayfork Creek watershed will increase to about 900 tons (500 tons in the Proposed
Action) (See Physical Sciences Report). Lower South Fork Trinity watershed will increase to about 600
tons of sediment (about 300 tons for the Proposed Action). Sediment in the Middle South Fork Trinity
watershed will increase from about 500 to 900 tons. Sediment entering the streams in the Upper Hayfork
Creek watershed will increase to about 1000 tons (600 tons in the Proposed Action). Sediment in streams
of the Upper South Fork Trinity River watershed will increase from about 30 tons to 50 tons. Sediment
entering streams in the Browns Creek watershed will increase from about 90 tons to about 200 tons.
Sediment entering streams in the Burnt Ranch watershed will increase from about 200 tons to about 300
tons. Sediment in the Canyon Creek watershed will increase to about 20 tons from about 9 tons. Sediment
in streams of the New River watershed will increase from about 1000 tons to 2000 tons.
Cumulative Effects
The risk of cumulative watershed effects is slightly greater for Alternative 3 compared to the Proposed
Action for most hydrologic units (risk ratios are typically about zero to five percentage points higher).
Changes in the disturbance level of most hydrologic units is usually insignificant however.
For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River, Upper Hayfork
Creek, and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds over the TOC or at
high risk. In the Olsen Creek drainage of Lower Hayfork Creek, the disturbance level of one sub-drainage
(1801021204050405) is high in 2020 instead of moderate like in the proposed action. In Upper Hayfork
Creek, a sub-drainage of Halls City Creek-Wilson Creek (1801021203010403) has a high disturbance
level in 2020 (moderate for the Proposed Action).
In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom sub-watershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation
would be required if Alternative 3 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning will be replaced with
hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas
in Hyampom will be removed from Alternative 3. With these changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused
by chipping and masticating (-28.2 acres) will more than offset the ERA increase caused by salvage
logging and piling and burning (+27.5 acres). Additionally about 1.6 miles of unauthorized roads will be
restored, thereby further reducing the ERA (-2.3 acres). No open system roads would be decommissioned.
The drainages (HUC7) and sub-drainages (HUC8) that have very high disturbance levels for this
alternative are also very high in the Proposed Action.
In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat sub-watershed is over the TOC;
therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 3 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning is
replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the
unburned to low severity burned areas in in this sub-watershed is removed from Alternative 3. With these
181

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused by chipping and masticating (-3.7 acres) will more than
offset the ERA increase caused by salvage logging and piling and burning (+2.5 acres). About 3.2 miles of
non-system roads identified in Appendix D – Legacy Sediment Site Plan will also be hydrologically
restored, thereby reducing the ERA further (-4.6 acres). No open system roads would be decommissioned.
The drainages (HUC7) and sub-drainages (HUC8) that have very high disturbance levels for this
alternative are also very high in the Proposed Action.

Alternative 4
Direct Effects
The direct effects of Alternative 4 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed
Action with the BMPs and RPMs.
Indirect Effects
The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is about
2,000 tons (about 0.002 tons per acre) for Alternative 4 (compared to about 3,000 tons for the Proposed
Action). Except for Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River, and New River (See Physical
Sciences Report), the estimated total amount of sediment for each watershed will be less than half of that
of the Proposed Action.
Cumulative Effects
The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 4 is similar to the Proposed Action for most
hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River,
Upper Hayfork Creek and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds
over the TOC or at a high disturbance level.
In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom sub-watershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation
would be required if Alternative 4 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning will be replaced with
hand piling and burning in Hyampom, and salvage logging of the unburned to low severity burned areas
in Hyampom will be removed from Alternative 4. With these changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused
chipping and masticating (-12.5 acres) will more than offset the ERA increase caused by salvage logging
and piling and burning (+8.2 acres). Additionally, about 1.6 miles of unauthorized roads will be restored,
thereby further reducing the ERA (-2.3 acres). No open system roads would be decommissioned. The
drainages (HUC7) and sub-drainages (HUC8) that have very high disturbance levels for this alternative
are also very high for the Proposed Action.
In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat sub-watershed is over the TOC;
therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 4 is implemented. Mechanized piling and burning is
replaced with hand piling and burning in Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat, and salvage logging of the
unburned to low severity burned areas in in this sub-watershed is removed from Alternative 4. With these
changes, by 2022, the ERA reduction caused by chipping and masticating (-1.0 acres) will more than
offset the ERA increase caused by salvage logging and piling and burning (+0.5 acres). Additionally,
about 3.2 miles of unauthorized roads will be restored, thereby further reducing the ERA (-4.6 acres). No
open system roads would be decommissioned. The drainages (HUC7) and sub-drainages (HUC8) that
have very high disturbance levels for this alternative are also very high in the Proposed Action.

Alternative 5
Direct Effects
The direct effects of Alternative 5 on temperature and sediment are expected to be similar to the Proposed
Action with the BMPs and RPMs.

182

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Indirect Effects
The estimated total amount of sediment that will enter streams in all the watersheds combined is about
500 (about 0.0004 tons per acre) for Alternative 5 (compared to about 3,000 tons for the Proposed
Action). For Lower Hayfork Creek and New River (See Physical Sciences Report), the estimated total
amount of sediment will be one fifth of that of the Proposed Action. For Burnt Ranch, the estimated
amount of sediment is 15% of that of the Proposed Action. For Browns Creek, Canyon Creek, Middle
South Fork Trinity River, Upper Hayfork Creek, and Upper South Fork Trinity River, the estimated
amount of sediment will be one tenth of that of the Proposed Action. For Lower South Fork Trinity River,
the total amount of indirect sediment will be negligible (about 0 tons).
Cumulative Effects
The risk of cumulative watershed effects for Alternative 5 is similar to the Proposed Action for most
hydrologic units. For Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, New River,
Upper Hayfork Creek, and Upper South Fork Trinity River, there are no watersheds or sub-watersheds
over the TOC or at a high disturbance level.
In Hyampom and Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat sub-watersheds, although they are over the TOC,
there are no activities proposed for this alternative, so mitigation will not be required.

Alternative 6 (No Action)
Direct Effects
There are no direct effects associated with the No Action Alternative.
Indirect Effects
If no action is taken by the Forest Service, then the increases in sediment delivery to the streams from the
Proposed Action (or any of the other action alternatives) will not occur. However, it is anticipated that if
the timber is not salvaged by the Forest Service, then at least some of it will be harvested by unauthorized
activities. In this event, it is unlikely that RPMs and BMPs will be implemented. Therefore, depending on
the extent of any unauthorized logging, it is possible that more sediment could enter the streams than
would occur by the timber salvage activities in the Proposed Action.
Cumulative Effects
If no action is taken, then the cumulative effects for each hydrologic unit will be the same as the baseline
conditions described in the Affected Environment section of this report. Any unauthorized logging that
may occur has not been modelled because it is not possible to predict where it may occur, or its
magnitude. However, unauthorized logging will increase the ERA of the hydrologic units in which it is
located.

Aquatic resources are an emphasis on the STNF via the LRMP (USDA, 1995a); for example, page 4-25,
18.f: “Identify and treat areas with a degraded watershed condition in a cost-effective manner and
according to beneficial use priorities. High priority items include domestic use, anadromous fish habitat,
and sensitive species habitat”. These priorities are duplicated for the Trinity River watershed via the
multi-decadal US Bureau of Reclamation-funded Trinity River Restoration Program of which the STNF is
an active participant in, and a member of, the Trinity Management Council.
Riparian Reserves, critical for proper aquatic habitat function and management and as defined by the
Northwest Forest Plan ROD (USDA and USDI 1994a), receive strong protection from potential Project
impacts. Riparian Reserves on the STNF are scheduled to receive some of the proposed or alternative
actions by which adverse impacts to aquatic resources could feasibly be delivered. Riparian Reserves
were established in each watershed within and around areas that are directly coupled to streams or rivers.
The reserves generally parallel the stream network and were established to maintain hydrologic,
geomorphic, and ecologic processes and include other areas necessary for maintaining these processes.
The widths of the reserves are as wide as two site-potential trees in height on each side of fish-bearing
streams. Widths decrease for smaller or non-fish-bearing streams. The reserves are managed under special
Standards and Guidelines that prohibit and/or regulate forest management activities that would otherwise
retard or prevent attainment of Aquatic Conservation Strategy objectives USDA, 1995a; USDA and USDI
1994a). The reserves are a key element designed to maintain and restore riparian structure and function
and promote desirable water temperatures connectivity corridors for wildlife.
Fuels reduction activities and removal of fire-killed hazard trees in excess of large woody debris (LWD)
quantity needs will contribute to the health of riparian reserves by reducing severe or intense fires in and
near riparian reserves that could otherwise adversely affect aquatic systems. Based on the Project DEIS:
Figure 1-1 illustrates the specific fire complex locations described above, and includes past management
on the STNF within the same areas. (Figure obtained from the Project’s Forest Vegetation Report. Table

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Actions Common to All Five Action Alternatives

The primary means by which alternatives differ include levels of fuel reduction treatments prescribed,
how to treat (or not treat) felled trees, and the criteria used for identification of hazard trees. From the
Project Forest Vegetation Report:


Treatments in areas identified for fuels reduction treatment types for both initial entry and
maintenance could include: Mechanical or hand felling and removal of hazard trees utilizing
ground or cable logging systems. Hazard trees felled outside of the 300 foot buffer would be left
on site.



Reduction of fuel loading to 10-20 tons/acre including dead trees and brush. Dead brush will be
reduced by 50-100%. Dead vegetation will be identified at the time of treatment.
o Hand felling, which cuts down trees and/or brush using hand tools such as a chainsaw.
o

Mastication, which pulverizes or chops standing trees and logs into small particles. This
treatment can include mowing, mulching, or chipping.

o

Lopping woody debris (slash) and scattering around the treated area, which redistributes
woody material.
Pruning which removes lower limbs up to 10 feet from the ground.

o
o

Hand piling slash which concentrates slash and surface fuels in small piles. Machine piling
slash which utilizes equipment to pile slash and surface fuels into larger piles. Pile burning,
which is the prescribed ignition of created piles.

o

Jackpot burning, which is a burning method used to reduce heavy intermittent fuel
concentrations, where fuels are not continuous enough to carry a broadcast fire.

o

Broadcast burning, which is a burning method used where heavy continuous fuel
concentrations exist.

o

Chipping. This pulverizes or chops trees, brush, and logs into small particles, redistributing
surface fuels.

Utilize wood products whenever possible. This can include salvage logs, commercial or personal
use firewood, biomass removal, etc.
After the initial entry, vegetation will continue to grow, and trees will continue to succumb to fire damage
and subsequent insect and disease and fall to the ground. These processes contribute to increasing fuel
loading along roads once the initial Project implementation is complete. In order to sustain the desired
condition as it relates to hazard mitigation, follow-up treatments may be necessary to maintain fuel
loading levels between 10-20 tons/acre. Conditions will be evaluated and prescribed 10-15 years
following implementation.


Another interrelated or connected action required during implementation of any of the alternatives is
addressing up to 11 so-called road/stream crossing sites that have been deemed problem locations by
STNF internal Sediment Source Inventories (2016, 2012, and 2011) and reported to the North Coast
Water Quality Control Board. Generally, the crossing sites are culverts determined to be inadequately
sized to successfully pass stream discharges expected during larger storms such as a 100 year return
interval storm event. A road/stream crossing ford that currently passes vehicles directly across a flowing
stream must also be ameliorated. See further discussion about this specific activity under the description
of ‘Project elements’, particularly Project element 5, under the Project Description heading.

Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat subwatersheds are over the TOC and lie within the Project action area.
Decommissioning non-system (U) roads and upgrading Forest Service system roads have been included
in the action alternatives to serve as Cumulative Watershed Effects (CWE) TOC mitigation measures.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

PE 1 - Hazard Tree Mitigation and Reforestation
The need to conduct this activity is described in the Project Forest Vegetation Report:
“Roadside Safety Hazards- Trees killed by fire possess reduced structural integrity and are likely
to fail. Fire-killed trees of all age classes continue to fall along roads, threatening human safety,
road and trail access, and culvert efficacy.
Within and along the perimeters of the 2015 wildfires, 233 miles of open (maintenance level 2, 3 and 4)
National Forest Transportation System (NFTS) roads as well as state highways and county roads had a
mosaic of very low to high intensity fires burn along them. The open NFTS roads which bisect conifer
stands that experienced moderate to high severity wildfire have resulted in a considerable hazard to users
particularly in areas with steep topography. Dead trees fall to the ground, with the potential to fall into the
road or roll down toward open roads, resulting in heighted risk to public health and safety”. See a list of
road segment vegetation treatment mileages and acres in Table 1 of the Project fish BA.
Reforestation is also an important component of this phase of the action alternatives and would generally
be conducted as such: “Reforestation would occur within the road buffer in areas salvaged as well as
other historically forested areas that experienced moderate to high burn severity, thereby largely losing the
overstory (i.e. sources of natural seed). Reforestation would entail the planting of tree species historically
present in each stand. Tree species would include a mixture of Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, incense cedar,
sugar pine and red fir (South Fork Mountain only). Reforestation spacing could vary between 18-feet
by18-feet to 30-feet by 30-feet depending on site condition, terrain and existing vegetation. Within five
years after planting, there is an expected mortality rate of approximately 30%, which may vary depending
on weather/drought conditions and site. Live planted seedlings would be manually released (removal of
competing vegetation by hand, not chemically) approximately 3 years following planting.” (Project Forest
Vegetation Report. Approximately 11 MMBF of hazard trees may become salvage logs.
PE 2 - Fuels Reduction – Initial Entry
The criteria, techniques and goals of initial entry fuels reduction are listed below (Project Forest
Vegetation Report:
“Treatments in areas identified for fuels reduction treatment types for…initial entry….could include:



190

Mechanical or hand felling and removal of hazard trees utilizing ground or cable logging systems.
Hazard trees felled outside of the 300 foot buffer would be left on site.
Reduction of fuel loading to 10-20 tons/acre including dead trees and brush. Dead brush will be
reduced by 50-100%. Dead vegetation will be identified at the time of treatment.
o Hand felling, which cuts down trees and/or brush using hand tools such as a chainsaw.
o Mastication, which pulverizes or chops standing trees and logs into small particles. This
treatment can include mowing, mulching, or chipping.
o Lopping woody debris (slash) and scattering around the treated area, which redistributes

o Pruning which removes lower limbs up to 10 feet from the ground.
o Hand piling slash which concentrates slash and surface fuels in small piles.
o Machine piling slash which utilizes equipment to pile slash and surface fuels into larger piles.
o Pile burning which is the prescribed ignition of created piles.
o Jackpot burning, which is a burning method used to reduce heavy intermittent fuel

o Broadcast burning, which is a burning method used where heavy continuous fuel
concentrations exist.
o Chipping, which pulverizes or chops trees, brush, and logs into small particles, redistributing
the surface fuels”.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

PE 3 - Commercial Salvage
Commercial timber sales (saw logs) are expected to be economically feasible along approximately 128
segmented miles of the 233 miles of roads on approximately 4,072 acres in alternative 1; 5,340 acres of
alternative 2; 7,684 acres in alternative 3; and 782 acres of alternative 4. Additional sales could be
considered outside of these miles, but the expected volume is less outside of the acres listed for each
alternative. Commercial sale of firewood is also an outcome of such salvage. Fire-killed trees lose all
commercial value within three years (Project Forest Vegetation Report; ideally, capture of such wood is
best if done within one year of the fire.
PE 4 – Routine Road Preparation and Maintenance, Temporary Road Ramps, Landings, and
Water Drafting
Routine road work will be required for at least the 233 miles of roads specifically involved with any of
the Project alternatives. Installation of drainage dips and grading are specific examples.
Access ramps would be less than 100-feet in length and may be utilized to access existing or newly
constructed landings. Ramps will be decommissioned following use.
Use of existing landings will be emphasized. Up to 60 new temporary landings will be constructed to
store dead tree-cut logs for commercial salvage along 128 miles of roads. Existing landings within
Riparian Reserves can be reused; however, the surface area of disturbance will not be increased and these
features will be tilled and seeded following use where they do not need to be retained as part of the road
system. No new landings will be constructed within the Riparian Reserve. No existing landings within
equipment exclusion zones (EEZs) will be used unless they are connected to a system road. Road pullouts
are sometimes used as landings. Wide areas along roads that are used as landings are often also used as
turnouts for vehicle traffic and are considered part of the road system. Where these occur within Riparian
Reserves, they will be retained. Landing surfaces will be tilled and made porous to precipitation when the
Project is completed.
Water drafting will occur under the following direction of resource protection measure language, guided
in part by the Forest LRMP (1995, page 4-25).
Water drafting will:
a) occur at existing sites with existing access;
b) minimize adverse effects on stream channel stability and instream flows needed to maintain
riparian resources;
c) minimize sedimentation;
d) minimize impacts to fish habitat; and
e) utilize a fish screen to prevent fish entrapment.
No new water drafting sites will be developed. Water drafting sites that are not within habitat that is
accessible to anadromous salmonids will be identified first and will be given priority for use. See a map
of the drafting sites in the Project Fish BA, Appendix A. When needed, water drafting may occur in
habitat accessible by anadromous salmonids. In all cases where water drafting occurs within anadromous
salmonid habitat, 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s Water Drafting Specifications will be adhered
to (see Appendix D of the Project Fish BE and MIS Report). Any new drafting sites will be approved by a
Forest Service fish biologist and/or hydrologist prior to use. In addition, when drafting water the
following rules apply. From the STNF LRMP:
a) Allow drafting from fishery streams only where immediate downstream discharge is maintained
at 1.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) or greater.
b) Allow drafting from ephemeral streams, intermittent streams, wetlands or constructed ponds
provided that sufficient water quantity and quality remains to support associated wildlife species
and riparian values.

191

Final Environmental Impact Statement

c) Never allow drafting to remove more than 50 percent of any stream discharge or 75 percent of
constructed pond water.
A detailed discussion about how water drafting can adversely affect salmonids (and/or lamprey) is found
under the ‘Effects’ section in the Project fish BA.
PE 5 -Legacy Site Treatments, Stream Crossing Reconstruction, and Road Decommissioning
Sediment Source Inventory (SSI) reports from 2016, 2012, and 2011 were used to compile the potential
restoration sites.
From the most recent SSI (2016):
“The Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain
Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (“Waiver”) addresses
nonpoint source discharges of waste to waters of California from activities associated with specific uses
of NFS lands (NCRWQB, 2015). The Waiver requires that all legacy sediment sites for this project must
be identified, inventoried, prioritized, scheduled and implemented for treatment as a part of the project
activities. The inventory is required to be submitted to the Regional Water Board during project
development. This report will be submitted to the Regional Water Board to comply with this requirement.
The Waiver acknowledges that some projects may be so large that it is infeasible or unnecessary to treat
all legacy sediment sites. In such cases, alternative legacy sediment site treatment plans that inventory and
propose to treat some portion of the largest sediment producing sites within the project area may be
submitted to the Executive Officer of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Water
Board or NCRWQB) for approval. The Water Board has agreed that an alternative legacy sediment site
treatment plan is appropriate for this project (M. Robinson, personal communication, February 16, 2016).
Therefore, the Forest Service proposes to treat only the high and moderate-high risk features within the
project area, and the high risk features along the haul routes. These treatments, along with descriptions of
past legacy sediment site treatments and restoration efforts implemented in the same subwatersheds (HUC
6) within the past twenty years will be submitted to the Water Board as part of an alternative legacy
sediment site treatment plan.
Watersheds that are over the threshold of concern (TOC) are not to be further impacted unless they can be
improved with appropriate mitigation measures (STNF LRMP, page 4-25). Hyampom and Sulphur GladeWaldorf Flat subwatersheds are over TOC. Decommissioning Forest Service system roads, restoring nonsystem roads, and upgrading system roads are common mitigation measures. Non-system roads in
Hyampom and Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat that have been identified for restoration to comply with the
mitigation requirement for this project are identified in this report. Closed roads in Hyampom that have
been identified for decommissioning or improvement are identified in this report.
Road reconstruction will occur as necessary to comply with the Waiver and Forest Plan mitigation
requirements. Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage dips, culverts, riprap
fills or other drainage or stabilization features with potential disturbance outside the established roadway
(toe of fill to top of cut); and realignment”.
Concerning primarily the latter requirement, the decommissioning of approximately five miles of roads
may also be required. Stream crossing culvert removal will also occur on 21 additional miles of selected
roads regardless of the number of existing culverts that may exist on them. Road quality upgrading and
reconstruction will occur over 247 total miles of road as well to reduce total sediment yields from them
compared to pre-treatment. Road reconstruction will occur as necessary to comply with the Waiver and
Forest Plan mitigation requirements. Actions can include surface improvement; construction of drainage
dips, culverts, riprap fills or other drainage or stabilization features with potential disturbance required
outside of the established roadway (from toe of fill to top of cut); and realignment.

Applicable Laws, Regulations, and Standards
Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan

Programmatic management direction for the STNF is provided by the Forest Plan (USDA and USDI
1994a), which incorporates the Record of Decision (page 46) for Amendments to Forest Service and
Bureau of Land Management Planning Documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl
(Northwest Forest Plan - USDA, USDI 1994).
The ROD established the Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS), of which Riparian Reserves are a
component. Specific direction for management of Riparian Reserves is found in the ACS and in STNF
standards and guidelines for this management area. The standards and guidelines are designed to protect
the unique functions (such as stream shade, sediment filtering and large wood recruitment to the stream)
of near-stream areas and preserve their integrity by not engaging in activities that disturb soil or
destabilize slopes within Riparian Reserves. Adoption of the ACS through the ROD and the STNF LRMP
sets the framework for significant changes (beginning in 1994) in the way ecosystems are managed,
conserved, and restored. Among these changes is the application of focused and prioritized restoration and
protection in areas with the highest likelihood of recovery and retention of high quality aquatic habitat.
The concept of Key Watersheds is another component of the ACS. Key Watersheds act as refugia for
endangered salmonids and other aquatic and riparian-dependent species. Guidelines require watershed
analysis (WA) prior to major projects (such as this one) and no net increase in road miles. There are four
Tier 1 Key Watersheds within the Project area: Upper South Fork Trinity River (Hayfork Creek to
Headwaters); New River (Mouth to Virgin Creek); North Fork Trinity River (Mouth to Headwaters);
Canyon Creek (Mouth to Headwaters). Tier 1 Key Watersheds contribute directly to conservation of atrisk anadromous salmonids and have a high potential of being restored as part of a watershed restoration
program.
The STNF LRMP (1995) includes provisions from the Northwest Forest Plan Record of Decision (USDA,
USDI 1994) to protect and improve conditions for aquatic species, including salmon and trout.
Implementation of the Record of Decision standards and guidelines were designed to “reverse the trend of
degradation and begin recovery of aquatic ecosystems on federal lands within the range of the owl”
(ROD, page 46). The Record of Decision also addresses the matter of long-term persistence of late seral
and early seral dependent species stating that, “implementation of the ROD fully meets our statutory and
regulatory requirements regarding fish and wildlife resources.”

Streamside Management Zones - protection of streamside management zones is accomplished through
designation of Riparian Reserves and equipment exclusion zones and field verification of specific
activities within Riparian Reserves.

Clean Water Act of 1972, as Amended
Forest management activities must be consistent with the federal Clean Water Act and the California
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act, as addressed in the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast
Region. This Plan contains water quality standards that include water quality objectives and protection of
applicable beneficial uses. As mentioned before, the Trinity River Total Measurable Dissolved Load
(TMDL; EPA 2001) for sediment is established in accordance with Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act
because the State of California has determined that water quality standards for the Trinity River are
exceeded due to excessive sediment. The beneficial uses associated with cold water fish habitat are
currently impaired in the Trinity River Basin. Conditions in portions of the Trinity River and its tributaries
have degraded and are not adequate to support the beneficial uses.
Land management activities have been recognized as potential sources of nonpoint water pollution. By
definition, nonpoint pollution is not controllable through conventional treatment plant means. Nonpoint
pollution is controlled by containing the pollutant at its source, thereby precluding delivery to surface
water. Sections 208 and 319 of the federal Clean Water Act, as amended, acknowledge land treatment
measures as being an effective means of controlling nonpoint sources of water pollution and emphasize
their development.
The most effective means to control nonpoint source pollution is through implementation of best
management practices (BMPs; see section below on BMPs and Appendix C), which are defined as
“methods, measures, or practices selected by an agency to meet its nonpoint source control needs.” BMPs
include, but are not limited to, structural and nonstructural controls, operations, and maintenance
procedures. BMPs can be applied before, during, and after pollution-producing activities to reduce or
eliminate the introduction of pollutants into receiving waters. BMPs are usually applied as a system of
practices rather than as a single practice. BMPs are selected on the basis of site-specific conditions that
reflect natural background conditions and political, social, economic, and technical feasibility. BMPs are
basically a preventive rather than an enforcement system. BMPs are a whole management and planning
system in relation to sound water quality goals, including both broad policy and site-specific
prescriptions.
Management direction specific to maintaining water quality during Project implementation is contained in
Chapter 4 of the STNF LRMP. The BMPs were developed in compliance with Section 208 of the federal
Clean Water Act to protect beneficial uses such as water quality and anadromous fish and were certified
by the State Water Quality Resources Control Board and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
In 1981 the Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5) first entered into a management agency
agreement with the California Water Resources Control Board. The agreement requires the Forest Service
to institute a water quality management program to meet applicable water quality objectives and protect
beneficial uses in accordance with Regional Basin Plans. The agreement allows the Forest Service to use
its state-approved and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-certified BMPs to protect water quality
from nonpoint sources of pollution and thereby meet applicable Basin Plan objectives. The agreement
also requires the Forest Service to monitor BMP effectiveness in meeting Basin Plan requirements.
Specific BMP descriptions and implementation guidance are included in the Region 5 handbook titled,
“Water Quality Management for National Forest System Lands in California.”

Endangered Species Act of 1973.
Management activities must be consistent with the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The STNF LRMP
management direction for federally listed species includes conserving Endangered and Threatened species
and using forest authority to further the ESA. All Forest Service planned, funded, and executed programs
and activities must be reviewed for effects on listed species (USDA, 1995a). Potential adverse effects of
projects must be minimized.
The methodological approach chosen to describe the effects of this Project on aquatic resources is the AP,
which stands for the “Analytical Process for Developing Biological Assessments for Federal Actions
Affecting Fish within the Northwest Forest Plan Area” (USDA et. al 2004). See Appendices A and G in
the Project Fish BE and MIS Report for a description of this methodology used to analyze the effects of
this Project on fish and aquatic resources and to view the table referenced below.
The AP (USDA et al. 2004) is used for ESA consultations and provides “Tables of Population and Habitat
Indicators for Use in the Northwest Forest Plan Area.” The Table describes the Primary Constituent
Elements of critical habitat for SONCC coho salmon, as well as the important elements necessary for
analysis of habitat for steelhead trout, Chinook salmon, EFH, resident rainbow trout and Pacific Lamprey.
The Table provides values and ranges of conditions of indicators to determine whether baseline conditions
are “Properly Functioning,” “At Risk,” or “Not Properly Functioning.” The Table is used for project-level
analyses, to summarize existing conditions of fish habitat and effects of projects (refer to the Project fish
BA. See Appendices A and G of the Fish BE and MIS report.

National Forest Management Act
The effects analysis will include consideration of direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on aquatic
species that are considered USDA Forest Service Region 5 Sensitive (USDA, 2013) and STNF
Management Indicator Species (MIS).
The National Forest Management Act (90 Stat. 2949; 16 USC 1600) states “it is the policy of the
Congress that all forested lands in the National Forest System be maintained in appropriate forest cover
with species of trees, degree of stocking, rate of growth, and conditions of stand designated to secure the
maximum benefits of multiple use and sustained yield management in accordance with land management
plans.”

Magnuson-Stevens Act and Essential Fish Habitat
An analysis for EFH is contained in the Project biological assessment for SONCC coho salmon and UKT
Chinook salmon. Both of these species are also addressed in this report with reference to EFH. The STNF
follows the 2004 and 2001 “Guidance for Integrating Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and
Management Act EFH Consultations with Endangered Species Act Section 7 Consultations, National
Marine Fisheries Service”.
EFH provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA) require heightened consideration of fish habitat in
resource management decisions wherever applicable. EFH is defined in section 3 of the MSA as “those
waters and substrates necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” NMFS
interprets EFH to include aquatic areas and their associated physical, chemical, and biological properties
used by fish that are necessary to support a sustainable fishery and the contribution of the managed
species to a healthy ecosystem. The MSA and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR 600.92(j) require
that before a federal agency may authorize, fund, or carry out any action that may adversely affect EFH, it
must consult with the NMFS. The purpose of the consultation is to develop conservation
recommendations that address reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on EFH. Freshwater EFH for
Pacific salmonids includes all streams, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and other water bodies currently, or
historically, accessible to salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California, except areas upstream of
specific impassible manmade barriers and long-standing impassible natural barriers. The definition of
195

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

EFH is the functional equivalent to Southern Oregon / Northern California Coasts (SONCC) coho salmon
critical habitat in the Assessment Area. The STNF uses its distribution information for steelhead trout to
identify critical habitat since it is the most complete and ‘conservative’ information relative to estimating
the extent of anadromous fish habitat. The effects analysis contained in the Project fish BA and this
document consider effects on Pacific salmonid habitat in general, effects on SONCC coho salmon critical
habitat, and EFH.

Wild and Scenic River Values
The mainstem Trinity and South Fork Trinity Rivers are designated Wild and Scenic. Wild and Scenic
Rivers shall be preserved in free flowing condition; they and their immediate environment shall be
protected for the benefit and enjoyment of future generations.
Project activities would not impede free flowing conditions or cause direct and adverse effects on the
identified Outstandingly Remarkable values. Considering all cumulative and foreseeable effects,
implementation of any of the action alternatives will protect or enhance the Outstandingly Remarkable
fisheries and cultural values, particularly in the intermediate to long-term. The outstandingly remarkable
value of fisheries will benefit in the intermediate and long-term resulting from the long-term beneficial
effects of the proposed action.

Aquatic Conservation Strategy
The ACS has 4 key components to help maintain and restore fish populations and their habitat: 1)
Riparian Reserves, 2) Key Watersheds, 3) Watershed Analysis, and 4) Watershed Restoration. The STNF
in general, and this Project specifically, meet ACS objectives through designation of key watersheds and
Riparian Reserves, completing watershed analyses, identifying restoration needs, and funding and
implementing restoration projects in the subject watersheds (e.g. road decommissioning). Management
Direction contained in the STNF LRMP relative to ACS objectives and fuels projects provides more
specific guidance. The Project meets Management Area Goals and Standards and Guidelines. The Project
is consistent with the ACS through implementation of fuels reduction projects including within Riparian
Reserves, while maintaining existing desired stand characteristics (a diverse age class of healthy conifers
along with obligate riparian vegetation) and through enhancing future stand conditions by encouraging
survival of suppressed and intermediate trees and promoting growth of conifers already present. These
actions would result in a more diverse forest structure, and would enhance potential large wood
recruitment to streams. Other management direction includes designing fuels treatments to meet ACS
objectives, and to minimize disturbance to ground cover and vegetation in Riparian Reserves. The Project
meets this direction through designing treatments in Riparian Reserves that would maintain or restore
Riparian Reserve function including desired stand characteristics that provide stream shade, wood
recruitment and sediment filtering capacity.
Guidance for compliance with the ACS was promulgated in a joint memorandum issued by the Forest
Service and the BLM in 2007. That compliance is being followed in this Project analysis.
A discussion of Aquatic Conservation Strategy Objectives can also be found in Appendix E of this
document.

Existing Conditions

Background on Environmental Baseline
Refer to the Project fish biological assessment for detailed discussions on existing conditions and the
environmental baseline. See Appendix A in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report for a tabular presentation
of the criteria by which baseline conditions are assessed.
Environmental baseline is defined as: “The past and present impacts of all Federal, state, or private
actions and other human activities in an action area, the anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal

projects in an action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7 consultation, and the
impact of state or private actions that are contemporaneous with the consultation in progress” (50 CFR
§402.02, as defined in the Final ESA Section 7 handbook, March 1998).
Please refer to Figure 3- 12 which lists the specific fifth-field watersheds and the hydrologic unit codes
(HUCs) affected by the 2015 fires. The figure also shows the fire area footprints in relation to those
variously affected sub-basins of the Trinity and South Fork Trinity Rivers. Figure 3- 12 originates in the
Project Biological Assessment .
Table 3-55 lists all streams within the Project action area that have anadromous or resident fish or fish
habitat within 300 feet of Project roads within or near treatment buffers. The Action Area, defined as “all
areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely the immediate area
involved in the action” (ESA Handbook 1998), provides habitat for SONCC coho salmon, listed as
Threatened under the ESA, and their designated CH. EFH for SONCC coho and Chinook salmon occur
within the Action Area, and is considered identical to the distribution of SONCC coho salmon CH in this
document. Habitat for all of the remaining species listed at the beginning of this document: USFS
Sensitive and STNF Management Indicator Species, are all assumed to potentially utilize the same
habitat. In reality, SONCC coho salmon are not quite able to access all of the physical habitats that USFS
Sensitive Klamath Mountain Province (KMP) steelhead can gain access to, but in turn steelhead cannot
gain access to all of the habitats that USFS Sensitive Pacific Lamprey can access on some occasions.
Finally, resident trout reside in some upper stream reaches that no anadromous species can access.
Overall, the water quality in the Trinity River is impaired and is on the 303(d) Clean Water Act list due to
fine-grained sediment loading. The South Fork Trinity River is also listed on the 303(d) Clean Water Act
list due to temperature impairment, in addition to sediment loading.
Despite these official impairment designations, the water released from Lewiston Dam at river mile 112
on the mainstem Trinity River is often ‘crystal clear’ and for the majority of the dry months from May to
October, transports very little appreciable sediment nor turbidity for the entire 112 miles to the Klamath
River. Elevated temperatures on the South Fork Trinity River have been an issue since the end of the
devastating December, 1964 flood. The main channel of the river widened appreciably and to this day,
more than 50 years later, insufficient riparian habitat encroachment to provide shading has occurred along
much of the river channel. Significant reaches of it are still exposed to nearly constant spring and summer
sunlight. The water depth has also decreased in much of the channel due to massive bedload contributions
from the 1964 flood, so this shallower, often wider channeled water is much easier to increase in
temperature in the summer sunlight.
Summaries of the affected 5th field watersheds follow, and largely originate from the Project fish
Biological Assessment. A HUC 5 watershed burn severity table can be seen in the BA.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Figure 3- 12. Map showing the sub-basins (HUC 4) and watersheds (HUC 5) affected by the
fires of 2015 in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. (Project Biological Assessment).
New River
Nearly 44% of this watershed burned in the 2015 fire complexes. Fortunately, less than 3% of the
watershed was severely burned and the vast majority of it was burned at a very low to low intensity.
Unburned vegetation (including canopy) remains along the majority of the streams within the River
Complex (USFS 2015 – BAER Fisheries Report).
Fifty-four miles of accessible anadromous fish habitat, including availability to all of the fish species
listed in this report, occur in several New River tributaries and the mainstem.
The New River watershed is identified as a Tier 1 Key Watershed in the Northwest Forest Plan. These
watersheds serve as refugia for maintaining and recovering habitat for at-risk stocks of anadromous
salmonids and resident fish species and provide high quality water. Surveys for so-called ‘summer-run
steelhead and spring Chinook salmon’ are conducted annually in the New River and have been occurring
since 1990. Note: the summer-run steelhead is a recognized strain of the USFS Sensitive KMP steelhead.
198

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The summer-run steelhead in the New River is not technically a Management Indicator Species because
the ‘MIS’ status is designated for the South Fork Trinity River only (LRMP 1995). Similarly, spring-run
Chinook salmon are a recognized strain of UKT Chinook salmon, also a USFS Sensitive species. ESA
Threatened SONCC coho salmon are normally not ‘attracted’ to the New River drainage from the
mainstem Trinity River but juvenile SONCC coho salmon are sometimes found during the annual
surveys.
It appears after calculating risk for cumulative watershed effects (CWE92) that no subwatershed in the
New River 5th field is at a high risk of serious sedimentation after the fires were extinguished except for
one eighth-field subwatershed.in the Barron Creek-Caraway Creek drainages within the Upper New River
sixth-field. But the high Disturbance Level risk ratio status ends before the year 2020. See Project
Physical Science or Fish Biological Assessment documents. This AP Indicator (sedimentation; USDA et
al. 2004) is deemed properly functioning. Water temperatures are also properly functioning. There may be
stream reaches where riparian function may be ‘at risk’, but overall the fifth field riparian habitat is
properly functioning.
Burnt Ranch
The primary fisheries stream in the Burnt Ranch fifth-field watershed is the Big French Creek 6th field
watershed. SONCC coho and Chinook salmon have been observed in this stream intermittently. One of
the adjacent tributaries with 1.8 miles of SONCC coho salmon CH is Swede Creek. The upper portions of
this watershed burned intensely enough to likely generate sediment, turbidity, and ash downstream to the
lower end and the Trinity River mainstem.
Similarly to New River, there is no subwatershed that rises to the level of a high or very high
sedimentation risk threshold using the Forest’s CWE methodology. But the fifth field overall is
downgraded a step from New River and is considered to be functioning at risk. Water temperatures are
properly functioning. The riparian function situation is the same for Burnt Ranch as described above for
the New River.
Canyon Creek
This watershed saw relatively few acres burned, none more than at a moderate severity, and no Project
activity is planned within miles of fish habitat. No analysis is required for this basin.
Browns Creek
Slightly less than five miles of fish habitat occur within this watershed (extending beyond Chanchelulla
Creek), and coho salmon actually use it every year. Fortunately, only 36 acres burned at high severity out
of 2,953 acres burned. This helps keep the CWE risk at moderate, leaning toward low. Riparian habitat is
adequate reflected by the fish numbers seen in the watershed, but is technically designated as ‘functioning
at risk’ due to a major forest road existing next to Browns Creek for many miles which puts the mainstem
drainage at risk at any given time.
Upper South Fork Trinity
Only 305 acres burned within this watershed and all of it was of low severity. The environmental baseline
did not appreciably change. CWE Disturbance Level values are low except for one eighth-field calculated
to be moderate.

92 Cumulative

Effects under ESA are those effects of future state or private activities, not involving federal activities, that are
reasonably certain to occur within the action area of the federal action subject to consultation [50 CFR §402.02]. Under NEPA,
cumulative impacts are the impacts of the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to
other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal) or person
undertakes such other actions. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking
place over a period of time.

199

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Middle South Fork Trinity
Three different fire complexes burned in this watershed, two (Mad River and Route Complexes) limited
to the upper portion and another (Blue Fire of the Mad River complex) focused on the lower portion.
SONCC coho salmon are not known to migrate upward from the mainstem Trinity River to the lowermost
portion of this fifth field watershed, instead stopping at the Hyampom Gorge. The lower portion of one
tributary, Glenn Creek, provides SONCC coho salmon CH (technically…..no fish are seen) and also had
the hillslope area adjacent to that reach experience fire. The upper portion of Glenn Creek burned
intensely so it may contribute increased sediment and accelerated erosion rates, extending down to and
along the South Fork Trinity River. Despite this, debris flows are not necessarily anticipated from Glenn
Creek which would have the most severe impact to the mainstem South Fork Trinity River downstream
from it. Rattlesnake Creek has several miles of SONCC coho salmon CH and because of upper watershed
burning, there may be accelerated sediment generated from the tributary to the mainstem of the South
Fork Trinity River.
Overall, the risk of CWEs in this watershed is calculated to be moderate (Project Physical Sciences
report). But it is worth noting that there is a sixth field, a seventh field, and two eighth field watersheds
that have a very high CWE Disturbance Level rank mostly because of the totality of the effects from
several tributaries that are expected to generate increased sediment loads from areas of severe and
intensely burned landscapes. See a more detailed discussion below on the Forest’s CWE methodology, the
Project Physical Science (hydrology) report, and the Project fish BA.
Riparian function and water temperature indicators are both considered to be ‘functioning at risk’ in this
fifth field watershed.

Lower South Fork Trinity River
Three of the five separate 2015 fire complexes burned in this watershed, but all three occurred in the
upstream portion of the drainage area (the southern end). Three tributaries have varying lengths of
SONCC coho salmon CH, and therefore EFH. Two of those tributaries have a moderate to very high
CWE risk ratio. In general, tributaries in this kind of condition are not best suited to suffer consequences
from wildfire unless of a very low intensity. Past timber harvests and the presence of many miles of roads
are the primary reason for this CWE status. There will be accelerated erosion and sediment generated
from many of these tributaries in part because of there being significant areas of private timber lands that
are already being liquidated of their timber via active salvage. Even though there probably will be
measureable increases in overall sedimentation for several years, STNF-originating accelerated erosion
may be comparatively small when measured against the already high erosion rates prior to the 2015 fires,
the fires themselves and the material generated from private lands. In summary, there is one sixth field,
three seventh fields, and eight eighth field subwatersheds with a very high Disturbance Level ranking. See
Project Physical Science Report.
The indicators of water temperature and riparian function are both considered to be ‘functioning at risk’.
Naturally cool river and stream reaches of groundwater-derived sources help keep tributaries cooler than
what otherwise might happen, and large woody debris will likely beneficially increase in some of these
tributaries having experienced fire.

202

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Lower Hayfork
Eight different tributaries have varying lengths of SONCC coho salmon CH and therefore EFH, but actual
SONCC coho salmon use is either rare or perhaps today non-existent. However, other species like
steelhead and resident rainbow trout may do relatively well in areas of this watershed. This may be
explained by the majority of the tributaries having a low to moderately low risk ratio as per CWEs.
Water temperatures generally degrade while working downstream from the upper portion of this
watershed from functioning at risk, to not properly functioning. The primary reason is because of water
that is too warm for cold water fishes in mid- to late-summer caused in part by small water volumes that
are too easily heated diurnally. Overall much of the watershed has riparian habitat that is effectively not
functioning because much of it has been obliterated prior to these 2015 fires. Some tributaries have
riparian habitat that is functioning at risk.
Upper Hayfork Creek
The fire named the Fork Complex burned within a portion of this watershed area. Although it has been
several, perhaps many, years since SONCC coho salmon have been viewed in this watershed area,
SONCC coho salmon critical habitat and therefore EFH exists in several tributaries and in Hayfork Creek
because the habitat is accessible by anadromous fish. One of the tributaries, Wilson Creek, had intense
and severe burning such that increased peak flows and fire-related products (ash and sediment) may
migrate downstream to the confluence with Hayfork Creek. This is an unfortunate circumstance because a
fish passage improvement project was constructed in Wilson Creek recently. Young steelhead were
observed in Wilson Creek in late summer 2015.
A tributary named Barker Creek and its largest water and sediment contributor named Little Barker Creek
received enough intense and severe burning such that increased peak flows, turbidity, sediment loads, and
ash delivery is expected to reach Hayfork Creek during storm events.
The CWE risk ratios did not elevate above Moderate anywhere, with more frequent Low ratings. But
there will be increased soil erosion such that a predicted undisturbed rate of two tons per acre might get as
high as 55 tons per acre for a year or two in the most severely burned areas from just a modest-sized
storm. Putting the previous conditions together, the erosion hazard rating was considered high overall.
Much of this material would be generated in debris flows within drainages such as Little Barker Creek –
up to an 80% chance for a 100,000 cubic meter debris flow in a ten-year storm event. Accompanying this
are estimated peak flows that increase from 31% to 112% depending on the drainage and the size of storm
up to a five year recurrence interval within a seven year time period (Physical Sciences Report). Riparian
habitat overall is at best in fair condition; technically, at risk.

Alternative Effects Analysis – Including the No Action Alternative

The analysis of impacts is focused on salmonids, lamprey and their ‘Habitat Indicators’ that may be
affected by the proposed and the other action alternatives. Specifically, this analysis uses key indicators of
habitat quality as identified in the Analytical Process (USDA et al. 2004). Primary Habitat Indicators that
may be affected by the proposed action or the other action alternatives are Water Temperature; Suspended
Sediment and Turbidity; Stream Substrate Character; Large Woody Debris; Streambank Condition;
Change in Peak and Base Flows; and Riparian Reserves. Thus, the discussion of direct and indirect effects
is organized by these Habitat Indicators. See the Project fish BA for further elaboration. The fish species
and habitat resources assessed for impacts are first listed under the Executive Summary.
The effects of the specific alternatives will be assessed via determining the probable or possible impacts,
if any, of the discreet Project elements upon the selected habitat indicators.
From the AP guidance document (USDA et al. 2004): An assessment may include "an analysis of the
effects of the action on the species and habitat, including consideration of cumulative effects, and the
results of any related studies" (50 C.F.R. § 402.12(f) (4)), depending on the nature of the federal action.
Effects of the action are defined in 50 CFR § 402.02 as:
203

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

“The direct and indirect effects of an action on the species or critical habitat together with the
effects of other activities that are interrelated or interdependent with that action that will be added
to the environmental baseline. Indirect effects are those that are caused by the proposed action
and are later in time, but are reasonably certain to occur. Interrelated actions are those that are
part of a larger action and depend on the larger action for their justification. Interdependent
actions are those that have no independent utility apart from the action under consideration”.
Direct Effects are also defined under NEPA (40 CFR 1508.8): Direct effects are caused by the action and
occur at the same time and place’.
Again, from the AP guidance document (USDA et al., 2004):
Indirect effects are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still
reasonably foreseeable. Indirect effects may include growth inducing effects and other effects related to
induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate, and related effects on air
and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems. Effects and impacts as used in these
regulations are synonymous. Effects include ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on
the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural,
economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative. Effects may also include those
resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, even if on balance the
agency believes that the effect will be beneficial.
As stated above under Analysis Methodology, implementation of any of the action alternatives will
require discreet actions that can be separated into these specific activities, or so-called Project Elements:

Effects to CH, EFH, Sensitive species and MIS aquatic habitats are described using the following terms:
Neutral Effect. The action has no effect on the aquatic habitats.
Beneficial Effect. The effect is contemporaneous and has positive effects without any adverse
effect to the aquatic habitats.
 Discountable Effect. The effect to CH, EFH or the other species aquatic habitats is extremely
unlikely to occur and/or based on best judgment, a person would not be able to meaningfully
measure, detect, or evaluate any effects.
 Insignificant Effect. The effect to the aquatic habitats may occur but is not to a level that can be
meaningfully measured or detected.
 Significant Effect. The effect to the aquatic habitats is detectable, and may be meaningfully
measured.

effects may result in jeopardy to the continued existence of a population unit, ESU, or species.

Depending upon the nature of the effect being considered, two or more of the six Project elements may be
combined when anticipated effects are fundamentally identical.
As per guidance in the Analytical Process for Developing Biological Assessments for Federal Actions
Affecting Fish within the Northwest Forest Plan Area (‘AP’; USDA et al. 2004), the elements above will
be evaluated against selected habitat indicators that are relevant to the action alternatives. The Table for
Population and Habitat Indicators found in the AP document urged modification for local forest
conditions which was done for the STNF. The version used on the STNF is illustrated in Appendix A of
the Fish BE and MIS Report and is titled “Matrix of Factors and Indicators.’
Refer to the Project BA to see how the various Habitat Indicators are grouped. Summarized, they are
headed by the general categories of Sediment, Water Quality, and Riparian Function.
As per the AP, the Project elements will be tested for potential effects to the habitat indicators by up to
eight factors, defined as follows:
a. Proximity ~ the geographic relationship between the Project element or action and the
species/designated critical habitat.
b. Probability ~ The likelihood that the species or habitat will be exposed to the biotic or
abiotic effects of the PE or action to the indicator.
c. Magnitude ~ The severity and intensity of the effect.
d. Distribution ~ The geographic area in which the disturbance would occur (may be
several small effects or one large effect).
e. Frequency ~ how often the effect would occur.
f.

Duration ~ how long the effect would last. Potential categories include (a) short-term
event whose effects subside immediately (pulse effect); (b) sustained, long-term effect, or
chronic effect whose effects persist (press effect); and (c) permanent event that sets a new
threshold for a species’ environment (threshold effect).

g. Timing ~ When the effect would occur in relation to the species’ life-history patterns.
h. Nature ~ Effects of the action on elements of a species’ life cycle, population size or
variability, or distribution; or on the primary constituent elements of critical habitat,
including direct and indirect effects.
Proposed actions that yield insignificant, discountable, or no effects can usually be analyzed by the first
three, or even fewer, of the factors listed above to adequately determine Project effects.

Resource Protection Measures

Except for the No Action Alternative, all of the potential Project action alternative effects, be they direct
or indirect, will be largely ameliorated or prevented from happening via Project Resource Protection
Measures (RPMs). Project-related RPMs are developed to minimize impacts to resources in the area from
205

Final Environmental Impact Statement

this Project. The following resource protection measures are incorporated into all action alternatives,
unless otherwise noted.
Numerous RPMs found in several resource areas– Wildlife and Fish, Riparian Reserves Areas, and Soils
and Hydrology, for example – combine to ensure that aquatic resources are protected and potential
impacts or adverse effects to aquatic habitat are either eliminated or greatly minimized. Some examples
are included here:
Field personnel and equipment will not enter waterways where anadromous fish are determined
to be spawning or eggs would be incubating, as determined and indicated by a fish biologist.
Restricted time periods are generally from October 15 through April 15. Additional restrictions
may be appropriate for waterways containing spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
tshawytscha) and summer-run steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), as determined by a qualified fish
biologist (focus is protection of spawning and incubating eggs). To avoid potential watershedrelated impacts, including effects to anadromous fish, Project activities will occur between April
15 and October 15.
This time period is referred to as the normal operating season, or aquatic period of operation (also
discussed with BMPs and Wet Weather Operation Standards elsewhere in this report). No units are
immediately adjacent to anadromous fish habitat; therefore, no Project equipment or vehicle-related direct
effects are possible, for example, outside of potential water drafting sites that may be chosen within
anadromous fish habitat.
See Appendix B in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report for a list of specific aquatic habitat related RPMs
developed for this Project.

Best Management Practices
Best management practices (BMPs) are required to control nonpoint source pollution related to all
management actions with the potential to affect water quality on National Forest System lands (FSM
2532). All NEPA decisions are to incorporate site-specific BMPs for protecting water quality (FSH
2509.22). BMPs have been selected for this Project (Appendix C – Best Management Practices) from the
USDA Forest Service National BMP compilation (USDA, 2012)
BMPs were developed to comply with Section 208 of the Clean Water Act. BMPs have been certified by
the State Water Quality Resources Control Board and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) as the most effective way of protecting water quality from impacts stemming from non-point
sources of pollution. These practices have been applied to forest activities and have been found to be
effective in protecting water quality on the STNF. Specifically, effective application of the US Forest
Service Region 5 BMPs has been found to maintain water quality that is in conformance with the Water
Quality Objectives in the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board’s (NCRWQCB) Basin Plan.
Forest Service Region 5 BMPs have been monitored and modified since their original implementation in
1979 to make them more effective. Numerous on-site evaluations by the NCRWQCB have found the
practices to be effective in maintaining water quality and protecting beneficial uses. The STNF monitors
the implementation and effectiveness of BMPs on randomly selected projects each year. Adequate
implementation of BMPs occurred on an average of 85 percent of sites from 2006 through 2010. BMP
effectiveness requirements were met on an average of 95 percent of the sites sampled in 2006-2010.
The list of BMPs that would be implemented are designated in Appendix C – Best Management Practices.
For additional information on the BMPs and their objectives, see the Water Quality Management for
Forest System Lands in California – Best Management Practices: Soil and Water Conservation Handbook
(USDA, 2010a).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

No Action Alternative - Alternative 6

To meet the intent of 40 CFR 1502.14(d) a No Action alternative will be analyzed. Based on Forest
Service policy direction, this is interpreted to mean that no new action will occur from this alternative.
The no action alternative is not a baseline condition, but rather a description of current and projected
future circumstances without implementation of the Trinity Post Fire Fuels Reduction and Salvage
Project. The no-action alternative incorporates a continuation of the current general level of management
on federal, state, and private lands, as well as projected future management activities including, for
example, road maintenance, hazard tree removal, recreation, watershed restoration projects, other projects
with vegetation management, and fire suppression. The contexts of these analyses are in relation to the
species considered in this report and their habitats necessary to survive and reproduce.
Fuels would not be reduced within any potential treatment buffers, hazard trees may not be felled and left
onsite at least to the degree proposed in this Project and/or commercially disposed of, and legacy streamroad crossings may not be improved nor any roads decommissioned or addressed in any way outside of
routine maintenance that would have occurred regardless of this Project.
No Project-related sediment would be generated whatsoever by choosing the No Action alternative, nor
would any possibility exist of the other habitat indicators being adversely affected directly or indirectly to
any extent by implementation of the Project elements. But the Purpose and Need of this Project is not to
avoid generating any sediment production nor affecting in any way the habitat indicators used to evaluate
the effects of this Project. See the Purpose and Need statement listed above. The majority of any Projectrelated sediment and any other potentially minor adverse effects would be short term in nature. It’s also
possible that up to 30,000 cubic yards of road fill will not be rendered inaccessible to streams that are
currently at risk of it becoming incorporated into stream flow transport due to the several undersized
culverts of which this massive amount of road fill sediment surrounds.
Direct Effect of Taking No Action
If No Action is chosen or otherwise not taken, then the six Project elements will not be implemented. No
direct effects would occur to any of the fish species considered in this report nor any portion of their
required habitat components including the habitat indicators such as water temperature, suspended
sediment and turbidity, stream substrate quality, large woody debris, streambank condition, change in
peak and base flows, and riparian reserves.
Indirect Effects of Taking No Action
There would be no indirect effects if no actions are taken to cause direct effects. But over time, there
could be consequences from taking no action that could indirectly cause adverse effects to the fish or their
required habitats addressed in this report. This could result from illegal or unauthorized harvest of trees
within the treatment buffer because of ease of access. Any such activities that could occur would not
honor Project RPMs or BMPs so the activity would surely promote greater sedimentation or other adverse
effects (Physical Sciences Report. Later in time, more frequent or more severe and intense wildfires could
occur if no fuels treatments were initiated in areas calculated to require them via the Project. Human life
could be incidentally at risk if no or an insufficient number of 2015 wildfire-killed hazard trees were
felled, possibly allowing remaining trees to spontaneously fall upon humans, human-occupied vehicles on
roads, or unoccupied vehicles or other property. No fuel breaks would be constructed. The maintenance
unquestionably required for several years to maximize the desired effect if one of the action alternatives
were instead to be chosen would also not occur.
Cumulative Effects under ESA:
The No Action alternative does not add any proposed action subject to consultation to the other ongoing
and future State or private activities; hence, there cannot feasibly be any cumulative effects as a result.

207

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Cumulative Impacts under NEPA
The No Action alternative does not add any proposed action to other past, present, or reasonably
foreseeable future actions, hence no incremental impacts can possibly occur. But as described above,
taking no action could directly and indirectly lead to future adverse environmental consequences that
would not otherwise occur had the proposed action been implemented. Some of the sequential outcomes
of taking no action could be considered individually minor, but collectively significant.

Alternative 1 – Proposed Action

Attention given to this Alternative within the confines of anadromous fish habitat will be reduced in this
report because a thorough analysis was provided in the Project fish BA. The Project fish BA limited the
analysis to SONCC coho salmon and SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat, and to Essential Fish Habitat
for SONCC coho and UKT Chinook salmon. But the additional fish species and aquatic habitats
considered in this report – Pacific Lamprey, KMP steelhead, and resident rainbow trout – would be
affected similarly to those described in the Project fish BA except where depicted below.
Pacific Lamprey can migrate on occasion further upstream than the upper limit of where SONCC coho
salmon critical habitat exists or the uppermost stream reaches for KMP steelhead. Additionally, resident
rainbow trout and their required habitats occur on larger tributaries for several miles further upstream than
any of the other fish species considered in this report. But there are no specific actions proposed in this
alternative nor RPMs or BMPs that are inherently different when applied to these upstream areas from the
actions proposed further downstream in the same Project area tributaries where all of the species and
SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat or salmon EFH do occur. None of the proposed actions will occur
disproportionately more frequently or intensively in these upper rainbow trout stream habitat reaches.
Direct Effects
Direct effects that could occur would result from implementing any or all of the proposed Project
elements and assessing how they could affect the selected habitat indicators of Water Temperature;
Suspended Sediment and Turbidity; Stream Substrate Character; Large Woody Debris; Streambank
Condition; Change in Peak and Base Flows; and Riparian Reserves from the total population of habitat
indicators found in Appendix A of the Fish BE and MIS Report.
There will be no direct effects to any anadromous fish from implementation of Project elements 1-4 and 6
because no vegetation management will occur in or immediately adjacent to CH or EFH. Direct
manipulation of MIS resident trout habitat could occur with the felling of hazard trees that become part of
the Large Woody Debris (LWD) component of streamside wood stores. It is technically possible that a
rainbow trout could be struck by one or more trees felled directly into stream courses. Also, the upgrading
of any stream crossings that could occur in MIS rainbow trout habitat upstream of anadromous fish
habitat could be affected. But this is where the sum of the Project EEZs, RPMs, BMPs, ACS and riparian
reserve management restrictions limit affects to generally being insignificant for any fish habitat in
affected areas, and cause at most a minor effect to Project area fish.
The Project Physical Sciences Report cannot dismiss the possibility during salvage of fire-killed trees of
reactivating unmapped or unknown existing landslides. However, the probability is low. Temporary road
construction and any new landings could potentially alter surface and subsurface hydrology which might
cause turbidity directly to streams. Again, the probability is low. Soil compaction should be a non-issue
according to the report, and soil cover percentages should increase via operations, actually decreasing
surface erosion.
The hydrology portion of the Physical Sciences Report focuses on two primary habitat variables or
equivalent habitat indicators to assess Project impacts, regardless of Alternative: sediment and
temperature. Sediment can enter streams from and through riparian reserves during the otherwise
beneficial process of felling hazard trees to increase large woody debris reserves. Note that of 37,575
acres of riparian reserve that exists within the burned area footprints, only 1,386 acres will receive direct
208

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

treatment in the proposed preferred action alternative (DEIS). Water temperature changes should be
minimal because the dead trees felled will already be providing little shade to the water surface. Some
increase in solar radiation could occur to water surfaces just from the canopy holes that would be created
through the action of falling such trees into streams. These canopy clearings would fill back in relatively
quickly. See the discussion of riparian reserve management in the Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology
section, under Alternative 1 – Direct Effects portion. Certainly the factor of proximity can be met
regarding this activity, but the consideration of probability and magnitude of any result yielding more than
a minor effect is discountable.
Sediment could also be generated directly into stream channels or flowing water from treatment of the
legacy road stream crossings via culvert replacement, or treatment of culvert inlets via debris clearing.
But road stream crossing restoration will not occur within CH or EFH. Additionally, there is some
sediment generated during the first winter after roads are decommissioned just through a disturbed
landscape adjusting process, and up to 30 miles of roads could receive that form of treatment. There are
specific BMPs (Appendix C – Best Management Practices) and RPMs (Chapter 2-Resource Protection
Measures Common to All Alternatives) for stream crossings, road decommissioning, and operations in
aquatic ecosystems scheduled to be implemented to address this activity.
To summarize, direct contributions of sediment causing turbidity and the potential for streambed sediment
deposition to proposed action affected stream courses could occur but should be generally discountable,
insignificant, or minor to MIS trout or lamprey, especially during culvert replacement. Therefore stream
substrate character should be insignificantly affected. Surface water temperature changes resulting
directly from proposed actions should be either insignificant or discountable. Large woody debris (LWD)
loads will not decrease below 20 tons per acre in treatment area riparian reserves due to fuels treatments.
Hand-felling of fire-killed trees in the inner half of riparian reserves will accelerate the quantity of LWD
occurring in adjacent streams. Trees felled directly into streams with MIS rainbow trout fish habitat could
conceivably cause direct mortality to individual fish, or at least create harm in the form of injury or stress
to them.
Potential LWD that could be end-line removed from the outer half of riparian reserves would occur only
where there is sufficient LWD already present in the area.
Streambank condition could be changed in areas where trees are felled directly into streams for LWDgenerating purposes, but generally only for the width of the tree. This degree of change is insignificant
and/or discountable. Because of the extent of the relatively minor direct effects described above, potential
changes to peak and base flows should be discountable.
Indirect Effects
The development of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy and associated riparian reserves may play a
greater role in minimizing potential adverse indirect effects to aquatic habitats than any other federal land
management change during the past quarter century on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Descriptions of
this strategy or land reserves can be found throughout this document and the Project fish BA.
Slash material generated from commercial salvage logging as a component of hazard tree reduction will
beneficially increase soil surface protection and enhance infiltration rates. This could possibly counteract
or beneficially exceed any accelerated sedimentation resulting from ground disturbing activities via the
felling and yarding of fire-killed trees. Fuels reductions within a maximum 300-foot wide buffer along
233 road miles covering 7,969 acres will ultimately reduce fire severity yielding decreased surface runoff
and even lesser landslide potential years later. Increased sedimentation from road surfaces as a result of
commercial harvest activities will be partially offset by reduced hillslope surface erosion due to Project
activities such as mastication and lop and scatter (Physical Sciences Report). Tilling and mulching
landings and access roads, plus water barring access roads will prevent and reduce erosion as time
progresses. There will be decreased indirect sedimentation to stream courses over time as legacy stream

209

Final Environmental Impact Statement

crossing improvements and road decommissioning sites adjust to receiving winter storms and eventually
create resiliency as surface fine sediments are winnowed away.
Much of the increased sediment delivery could be a result of road-related erosion. Roads utilized in this
alternative will have an estimated increase in sediment yield because of implementing the alternative to
13.6 tons per mile of road, from 7.5 tons per mile with background or no action (Physical Sciences report,
soils section).
Water temperature changes, which could result from Project-related channel widening in specific reaches,
yielding decreasing streamflow depths and increasing water surface areas, are not expected to occur or
persist over time. Adverse Project-related effects are expected to be minor. Introduction of LWD to stream
courses helps to cause and deepen beneficial pools. Stream substrate character could improve due to LWD
introduction perhaps more easily than deteriorate due to any increased sedimentation. Change in peak and
base flows could change over time with fewer intense and severe wildfires in the general area due to
nearly 8,000 acres of fuels treatments scheduled. Peak flows may decrease but probably not measurably,
and base flows remain neutral or possibly increase. These individual effects should collectively range
from being insignificant or neutral adverse impacts, to moderately beneficial.
Riparian reserve habitat would increase in quality over time after Project treatments. Project fuels
reduction would help decrease or eliminate severe or intense future wildfire in treated areas, sparing
adjacent riparian habitat from detrimentally burning in severe intensity.
Again, the Project fish BA has a more thorough discussion about vegetation management activities and
their potential effects. As an example summarized in the BA: “New River has the highest treatment acres
in perennial fish-bearing RRs (about 128 acres). The probability of effects is highest in acres adjacent to
CH and EFH. However, the probability for indirect effects associated with sediment from the Project is
low due to the EEZs proposed for perennial streams, the EEZs proposed for intermittent and ephemeral
RRs, RPMs that will minimize site effects and because specific hazard tree guidelines will dictate which
few select trees can be felled in roadside RRs.”
Reforestation includes planting up to 7,969 acres of roadside treatment areas to accelerate natural burned
area reforestation. Most treatment areas are in upper slope and ridgetop locations. Treatment will increase
sediment retention capacity and soil cover. The combination of treatment locations and the nature of the
work ensures that potential indirect effects would be discountable or even neutral to aquatic habitats.
The legacy road treatment sites are discussed in detail in the Project fish BA. A couple of the possible
culvert replacement sites occur at or just upstream of SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat locations.
Despite all of these legacy treatments being ultimately beneficial for aquatic resources, there can be short
term impacts even with implementation of RPMs and BMPs. These impacts are usually in the form of
sediment yield. Culvert replacement projects always yield some sediment upon receiving the first few
significant rainstorms of the fall and winter. Similarly, freshly decommissioned roads will provide surface
erosion of fine-grained material until some basic surface ‘hardening’ occurs after a few storms. Fill
slopes, disturbed cutbanks, road surfaces, and all drainage crossings can provide adjustment
sedimentation regardless of how well the task is performed. For rainbow trout and lamprey stream
reaches, nearly all stream crossings and riparian reserves that bisect treatment roads are located in upper
slope or ridgetop locations along ephemeral or intermittent drainages (Project fish BA).
Cumulative Watershed Effects
CWEs have been calculated for affected Project watersheds, but it should be noted that the 2015 wildfires
have alone created watershed impacts greatly exceeding potential additional effects resulting from the
proposed action. Sedimentation generated by the proposed action will likely decrease down to pre-Project
levels within 5-10 years (Physical Science Report). The estimated total amount of sediment generated
from the proposed action that may in turn enter stream courses throughout the nearly 8,000 acre treatment

210

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

area, and including the legacy treatment sites, is around 3,229 tons (Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology
section). Project RPMs, EEZs and BMPs prevent this estimate from being appreciably larger.
CWE calculations were made for all of the watersheds that combine the 2015 wildfire footprint with the
areas comprising the proposed action. These were calculated at the larger area hydrologic unit code
(HUC) 5 watersheds, all the way out to the much smaller area HUC 8 watersheds. Despite the estimated
increase in tonnage of 3,229 tons of sediment generated from the proposed action compared to
background, the level of importance of this material decreases when the CWE ‘disturbance level’
descriptions, correlated with estimated ‘risk ratios’, do not change when comparing the no action
alternative with the proposed action. See the hydrology section of the Physical Sciences Report, the
Project Fish BA, and Appendix H of the Shasta Trinity National Forest LRMP (USDA, 1995a) for
discussions on the concept of risk ratios and thresholds of concern.
The following summarized calculations and descriptions can be seen in Tables 36-44 of the Physical
Sciences Report, Hydrology section. Note in these nine tables that nearly all of the HUC 8 calculated riskratios decrease when progressing from the 2018 columns to the 2020 and 2022 columns. This indicates a
trend of disturbance recovery. Baseline condition comparisons are drawn from Tables 18-26 in the same
report.
Olsen Creek, a 7th field watershed within the Lower Hayfork Creek/Grassy Flat Miners Creek larger
basins, maintains a disturbance level of ‘Moderate’ comparing the baseline recovery over five years to the
proposed action timeframe. Other HUC8 or larger drainages have their rates of recovery slowed .but only
a few see minor increases in risk ratio values to the year 2020 only.
The Sulphur Glade-Waldorf Flat Creek HUC6 (Middle South Fork Trinity) must be mitigated in response
to the proposed action because it has a very high disturbance level and at values of 1.06 and 1.05 in 2018
through 2022, is considered above the ‘Threshold of Concern’ as per the Land and Resource Management
Plan (USDA, 1995a). Three miles of road decommissioning, feasible in this basin, would suffice for
comparable mitigation.
Similarly, mitigation is required in the Hyampom HUC6 (Lower South Fork Trinity), specifically the Big
Creek-Hyampom HUC7 within it, because of risk ratios close to 2.2 which leads to a very high
disturbance level. One HUC8 has a risk ratio of 2.67 in 2018. No SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat is
available in the affected tributaries, but they do empty into the South Fork Trinity River which has
SONCC coho CH for its entire length. Values this high clearly place this HUC6 over the TOC. As quoted
in the Physical Sciences Report, Hydrology section:
“Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore, mitigation is required if the Proposed
Action is implemented. Hyampom is a planning watershed, and watersheds that are over TOC,
regardless of ownership, are not to be further impacted unless they can be improved with
appropriate mitigation measures (Forest Plan, page 4-25). To improve Hyampom, it is necessary
to reduce the risk ratio (through mitigation) more than the Proposed Action increases the risk
ratio. From the ERA model, it is estimated that about 60 miles of road decommissioning (or an
equivalent amount of some other type of improvement project) in Hyampom by the year 2020 is
necessary if the Proposed Action is implemented. Mechanized hand piling and burning will be
replaced with hand piling and burning in Hyampom; thereby reducing the required mitigation to
the equivalent of about 36 miles of road decommissioning. Tractor thinning of the unburned to
low severity burned areas in Hyampom will be removed from the Proposed Action; thereby
reducing the required mitigation to about 22 miles of road decommissioning. With these
described modifications, the mitigation opportunities for Hyampom identified in the Sediment
Source Inventory Report” are more than sufficient to implement the Proposed Action”.
There are several HUC8 watersheds that achieve risk ratio values of around 0.10 greater than the no
action alternative but do not exceed the TOC at the HUC5 basin size. In summary, the proposed action
211

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

will yield about 3,229 tons of Project-related fine sediment spread out over the entire 233 road mile
treatment areas and legacy sites. This yield prevents a possible determination of a ‘No Effect’ analysis
result. Upon implementing the proposed action, this sediment yield may be concentrated in areas of
HUC8s where risk ratios take the biggest jump upward and in areas of high to very high disturbance level
descriptions.
Despite the attention drawn above to the smaller HUC 7 and HUC 8 sized watersheds above, what truly
matters is described in the Project Fish BA: “Although a change in the risk ratio of a few percent relative
to the baseline condition is common (especially at the HUC 7 and 8 scales) these changes are considered
to be fairly negligible. Only the changes that cause a change in the risk description (e.g. moderate in the
baseline CWE and high in the Proposed Action CWE) are specifically addressed in the text”.

Alternative 2 - Consistent Buffer and Fuel Breaks Alternative

See the description of this alternative written previously under the Introduction section of this report. For
much more detail, find the additional information in Chapter 2 and in the Project Forest Vegetation and
Physical Science Reports.
The area proposed for treatment with this alternative increases from 7,969 acres in the proposed action, to
about 9,522 acres in this one. The main reason is because the treatment buffer is not variable such as it is
in the proposed action, but rather a fixed 300 feet total width throughout the entire buffer along 217 miles
of road. Although the number or miles of road is reduced from 233 to 217 to receive this treatment, the
remaining 16 miles will receive strategically located fuel breaks totaling 2,178 acres. These fuel breaks
can be constructed within a treatment buffer that extends out 600 feet on both sides of the road, or 1,200
feet in total width. See Chapter 2 or the Project Forest Vegetation and Physical Science Report for a

212

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

detailed description of the specific actions to occur within the 217 mile treatment buffer or the 16 mile
intensive fuel break treatment area.
Another difference between the proposed action and this alternative (Project DEIS): “Existing
unauthorized roads may be utilized as temporary roads to access existing or new landings. Unauthorized
roads utilized will be decommissioned after completion of Project activities”.
See Table 3-56 to compare treatment data among all of the various alternatives (derived from the Project
DEIS. Note that the fuel break acres are added to the fuel reduction treatment acres.
The Project elements listed at the beginning of this section apply to this alternative, as do the habitat
indicators. Generally, the differences in potential effect between this alternative and alternative 1 is from
the increase in treatment areas for harvest and fuel break as per Table 2-2.
Direct Effects
Approximately 700 additional tons of sediment could be produced both directly and indirectly from
implementing this alternative compared to alternative 1, or 3,929 total tons.
There could be a slight increase in risk for landslide potential compared to no action and alternative 1
because green but dying trees can be harvested in this alternative compared to only dead trees being cut in
Alternative 1. Therefore, there may be more hazard trees felled that reach streams containing MIS
rainbow trout or their habitat. There will not be any change to direct effect risk to anadromous fish,
however, because like Alternative 1, no Project activities will take place adjacent to SONCC coho or
Chinook salmon or KMP steelhead aquatic habitats. There will be an additional 2,178 acres of fuel break
activities implemented in this alternative that are not conducted in Alternative 1. This incorporates Project
element 2. From the Soils section of the Physical Sciences Report:
“The larger fuel breaks will create an additional 14 miles of possible mechanical thinning that could cause
additional erosion, displacement, compaction and puddling off the main roads”.
Direct effects in the form of some sedimentation and turbidity may occur identically to Alternative 1 if the
legacy site treatments remain the same throughout the various alternatives.
Despite the increases in treatment area compared to the proposed action, the environmental impacts
should not appreciably increase because of the RPMs, EEZs and BMPs that will apply to every acre
treated in this and every action alternative. Note specifically the RPMs of 20-33 and 41-48 in Appendix
B, and the BMPs listed in Appendix C, both found in the Project Fish BE and MIS Report.
Outside of these changes, the direct effects analysis written for alternative 1 applies to this alternative as
well.
Indirect Effects
The fuel breaks could reduce future fire intensity and the rate and degree of fire spreading. This would
positively affect sediment yield and turbidity, riparian reserve condition, and the remaining habitat
indicators beyond a decade. Additionally, more acres would be subject to treatment-connected
reforestation via tree planting. This activity clearly improves the status of all of the habitat indicators
under consideration progressively over time. Conversely, construction of the 2,178 acres of fuel breaks
could lead to some degree of erosion that could be distributed to adjacent stream courses via the outcome
described above under the ‘Direct Effect’ portion.
Implementation of this alternative could generate about 700 tons more sediment than the proposed action
as stated above under Direct Effects (Physical Science Report). The majority of the increased tonnage will
be generated from the Lower South Fork Trinity River HUC5 (400 tons) and the Burnt Ranch HUC5 (200
tons). The 700 additional cubic yards of sediment is ‘consequential’ but, when spread out over several
years and generating from the acreage of the entire Project, it borders on being insignificant to minor in
overall effect.
213

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Much of this increased sediment is a result of road-related erosion. Similar to Alternative 1, roads utilized
in this alternative will have an estimated increase in sediment yield because of implementing the
alternative to 13.6 tons per mile of road, from 7.5 tons per mile with background or no action (Physical
Science report).
In summary, excluding the differences between the proposed action and alternative 2 that are described
above, the remaining description under alternative 1 above applies to this alternative in terms of
treatments and effects to the fish species under consideration in this report. RPMs and BMPs will remain
the same throughout this and all the alternatives.
Cumulative Watershed Effects
As indicated above, additional actions associated with this alternative that will not occur in alternative 1
involve fuel break construction and removal of dying but still green trees. The changes in treatment
acreage and different activities associated with the proposed action and alternative 2 will yield an
estimated 3,929 tons of sediment by 2018 if implemented as scheduled, 700 more tons than the proposed
action. As stated in the Physical Science Report, Hydrology Section:
“In Lower South Fork Trinity River, Hyampom subwatershed is over the TOC; therefore,
mitigation would be required if Alternative 2 is implemented. From the ERA model, it is
estimated that mitigation equivalent to about 100 miles of road decommissioning would be
required. If hand piling and burning is done instead of mechanized piling and burning, and the
harvest thin in the unburned to low severity burned areas is removed from Alternative 2, then
about 30 miles of road decommissioning would be required for mitigation. Mitigation
opportunities for Hyampom are identified in Appendix D – Legacy Sediment Site Plan93. The
HUC7s and HUC8s that are over the TOC for Alternative 2, are also over for the Proposed
Action.
In Middle South Fork Trinity River, Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat subwatershed is over the
TOC; therefore, mitigation would be required if Alternative 2 is implemented. From the ERA
model, it is estimated that mitigation equivalent to about 26 miles of road decommissioning
would be required. If mechanized piling and burning is replaced with hand piling and burning,
and the harvest thin in the unburned to low severity burned areas is removed from Alternative 2,
then about 6 miles of road decommissioning would be required for mitigation. Mitigation
opportunities for Sulphur Glade Creek-Waldorf Flat are identified in the Sediment Source
Inventory Report (in Appendix D). Like the Proposed Action, Hitchcock Creek-Oak Flat drainage
and its subdrainages are at very high disturbance levels”.

Alternative 3 – Wide Buffer

A consistent 600 foot wide buffer will be used with this proposal, 300 feet on each side of 233 miles of
road. The treated acreage in this alternative jumps up to nearly 14,948 acres, or nearly double the size of
the proposed action. As stated above under Alternative 1 and 2, the same RPMs, EEZs and BMPs will
apply so there should be no appreciable change to the management of riparian reserves and the
consequences from implementing this action on a per forested acre or per road mile basis. Refer to Table
2-2 to denote different treatment data.
Besides acreage increases, the other minor changes regarding this action compared to the proposed action
are 1) hazard trees would be identified using a probability of mortality of 0.6; 2) commercial timber sales
of harvested hazard trees could be feasible along 128 miles of road as with the previous two alternatives
but would apply to 7,684 acres; and 3) up to three miles of unauthorized but existing roads could be
utilized as temporary roads to access landings but would be decommissioned after Project completion.

Sciences Report. That appendix has been reproduced in its entirety for the FEIS as Appendix D.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The estimated sediment tonnage to be generated by this alternative is 5,970 tons, nearly 2,750 more tons
than with the proposed action and about 2,050 tons more than with alternative 2. This mirrors the big
increase in treatment acres. The timeline for implementation will not lengthen because of the increased
acreage, so there will be greater sediment production rates in the same or similar amount of time as the
previous two alternatives. The legacy treatment sites will remain the same so their sedimentation,
temperature and other habitat threats will be the same as in the proposed action or alternative 2.
Direct Effects
As stated in the Physical Science report, Soils section:
Alternative 3 could cause more erosion, compaction, displacement, and puddling than
Alternatives 1 and 2 due to the larger footprint for mechanical equipment operations off the
main road, especially temporary roads (utilizing up to 3 miles of unauthorized roads).
These 3 miles of unauthorized roads will be used as temporary roads to access existing or
new landings. Additional displacement and compaction would occur, requiring sub-soiling
and mulching as per the soil RPMs. This larger treatment area in severely burned
landscapes that already lacks soil cover will be more prone to erosion than Alternatives 1
and 2.
There could be a greater threat of direct effects to MIS trout via mortality, injury or stress due to
additional felling of trees into stream channels potentially containing trout. A greater number of such trees
could reach stream channels because a probability of mortality method will be used to decide the fate of
many trees, leading to a greater number being felled overall compared to any of the other action
alternatives.
The direct effects possibly resulting from sedimentation with this alternative may, in some hillside
treatment cases – primarily fuels reduction and harvest - simply be 50% greater than, and up to double the
effect as that described in the proposed action due to the doubling in the treatment acreages. But the
reason why the overall sedimentation will not double is in part because the road mileages used will
remain the same as in the previous two alternatives (Table 2-2). The intensity of the use will increase but
that does not add to sediment loads as quickly as adding more miles of additional roads.
Indirect Effects
The HUC5 watersheds where the majority of the sediment yield will take place are Lower Hayfork (from
600 tons in alternative 1 to 900 tons); Lower South Fork Trinity (300 to 600 tons); Middle South Fork
Trinity (500 tons to 900 tons); and New River (1,000 tons to 2,000 tons).
A description of the Project element effects for this alternative is similar to alternative 1 and 2, but
progressively larger than alternative 2.
It may be applicable to assume that indirect effects and any risks associated with them increase
proportionately to the estimated percentage increase in tons of sediment when implementing this
alternative compared to alternatives 1, 2, 4 and 5. See below. Because there will be no lessening of RPMs,
EEZ standards, or BMPs, nor will there be an increase in legacy road treatment miles, crossings or areas,
there should not be an appreciable increase in adverse effects to anadromous fish – SONCC coho salmon
CH, SONCC coho and Chinook salmon EFH or KMP steelhead habitat, Pacific Lamprey habitat - or MIS
rainbow trout.
Cumulative Effects
Despite the nearly 5,970 tons of sediment to be generated via the implementation of this alternative – An
85% increase over the proposed action – there are no additional fifth field planning watersheds that have
their CWE threshold of concern surpassed when they would not have been surpassed when implementing
the other alternatives. Those that are high or very high – described in the proposed action – remain the
same and the need for mitigation remains the same or similar. See the discussion above under the
215

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

proposed action, or the Physical Science report, Hydrology section, for descriptions of the specific
watersheds that are over the TOC.
Numerical changes for lesser sized watersheds regarding this alternative follows:
Lower Hayfork Creek HUC 5: Olson Creek HUC7 sees an appreciable increase.
Upper Hayfork HUC5: the Hall City-Wilson Creek HUC8 increases enough for the Disturbance Indicator
to change from Moderate to High; See the Project Physical Science Report, Hydrology Chapter, for a
discussion on this Alternative regarding further CWE detail and mitigative responses required. In
summary, implementation of the Project elements with this alternative would generate about 85% greater
sedimentation and turbidity than alternative 1, possibly preserving stream substrate character less while
still generating LWD, retain but put at risk some streambank conditions, increase the probability of
detrimental changes to base and peak flows, and somewhat strain the aquatic conservation strategy
regarding riparian reserves.

Alternative 4 – Northern Spotted Owl

Table 2-2 indicates that the road buffer width in alternative 4 will yield the same treatment acreage as
alternative 1 (7,969 acres). The fuel reduction acreage, however, will drop to 5,840 and the potential
hazard tree harvest road miles will decrease to 20 miles from the 128 miles available in the three previous
alternatives. Tree salvage harvest acreage in this alternative (782 acres) is barely 10% of that available in
alternative 3, and less than 20% available in the proposed action. The reason for the reductions in these
treatment acreages is because habitat for northern spotted owls would be avoided for salvage, fuels
reduction, and follow-up maintenance. Only hazard tree felling by hand could occur within spotted owl
habitat, but felled trees would need to be left as fallen. Approximately 2,011 cubic yards of sediment
would be generated to stream courses from this alternative implementation, significantly less than that of
the previous three alternatives.
Direct Effects
Fewer hazard trees would be felled with this alternative reducing the likelihood that some MIS trout could
be directly killed, injured, or harmed via stress through trees dropping directly into stream channels. It’s
possible that the result of such implementation would cause no effect to living fish and discountable
adverse effects to fish habitat.
The legacy roads stream crossing improvements and road decommissioning would remain the same if
implementing this alternative as with the other alternatives so the risk of direct effects would be the same
for this phase of the treatment. But many of the remaining actions would pose less risk than the preceding
alternatives because this alternative is closer to the no action alternative than the previous three
alternatives, which would provide literally no direct effects of course. Significantly less mechanical
disturbance would occur on the native landscapes in spotted owl habitat but would remain the same as the
proposed action outside of the owl habitat areas.
Indirect Effects
Although hand-felled trees remaining on site would tend to beneficially decompose where felled with no
additional ground disturbance occurring, those same trees could add to the fuel load during future
wildfires, increasing the intensity. As indicated just above, sediment production would be less than half
that generated from the proposed action. Whereas this difference is more beneficial incrementally to fish
and aquatic resources, it also moves the Project further away from the purpose and need for action.
Implementation of the Project elements with this alternative would generate less sedimentation and
turbidity, help preserve stream substrate character more while still generating some LWD, retain
streambank condition, decrease the probability of detrimental changes to base and peak flows, and help
maintain the aquatic conservation strategy regarding riparian reserves. This alternative, conversely, may
create greater fuel hazard environments at a later time and subject areas to more intense wildfire burning.
216

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

This outcome would likely generate more sediment afterwards than what the difference between the
proposed action and this alternative does.
Cumulative Effects
There would be reduced upward changes in Risk Ratios for many of the watersheds analyzed in this
alternative which would correlate with the reduced projected sediment tonnage increases. At the HUC5
scale, the reduction would not change the existing TOC for any of the watersheds already designated to be
above the TOC so mitigation activities would still need to occur in these watersheds, described under the
CWE of the proposed action. However, mitigative activities would need be implemented due to various
TOCs already being exceeded such as in Lower South Fork and Middle South Fork. See Project Physical
Science Report, Hydrology Chapter.

Alternative 5 – Minimum Impact Alternative

The general treatment buffer area and buffer width would remain the same for this alternative as for the
proposed action. What changes with this alternative is that the following sensitive areas would be offlimits to any kind of activity other than hazard tree felling:


Northern spotted owl suitable nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat; and post-fire foraging



Riparian Reserves



Inventoried Roadless Areas



‘At-risk’ watersheds

See Table 2-2 for the comparative differences in the treatment categories and the Project EIS for a more
thorough description of the alternative. Active salvage operations would cease in this alternative as well.
The contribution of sediment to Project-area streams would be reduced by over 86% compared to the
preferred alternative: 474tons.
Direct Effects
There will be no direct effect to fish or fish habitat of any kind or location via vegetation management due
to the exclusion of riparian reserve entry. Therefore, no felled hazard trees will be able to reach a stream
containing fish. All felled trees will also be left on site in the position they were all felled. Treatment
outside of the sensitive areas listed above will have fuel reduction including machine-piling, mastication,
chipping, hand-piling and future broadcast burning. Unquestionably, the Project elements that will be
implemented (excludes commercial salvage) under this reduced scale of operation will yield less direct
effects to the habitat indicators. More than with the previous four alternatives, the portion of direct effects
resulting from legacy road treatments compared to the rest of this alternative will be greater because there
will be no reduction in legacy road treatments, while the overall alternative direct effect level will
decrease.
Indirect Effects
Similarly to the discussion above, all of the indirect Project element effects to the habitat indicators will
be proportionately reduced under this alternative when compared to the other alternatives. It is possible,
especially when comparing the implementation of this alternative to alternative 3, for example, that one or
more of the habitat indicators may come close to receiving a neutral, or at most a discountable effect
compared to an insignificant effect regarding the other alternatives.
Cumulative Effects
No watersheds will exceed the TOC upon adopting this alternative that do not exceed the TOC in any
other alternative because landscape management will be less than the others, excluding the no action
alternative. But it also does not appear that risk ratio disturbance levels will change at the HUC5, HUC6,
and HUC7 watershed size levels either. It’s possible that one or more HUC8 risk ratios will drop enough
such that the disturbance level determination will decrease to the next lower level.

Additional Mitigation Guidance and Requirements
Water Drafting
Water drafting sites will occur at already established locations with existing access and will be located to
minimize adverse effects on stream channel stability, sedimentation and instream flows needed to
maintain riparian resources, channel conditions and fish habitat.94 Water drafting sites that are not within
habitat accessible to anadromous salmonids will be identified first and will be given priority for use.
When needed, water drafting may occur in habitat accessible by anadromous salmonids. In all cases
where water drafting occurs within such habitat, 2001 National Marine Fisheries Service’s Water Drafting
Specifications95 will be adhered to.
Refer to table 3 in the Fish BE and MIS Report which lists the river or tributary reaches that are
accessible to anadromous fish and therefore are SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat. They
include the entire South Fork Trinity River, approximately the lower mile of Butter Creek, lower
1.5 miles of Plummer Creek, lower 2 miles of Rattlesnake Creek, New River, and several other
tributary reaches within the action area of this Project.
In addition, when drafting water outside of critical habitat, the following rules apply.96
a) Allow drafting from fishery streams only where immediate downstream discharge is maintained
at 1.5 cubic feet per second (CFS) or greater, and the diversion is not greater than 10 percent of
the stream flow.
b) Allow drafting from ephemeral streams, intermittent streams, wetlands or constructed ponds
provided that sufficient water quantity and quality remains to support associated wildlife species
and riparian values (and complies with the NMFS Water Drafting Specifications above).
c) Never allow drafting to remove more than 75 percent of constructed pond water.
Aquatic Period of Operation (APO).
The annual period of normal operations established to protect aquatic resources is from April 15 through
October 15. The concept is often referred to as a ‘limited-operating period’ in BMP text and elsewhere.
This period may be extended on either end of the stated seasonal range based on occurrence of all of the
following criteria: 1) a long term dry weather forecast, 2) the ability to winterize activities at the end of
every day, 3) acceptance of recommendations from the district fisheries biologist and/or hydrologist (after
meeting the first two criteria), and 4) authorization by the District Ranger (after meeting the first three
criteria). Wet Weather Operations Guidelines (Rust, 2015a) will also be followed whenever activities
occur outside of the APO.
The Guidelines will be used to guide operations, especially hauling, during periods of wet weather. Earth
scientists will examine field conditions to determine when the soil and roads have dried out enough to
enable operations to resume without risk of watershed impacts. The earth scientists will make
recommendations as to when operations may resume to ensure that BMPs will be met and adverse
impacts will be avoided. The STNF Forest Plan Soil Cover Guidelines (Forest Plan, page 4-21) in the
Forest Plan) will be met to minimize soil compaction and erosion.

Discussion, Conclusions and Determinations

It has been determined in the Project Biological Assessment that implementation of alternative 1, the
proposed action, may affect, and is not likely to adversely affect SONCC coho salmon and/or SONCC
coho salmon Critical Habitat. This ‘NLAA’ determination would result despite the implementation of

Project element 5: “legacy site treatment, stream crossing reconstruction, and road decommissioning”,
which has the potential to generate the most sediment directly into stream courses. Were it not for the
extent of RPMs, EEZs, BMPs, the ACS and RR management standards to be applied to this Project,
adverse effects could be realized with this Project via this Project element.
Implementation of the remaining five Project elements together more easily merit a ‘not likely to
adversely affect determination’ when considering the effects to habitat indicators using the ‘factors’ for
effects consideration (AP; USDA et al., 2004).
Review the resource protection measures regarding riparian reserves listed in Appendix B of the Fish BE
and MIS Report which will minimize adverse effects to the habitat indicators.

Project Element 1 – Hazard Tree Mitigation and Reforestation

Implementation of this element, scheduled to occur in action alternatives 1-4, will most likely affect
flowing water, aquatic and fish habitats via the increased truck traffic associated with removal of any
felled hazard trees for commercial purposes.
As per the Project Physical Sciences Report, erosion rates increase from 7.5 tons per mile of haul route
road comparing its background use state to 13.6 tons per mile during harvest activities. No doubt a
portion of that accelerated erosion will migrate to flowing streams either by roadbed surface erosion
runoff during the first fall season rains, or via inboard ditch drainage relief. The actual felling of the
hazard trees to either remain in place if felled within 150 feet of perennial streams or perhaps yarded
away from perennial streams if more than 150 feet away, will affect flowing water very little. There may
be virtually no effect to flowing streams when fallen hazard trees are yarded toward roads on slopes
outside of riparian reserves.
Implementation will not decrease LWD levels; rather, it may increase it in specific reaches of stream
where hazard trees are felled within 150 feet of flowing streams but left in place. Streambank condition
will not change outside of the few linear feet where hazard trees may be felled toward and into stream
courses. This is an occurrence that could happen naturally shortly thereafter regardless, because the trees
are dead. The probability of changes in the magnitude of peak and base flows will not appreciably change
but rather be affected neutrally or insignificantly. Riparian reserves will certainly be in the close
proximity of operations of any of the action alternatives excluding alternative 5, including receipt of
direct manipulation. But the magnitude of appreciable adverse changes is discountable. Water temperature
should be affected neutrally because canopy levels creating shade over water surfaces will change
insignificantly.
Reforestation will create no adverse effects but rather mid- to long-term beneficial effects to vegetated
hillslopes and adjacent riparian reserves and stream courses by accelerating the incidence of tree canopy,
slope stability and shading.

Project Element 2 – Fuels Reduction Initial Entry

Fuels reduction activities will occur with all five action alternatives. See the list of actions common to all
alternatives in the Introduction of this report. Fuels reduction will not adversely affect the habitat
indicators of water temperature; suspended sediment and turbidity; stream substrate character; large
woody debris; streambank condition; change in peak and base flows; and riparian reserves. Removal of
dead brush and dying vegetation beyond hazard trees would be included in this Project element, and could
occur in all of the special land allocations except in alternative 4 and 5.

Project Element 3 – Commercial Salvage

Yarding of felled commercial hazard trees will not directionally occur toward, into, or through streams but
rather away from them. It will also not occur at all within 150 feet of perennial stream courses due to
EEZs. Sedimentation which could be expressed by turbidity, suspended sediment, and changes in
streambed substrate character could result to an insignificant or discountable extent from commercial
219

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

hauling of felled hazard tree logs on unsurfaced roads. See the discussion about this under Project element
1.

Project Element 4 – Temporary road ramps, landings, and water drafting

Up to two miles of currently unauthorized roads could be used for access to landings and nearly one mile
of temporary road newly constructed depending on the alternative. Landings may also be reused or
created. This element will remove vegetation and compact soils during the implementation of the Project
until maintenance activities are completed. See the discussion of this element in the Physical Sciences
Report, Soils section. The RPMs associated with this aspect of the Project element should reduce
potential impacts of this element to insignificant and/or discountable levels to water temperature;
suspended sediment and turbidity; stream substrate character; large woody debris; streambank condition;
change in peak and base flows; and riparian reserves.
Water drafting (Appendix D of the Project BE and MIS Report) will occur following the RPMs identified
in Appendix B of that Report and described above as per the National Marine Fisheries Service 2001
Water Drafting Specifications.

Project Element 5 – Legacy site treatments, stream crossing
reconstruction, and road decommissioning

The eleven culvert replacement sites will occur where the road fill prism over the currently undersized
culverts add up to nearly 30,000 cubic yards of mostly detrimental finer grained sediment materials. One
or more of these existing culvert crossings may be replaced by a bridge or natural arch stream crossing,
requiring permanent removal of much of the road bed fill material. Despite rigorous application of all
Project BMPs and RPMs, excavating quantities this large of road fill sediment will almost certainly inject
some fine-grained sediment into the adjacent affected stream courses in at least some of these crossings.
For any flowing streams at the time of the pipe replacement, the water will need to be diverted into
temporary pipes and may require temporary dams built up or downstream from the crossings.
Additionally, there will be a repair to an existing unauthorized stream ford that may have flowing water in
the stream at the time of the repair. Although a flow retaining structure may be built just downstream of
the repair work, no doubt some turbidity will be released from the site working downstream.
This work should not adversely affect any fish or fish habitats, however. Stream reaches will experience
diluted turbidity and a return to clarity not far downstream from any point source sediment intrusions,
even if such were to occur episodically.

Project Element 6 – Fuels Reduction Maintenance

This Project element would be less impacting than the initial entry of fuels reduction because less
treatment will occur per year for maintenance than any of the seasons of initial entry.

Effects Determination Summaries

Implementation of these Project elements will create insignificantly adverse effects at most to streams and
in turn Critical Habitat of ESA listed as threatened SONCC coho salmon, essential fish habitat for
SONCC coho and Sensitive UKTR Chinook salmon, and aquatic habitats for Sensitive KMP steelhead
and Pacific Lamprey, and MIS designated spring-run Chinook salmon and spring-run (summer) steelhead,
both of South Fork Trinity River derivation, and MIS designated resident rainbow trout. The Project will
have a minor affect to the fish listed above except for possible incidental direct harm or injury to MIS
rainbow trout from the felling of hazard trees within 150 feet of live streams possessing trout for the
creation of beneficial large woody debris.
It is my determination that the Proposed Action - Alternative 1, as well as the four other action
alternatives assuming that Project Element 5 will be implemented identically for all of them – may affect,
but is not likely to adversely affect SONCC coho salmon and SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat (see
Project fish biological assessment. Implementation of the action alternatives will not adversely affect

Essential Fish Habitat for SONCC coho salmon and UKT Chinook salmon by virtue of Project Element
outcomes being immeasurable in EFH. A trend toward listing under the ESA is not anticipated and
viability of Forest Service Sensitive Species is not at risk because implementation of any of the action
alternatives meet Standards and Guidelines, will be implemented under exhaustive RPM and BMP
stipulations, are subject to EEZs, and do not adversely modify fish and aquatic habitat in the long term.
However, some USFS Sensitive status individuals may be adversely affected in the short term via the
felling of hazard trees into stream channels for the otherwise beneficial creation of LWD. Impacts to the
listed MIS species and their habitats may be measureable in the short term but less so in the long term,
and could prove beneficial over allowance of sufficient time via implementation of any of the action
alternatives.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Geology
Within the project area, a high degree of mass wasting as shallow slope failures, rock fall, ravel, rock
slides and debris flow activity has occurred in the past and will continue in the future. In addition, some
dormant landslides are located in the project area which might be re-activated during future storms as a
result of the 2015 fires. When evaluating geologic hazards and slope stability, the focus of this report is on
identifying the geologic conditions and geomorphic processes that have helped shape the watersheds and
landscapes, and assessing the suitability and safety of logging equipment (both wheeled and tracked
types) on and off project roads. Using that understanding of rock types and characteristics, geomorphic
processes, and distribution of geologic hazards, this report will also assess the risk that implementation of
any of the proposed alternatives of the project may create or exacerbate the previously mentioned
geologic hazards.

Methodology

The Shasta-Trinity National Forest’s Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) requires that
unstable areas or areas that are suspected of instabilities be evaluated as part of project planning.
Furthermore, it requires that areas with a high probability of mass wasting from ground disturbing
activities be protected. For this project, the areas surveyed for potential geologic impact were limited to
those adjacent to roads and within the proposed project buffers.
In order to evaluate and protect unstable areas or suspected areas of instability, field data collected for this
project was recorded from personal observations taken primarily adjacent to county and Forest Service
roads using traditional field methods such as Forest Service and GIS maps, GPS, clinometer, and field
book.
A total of 20 days were spent in the field, and ten days were devoted to map and report creation. Notes
and maps documenting field observations are in the project record. The Forest GIS coverages for bedrock
and geomorphology were examined on-screen with fire perimeters, proposed treatments, and project
roads superimposed to identify areas where unstable land was impacted by fire and where they might be
impacted by project activities. Forest Service maps, GIS databases, and Google Earth images of the fire
areas were examined to get a sense for the effects of the fires and to look for recent landslides which may
have been missed by the Forest active landslide GIS coverage.
A small number of un-mapped, pre-existing, but unmaintained non-system roads were surveyed to
identify unstable areas. Rock types were observed to verify bedrock mapping available in the Forest’s GIS
bedrock layer.
Direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the alternatives on slope stability were analyzed. An analysis of
effects relevant to geology on National Forest lands within the project area for each activity was made.

Affected Environment
Geology
The proposed project area lies within the Klamath Mountains Physiographic Province, and is underlain
predominantly by Paleozoic and Mesozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rock, along with minor
amounts of Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary sediments. Tectonic processes accreted numerous
terranes to the western margin of North America and six of these occur within the project area: the
Sawyers Bar, Western Hayfork, Rattlesnake Creek, Western Klamath, Pickett Peak, and Yolla Bolly
Terranes (Table 3-57). These Terranes were intruded by granitic plutons, including the Wildwood Pluton
and Ironside Mountain Batholith. Small outcrops of sedimentary rock, represented by the Great Valley
Group, Weaverville Formation, and Pleistocene/Holocene colluvial deposits, occur primarily in the
Hyampom and Hayfork Valleys along with scattered patches of topographically-high relict Pleistocene
alluvial land surfaces. Figure 3-13 displays the regional distribution of terranes, with the location of the
fire complexes indicated.
The Sawyers Bar Terrane consists primarily of metasedimentary rock, including some small limestone
bodies with known caves. It contains a scattering of dormant landslide deposits, primarily slump and
earthflow complexes, amounting to about 10% of the area. One small post-fire debris flow has been
documented within the Sawyer’s Bar Terrane, and this was on the north side of Natural Bridge Creek, a
short distance north of Natural Bridge picnic area. The debris flow occurred around 2009, following a fire
a few years prior.

The Western Hayfork Terrane consists mainly of metavolcanic agglomerate and tuff, as well as argillite
and chert. It includes the dioritic Ironside Mountain batholith as well as the Hayfork Bally meta-andesite

facing slope east of Allen Creek are identified within the fire perimeter. The Terrane also contains small
bodies of limestone which could have caves.
The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane is an accretionary mélange consisting mostly of highly dismembered
ophiolite including slabs of serpentinite and peridotite, basaltic volcanic rocks, radiolarian chert, and
limestone knockers. A significant proportion consists of diamictite, a weak metasedimentary rock which
is prone to deep seated landslides. It contains a high density of dormant and active landslides in the
western half of the South Complex (about 60% of the area within the fire perimeter is composed of this
Terrane). Along the west central part of the fire complex, between the South Fork of Trinity River and
Eltapom Creek to the east, a large area is mapped almost entirely as dormant landslide. Parts of this
polygon do not express the hummocky bench/scarp topography typical of dormant landslides. There are,
however, several active landslide areas mapped in the northwest, far west, and southernmost portions of
the burn area. In general, the density of dormant and active landslide in the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane
(within the fire complex) is much higher than in the Western Hayfork Terrane (<5%). Scattered bodies of
serpentinite and peridotite diapirs occur within this Terrane, which could contain naturally occurring
asbestos. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane also contains small blebs97 of limestone which could have caves.
The Western Klamath Terrane is an accreted allochthonous oceanic terrane consisting of dismembered
upper ophiolite sequences, serpentinite and peridotite, mica schist, metasedimentary and metavolcanic
rocks, with interbedded shale, siltstone and chert. It includes the Galice Formation. The dismembered
ophiolite sequences contain serpentinite and peridotite, which may contain naturally occurring asbestos
(NOA). The southwestern portion of the South Complex and the northeastern part of the Route Complex
lie within the Western Klamath Terrane. Numerous active and dormant landslides are mapped within this
terrane, most notably within the South Fork Trinity River valley.
The Pickett Peak Terrane is dominated by the South Fork Mountain Schist, which consists chiefly of finegrained quartz-albite schist and sparse metachert. The knobby schist outcrops found on South Fork
Mountain within the Route and Mad River Complexes may contain small caves suitable for bat habitat.
South Fork Mountain also has several areas that are mapped and confirmed as having dormant and active
deep-seated landslides as seen in the numerous scarps, slumps, and benches on the slopes.
The Yolla Bolly Terrane is a narrow accretionary mélange terrane immediately to the west of the Picket
Peak Terrane and is similar in age and geologic composition. This terrane occupies the far western
portions of the Route and Mad River Complexes with predominantly west-facing slopes containing
several dormant deep-seated rotated slumps and may also contain small caves suitable for bat habitat. The
Cretaceous Great Valley Group that outcrops in the project area consists mainly of western outliers of
remnant near-shore marine and shallow-shelf deposits of well-indurated siltstone, sandstone, turbidite
sequences, and conglomerates. It is represented mostly as limited outcrops within the Fork Complex that
are not prone to geologic instability.
Plutons in the Klamath Mountains typically form sandy soils and can be particularly prone to shallow
debris slides and debris flows in steeper watersheds after wildfire. The Ironside Mountain batholith in the
River Complex and the Wildwood Pluton within the Fork Complex contain minor amounts of pyroxenite
which could also possibly contain naturally occurring asbestos.
Deposits of the mid-Tertiary Weaverville Formation crop out in the vicinity of Hyampom, Hayfork, and
above the New River Valley. These consist of weakly consolidated fluvial and lacustrine rocks, thinly
laminated, light-colored clay and tuff, alongside coaly deposits of late Oligocene and early Miocene age.
Lying predominately near ridgetops, they have low slope gradients, are poorly exposed and should not
pose a significant risk of erosion or sliding.

Older alluvium (Pleistocene) deposits are composed of weakly consolidated non-marine silt, sand, and
conglomerate associated with topographically high remnants of old land surfaces. Most of these deposits
are at elevations of 3,000 to 4,000 feet, about 2,000 feet or more higher than that of the South Fork Trinity
River. Deposits are generally less indurated than the Weaverville Formation, and therefore are more prone
to erosion after wildfire.

Geomorphology
Most of the geologic terranes of the Klamath Mountains are weak and prone to landslides. Rapid uplift,
high precipitation, and seismic activity to the west have created a landscape with abundant deep seated
landslides, many of which occupy several square miles. Most of these larger complexes are dormant
under present climatic and seismic conditions, though some from tens to hundreds of acres in size are
known to be active. Both the dormant and active landslides are very important parts of the landscape
because they are often the source of debris slides during wet winters, and the debris slides in turn generate
debris flows. Post-fire summer debris flows triggered by the rapid influx of sediment from rills and
gullies typical of places like southern California and the Rockies are less common in this region, most
likely because intense summer storms occur less frequently.
Some of the large active slides near the South Fork Trinity River, and specifically the ones mapped just
north of Hyampom, have experienced high to moderate burn severity. The largest area with high burn
severity is the eastern slope of Underwood Mountain, and the adjacent areas on both sides of Buckhorn
Creek in the northern part of the South Complex. This spot is situated within the Rattlesnake Creek
Terrane (as described above), generally with slopes of less than 65% and a small number of dormant
landslides located within it. The high burn severity coupled with the high probability of heavy winter
rains (NOAA, Sep. 2015), suggests the possibility of reactivating these dormant slides or even the
creation of new ones.

Geologic Effects Analysis
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects

The application of resource protection measures (RPMs) for Riparian Areas, Soils and Hydrology would
protect unstable lands and minimize each alternative’s direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. Effects
from mechanical off-road equipment (both wheeled and tracked types) on land-sliding would be
negligibly increased and thus none of the alternatives would be expected to cause new landslides or
reactivate existing ones.
All known (mapped and field-verified) active landslides will be flagged and avoided as described in
Appendix B of the Geology Report and per RPMs.

Proposed Action/Action Alternative 1 (approximately 8,000 acres)
Direct Effects
Direct effects of fire-killed trees and understory vegetation include the physical disturbances to the soil
associated with their removal. Only hazard trees would be felled within 50 feet of unstable and potentially
unstable areas.
As part of photosynthesis, trees pull moisture from the soil, which helps to regulate soil moisture and
increase slope stability. The loss of these trees through fire removes this effect. Therefore, root support
and evapotranspiration are not expected to be affected by salvage of fire-killed trees as their roots are
dead and the trees no longer transpire.
Potential direct effects of tractors and yarding with a ground-based system are potential reactivation of
unknown existing dormant or unmapped landslides by: a) rerouting of surface runoff; or b) disturbance to
subsurface hydrology affecting springs possibly by compaction or changes in surface and shallow
subsurface flow paths. These changes in hydrology can increase subsurface water or cause water to
infiltrate previously unsaturated areas making landslides more likely.
Direct effects of cable yarding, if used, are less than those caused by tractor logging as ground
disturbance would be less.
Construction of a new temporary road (<1 mile for this alternative) and new landings would: 1) remove
remaining live vegetation (live vegetation increases slope stability through root shear strength and
227

Final Environmental Impact Statement

evapotranspiration); 2) on steeper ground, alter and over-steepen slopes through cuts and fills thereby
decreasing slope stability; and 3) potentially reroute surface runoff. Temporary roads and landings will be
located on gentle slopes (<20%) to minimize earthwork, and will avoid unstable areas, steep slopes below
landslide benches and slope positions where they could deliver sediment to streams. Cuts and fills would
not exceed 5 feet in height, unless field reviewed and approved by an earth scientist beforehand per
Project Geology RPMs.
Indirect Effects
Removal of fire-killed trees and understory vegetation is not expected to cause measurable changes in
hillslope stability (see direct effects section concerning evapotranspiration). However, slash from salvage
logging would enhance infiltration of water into soils and at the same time protect soils from rilling,
gullying, and shallow landslides.
Indirect effects of cable yarding include potential for felled logs to roll downhill in steep areas. This could
result in additional ground disturbance which could cause changes to hillslope hydrology possibly
increasing landslide potential.
Decommissioning of temporary roads and landings as well as hydrologic stabilization practices would
improve slope drainage and reduce landslide potential. Maintenance of existing roads would correct
surface drainage problems, reduce concentration of water, and thereby reduce landslide potential and
sedimentation of nearby drainages.
RPMs to protect workers from exposure address the probability of naturally occurring asbestos in rock
outcrops.
Fuels treatments would help reduce future fire severity which would in turn cause a reduction in future
landslide potential.
The Proposed Action also includes reforestation which would enhance slope and soil stability through
evapotranspiration and root shear strength resulting in a reduction in landslide potential.
Cumulative Effects
The 2015 Fires comprise the background and have overwhelmed previous activities within the burned
area. All past and future foreseeable actions (as identified in the EIS) have been considered. The 2015
fires reduced forest and other vegetation cover, reducing transpiration and increasing the likelihood of
landslides. The Proposed Action /Alternative 1 would not increase that impact because only dead trees
and vegetation would be treated, but would slightly mitigate the effect of soil cover removed by the fire
by increasing soil cover through slash production. Due to the limited area treated under the proposed
action, any mitigating effects are small compared to the widespread damage created by the fires, resulting
in insignificant changes in landslide potential.
Overall, the cumulative effects of the Proposed Action/Action Alternative 1 would be a slight decrease in
long term risk for land-sliding and mass wasting, due to reduced future fire severity and reforestation
efforts.

Action Alternative 2: Consistent Buffer and Fuelbreaks Alternative
(approximately 9,500 acres)
Direct Effects
With additional acres under this alternative, there would be a similar disturbance from yarding of
salvaged timber but slightly increased ground disturbances would occur when machine piling and logging
activities occur due to the larger number of acres treated. Also, this alternative would remove some dying
trees that are currently still green, resulting in additional losses of evapotranspiration with the associated
increase in soil saturation and increased landslide potential. This effect is short-term since the trees are

228

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

currently dying and would stop evapotranspiration within a few years even without treatment. The
removal of these dying trees could result in a negligible increase in landslide potential.
The creation of new temporary roads (<1 mile) and new landings would have a similar direct effect as
stated in the Proposed Alternative.
As with Alternative 1, RPMs to protect workers from exposure address the probability of naturally
occurring asbestos in rock outcrops, but this alternative would treat more acres within areas that could
potentially have naturally occurring asbestos in rock outcrops, which are scattered throughout the project
area.
Indirect Effects
Similarly to Alternative 1, the fuels treatments associated with this alternative would reduce future fire
intensity and its associated effects. In addition, this alternative would include fuel breaks which could
further reduce fire intensity and fire spread which would more significantly reduce potential future fire
impacts on landslide probability.
This alternative also includes reforestation which would enhance slope and soil stability through
evapotranspiration and root shear strength causing a reduction in landslide potential; however, more trees
per acre would be planted under this alternative, reducing landslide potential compared to Alternative 1.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects for Alternative 2 are similar to the Proposed Action; however, a comparatively small
number of dying trees would be removed under this alternative, having the potential to reduce
evapotranspiration further, resulting in a cumulative reduction in live vegetation-related
evapotranspiration and the associated effects to slope stability.

Action Alternative 3: Wider Buffer Alternative (approximately 15,200 acres)
Direct Effects
Direct effects of Alternative 3 would be similar to Alternative 2, except area of disturbance would
increase due to an increase in the number of acres treated (nearly double those of the Proposed Action).
Similarly to Alternative 2, Alternative 3 would also remove some dying trees on those treated acres,
resulting in a greater reduction in evapotranspiration and root support than Alternative 1. This would
result in a negligible increase in landslide potential.
Indirect Effects
With additional fuels reduction treatments there would be, compared to Alternative 1, a slight decreased
risk of future fire severity and associated effects.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects for Alternative 3 would be similar to Alternative 2, but the scale of project related
effects would be larger due to the increased acreage, leading to a potential for larger cumulative effects on
reduction of evapotranspiration than Alternative 2. The increased evapotranspiration (and resulting slope
stability) due to the planting of trees would be similar to the Proposed Action.

Action Alternative 4: Northern Spotted Owl Alternative (approximately 8,000
acres)
Direct Effects
Alternative 4 would be similar to the Proposed Action, with the same number of acres treated, but fewer
salvage logging and fuels reduction treatments on those acres under this alternative. Fewer salvage
logging and fuels reduction treatment acres means fewer acres of soil impacts and associated landslide
potential. This alternative also only removes dead trees, leaving dying trees; therefore, no reduction in
evapotranspiration would occur from this alternative.
229

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Indirect Effects
Alternative 4 would have similar indirect effects as the Proposed Action. Where fuels reduction
treatments are performed, there would be reduced severity for future fires and a potential decrease in
landslide probability after future fires; however, this reduction is less than the Proposed Action because
the areas identified as important habitat for Northern Spotted Owls would not have fuels reduction
treatments.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects for Alternative 4 would be similar to the Proposed Action given that the acres treated
are the same. The increased evapotranspiration (and resulting slope stability) due to the planting of trees
would be similar to the Proposed Action.

Action Alternative 5: Minimum Impact Alternative (approximately 8,000
acres)
Direct Effects
Alternative 5 would have less soil disturbance with fewer acres of fuels reduction treatments and no
salvage logging. Also, this alternative would only fell dead hazard trees. Dying trees would be left
standing; therefore, this alternative would not result in a reduction of evapotranspiration. This alternative
results in the least amount of direct effects due to the small number of acres treated.
Indirect Effects
Alternative 5 would have fewer positive indirect effects due to the fewer acres treated. Where fuels
treatments are performed, there would be reduced severity in future fires and thus a potential decrease in
landslide probability after future fires; however, the number of acres with fuels reduction treatments is the
least under this alternative compared to other alternatives, resulting in the least amount of decrease in
landslide potential after future fires. Where areas are left untreated, especially areas with higher fuel
loading, the possibility of severity of future fire remains high with the associated increased risk of
potential landslides.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects for Alternative 5 would be similar to the Proposed Action, but would be slightly
smaller due to the smaller area treated with fuels reduction and the lack of salvage logging. This
alternative results in the least potential for mitigation of fire effects on slope stability through fuels
reduction treatments. The increased evapotranspiration (and resulting slope stability) due to the planting
of trees would be similar to the Proposed Action.

Alternative 6: No Action

No vegetation will be treated. Trees and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and
fall without human influence.
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
A No-Action Alternative would result in no ground disturbance with no proposed treatments. However,
because no timber salvage, hazard tree removal or fuels treatments are proposed in this alternative, there
would be an increased likelihood of high severity fires and landslide probability after future fires.
The 2015 fires resulted in increased landslide potential due to removal of soil cover and live vegetation,
and associated changes in slope hydrology. Implementation of this project has the potential to mitigate
some of those fire effects on a relatively small number of acres, but the no action alternative would not
implement those treatments, leaving the existing condition of elevated landslide potential.

Soils
Methodology
The effects of each Alternative on the soil resources of the project area have been assessed using the Soil
Quality Standards (SQS) in Appendix O of the Forest Plan. Soil quality standards provide threshold
values to identify when changes in soil properties or conditions become detrimental, which would result
in significant change or impairment of the productive capacity, hydrologic function or environmental
health of the soil.
Soil resources have been reviewed using soil survey data, data in GIS, and field reconnaissance (a total of
78 soil descriptions were examined and categorized in the field to verify soil mapping). Most of the
treatment units have been field reviewed by the Forest soil scientist to verify mapping, identify areas
where soil productivity may be affected by proposed actions, and examine current disturbance on site.

Soil Resiliency
Soil resiliency refers to the ability of a soil to resist or recover its healthy state in response to destabilizing
influences. It is based on the Region 5 Soil Interpretations of 1999 (Miles, 1999). The soil resiliency
index rates soils on their ability to resist degradation from disturbance. It is based on a soil’s susceptibility
to erosion98, burning, compaction, displacement99, puddling100, and churning101– which are the common
soil stressors from timber and fuel reduction operations. Soil resiliency determines what amount of
disturbance forest soils can endure before they become less productive due to cumulative effects. The soil
resiliency index combines all the soil stress ratings to give an overall resiliency rating to the soil. The soil
disturbance rating values listed in Table 3-58 are a numerical range based on combined ratings for soil
physical properties. The resiliency rating is for total resiliency of a soil to the combined effects of erosion,
burning, compaction, displacement, puddling and churning.

Soil Stability
Many land use activities have the potential to cause erosion rates to exceed natural soil erosion or soil
formation rates. In order to assess the potential risk of a given soil to erode, an erosion hazard rating
(EHR) was developed (R-5 FSH 2509.22). Many interrelated factors are evaluated in an EHR system to
determine whether land use activities would cause accelerated erosion. The EHR system is designed to
assess the relative risk of accelerated sheet and rill erosion. This rating system is based on soil texture,
depth, permeability of soil, amount of rock fragments, surface cover (vegetative and surface rocks),
slopes, and climate. Risk ratings vary from low to very high with low ratings meaning low probability of
surface erosion occurring. Moderate ratings mean that accelerated erosion is likely to occur in most years
and water quality impacts may occur for the upper part of the moderate numerical range. High to very
high EHR ratings mean that accelerated erosion is likely to occur in most years and that erosion control

98 Erosion

is the detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles by water, wind, or gravity.
Displacement is the removal of topsoil from heavy equipment.
100 Puddling is mixing soil into a watery slurry that removes soil structure.
101 Churning occurs when soil is turned so that topsoil is placed underneath subsoil.
99

measures should be evaluated. These ratings assume varying amounts of vegetation cover depending on
degree of fuel management.
Vascular plants, soil biotic crusts, and litter cover are the greatest deterrent to surface soil erosion. Visual
evidence of surface erosion may include rills, gullies, pedestalling, soil deposition, erosion pavement, or
loss of the topsoil102. Erosion models are used to predict on-site and off-site soil loss (water erosion
prediction project (WEPP) and/or the erosion hazard rating (EHR). Sufficient soil cover should be
maintained to prevent accelerated soil erosion that exceeds the rate of soil formation. Erosion needs to be
less than one ton/acre, which equates to an erosion hazard rating in the low range. For granitics, 90% or
greater soil cover is necessary. For metasediments, 50 to 70% cover is necessary (Forest Plan, Appendix
O).

Soil Hydrology
Compaction reduces infiltration, increases runoff, which increases erosion hazard ratings and decreases
down site water quality. Compaction also decreases porosity, which decreases tree root elongation during
critical growing period thus stressing the tree. With stressed trees the stand becomes more likely to
develop disease and insect attacks.
Soil porosity is the standard to measure compaction, and it puts change on a relative basis per soil type.
Soil porosity is the area of the soil matrix that is occupied by voids (micro and macro-pores) that air and
water circulate through. The standard for soil porosity is at least 90% of the porosity found under
undisturbed or natural conditions. Soil porosity is measured between 4 and 8 inches below the soil
surface. A 10 percent reduction in total soil porosity corresponds to a threshold soil bulk density that
indicates possible detrimental soil compaction (depending on texture; Forest Plan, Appendix O).

Nutrient Cycling

Nutrient cycling is assessed by evaluating the vegetative community composition, litter, duff, coarse
woody material, and root distribution. These indicators are directly related to soil organic matter, which is
essential in sustaining long-term soil productivity. Soil organic matter provides a carbon and energy
source for soil microbes and provides nutrients needed for plant growth. Organic matter needs to be
maintained in kinds and amounts sufficient to prevent significant nutrient cycle deficits, and to avoid
detrimental physical and biological soil conditions:







102 A

Soil organic matter (dark topsoil layer) in the upper 12 inches of soil should be at least 85 percent
of the total soil organic matter (SOM) found under undisturbed or natural conditions.
Fine organic matter should occur on at least 50 percent of the area; this includes duff, litter, and
woody material less than three inches in diameter. Fine organic matter left after treatment (surface
horizon depth after treatment) should generally be about four to eight tons/acre.
Large woody material, when occurring in the forested area, should be at least 5 logs per acre in
contact with the soil surface, and should represent the total range of decomposition (preferably in
decay class 3 and 4). The number of logs/acre should be adjusted to account for ecological type
potential.
Excessive lateral movement of topsoil from its usual place in the profile should be avoided.
Usually areas greater than 20 square meters (15 feet by 15 feet area) and greater than 2 inches of
topsoil removed.

rill is a shallow channel caused by erosion. A gully is a deeper channel usually deeper than 1 foot. Pedestalling is a feature
left after erosion where rock fragments are left elevated. Soil deposition is sediment deposit below a rill or gully. Erosion
pavement is rock fragment surface where fine soil is washed away leaving rock cover.

Cumulative Effects

To analyze the cumulative effects on soils, the unit of measure used to quantify the effects are the Forest
Plan Soil Quality Standards (SQS) developed and adopted in 1995 (FSH 2509.18 Soil Management
Handbook, , R-5 Supplement 2509.18-95-1-Soil Management Handbook Region 5 Supplement). These
are the appropriate units of measure because they evaluate measurable changes in soil productivity that
have been tested and peer reviewed. This cumulative effects analysis quantifies the impact effects as a
sum of the direct and indirect impacts of the alternatives considered in addition to the past, present, and
foreseeable future actions (which are independent of the alternatives considered). Future foreseeable
actions of reforestation and fuel break maintenance are within the soil bounding area. These actions are
minor and will not result in significant cumulative impacts to soils.
Cumulative soil effects will be evaluated by looking at the effects of dead tree removal and treatment of
remaining slash (pile and burn or masticate) along road corridors. The cumulative effects analysis for
soils is bounded in space by the area treated in this project. Soil impacts occur to soils in a specific
location. Impacts to soils outside of the areas treated for this project are not additive to soil impacts
created by this project. The cumulative effects analysis for soils is bounded in time by the amount of time
a particular soil is known to recover from disturbance. This time bounding varies depending on soil type;
some more sensitive soils take longer to recover from disturbance than less sensitive soils. This bounding
ranges from 15 to 30 years for sensitive soils to 5 to 10 years for more resilient soils.

Sensitive soils of granitic, shallow, and serpentine soils account for 60% of the River Complex, 55% of
the South Complex, 40% of the Saddle fire, 45% of the Fork Complex, and only 15% of the Route and
Mad River Complexes (Figure 3- 14 thru Figure 3- 19).
How resistant a soil is to erosion, compaction, displacement, burning, and puddling is called resiliency.
Shallow soils are susceptible to erosion and displacement. Granitic soils are susceptible to damage by
erosion, displacement, and burning. Serpentine soils are susceptible to damage by compaction, puddling
and churning.
The shallow soils (Goulding, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky) have the lowest soil resiliency ratings
making them very susceptible to disturbance. Soils that have the highest resiliency are Dunsmuir, Forbes,
Holland, and Secca, making them less susceptible to disturbance. Refer to Table 4 in the Physical
Sciences Report for Resiliency index ratings for major soil types. See Table 2 in the Physical Sciences
Report for definition of index ratings.

Soil erosion susceptibility levels are listed by type in Table 5 of the Physical Sciences Report. Soil erosion
susceptibility is based on the surface soil texture, how permeable the surface is, the depth to any
restrictive layer that would cause ponding, surface rock fragments that could provide cover, the steepness
of the slope, soil cover after any disturbance (natural or man-made) and the climate (rainfall or snow
amounts). Soils with the highest erosion hazard ratings include Goulding, Granitic soils (Chaix and
Chanwankee), Neuns steep, Scree, and Shallow Rocky, which are due to sandy loam textures on steep
slopes (60 to 80% slopes). Flat loamy soils (Dunsmuir, Forbes, and Holland) have the lowest erosion
hazard ratings due to strong textures and flatter slopes. Serpentine soils (Beaughton and Dubakella) have
low to moderate erosion hazard due being moderately deep with cobbles and high clay content. All of the
erosion hazard ratings assume a soil cover after disturbance (fuel treatments) of 30 to 50%.

Compaction
Compaction hazard ratings for the soils in the project area are shown by type in Table 6 of the Physical
Sciences Report. Compaction susceptibility is based on surface soil texture, cobble and stones in the
subsoil, organic matter in the topsoil and subsoil, depth of litter and duff, and soil structure. Fine-textured
soils (Dunsmuir, Forbes, and Secca) have moderately high compaction hazard ratings due to textures
(clay loam) and lack of rock fragments in the subsoil. Serpentine soils are cobbly clays with moderately
high compaction hazard, moderate puddling hazard, and potential for naturally occurring asbestos
(NOA).The rest of the soils (loamy-skeletal, steep rocky serpentines, and sandy soils) in the project area
have low to moderate compaction hazard ratings due to soil textures and high rock content.
Soil with rock fragments greater than 40%, compaction is only moderate but with rock fragments less
than 40% compaction can be severe depending on texture. Studies have shown that rock fragments greater
than 40% act as a matrix or skeleton that resists compressive forces (Powers and Alves, 1995; Gomez and
Powers 2004; Liechty and others, 2002; Rust 2004). Soil compaction is not of great concern on most of
the soils within the project area since most soils have rock content greater than 40%.

Displacement
Displacement susceptibility is based on soil texture and structure, surface organic matter, litter and duff
thickness, bulk density, and cohesion ability. Most soils in this project have moderate displacement
susceptibility, with the shallow soils having high displacement ratings due to being shallow and lacking
soil strength (Table 7 – Physical Sciences Report). Since most roots are in the upper 1 to 2 feet of soil, it
is very important to protect topsoil from displacement and puddling, especially for the Goulding, Granitic,
Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils since they are the most sensitive soils within the project.

Burning
Burning susceptibility is based on topsoil organic matter, coarse fragments in the topsoil, texture and kind
of weathered rock, and slope. Project area soils have a moderate to low risk of being degraded by fire,
except for Dark Rocky, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils – which have a moderately high risk of
damage from burning due to their coarse textures (Table 8-Physical Sciences Report).
Across all fires, there was an average of 28% moderate to high soil burn severity and 72% low to very
low soil burn severity. In areas where soils were burned at moderate to high intensity, soil structure was
destroyed, soil cover was removed, and water repellency was common. Since the highly burned
landscapes (where most of the salvage will occur) lack cover, returning as much cover as possible during
implementation is desirable. This technique was used recently for the Stafford Fire Salvage Project of
2013 (Figure 3- 20 and Figure 3- 21 below). Cover was maximized as much as possible in areas that
burned hot and soil cover was marginal. Techniques of lop-and-scatter and mastication of dead unmerchantable material was utilized to return cover to the ground and slow erosion. Immediate cover was

needed to protect severely burned soils from accelerated erosion and the loss of important nutrients that
are held in the duff and organic matter in the surface horizons. Additionally, salvage breaks up water
repellant surface layers and provides a surface roughness factor that reduces erosion (James, C. 2014). Dr.
James found salvage logging that use ground-based tractors roughen the topsoil to break up water
repellency and reduce erosion by loosening the topsoil layer and creating a roughness factor.

Post-harvest soil cover conditions – 35 to 60%
cover providing effective soil cover

With prescribed fire, most soil burning is low to moderate in a mosaic pattern, leaving greater than 50%
duff and litter (less than 3 inches in diameter). Deadwood, Neuns, Goulding, Dunsmuir, Forbes, Holland,
Secca, Serpentines, and Wetland have low soil burning damage susceptibility due to their finer textures
that resist heat penetration; the rest of the soils are moderate with the exception of Dark Rocky and
Shallow Rocky soils that rate as severe.

Puddling
Puddling hazard is the susceptibility of the soil to puddling based on soil properties. Puddling is the
destruction of soil aggregates by mechanical manipulation within a narrow range of moisture contents
above and below field capacity, so that soil aggregates lose their structure, resulting in a homogeneous
mass of soil particles.
Puddling is shown by soil type in Table 9 of the Physical Sciences Report, which shows that most of the
soils in the project area are have a low to moderate susceptibility to puddling.

Soil Fertility
Soil fertility in the project area is high to moderately low depending upon the parent material formation,
soil texture, and available water holding capacity (Table 10-Physical Sciences Report), Loamy soils
(Forbes, and Holland) have the highest soil fertility due to their depth and available water-holding
capacities (AWC). Serpentine soils (Beaughton and Dubakella) have moderately low soil fertility due to
their parent rock type (chemical imbalance) and moderate AWC. In general, most soils that are suitable
for growing timber have low fertility, and most nutrients are recycled from decomposing roots and surface
duff that gets incorporated into the soil. Desired Condition.

242

Final Environmental Impact Statement

The desired condition is to maintain or restore soils to their natural productivity. Recovery time varies for
soil burn severity experienced. For moderate to high soil burn severity, soil recovery will take five to
fifteen years. For low to very low soil burn severity, soil recovery will take three to five years.
Maintaining soil productivity over the long term generally requires presence of soil organic material and
fire effects characteristic of the natural fire regime.

Effects Analysis
The extent (geographic boundaries) of this soils analysis is the project bounding area of the Proposed
Action and each of the alternatives. Soil Quality Standards only apply to the affected soils in regards to
erosion, compaction, and fertility within the project area.
The duration of the soils analysis is fifteen years from the time of implementation. Typical erosion
recovery rates for soils with 50 to 70% cover is three to five years for areas of very low to low soil burn
severity, and ten to fifteen years for areas of moderate to high soil burn severity (as determined from the
Universal Soil Loss Equation).

Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
Direct Effects
Direct effects of the Proposed Action on the soil ecosystem are primarily soil disturbance, redistribution
of organic matter, and changes in biological properties. Tree falling by hand or mechanical means along
roads could cause minor compaction or soil displacement, depending on the soil type and slope.
Compaction caused by tree removal will be minimal since most heavy mechanical equipment will be
operating from the road. Soil cover will be improved by about 15 to 35% by lopping-and-scattering tree
tops and limbs (Rust, 2015). Soil RPMs (see Chapter 2) will minimize impacts to the landscape.
Compaction will be reduced by tilling and mulching landings, temporary roads, and main skid-trails up to
200 feet from landings.
Hazard tree treatments plus mechanical harvesting plus fuel reduction treatments plus fuel maintenance in
10 to 15 years could have direct effects on some of the more sensitive soils. The soil RPMs will insure
that their productivity will be protected and not compromised.
Soil Cover/Erosion
Current soil cover conditions are 10 to 50% (depending on soil burn severity), so increasing effective soil
cover (masticating or lop and scatter) by 10 to 30% would have positive soil effects (Figure 3- 20 and
Figure 3- 21, MacDonald, 2003). Additional soil cover would help curb the effects from future winter
storms. Tree planting will also provide cover and reduce erosion.
Soil Compaction
Dunsmuir, Holland, and Forbes soils have high soil compaction hazard ratings (Table 6-Physical Sciences
Report). These three soils occupy most of flatter, less rocky landscapes in the area (Figure 3- 14 through
Figure 3- 19). Operations would primarily be on the road prism, so compaction will be insignificant since
roads are already compacted and are not productive timberland but part of the infrastructure and exempt
from the National Forest Management Act regulations. About 40% of the areas logged in the past have
low to moderate level of soil disturbance, with compaction (4 to 7% decrease in porosity) and
displacement well below the soil quality standards for extent and severity. With the RPMs, expected
compaction from mechanical operations will only increase by an average of 2 to 4% on 40% of the unit,
leaving about 60% undisturbed and well below SQS thresholds for compaction and extent of disturbance.
Soil RPMs also include a dry operating season with only restricted wet weather operations to ensure soils
are dry enough to reduce damage due to compaction from mechanical operations (see Chapter 2).

Indirect Effects
Indirect effects on the soil ecosystem are secondary reactions to direct effects. The most common
secondary reactions are erosion caused by increased surface runoff due to compaction, reduced available
water-holding capacity of the soil due to water repellency or compaction, reduction in fertility due to
removal of cover, and reduced vegetative growth due to compaction. Additional soil cover will reduce
erosion of critical topsoil and increase soil fertility by returning all available fine slash (less than 3 inch
woody material) which contains a large proportion of recyclable nutrients that are beneficial to soil health
and productivity (Rust, 2015; Busse and others, 2014).
Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter and mastication treatments would reduce
erosion. Hillside erosion calculations (untreated vs. treated) and road erosion calculations (before
implementation, during implementation, and after implementation) indicate that the average erosion
reduction for Alternative 1 vs. No Action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated (Tables
11 and 12 of the Physical Sciences Report). For roads, erosion increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6
tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background levels of 7.5 tons/mile. Hillside
sediment reduction is due to more cover after treatment.
Tree removal by hand falling and skidding or mechanical treatments (machine-piling and mastication)
could cause some soil disturbance which would result in erosion depending on the soil type and slopes.
Erosion will be addressed by soil RPMs, (see Chapter 2) that retain as much available cover as possible,
and can be increased where cover is lacking through lop and scatter of retained woody debris or
mastication. Erosion will be minimized by keeping mechanical equipment on roads where possible,
minimizing dragging of logs, and using existing skid-trails and landings. Tilling and mulching landings
and main skid-trails up to 200 feet from landings will address compaction, erosion, and increase available
soil moisture. Water-barring all skid-trails will reduce erosion.
Soil Fertility
The topsoil in the areas in this project that burned at high and moderate severity often sustained damage.
For these reasons remaining topsoil is protected from displacement and compaction in the project RPMs.
Minimizing displacement and puddling in shallow soils will protect topsoil.
Dark Rocky soils have subsoil nutrient deficiencies. Total soil resiliency shows Dark Rocky, Goulding,
Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils as having the lowest resistance to damage from disturbance due
to depth and textures (Table 4 – Physical Science Report and Figure 3- 14 through Figure 3- 19). These
soils have RPMs to insure that their soil productivity will not be compromised.
Burning
Soils were damaged during the 2015 fires and soil cover was reduced. Recruitment of woody debris from
available salvage slash or hazard tree falling and treating of fuels (branches and tree tops) by lop-andscatter or mastication would mitigate some of these fire effects. The increased soil cover should help to
curb erosion and provide for soil nutrient return and retention of soil carbon. (Rust 2015, Uselman 2012).
Conclusions
Soil effects of salvage logging, lop-and-scatter, machine piling, hand pile & burn and mastication are
listed in Table 3-60.

Treatment

Effects on Soil

Machine pile & burn

Possible topsoil displacement and compaction but if done when soils are
dry and using a brush-rake, effects are minimized. Concentrations can
burn hot if piles are large with large logs, but are typically only spotty and
create mosaic burn patterns.
Small concentrated piles, decompose more slowly, concentrations can
burn hot if piles are large with large logs, but are typically only spotty and
create mosaic burn patterns.
Concentrated areas of fuel consumed can be hot but are limited on the
landscape, are mosaic, and do not increase overland erosion.
Fuel rearrangement. Increased soil cover, temperature, moisture and
microbe activity. Possible short-term Carbon/Nitrogen imbalance if too
much material is incorporated into soil.
In unburned areas it can be effective in reducing fuels by creating mosaic
burns that leaves adequate soil cover while reducing fuel loads. This
treatment would only be used initially in areas that have high soil cover
and high levels of woody debris; available woody debris and soil cover will
be retained in areas that burned at high severity.

With soil RPMs in place, there will be only minor impacts on soils within the soil resource bounding area
(treatment units). Impacts to soils are within the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan Soil
Quality Standards thresholds. This project will maintain soil productivity, and will adequately protect
soils from erosion, compaction, burning and displacement.
Cumulative Effects
By focusing on the soil quality standards and considering past, present, proposed, and future activities,
cumulative effects can be evaluated for each alternative within the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and
Salvage Project treatment units. See Appendix G-Cumulative Effects Table) or a complete list of all past,
present, and future actions within Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project area. Because
the resource analysis bounding for soils is the areas directly impacted by the project (the road buffers),
there are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break
maintenance but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils); however, the
fires had negative impacts on soils in the analysis area and have been included in this cumulative effects
analysis.
With mitigations and erosion control measures implemented with this project, cumulative erosion will be
slightly elevated but will go to background levels after 5 to 10 years. This is shown with the WEPP
erosion rates (Table 14-Physical Sciences Report), which shows calculated surface erosion rates (WEPP
erosion model)106 for predevelopment conditions, severe wildfire, and post-harvest recovery rates. Erosion
from severe wildfire for typical soils within the project area (Neuns – rocky soil, and Holland – finetextured soil) are both very high. However, if the sites’ available slash component and the soil surface
roughness coefficient are increased (similar to green tree removal treatments – GTR), then soil erosion is
significantly reduced (30 to 40 tons/acre of erosion for untreated burned areas down to 2 to 6 tons/acre of
erosion for treated areas). Untreated skid-trails have high erosion rates (25 to 40 tons/acre of erosion), but
when water-barred and mulched, soil erosion is again significantly reduced (0.5 to 1 ton/acre). The same
holds true for landings that are bare (1 ton/acre) vs. mulched (<0.5 tons/acre).

106 The

Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) soil erosion model was developed by an interagency group of scientists
including the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service, Forest Service, the Dept.
of Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and US Geological Survey. Scientists from these agencies throughout the United States
have been working since 1985 to develop this erosion prediction model to replace the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) for
various land management activities (timber harvesting, roads, grazing, fuel reduction plans, prescribed fire and wildfire).

245

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Hillside erosion of salvage logging and thinning are generally minimal due to adequate logging slash. The
main areas where erosion is of concern are roads and skid-trails. With proper erosion control, these effects
can be mitigated and reduced to acceptable levels. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly
mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the
fire that would not be treated.

Alternative 2
Direct Effects
Effects are similar to Alternative 1 except on a larger scale (~9,500 acres) and a set treatment distance
(150 feet on either side) instead of a variable treatment width and strategic fuelbreaks on certain road
segments (1200 feet total width, 600 on either side of the road). This alternative will utilize two miles of
unauthorized roads as temporary roads, and create one mile of new temporary roads. Old unauthorized
roads have had time to partially recover by trees growing on them, and soils being partially decompacted
over time by tree roots. Any recovery will be halted with additional displacement for newer larger
equipment and increased compaction, resetting the recovery process. Also, new temporary roads will be
created displacing and compacting soils.
The larger fuelbreaks will create an additional 16 miles of possible mechanical thinning that could cause
additional erosion, displacement, compaction and puddling off the main roads.
The use of unauthorized roads and creation of new temporary roads is acceptable according to the Forest
Plan as long as no more than 15% of the harvest unit is dedicated to non-productive purposes such as
roads, skid-trails, and landings (Forest Plan, page 4-25). Soil RPMs of subsoiling and mulching
temporary roads will address this issue along with other impacts to soils from mechanical thinning and
burning similar to Alternative 1. With adherence to the soil RPMs, direct impacts will be minor and
nonsignificant.
Burned areas that will be treated are areas where trees are dead and most soil cover has been removed by
the fire. In these areas, soil cover replacement would slow erosion and preserve the topsoil (Figure 3- 20
and Figure 3- 21). Unburned and lightly burned areas that will be treated by thinning (in the fuelbreaks)
and mastication, machine piling or hand treatments, and burning; preservation of existing soil cover and
topsoil will occur as part of the RPMs. Benefits of prescribed burning include return of nutrients to the
soil while providing adequate cover due to low burn severity. Adhering to the soil RPMs will insure all
available soil cover will be utilized to protect critical topsoil. Soils susceptible to compaction,
displacement, puddling and burning will be protected by soil RPMs (see Appendix D of the Soils Section
of the Physical Sciences Report for the Resource Protection Measures specific to soil resources).
Indirect Effects
The effects regarding erosion are similar to the Proposed Action due to the lack of cover from the fires
and compaction from mechanical operations. Besides compaction creating more overland flow and
erosion, less water penetrates the soil which reduces available water holding capacity. These effects will
be minimized by adherence to the RPMs described in Chapter 2.
Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter and mastication treatments would reduce
erosion. The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for
untreated areas and 2 tons/acre for treated areas. For roads, it increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6
tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background levels. Hillside sediment reduction
due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11- Physical Sciences Report). These positive soil effects
would occur over a larger area than the Proposed Action due to the larger area treated under this
alternative.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Cumulative Effects
Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of increased
temporary roads and additional fuel breaks. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when
combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some
of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would
not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel
break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the
long-term reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits.

Alternative 3
Direct Effects
Direct effects of Alternative 3 will have the potential for greater impacts to soils over Alternatives 1 and
2. Soil effects will be similar to Alternative 1 except a larger footprint would be treated due to the larger
roadside buffer. Hazard tree treatments plus mechanical harvesting plus fuel reduction treatments plus
fuel maintenance in 10 to 15 years could have direct effects on some of the more sensitive soils (see
Alternative 1 for a discussion of the sensitive soil types). These soils will have soil RPMs to insure that
their productivity will be protected and not compromised
Alternative 3 could cause more erosion, compaction, displacement, and puddling than Alternatives 1 and
2 due to the larger footprint for mechanical equipment operations off the main road, especially temporary
roads. Additional displacement and compaction would occur, requiring sub-soiling and mulching as per
the soil RPMs. This larger treatment area in severely burned landscapes that already lacks soil cover will
be more prone to erosion than Alternatives 1 and 2.
Indirect Effects
This alternative could cause more compaction and overland flow due to the larger footprint of treatments,
leading to more erosion and less water infiltration into the soil. More temporary roads will lead to more
displacement of topsoil and reduced fertility of the soils. To minimize these effects, adherence to the soil
RPMs will be required.
Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter and mastication treatments would reduce
erosion. The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for
untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated (Figure 3- 20 and Figure 3- 21). For roads it increases from 7.5
tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background. Hillside
sediment reduction due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences Report). These
positive soil effects would occur over a larger area than Alternatives 1 and 2 due to the larger area treated
under this alternative.
Cumulative Effects
Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of increased
temporary roads and area treated. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when combined
with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some of the fire
impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would not be
treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel break
maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the longterm reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits.

Alternative 4
Direct Effects
This alternative reduces direct impacts to soils compared to Alternatives 1-3 due to the reduced area of
mechanical disturbance. Acres providing important habitat for the northern spotted owl would only have
hazard trees felled and not removed. Along with providing soil cover, nutrients in the felled trees will be
247

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

in direct contact with the soil hastening the return of nutrients to the soil. The project RPMs will ensure
that these soils and their productivity will be protected and not compromised.
Outside of sensitive NSO locations, treatments would be the same as Alternative 1 except on a smaller
scale. In areas harvested, the combination of hazard tree treatments plus mechanical harvesting plus fuel
reduction treatments plus fuel maintenance in 10 to 15 years could have direct effects on some of the
more sensitive soils, but these impacts will be less than Alternatives 1-3 due to reductions in areas treated.
Treatment effects will be minimized by adherence to the soil RPMs.
Indirect Effects
Areas treated with hazard tree felling only will be more prone to destructive wildfires in the future. This
could negatively affect soils if they are burned at high intensity, further reducing their productivity. This
would cause additional water-repellency, especially in granitic soils, which would lead to increased
overland flows and erosion. These areas will be even more susceptible to high intensity fire over time due
to brush growing between felled trees, further heightening high severity fire hazards.
Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter, mastication, and hazard tree felling would
reduce erosion (Figure 3- 20 and Figure 3- 21). The average amount of erosion reduction for this
alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated. For roads it increases
from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background.
Hillside sediment reduction due to more cover after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences
Report).
Indirect effects of erosion due to displacement and compaction will be less than the Proposed Action due
to fewer timber harvest acres and reduced fuel reduction treatments. Less displacement and compaction
reduces impacts, but because these areas are already burned, increased soil cover from treatments is an
important tool for reducing erosion. With fewer thinning and mastication acres, fewer acres of increased
soil cover will be realized.
The most sensitive soils (Dark Rocky, Goulding, Granitic, Scree, and Shallow Rocky soils) will be
protected and not compromised by adhering to the RPMs, any indirect impacts will be minor and
nonsignificant for this alternative.
Cumulative Effects
Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of reduced
timber harvest and fuels reduction treatments. These additive direct and indirect effects are minor when
combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments may slightly mitigate some
of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large footprint of the fire that would
not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils analysis area (reforestation and fuel
break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the
long-term reforestation will provide additional soil stabilization benefits.

Alternative 5
Direct Effects
With this alternative, there will be fewer direct impacts to soils than any of the other alternatives. This
alternative includes no salvage and fuels reduction treatments would only occur outside of Riparian
Reserves, Inventoried Roadless Areas, At-Risk Watersheds, and important NSO habitat. In areas with
hazard tree felling only, along with providing soil cover, nutrients in the felled trees will be in direct
contact with the soil hastening the return of nutrients to the soil.
This alternative only treats hazard trees and fuels, so there will be very little impact to the soils except in
fuel treatment zones. Fuel treatment options vary depending on the site, but the goal is to increase soil
cover by using available woody material (Figure 3- 20 and Figure 3- 21). Direct impacts to soils include
masticating, hand-piling and pile burning, then later maintenance burning. With adherence to soil RPMs
248

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

only minor impacts to soils will be realized. Minor direct and indirect effects from this alternative are well
below SQS listed in the Forest Plan.
Areas outside of the sensitive areas mentioned above will have fuel reduction treatments including
mastication, hand-piling, chipping, or future broadcast burning. The direct effects of this alternative will
be less than the effects of the other alternatives due to the lack of salvage and the smaller scale of fuels
reduction treatments. Impacts of current treatments and future treatments (such as maintenance burning)
will be minimized by application of the RPMs.
Indirect Effects
Areas with only hazard tree felling treatments will be more prone to high severity fires in the future. This
could affect soils by burning them at high intensity and further reducing their productivity. This would
cause additional water-repellency especially in granitic soils, which would lead to increased overland
flows.
Increases in the amount of soil cover from lop and scatter, mastication, and hazard tree felling would
reduce erosion. The average amount of erosion reduction for this alternative vs. no action, is 4 tons/acre
for untreated and 2 tons/acre for treated. For roads it increases from 7.5 tons/mile to 13.6 tons/mile during
harvest, and after harvest it drops back to background. Hillside sediment reduction due to more cover
after treatment is 40% (Table 11-Physical Sciences Report).
Cumulative Effects
Direct and indirect effects of this alternative are similar to Alternative 1 with the exception of no timber
harvest related effects and fewer acres of fuels reduction treatments. These additive direct and indirect
effects are minor when combined with the effects of the fire. The increased soil cover from treatments
may slightly mitigate some of the fire impacts, but these effects would be minor compared to the large
footprint of the fire that would not be treated. There are minor foreseeable future actions in the soils
analysis area (reforestation and fuel break maintenance) but these actions are minor and are not
significant cumulative impacts to soils. In the long-term reforestation will provide additional soil
stabilization benefits.

Alternative 6 (No Action)
Direct and Indirect Effects
Under the No Action Alternative, no fuel reduction or hazard tree treatments would be implemented to
accomplish project goals. There would be no new disturbance resulting from forest management
activities, and existing disturbance would persist. No new adverse effects would result from this action
but in some locations productivity potential in the short term may not be as high under this alternative as
compared to the action alternatives because past disturbance (fire and storm damage) would not be
alleviated through increases in soil cover. Hydrologic function, such as soil drainage, would be
maintained at existing rates.
Under the No Action Alternative, the remaining forest canopy would not be altered and remaining organic
material covering the soil would not be disturbed by management. Soil cover standards would continue to
not be met and the litter/duff layer would very slowly increase over time. As a result, erosion hazards
would likely remain high due to lack of effective cover on the ground.
Coarse woody debris levels would increase over time as fire-killed trees fall. The probability of a highseverity fire within the project area during a given timeframe is unpredictable. However, when a fire
breaks out, the chances for high-severity fire effects on soils can be much higher in areas with excessively
heavy fuel loads compared to those that have been treated (Certini, 2005; Cram and others, 2006;
Gorman, 2003; Keane and others, 2002). Monitoring of prescribed fire after the fires of 2008 showed the
benefits of treating fuels with prescribed fire and their effects on soil vs. untreated fuels and wildfire
effects on soil (Rust, 2010).
249

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Future high-intensity wildfire would increase the potential for additional impacts to soils and soil
productivity in areas that were severely burned in 2015, especially since the risk of soil erosion increases
proportionally with fire intensity (Megahan, 1990). Other effects would include the additional loss of
organics, loss of nutrients, and reduced water infiltration (Wells et al. 1979). Fires that create very high
soil surface temperatures, particularly when soil moisture content is low, almost completely destroy soil
microbial populations, woody debris, and the protective duff and litter layer over mineral soil
(Hungerford, 1991; Neary and others, 2005). Nutrients stored in the organic layer (such as potassium and
nitrogen) can also be lost or reduced through volatilization and as fly ash (DeBano, 1991; Amaranthus
and others, 1989).
Fire-induced soil hydrophobicity is presumed to be a primary cause of the observed post-fire increases in
runoff and erosion from forested watersheds (Huffman and others, 2001). Though hydrophobicity is a
naturally occurring phenomenon that can be found on the mineral soil surface, it is greatly amplified by
increased burn severity (Neary et al., 2005). The storms of 2012 in the Bagley fire caused extensive sheet
and rill erosion six to twelve inches deep due to water repellency at that depth (Rust, 2013).
Soil hydrophobicity usually returns to pre-burn conditions in no more than six years (DeBano, 1981).
Dyrness (1976) and other studies have documented a much more rapid recovery of one to three years
(Huffman and others, 2001). The persistence of a hydrophobic layer depends on the strength and extent of
hydrophobic chemicals after burning and the many physical and biological factors that can aid in
breakdown (DeBano, 1981). This variability means that post-fire impacts on watershed conditions are
difficult to predict and to quantify. In the case of the fires that burned during 2015 in this project area, two
to three years water repellency is expected due to the higher elevations in the burned area.
In the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Salvage Project case, the areas to be treated are the areas that had
moderate to severe vegetative burn severity. With this project, these burned areas would be beneficially
impacted by increased soil cover to reduce erosion from foreseeable winter storms in the next two to five
years; these beneficial effects would not be realized under this alternative.
Cumulative Effects
Because there are no direct or indirect effects of the No Action Alternative, there are no cumulative
effects; however, increasing coarse woody debris over time from fire killed trees could result in additional
high intensity wildfires which would cumulatively negatively impact soils that have already been
damaged by fire.

Soils and Climate Change

Climate change is responsible for major ecological changes such as: 1) decreased snowpack; 2) increasing
rains; 3) increasing temperatures; 4) vegetative shifts to higher elevations; 5) lower elevation vegetation
taking over higher elevation ranges and extending its range. These shifts are causing changes in soil
respiration due to different vegetation and microbial populations that are exacerbated by wildfires, urban
sprawl, and management of fuel (thinning, clearcuts, mastication, and burning). All of these factors can
cause a shift of soil carbon by shifting vegetation types that influence soil microbes with different carbon
sequestrating rates and abilities.
To say one fuels project does not contribute any significant amount of CO2 is like saying a car does not
contribute any significant amount of CO2 gas to the atmosphere. But millions of cars are a different story.
The same could be said with all of the fuel projects on the forest, the state, and across the nation, they add
up cumulatively and do have an effect on the CO2 levels and the soil carbon pools. Yes, we need to
reduce the fuels to reduce catastrophic effects of wildfires. But we also need to do it in a controlled
incremental way and we also need to acknowledge the small but cumulative effects of doing so.
Soils are the largest pool of organic carbon, which is essential for mitigating and adapting to climate
change. In an era of water scarcity, soils are fundamental for its appropriate storage and distribution. The
soils of the world, with the biota they support, are major absorbers, depositories, and releasers of organic
250

Final Environmental Impact Statement

carbon. Soils altogether contain an estimated 1,700 Gt (billion metric tons) to a depth of 1 meter and as
much as 2,400 Gt to a depth of 2 meters. An estimated additional 560 Gt is contained in terrestrial biota
(plants and animals). In contrast, the carbon in the atmosphere is estimated to total 750 Gt. Thus, the
amount of organic carbon in soils is more than four times the amount of carbon in terrestrial biota and
three times that in the atmosphere. The content of organic carbon in soils in most cases constitutes less
than 5% of the mass of soil material and is generally concentrated mainly in the upper 20 to 40 cm (the
so-called topsoil).
What processes release soil carbon from sequestration? Well, anything that disrupts soil structure such as
tillage, compaction, and erosion are a disruption of soil structure. Increases in soil temperature can release
soil carbon from sequestration. Soil degradation (resulting from burning of vegetative cover, tillage,
erosion, leaching, pollution, compaction, salination, and/or other processes) diminishes the capacity of
soils to fully recover their original state.
The potential of soils to sequester carbon is intimately associated with the content and nature of their clay
fraction. Sandy soils, which tend to be well aerated and have little adsorptive capacity, generally retain
little organic matter. Clayey soils, on the other hand, form strong physicochemical bonds between the
active surfaces of the clay particles and the organic macromolecules of humus, which thus become
resistant to further decay. Moreover, clayey soils tend to form tight water-resistant aggregates, the
interiors of which restrict aeration and further resist the decay of occluded organic matter. Whenever soil
aggregates are disrupted by mechanical tillage, soil structure is prone to deteriorate and soil organic
matter tends to decompose more rapidly.
Granitic sandy soils occur in various plutonic bodies (around 20% of the area) in the project treatment
units (see soils maps). The rest are loamy to clayey soils with high levels of soil organic matter (SOM).
Soil resources protection measures will protect sensitive granitic soils from degradation and reduce the
loss of SOM from the topsoil.
Decayed downed large woody debris (LWD) provide little soil carbon but are hubs for mycorrhizal fungi
since LWD that is decayed and rotten and has high moisture holding capacity due to brown rot (high in
lignin that holds water) (Busse, 1994), SSAJ. Spears et al. (2003), found decayed organic C and N
leachates higher under decaying logs but soil C or N was not higher than control plots that lacked LWD
and gross N mineralization was higher in open areas. Powers et al.. (1994) found mycorrhizal root tips in
soil and brown rot in LWD was about twice the density but soil carbon and N levels in the soil below
LWD was less than areas adjacent to LWD. They showed decayed LWD contributes little to soil carbon or
nitrogen and most of it was used by the mycorrhizal fungi to grow. This does have an indirect benefit to
adjacent trees since mycorrhizal fungi do help tree extend their ability to extract minerals from the soil for
their growth.
Microbial communities feed off the organic matter, duff, litter, and decaying roots that make carbon
available for plant uptake and storage. Yes logging can raise soil temperatures by reducing canopy and in
some cases (most notably in clearcuts) increase soil respiration. Clearcut units are limited in this project
with most of the treatments as thinning so soil efflux rates (CO2 release) will be much less. During the
winter so little respiration will happen and during the spring it will spike and decreases into the summer
through the fall due to low soil moisture. So any significant contribution happens in spikes (bursts) due to
warm moist soils (spring conditions). So overall contributions will be sporadic and very low for the whole
project. In comparison to the areas that burned this project only represents a small contribution to soil
efflux. Climate change to soils within this project is not expected to change soil carbon pools significantly
and is not an issue for the size of this project in comparison to the larger fire scars and the RPMs being
implemented.

Botany
Background
Categories of Botanical Species of Concern

Current management direction requires conservation of several categories of plants on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest.
Threatened and Endangered species are those listed and protected under the Endangered Species Act
of 1973. Forest Service Manual 2670 (eff. 9/23/2005) provides direction for conservation and
recovery of threatened and endangered species. There are no federally listed threatened or endangered
plant species on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Appendix A-1of the Botany Biological Evaluation provides the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife list of
known or potential Threatened and Endangered botanical species from the proposed project area
(04/27/2016 extract). Hoover’s spurge (Euphorbia hooveri syn. Chamaesyce hooveri), Mcdonald’s
rock cress (Arabis mcdonaldiana) and slender orcutt grass (Orcuttia tenuis) are identified as having
potential to be present within the project area, but there are no documented populations of any of the
species and all grow in geographic regions that are not similar to those in Trinity County or in the
project area.
Sensitive species are those vascular plant, bryophyte, lichen, and fungi species, of whose viability is
of concern. Field surveys to determine if populations are present in a proposed project area are
encouraged, but not required by law, regulation, or policy. Direction for protection and management
of Sensitive species is provided in Forest Service Manual 2670. Sensitive species will be protected
from management actions to avoid a loss of viability and prevent a trend toward federal listing. The
Region 5 Sensitive Plant List was updated and signed by the Regional Forester on July 3, 2013.
Sensitive species known from the west side of the Forest are identified in Appendix A-2 of the Botany
Biological Evaluation and analyzed in the Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences
sections of this document. Appendix A-2 of the Botany Biological Evaluation assesses the potential
for individual Sensitive species to be present within the project area based on a variety of factors,
including habitat characteristics, geographic location, elevation, plant community composition, soil
mineralogy and characteristics, and water.
Forest Plan Endemic species are species confined wholly or mostly to the Shasta-Trinity National
Forest. These species are not currently on the Regional Forester’s Sensitive species list, but are
afforded the same protection as Sensitive species by direction in the Shasta-Trinity Land and
Resource Management Plan (USDA, 1995a). If present within a project area, these species are
addressed in the Botany Evaluation in Appendix B-1, Botany Specialist Report, Forest Plan Endemic
Species.
Survey and Manage species are rare or uncommon species associated with late-seral conifer forest
habitat and are designated on the 2001 Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for
Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures, Standards
and Guidelines (USDA, 2001a). Most recently, the designated species list was updated to reflect
results of Annual Species Reviews up to 2003. These species are to be managed to avoid significantly
negative impacts to their habitat or persistence on individual sites and management requirements are
somewhat different than those for Sensitive species. Survey and Manage species are addressed in the
Botany Evaluation in Appendix B-2, Botany Specialist Report, Survey and Manage Species.
Noxious Weeds are invasive, non-native plant species that threaten ecosystem integrity and the health
of native plant communities. Forest Service Manual FSM 2080 and the 2001 Northern Province
Noxious and Invasive Weeds Program Strategy (USDA, 2001b) provide direction for management of

252

Final Environmental Impact Statement

noxious weeds, including a risk assessment for all proposed actions. Noxious weeds are addressed in
the Botany Evaluation in Appendix B-4, Botany Specialist Report, Noxious Weed Risk Assessment.

Authorities: Direction and Policy

Several laws, regulations, and policies describe requirements and recommendations for developing
proposed action to insure they won’t harm protected botanical species enough to warrant listing them as
threatened or endangered. These include direction for conducting environmental analysis and designing
proposed actions to minimize harm to protected botanical species. Authorities related to botany are shown
below.
Forest Service Manual 2670 Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Plants and Animals (FSM
2670).
FSM 2670.11. Section 5 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, directs the Secretary of
Agriculture to "establish and implement a program to conserve fish, wildlife, and plants," including
federally listed species.
FSM 2670.12. Forest Service departmental regulation 9500-4 directs the Forest Service to:
2. Conduct activities and programs "to assist in the identification and recovery of threatened and
endangered plant and animal species."
3. Avoid actions "which may cause a species to become threatened or endangered."
FSM 2670.22. Sensitive Species
1. Develop and implement management practices to ensure that species do not become threatened
or endangered because of Forest Service actions.
2. Maintain viable populations of all native and desired nonnative wildlife, fish, and plant species
in habitats distributed throughout their geographic range on National Forest System lands.
3. Develop and implement management objectives for populations and/or habitat of Sensitive
species.
FSM 2670.32 Sensitive Species
2. Review programs and activities as part of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
process through a biological evaluation, to determine their potential effect on Sensitive species.
3. Avoid or minimize impacts to species whose viability has been identified as a concern.
4. Analyze, if impacts cannot be avoided, the significance of potential adverse effects on the
population or its habitat within the area of concern and on the species as a whole. (The line
officer, with project approval authority, makes the decision to allow or disallow impact, but the
decision must not result in loss of species viability or create significant trends toward federal
listing.)
FSM 1950.1 National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321-4346).
NEPA requires Federal agencies to:
b. Consider the environmental impact of proposed actions;
c. Identify adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided should the proposal be
implemented.
Forestwide Standards & Guidelines for Sensitive & Endemic Plants (Forest Plan 4-14).
Standards and Guidelines applicable at the project level are:

253

4a. Map, record, and protect essential habitat for known and newly discovered Sensitive and
Forest Plan Endemic species until conservation strategies are developed.
4b. Analyze the potential effects of all ground-disturbing projects on Sensitive and Forest Plan
Endemic plants and their habitats. Mitigate project effects to avoid a decline in species viability at
the National Forest level.
4c. Monitor the effects of management activities on Sensitive and Forest Plan Endemic plants. If
monitoring results show a decline in species viability, alter management strategy.
Summary of Management Area Direction
Management Area 14-New River/North Fork/Canyon Creek. Canyon Creek stonecrop is identified as
potentially being present. Currently, populations of five Sensitive species are known from Management
Area 14. No specific management direction or supplemental management direction is provided for
Sensitive plants.
Management Area 15-Trinity River. No specific management direction or supplemental management
direction is provided for Sensitive plants. At the time of Forest Plan publication no Sensitive plants were
documented here, but currently populations of seven Sensitive species are documented within this
management area.
Management Area 16-Corral Bottom. The northern portion of the South Fire Complex falls within
Management Area 16. No specific or supplemental management direction is provided for species that are
currently on the Sensitive Species list, but Howell’s lewisia (Lewisia cotyledon howellii), a species
removed from the Sensitive Species list before 1998, is mentioned. While Howell’s lewisia no longer
requires additional protection measures to maintain species viability, it remains relatively unimpacted
because of its natural habitat on rock outcrops. Management actions rarely occur on rock outcrops
because of the potential for equipment damage. Populations of four Sensitive species are documented
here.
Management Area 17-Hayfork Creek. No specific management direction is provided for any current
Sensitive species, but the presence of Niles’ harmonia (Harmonia doris-nileseae) is noted. Howell’s
lewisia (Lewisia cotyledon ssp. howellii) and Pale yellow stonecrop (Sedum laxum ssp. flavidum), are also
mentioned, but both were removed from the Regional Forester’s Sensitive Species list before 1998. As in
Management Area 16, while both species no longer require additional protection measures to maintain
species viability, they remain relatively unimpacted because of its natural habitat on rock outcrops.
Management actions rarely occur on rock outcrops because of the potential for equipment damage. There
is supplemental management direction to search suitable habitat for Niles’ harmonia. Populations of three
Sensitive species are documented within this management area.
Management Area 18-Hayfork. The Forest Plan indicates Tracy’s wooly-stars (Eriastrum tracyi) and
Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei) as being present here and identifies the presence of habitat for Niles’
harmonia (Harmonia doris-nileseae). No specific management direction is given for Sensitive plants, but
there is supplemental management direction to survey for additional Niles’ harmonia populations.
Populations of six Sensitive and one Forest Plan Endemic plant species have been documented in this
management area. There is supplemental direction to protect rock outcrops from excavation until surveys
for pale yellow stonecrop can be completed.
Management Area 19-Indian Valley/Rattlesnake. The Forest Plan indicates Peanut sandwort (Minuartia
rosei) and Niles’ harmonia are present here and states the entire geographic range of Niles’s harmonia is
contained in this management area (additional populations have since been found outside this
management area in Management Area 21). This management area lies within the Rattlesnake Creek
Terrane, a geologic area rich in serpentine plant species. No specific management direction is given for
Sensitive plants, but there is supplemental management direction to survey for additional Niles’ harmonia
populations, protect the type localities of Niles’ harmonia and pale yellow stonecrop (no longer a

Regional Forester’s sensitive species, but still State-listed as a regional endemic) for their scientific value,
and protect rock outcrops from excavation until they have been surveyed for pale yellow stonecrop. Since
publication of the Forest Plan populations of seven Sensitive and two Forest Plan Endemic plant species
have been documented. Smoky Creek Research Natural Area is recommended for establishment. Maintain
Dubakella Mountain in its present condition pending evaluation as a Special Interest Area.
Management Area 20-South Fork Mountain. This management area contains some of the heaviest
concentrations of late-successional forest communities on the Forest. Rough Gulch Research Natural Area
is within this management area. The Forest Plan states that Umpqua green gentian (Frasera umpquaensis)
and pale yellow stonecrop (Sedum laxum ssp. flavidum) have been identified in this management area;
pale yellow stonecrop was removed from the Regional Forester’s Sensitive species list before 1998
though it retains California Rare Plant status as a regional endemic. The Forest Plan also notes great
botanical diversity on the east side of South Fork Mountain, most notable in a series of springs and fens
possibly emerging at South Fork or Bear Wallow fault lines (2010 California Dept. of Conservation Fault
Activity Map). No specific management direction is given botanical species, but the presence of unique
meadow habitats is acknowledged. There is supplemental management direction to evaluate the meadow
areas on the east side to determine if cattle grazing is resulting in decreased biodiversity of plant
communities, and implement mitigation efforts if necessary. Though not mentioned in the Forest Plan, an
extensive infestation of diffuse knapweed is found in this management area; it is most concentrated on the
South Fork Mountain ridgeline and has spread east as far as the South Fork of the Trinity River. Three
Sensitive species have been documented here.
Management Area 21-Wildwood. This management area lies within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and
includes the Western Azalea Special Interest Area. The Forest Plan indicates that Management Area 21
includes the center of distribution for Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei) and Stebbins’ harmonia
(Harmonia stebbinsii) is in this management area. No supplemental direction for botany is given.
Populations of seven Sensitive plant species and two Forest Plan Endemic species have been documented
in this management area.

Sensitive Species

This section will review the proposed Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project to
determine whether the proposed action would result in a trend toward Federal listing of any Sensitive
vascular plant, lichen, bryophyte or fungi species, as designated by the Region 5 Sensitive Species List
(USDA, 2013b) FSM2672.4 Biological Evaluations directs that biological evaluations and assessments
analyze impacts to Endangered, Threatened, Proposed, or Sensitive species. There are no federally listed
threatened or endangered plant species on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.

Resource Protection Measures and Project Design Features to Protect
Botanical Species of Concern
Species Protections
After identification of known Sensitive species population and assessment of the most appropriate
management measures, all plant populations requiring protection from proposed treatments will be
flagged on the ground, and some or all treatments may be excluded within those populations. These sites
will be shown on project implementation maps as control areas.
If individuals of protected species are discovered after project implementation begins, all off-road grounddisturbing operations will be stopped temporarily in the area of discovery until a Forest Service Botanist
or qualified representative recommends appropriate protection measures. This measure will be
incorporated into the project design through a contract provision or similar language in any service
contracts.

255

Western Waterfan Lichen
Stream crossings, rocked or otherwise, will not be constructed on Collins Creek or any of its tributaries
known to be occupied by Goward’s waterfan lichen to avoid potential damage to the species.
Niles’ and Stebbins’ Harmonia
When using heavy equipment with blades, ditches may be cleaned without restriction up to 24 inches in
height above the ditch bottom in the area of known Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia populations or their
mapped habitat. Above 24 inches, vegetation that obstructs vehicle line of sight will be manually cut and
removed without disturbing the roadside.
Pacific Fuzzwort
Standard provisions for protection of residual trees will be included in all implementation contracts or
agreements to avoid accidental scraping of potential Pacific fuzzwort mats at the base of host trees.
Operations shall not unnecessarily damage young growth or other trees to be reserved.
Umpqua Green Gentian
Handline construction will not occur within known populations of Umpqua green gentian. Heavy
equipment use will be excluded from grassy or gravelly openings within late-seral conifer forest.
Canyon Creek Stonecrop
Trees will be directionally felled away from rock outcrops or exposed bedrock greater than 10 feet in
diameter.
Habitat Protections
The following protections are incorporated within the Project’s Resource Protection Measures and the
resource prescriptions.
Heavy Equipment Use
Heavy equipment operations will be excluded from within known Sensitive botanical populations.
Locations will be flagged on the ground and marked as control areas on operational maps.
Machine piling will be restricted to landings and areas of pre-fire heavy soil disturbance, except where
field surveys are conducted and absence of Sensitive botanical species is verified.
When using tractors to remove felled trees, material will be skidded with one end suspended wherever
possible to minimize soil gouging and potential damage to potential unidentified Sensitive botanical
species.
Soil Quality Protection Measures for Protection of Botanical Habitat
Post-treatment total soil cover should be no less than 50% where it exists prior to treatments, averaged
across individual treatment areas. This maintains organic matter on the soil to reduce soil drying and
provide nutrients for plant growth.
Mechanical skidding equipment is generally restricted to slopes less than 40 percent. On short steep
pitches (less than 45% slope, and less than 100 ft. in length), mechanical skidding equipment is restricted
to slash covered primary skid trails using flexible track skidders with low ground pressure equipment.
Wet weather logging is permitted on soils with compaction hazard rating of moderate or less with
restrictions (see Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust
2015) and Shasta-Trinity Wet Weather Soil Compaction Hazard Rating (Rust 2008)).
Ground-based mechanical equipment will only operate on fine-textured soils (identified as medium and
heavy soils in the Field Guide to Soil Moisture Conditions for Operability of Logging Equipment (Rust

2015) when the top 8 inches of soil are dry (identified as slightly moist soils in the Field Guide), as
evaluated by Forest soil scientist or designee. Areas along roads proposed for treatments that have this
soil type will be identified on a map for use by the Timber Sale Administrator.
Burning
Burning prescriptions will be developed to result in no more than 10% mortality of residual live trees 20
inches DBH or greater in late-seral habitats.
Serpentine Habitats and Species
In general, management and protection measures correspond to three broad serpentine habitat
descriptions, Types 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant
different management requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site and these are
described below. Hazard trees will be felled where found in all serpentine habitats, regardless of the type.
Type 1 and Type 2 serpentine sites will be identified on project implementation maps as control areas. See
the Botany Biological Evaluation for Type 1, 2, and 3 habitat characteristics.

Affected Environment (Sensitive Species)
Reference Materials and Methods
Resources used to assess habitat for botanical species of concern were corporate GIS database
information, documented population records, field surveys, botanical studies, taxonomic keys, and field
visits in the project area. Plant community information is derived from CalVeg data107 and informal field
visits in the area between 1999 and 2011.
Field Surveys
Because of the extensive area and urgency of the purpose and need, additional field surveys were not
completed for this analysis. Some past field surveys have been completed within the fire areas, but these
are not enough to make confident conclusions about presence or absence of Sensitive plant populations.
Without complete field survey data, Sensitive botanical species are assumed to be present where suitable
habitat is present. Project design features and resource protection measures are incorporated into the
design of the action alternatives to reduce potential impacts in suitable habitat and minimize the chance of
leading to a trend toward federal listing as a result of implementing the project.
Project Area Habitat and Suitability for Sensitive Species
Data are unavailable for areas other than National Forest System (NFS) lands therefore this analysis is for
NFS lands only. Impact analysis is for the geographic extent of proposed treatments, although
consideration is given to surrounding habitats.
The six fire areas are spread out over two ecological sections, the Route and Mad River Complexes within
the Northern California Coast Ranges Section and the Fork, River, Saddle, and South Complexes within
the Klamath Mountains Section (USDA, 1997). Subtle differences in amount of annual precipitation and
landslide incidence exist between the two sections, but in general they are very similar in ecological
character and both are heavily influenced by a Mediterranean climate of winter precipitation and extended
summer drought (Barbour, et al., 2007).
Plant communities in the project area are dominated by conifer, hardwood, and mixed conifer/hardwood
forest, intermixed with chaparral shrublands. Within conifer forest, all seral stages are represented within
The CALVEG classification is a provisional system that meets the floristically based level of the National Vegetation
Classification Standard hierarchy. These vegetation alliances were originally developed by the Region's Ecology Program in
1978. (USDA Forest Service. 1981). CALVEG: A Classification of California Vegetation. Pacific Southwest Region, Regional
Ecology Group, San Francisco CA. 168 pp). 2010 data was used for this analysis, providing information on vegetation
communities prior to the 2015 fires.

areas that burned at less than high fire intensity. The fires changed the distribution and quantity of early,
mid, and late seral conifer forest. Where high severity fire occurred, mid and late-seral forest has
generally been set back to early-seral forest, increasing available habitat for protected species that require
early seral plant communities and decreasing available habitat for those that require older forest habitat
conditions.
Other plant communities are intermixed with conifer forest in the project area, including hardwood forest,
oak woodlands, montane shrublands, annual grasslands, rock outcrops and barrens, and water bodies.
Serpentine soils are present in all fire complexes and treatment areas. The South, Route, and a small
portion of the Fork Complex are all located within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, a geologic area rich in
serpentine soils. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane provides habitat to several Sensitive and endemic plant
species known only from this area.
Wetland mapping on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is limited in scope. Wetlands are
present in the fire areas, but not within any proposed treatment areas. Hundreds of miles of perennial
streams exist within the fire complexes. Combined with shady forest canopy they provide habitat for
selected Sensitive botanical species. Large rock outcrops are not usually mapped, but are known to be
present and common throughout the Klamath and Northern California Coast Ranges.
Special Area Designations
Research Natural Areas, Special Interest Areas or Other Specially Designated Botanical Areas
There are no established RNAs or botanical SIAs in the any of the fire complexes. Portions of all fires
except the River Complex are found within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, a unique, 375,000 acre
geologic area rich in serpentine soils and endemic plant species. The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane is under
consideration for development of a Special Interest Area based on the high number of serpentine endemic
species, including five Sensitive and two Forest Plan Endemic plant species. The Dubakella Special
Interest Area was established by the Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan, but still requires evaluation for suitability
as a Special Interest Area and boundary designation.
Habitat Suitability within High and Moderate Severity Fire Areas
All fires burned in a mosaic of high, medium, and low severity based on RAVG108 data (Table 3-61).
Based on field observations and summarized Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) and RAVG
imagery data, sites that burned with the highest severity no longer support suitable habitat for protected
botanical species (plants or fungi). On these sites, fire generally and consistently consumed all above
ground vegetation and dead woody debris. Fires that burn in late summer (such as seen in the 2015 fires)
have much higher potential for killing underground roots and mycelial tissue (fungi) than during fires that
start in the spring and early summer because there is less moisture in the soil to buffer fire impacts. As a
result, the relationship between high severity fire and loss of suitable habitat for protected botanical
species is strong. Areas that burned at moderate severity retained some live trees, but generally have a
mix of immediate mortality and live but heavily burned trees and understory that has high likelihood of
deforestation or large pockets of mortality due to fire-injury within the next 5-10 years.
Because of the loss of suitable habitat in areas that burned with moderate to high severity fire, this
analysis will only consider impacts to habitat and species populations within low/very low severity fire
and areas not burned in the fires, with the exception of California globemallow that can be found on sites
that burned within the past 5 years.

Plant Communities Providing Suitable Habitat within Fire Complexes
Areas that didn’t burn in 2015 or burned at low severity have an array of plant communities that have
potential to provide suitable habitat for Sensitive botanical species. All Sensitive species known to be
present or thought to be present on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, based on presence
of suitable habitat and other factors, are shown in the Appendix A-2 of the Botany Biological Evaluation.
Rationale is provided for species that are thought not to have suitable habitat in the project area.
When the geographic area of proposed treatments under all alternatives are combined and overlapping
areas removed, 15,990 acres are contained within the proposed treatment area footprint. Each alternative
contains a unique combination of treatments; explaining why the footprint total exceeds those under the
largest alternative, Alternative 3. Plant communities present within the fires that provide suitable habitat
for protected botanical species are shown in Table 3-62, along with the species they support.
Conifer Forest
Early-Seral Conifer Forest
About 55% of the project area, prior to the 2015 fires, was conifer forest (8,398 acres). 30% of that was
early-seral (2,459 acres). Early-seral conifer habitat is characterized by tree seedlings or saplings or small
trees. There is little or no overstory and shrubs, grasses, and forbs dominate in early-seral habitat. Early
and mid-seral forest provides habitat for California globe mallow (Iliamna latibracteata).
Mature to Late-Seral Forest, Including Uplands and Riparian Stream Channels
60% of the conifer forest in the project area is late seral (4,631 acres). Late-seral forest is characterized by
multi-story stands with large-diameter trees, high species diversity above and below ground, presence of
partially decomposed coarse woody debris, and occasional canopy gaps occupied by early seral species. It
provides habitat for mountain and Brownie lady’s-slippers (Cypripedium montanum, C. fasciculatum),
Umpqua green gentian (Frasera umpquaensis), Pacific fuzzwort (Ptilidium californicum), red-pored
bolete (Boletus pulcherrimus), branched collybia (Dendrocollybia racemosa), olive phaeocollybia
(Phaeocollybia olivacea), orange-peel fungus (Sowerbyella rhenana), bug-on-a-stick (Buxbaumia
viridis), and western waterfan lichen (Peltigera gowardii) (last two in perennial streams).
Closed Cone Pine Forest; Gravelly Flats and Benches in Chaparral Communities
Knobcone pine forest is an acceptable representative of closed cone pine forest and chaparral
communities on the Forest. 73 acres is present within proposed treatment units. The amount that would be
present under each alternative varies from 43 to 73 acres. Knobcone pine forest is naturally sparse with
few trees and somewhat low hazardous fuel levels. It provides quality suitable habitat for Tracy’s woolystars (Eriastrum tracyi).

Riparian Habitats
Perennial, shaded streams are habitat for bug-on-a-stick, western waterfan lichen, mountain lady’s-slipper,
and Brownie lady’s-slipper. Bug-on-a-stick grows on moist, partially decomposed large-diameter logs in
constant contact with a perennial water source. Brownie and mountain lady’s slipper orchids can be found
outside of riparian areas if there is a good shade layer and adequate surface litter and duff, but prefer to be
near perennial streams where cooler, moister air is provided. Perennial stream length within proposed
treatment areas varies from 8.9 miles (32 ac) under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5, to 18.1
miles (66 ac) under Alternative 3. Riparian streams in late-seral forest provide habitat for bug-on-a-stick,
mountain and Brownie lady’s-slipper, and western waterfan lichen.
Serpentine Soils
39 acres of serpentine soils are present within the proposed treatment areas. Serpentine soils appear
naturally lacking in vegetation but some have widely-spaced Jeffrey pine and incense cedar trees. The
extent of serpentine soils within proposed treatment areas ranges from 27 acres under the Proposed Action
and Alternatives 4 and 5 to 39 acres under Alternative 3. Serpentine soils provide habitat for Niles’ and
Stebbins’ harmonia (Harmonia doris-nileseae, H. stebbinsii) and Peanut sandwort (Minuartia rosei).
Roadcuts-Serpentine and Partial-Serpentine
Roadcuts contain bare mineral soil needed to support Shasta chaenactis (Chaenactis suffrutescens). There
are 233 miles of roadcuts in the project area, providing 452 acres of suitable habitat for that species.
Within those miles, 9 miles bisect serpentine soils that provide habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia
as well as Shasta chaenactis.

Rock Outcrops
Large rock outcrops provide suitable habitat for Canyon Creek stonecrop (Sedum obtusatum ssp.
paradisum). It grows within crevices and on ledges in outcrops. Rock outcrops that support this species
are typically greater than 10 feet in diameter and can be set horizontally on the ground or follow vertical
slopes. Rock outcrops are represented by “barrens” in the CalVeg vegetation classification. 90 acres of
barrens are found in treatment areas under Alternative 3; 83 acres are found in all other alternatives.
Species Accounts
Species accounts were compiled from a number of sources, including the California Natural Diversity
Database (CNDDB, 2016), UC Berkeley CalFlora Database (2016), NatureServe Explorer Database
(NatureServe, 2015), California Native Plant Society Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants (CNPS,
2016), the Jepson Manual (Baldwin et al.., 2012), Forest Service Natural Resource Information System
database (NRIS) and Shasta-Trinity National Forest species records and reference materials.
Early-Seral Conifer Habitat
California globemallow is a perennial herb found only in northern California and southern Oregon. No
populations are known from any proposed treatment areas.
Late-Seral Conifer Habitat (including riparian stream channel)
Uplands
Mountain lady’s slipper is wide ranging but rare western North American orchid. It is found in 6 western
states. Three populations are near or within proposed treatment areas.
Brownie lady’s slipper is another wide ranging but rare western North American orchid. It is found in 8
western states. Three populations are found within proposed treatment areas.
Umpqua green gentian is a tall, long-lived perennial forb that is entirely restricted (endemic) to a
localized geographic area south of Highway 36 on South Fork Mountain. All populations are within the
Mad River Fire Complex near Pickett Peak; three populations (11 subpopulations) are within proposed
treatment areas.
Pacific fuzzwort has a North Pacific Rim distribution extending from Japan and the Russian Far East into
southeastern Alaska, western British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. Pacific
fuzzwort requires a live tree as a substrate and doesn’t persist long once a tree has died. No known
populations are within or near any proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present.

Red-pored bolete is a solitary fungus that grows in association with roots of mixed conifers and tanoak in
coastal forests in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. No known populations within any
proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present.
Branched collybia is a fungi species that is widespread in the northern hemisphere but locally rare. No
populations are in proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present. Branched collybia is found in
clumps on rotting or mummified remnants of gilled mushrooms or seldom in nutrient-rich leaf mulch in
forests.
Olive phaeocollybia is a gilled mushroom that grows in scatters or arcs in mixed forests containing oak or
pine trees. It requires mature oak or pine species as host trees. The Forest Glen populations are very close
to the edge of the Mad River Fire Complex, but not within it or any proposed treatment area. Suitable
habitat is present.
Riparian Stream Channels
Bug-on-a-stick is a bryophyte that occurs throughout the world, and in 6 northern and western states.
None are near any of the fire complexes or proposed treatment areas, although suitable habitat is present.
Western waterfan lichen is an underwater lichen that anchors itself to rocks in cool mountain streams.
There are 43 populations currently known from California with a cluster of sites on Collins Creek near
Forest Glen. The species is considered to be an indicator of water quality. Suitable habitat is present in
perennial streams other than the Collins Creek system.
Closed Cone Forest, Gravelly Flats and Benches in Chaparral
Tracy’s wooly-stars occurs on dry, gravelly soils on flats and benches in closed-cone pine forests or
chaparral below 4400 feet. It is known only from California. No known populations are found in any
proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present.
Serpentine Soils Outside of Roadcuts
The Rattlesnake Creek Terrane is a unique geologic area rich in serpentine soils that support a suite of
plant species specially adapted to tolerate harsh serpentine soils. It spans 375,000 acres mostly in Trinity
County, and follows a northwest to southeast band roughly between the east slope of South Fork
Mountain and the towns of Hayfork and Burnt Ranch. A number of species on the Sensitive Species List
are found within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest is in the process of
developing a conservation strategy for management of rare and endemic species found on the Rattlesnake
Creek Terrane and the habitats they occupy.
Serpentine soils outside of roadcuts are generally gently-sloped and vary in their mineral composition.
These soils have high quantities of heavy metals (nickel, chromium, others) and very low amounts of
calcium, making them inhospitable for most native, non-serpentine plants. As a result, serpentine soils on
the Forest support only three tree species (Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, gray pine) and a limited number of
forbs and shrubs adapted to serpentine minerology. They are also fairly easy to visually distinguish from
non-serpentine soils and the plant communities they support.
Niles’s harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort grow only on high quality serpentine soils
containing only serpentinite and peridotite, and are restricted to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane.
Peanut sandwort is a low-growing perennial herb that occupies openings in serpentine soil with a high
content of peridotite minerology. It is entirely restricted to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. One population
is within a proposed treatment area in the Fork Fire Complex.
Niles’ harmonia is an early season annual restricted to the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane that occupies
openings in serpentine soil with a high serpentinite or peridotite mineral content. There is a single
population within a proposed treatment area in the Fork Fire Complex.

262

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Stebbins’ harmonia is similar to Niles’ harmonia and occurs in similar habitats. It is an early season
annual that occupies openings in serpentine soil with a high content of serpentinite or peridotite
minerology. No known populations are within proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present for
both species.
Serpentine Roadcuts
Shasta chaenactis is endemic to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. It is a low-growing perennial that
occupies two seemingly different habitats, gravelly, stabilized streambeds of high order rivers/streams and
rocky roadcuts that are primarily on serpentine soils or with serpentine inclusions. 38 populations are
documented in Trinity and Siskiyou Counties, with 24 known from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but
nearly half are historical sightings that haven’t been revisited in the last 30 years to determine if they still
exist. Roadcuts on serpentine soils are present in the proposed treatment areas.
Niles’ harmonia-see Serpentine Soils above.
Stebbins’ harmonia-see Serpentine Soils above.
Rock Outcrops and Barrens
Canyon Creek stonecrop is geographically restricted to the southern Klamath Ranges from western Shasta
to eastern Humboldt Counties. It is known only from California. There are no known populations in
proposed treatment areas, but suitable habitat is present.
Refer to the Botany Evaluation for conservation rankings and known threats for each species listed above.

Environmental Consequences (Sensitive Species)
For each of the six alternatives considered in detail, environmental impacts were analyzed and
documented in detail, including identification of the resource protection measures incorporated into the
project design, and the effectiveness of those measures to mitigate adverse impacts.
Overall Impacts of Different Treatment Types (Direct and Indirect Impacts)
Sixteen populations of eight Sensitive botanical species are known from the project area, but there is
habitat for sixteen total species. Because comprehensive field surveys were not completed, it is assumed
individuals of the 16 species could be present and potential impacts will be analyzed. These 16 species
are:
California globe mallow
Mountain lady’s-slipper
Brownie lady’s-slipper
Umpqua green gentian
Bug-on-a-stick
Pacific fuzzwort
Red-pored bolete

As with salvage treatments, Table 3-64 shows the maximum extent of potential disturbance that could
occur to late-seral habitat with temporary road construction, if all roads were placed only in that habitat.
Final placement of temporary roads would occur after operations start and there is no way to know where
that will be at this time. Temporary roads would be located throughout treatment areas and would be
unlikely to be placed exclusively in late-seral habitat; the amount of potential disturbance is shown for
disclosure purposes.

Proposed

Connected Actions: Road Maintenance, Reconstruction, Restoration, and Decommissioning
Road maintenance, reconstruction, restoration, and decommissioning treatments may occur on any NFS
roads that are connected with implementation of the project to protect resources, safely and efficiently
accommodate machine and worker access, and provide for removal of forest products; NFS roads within
the fire footprint as well as those planned for utilization as haul routes for log removal outside the fire
footprint, or approximately 247 miles of road. These types of treatments are generally intensive by nature
because they require heavy soil disturbance to accomplish the objectives. But because they always occur
within a road prism suitable habitat is no longer available except where selected roads have been
untouched for decades or more and stabilization has begun. Treatments that extend beyond the road bed
into cut/fill slopes or beyond the full road prism, such as outsloping and recontouring have potential to
result in moderate or heavy ground disturbance up to about 20 feet from the edge of the road prism.
Sensitive or other protected botanical species present within disturbed areas could be impacted.
Spatial Boundary
Spatial bounding for Niles’ harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort would be the boundary of
the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, the 375,000 acre geologic area that bisects the project area and contains
large areas of serpentine soils and endemic plant species. Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut
sandwort grow only within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and this is the only meaningful spatial area
boundary for cumulative impacts.
The spatial area for Umpqua green gentian is South Fork Mountain from Bennett Peak south to the Yolla
Bolly Wilderness and from the ridgeline to approximately 1 mile east. This is approximately the extent of
the soil types the species grows on (entisols, inceptisols).
The spatial area for the other twelve species would be the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Wherever
possible the spatial area is reduced to just the west side of the Forest, the Trinity River and South Fork
Management Units. The entire range of these species extends beyond the Forest, but is capped at the west
side to be a meaningful area of cumulative impacts analysis.
Temporal Boundary
Cumulative effects are bounded in time by the extent of documented ground-disturbing actions we are
aware of in the past, 1900 and later, and planned actions that have been formally published into the future,
20 years or less. Actions considered are those that are thought to have an adverse impact on the Sensitive
plant species in this analysis or habitat for those species. Those actions can occur on Shasta-Trinity
265

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

National Forest lands and on adjacent lands under other ownership or management. Consideration of
present and future actions is limited to those being implemented currently and those in planning stages
that have been publicly scoped at the time of writing the Botany Evaluation.
Threshold of Cumulative Impacts
There are no specific thresholds required under law or by Forest Service regulations or policy for
cumulative impacts to Sensitive botanical species, with the exception of Shasta-Trinity Land and
Resource Management Plan direction to manage Sensitive species in a way that management actions will
not lead to a trend toward federal listing. Sensitive species are rare by nature and generally have little or
no scientific data on thresholds. Thresholds of species degradation will not be identified for this project,
but the potential for cumulative impacts to occur as a result of implementing the proposed project will be
addressed.

Individual Species Impact Analysis
Early-Seral Conifer Forest Associated Species: California Globemallow
No populations of California globemallow are known from any proposed action treatment areas under any
alternative.
Forest road U4N12C, an unauthorized road planned for decommissioning under the connected actions,
lies at the edge of a large population of California globemallow, but all but a couple of individual plants
are well outside of the road prism. Those individual plants could be lost if outsloping or recontouring
treatments are applied where the individuals lie, but hundreds more individuals upslope of those would be
unaffected. Bare mineral soil created through outsloping or recontouring would provide ideal habitat for
recruitment and growth of the adjacent California globemallow population.
The 2015 wildfires greatly expanded the amount of suitable habitat available for California globemallow
by moving mid and late-seral conifer forest to early-seral forest. 227 acres of high and 4,604 acres of
moderate intensity fire burned hot enough to currently provide 4,831 acres of early-seral plant
communities. Some portion of these acres may not be conifer forest.
Resource protection measures and Best Management Practices incorporated into the project design will
reduce potential impact to California globe mallow. Known populations will be flagged and heavy
equipment use and new temporary road and landing construction will be prohibited within known
population boundaries.

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action (Alternative 1)
1,527 acres of early-conifer forest was present within proposed treatments just prior to the 2015 fires
under the Proposed Action. Additional suitable habitat is present now in areas of moderate and high
intensity fire, but some of that occurred where early-seral conifer forest was already present. Previous
267

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

early-seral habitat would not have trees large enough to be considered hazard trees after the 2015 fires,
therefore wouldn’t require either hazard tree felling or commercial salvage treatments. Tree planting and
fuels reduction treatments (hand or mastication treatments) of small trees and shrubs could be expected to
occur in California globemallow habitat, but any adverse impacts from these treatments would be
negligible if at all. Prescribed burning treatments would stimulate germination of seed in the soil,
resulting in a beneficial impact of increased seedling recruitment. Other low impact treatments would be
expected to have little or no impact on California globe mallow.
Heavy equipment use associated with removing hazard trees, fuelbreak treatments, and temporary road
construction and decommissioning could cause damage to currently unidentified California globemallow
populations. Although large plants, they don’t contain woody tissue and would easily crush if driven over.
Resprouting would likely occur if the woody caudex at the base is not highly disturbed; younger plants
with smaller caudices could possibly die, but older plants have larger caudices and more tissue from
which to regenerate. The degree of impacts to the species will also depend on how deep heavy equipment
goes into the soil in the area of populations.
Alternative 2
1,945 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 2. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-66, are the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Alternative 3
2,864 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 3. Alternative 3
also includes development/decommissioning of up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized routes for
temporary road use. Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-66, are the same as
described for the Proposed Action.
Alternative 4
1,527 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 4. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-66, are the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Alternative 5
1,537 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 5. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-66, are the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Assuming any
new wildfires occur far enough into the future for existing populations to replenish the seedbank, they
would perpetuate early-seral habitat needed to maintain California globemallow populations.
Cumulative Impacts
Six populations of California globe mallow are known from the Forest, none within or near any proposed
treatment areas. The proposed treatments would result in increased habitat for California globe mallow. In
combination with past, present, and foreseeable future actions, there are expected to be no cumulative
impacts from the proposed project under any alternative.
Determination
There is no significant difference between the five action alternatives. There is no difference in number of
known population between alternatives. Less than 20% of the treatment acres in each alternative contain
suitable habitat for California globemallow.
268

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The Trinity Post-Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project may affect individuals, but is not likely to
result in a trend toward Federal listing or loss of viability for California globemallow.
Late-Seral Conifer Forest - Upland Associated Species: Brownie Lady’s-slipper, Mountain Lady’sslipper, Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, Olive Phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua
Green Gentian
The amount of suitable habitat (mature to late-seral conifer forest) for Brownie and mountain lady’s
slipper orchids, red-pored bolete, branched collybia, olive phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua
green gentian ranges from 2,380 acres under the Proposed Action and Alternative 4 and 5, to 4,631 acres
under Alternative 3.
Three populations of Brownie lady’s slipper are known to occur within proposed treatment areas: two in
the South Fire within the Alternative 3 road buffer treatments on FS 4N30 (Pattison Peak area); and one in
the Fork Fire within proposed treatment areas under all alternatives on FS 30N31 (Natural Bridge area).
Three populations of mountain lady’s slipper are known to occur within proposed treatment areas: one in
the River Fire within proposed treatment areas under all alternatives on FS5N13 (Salt Log Spring); one
within the riparian zone next to FS31N20 within proposed treatment areas in all alternatives (Natural
Bridge); and a third within proposed treatments under all alternatives (Philpot Campground). There is an
additional population of mountain lady’s slipper outside of but directly adjacent to an Alternative 3 road
buffer treatment; the population will be flagged to avoid any potential impacts from treatments within the
proposed road buffer.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

There are no documented populations of red-pored bolete, branched collybia, or olive phaeocollybia
(Sensitive fungi) in any proposed treatment areas. There is a cluster of five populations of olive
phaeocollybia near Collins Creek just outside proposed treatment areas in the Mad River Fire, but there
would be no impacts to these populations.
Chapter 3 Eleven documented populations of Umpqua green gentian within proposed treatment areas are
clustered within 1.25 miles of Pickett Peak in the Mad River Fire Complex. No populations of Pacific
fuzzwort have been documented within proposed treatment areas under any alternative.
Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action – Alternative 1
There are 2,380 acres of suitable late-seral conifer upland habitat in treatment areas under the Proposed
Action. Impacts to above ground stems of mountain and Brownie lady’s slipper orchids, Umpqua green
gentian, and Pacific fuzzwort from tree falling, mastication, and hauling felled trees include stem
breakage and crushing. Physical impacts from falling hazard trees for safety or for commercial salvage
and yarding trees with cables could cause stem breakage, but plants would be expected to recover by the
next growing season from rootstock. No impacts are expected for Pacific fuzzwort because the species
grows on the boles of live trees only.
Trees falling on individual lady’s slipper plants could encourage plants to go dormant for a prolonged
length of time. If few hazard trees are dispersed over a large area, falling impacts would be mild.
Concentrations of hazard trees in a smaller area could lead to greater impacts, but concentrations are an
indicator of more severe wildfire and resulting degradation of habitat.
Lopping, pruning, hand piling, tree planting, hand falling small trees and brush would have little short
term and no long-term impacts. Accumulations of biomass from mastication and chipping could cause
temporary smothering of lady’s slipper orchids and Umpqua green gentian plants, but accumulations
should decrease to a fraction of their original depth by the following growing season. Impacts are not
expected to result in death of any individuals.
Heavy equipment travel through treatment areas has potential to penetrate further into the soil and cause
damage to underground roots, corms, and mycelium of all seven species. Tractors have the potential to
come in contact with Pacific fuzzwort mats on tree boles, although this would be a rare event. Pieces of
mats left near tree boles could potentially expand from the ground to the adjacent live tree (possible but
not likely), but most broken pieces wouldn’t survive. A provision will be placed in all implementation
contracts or agreements that will protect residual trees from unnecessary damage trees from operations.
Hazard tree falling would be restricted to dead trees. No live or healthy trees will be cut with the
exception of a very small number of live trees that pose a risk to operational safety.
Handline construction around treatment areas could excavate isolated individual plants that fall in the path
of a handline. All of the populations intersect with handlines could intersect individual plants if not
restricted.
Prescribed burning could consume aboveground rosettes of Umpqua green gentian, but would be unlikely
to kill rootstock or entire plants. Pile burning could generate heat impacts deeper into the soil if soil is dry
at the time of ignition. Burning when soil is moist buffers most heat impacts, restricting them to no more
than the top inch and reducing or eliminating potential for mortality.
Short stretches of temporary road construction (access ramps) and subsequent decommissioning has
potential to greatly impact one or more populations (or subpopulations) of all seven species because these
roads are intentionally highly compacted and vegetation is scraped off at the surface with roots excavated
where necessary. All populations will be flagged and mapped as control areas that exclude temporary road
construction, eliminating impacts from that activity.

270

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Tractors used to yard trees for salvage utilization (salvage/fuelwood/biomass) have the potential to cause
damage to underground orchid corms and mycelial networks when multiple passes are made or if tires
excavate deeper into the soil such as can be seen at turning points. Best Management Practices require
trees to be endlined wherever possible and tractors to travel over forest debris to reduce soil disturbance
from tires. Tree trunks will be limbed prior to yarding to the landing, reducing yarding impacts, but there
is still potential for endlined trunks to gouge the soil and break up the mycelial network with yarding.
Resource protection measures for soil call for retaining at least 50-70% soil cover across treatment units
with at least 50% of that in fine organic materials, helping to reduce contact between heavy equipment
and loose soil. Spreading lopped branches over tractor paths will reduce soil compaction and vegetation
crushing and increase the potential for individual plant recovery after operations are completed.
Without protection measures, tractor blades or forks that are invasive into the soil could easily unearth
corms and break the mycelial network; species would recover well from excavation. Most populations are
very restricted in size, increasing the probability of death of an entire population. Machine piling will be
restricted to previously heavily disturbed areas, where these species are not likely to occur. Known
populations would be flagged and avoided and impacts from machine piling are unlikely to occur.
Mastication will not adversely impact any of the seven species because blades are kept at least 6 inches
above the ground. Northern spotted owl limited operating periods will prohibit mechanical operations
until at least July, restricting operation until most lady’s slipper orchid populations have gone into
dormancy for the season. Biomass produced from mastication and chipping treatments will benefit all five
species by speeding up the process of decomposition and organic matter production, a key component of
quality habitat.
Jackpot and broadcast burning would have little adverse impact on the species, despite underground
corms and fungal mycelium being shallowly buried. Both types of burning are designed to burn lightly
with only minor heat penetration into the soil, with the goal of less than 50% consumption of surface
organic matter. Low intensity fire has been shown to benefit lady’s slipper orchids. Hand pile burning has
greater potential for adverse heat penetration into the soil with some potential for death of roots and soil
organisms.
Other proposed treatments (tree planting and borate application) will have no impact on lady’s slipper
orchid or fungi populations. Tree planting would only occur where stands are understocked, in stands that
lack enough canopy cover to expect any of the species to be present.
Alternative 2
2,898 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 2. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-67, are the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Under Alternative 2, reduction of canopy to as low as 40% in the first 200 feet from the road in graduated
shaded fuelbreak construction treatment could reduce canopy cover in late-seral habitats enough to
degrade habitat for the species. Approximately 730 acres of the fuelbreak are in late-seral habitat.
Approximately 96 acres of this late seral habitat were burned during the 2015 fires at moderate or high
severity and may no longer provide suitable habitat for these species. A minimum of 50% canopy cover is
recommended for management of Sensitive fungi and lady’s slipper orchid habitat, which will be met in
the 200’-400’ and 400’-600’ bands of the graduated fuelbreak. Increased sunlight speeds up soil moisture
loss in the summer, which leads to slower organic matter decomposition that is necessary for lady’s
slipper orchid and fungi species to thrive.
Umpqua green gentian occupies open to partially open sites in conifer forest. Increased sunlight from
graduated shaded fuelbreak construction will not negatively impact the species.

271

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Hand falling dead trees/vegetation and live trees under 10 inches DBH under Alternative 2 could result in
some physical damage to Umpqua green gentian plants that could be present in the area.
Alternative 3
4,631 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 3. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-67, are the same as described for the Alternative 2.
Alternative 4
2,380 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 4. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-67, are the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Alternative 5
2,380 acres of suitable habitat are present within proposed treatments under Alternative 5. Potential
treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-67, are the same as described for the Proposed
Action.
Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Any unidentified
populations of the seven species would continue to persist until habitat or environmental conditions
change and suitable habitat is no longer available.
Canopy shade could take slightly longer to develop without tree planting, extending the time required for
recovery of late-seral habitat characteristics. Lady’s-slipper orchids are thought to require periodic light
burning. The absence of burning treatments would be somewhat less beneficial for the species, but would
allow for greater litter, duff, and organic matter accumulation that benefits orchids and fungi species.
Exclusion of tree falling and removal treatments, as well as new temporary road and landing construction
and decommissioning would eliminate physical impacts to the species. Not implementing the action
alternatives would avoid the small potential for Pacific fuzzwort to be damaged or killed by scraping
caused by tractor movement through a treatment area. It would also eliminate any potential injury or
mortality from prescribed burning treatments.
There would be little effective difference between the action and no action alternatives for the above
treatments as well as hazard tree falling treatments because the species doesn’t grow on dead trees. Trees
with less than 25% live canopy or enough damage/disease to warrant hazard status are expected to die
within a few years. There is no effective difference between the action and no action alternatives for low
impact treatments (tree planting, hand piling, lopping, pruning, and borate stump application) because
these activities would have no impact on Pacific fuzzwort even when implemented.
Resource Protections
Resource protection measures and Best Management Practices incorporated into the project design will
reduce potential impact to Brownie and mountain lady’s slipper orchids, Red-Pored Bolete, Branched
Collybia, Olive Phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua green gentian. Known populations of all
species will be flagged and all proposed treatments that cause adverse impacts excluded. Treatments that
provide beneficial impacts or no impact at all would be permitted within populations.
Cumulative Impacts
Table 3-65 lists the past, present, and future actions that have happened within the cumulative impacts
analysis area. Actions that could create cumulative impacts to Brownie and Mountain Lady’s-Slipper
Orchids, Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, Olive Phaeocollybia, Pacific fuzzwort, and Umpqua
green gentian are those that would take place in late-seral conifer forest habitat.

272

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

38,481 acres of timber harvest on Federal lands have been implemented on the west side of the Forest
since 1950. 4,931 acres of harvest has occurred on neighboring private timberlands. Projects currently
being planned and including a component of late-seral forest include a Most of the timber harvest projects
were clearcuts and over 50% of the fuel reduction treatments were implemented using heavy equipment.
Timber harvest within late-seral forest habitat on neighboring private timberlands has likely degraded
some habitat since the 1950’s or earlier as well. There is a high likelihood that most or all of that harvest
activity used overstory removal systems. Response to timber harvest actions, including associated heavy
equipment use to yard logs, temporary road, skid trail, and landing construction would vary from
temporary damage to habitat and populations to permanent loss of any of the seven species.
About 23,000 miles of roads were built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since the
1950’s. New road construction was at its peak in the 1970’s and 1980’s to access mining operations and
facilitate timber harvest. It has dropped off significantly since the mid-1990’s and no new roads have been
built on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since 2003. Some or all roads built for timber harvest would
have been built through late-seral conifer forest. Lady’s-slipper orchids and their habitat can’t recover
from this type of action.
Over 100,000 acres of fuel reduction treatments have also been implemented since about the mid-1950’s,
either for the primary purpose of reducing flammable vegetation and wood or to reduce post-harvest fuels.
Post-harvest fuel reduction treatments may have taken place in late-seral forest habitats, but the majority
of work focusses on vegetative ingrowth over the last 70 years due to fire exclusion. In these cases,
adequate canopy closure is often left, but associated disturbances to soil and surface organic matter from
heavy equipment operations may have degraded habitat.
4,831 acres within the footprint of the proposed treatments burned at moderate or high severity in 2015.
Of these, 1096 acres burned within that were late-seral forest communities before the fires of 2015, where
suitable habitat for the seven species was present. 984,523 acres have burned at various fire severities
within the cumulative impacts analysis area. High and sometimes moderate severity fires that sterilize the
upper surface of the soil resulted in death of populations and/or long-term habitat degradation of the seven
species, but this is not always the case. Low and moderate severity fires would have had little adverse
impact or may have benefited habitat and populations.
Mountain and Brownie Lady’s-slippers, Pacific Fuzzwort, and Umpqua Green Gentian
An overwhelming majority of the known populations of both these orchids have been discovered by
predisturbance botanical surveys where timber harvest units or roads are being planned in the immediate
vicinity; on both public and private lands. Botanical surveys and mitigation for these species have been
implemented on the Shasta-Trinity and other California national forests since the mid-1980’s; since then
timber harvest projects have mitigated effects to this species through ‘flag and avoid’ protection. With
implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan, both of these orchids were afforded extra surveys and
protections through the Survey and Manage standard. No specific information is available on population
effects before 1985; it is likely that during the several decades of intensive harvest of old-growth timber
on public and private forest lands following World War II, lady’s slipper populations were destroyed or
fragmented.
Several small lady’s slipper populations have been found on the Shasta-Trinity at culvert outlets, on
ground that was certainly heavily disturbed during road construction. This indicates that the orchids are
capable of colonizing previously disturbed ground after the disturbance is stabilized, and if other habitat
requirements for shade, water, and mycorrhizal partners are met.
One small population of mountain lady’s slipper, previously known from Philpot Campground, was
apparently killed by hot wildfire in 1987. Many new lady’s slipper populations of both species have been
discovered after the year 2000, in the area between Weaverville and Trinity Lake.

273

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Two populations of Pacific fuzzwort are within proposed treatment units. It isn’t known if the host trees
supporting individuals in these populations are still alive, but RAVG mapping of fire severity indicates
one population was within moderate and high severity fire and the other was within an area that didn’t
burn in 2015. In all likelihood, only one population is still alive. Past actions that would have had the
greatest impact on Pacific fuzzwort populations and habitat are timber harvest and past wildfire that killed
host trees.
Red-Pored Bolete, Branched Collybia, and Olive Phaeocollybia
Currently there are 2 known populations of red-pored bolete, 3 populations of branched collybia, and 21
populations of olive phaeocollybia on the Forest, but not within the planned treatment areas. Planned
treatments combined with resource protection measures will maintain necessary habitat components for
red-pored bolete, branched collybia, and olive phaeocollybia. The new treatments will result in no more
than minor impacts to red-pored bolete, branched collybia, and olive phaeocollybia, and in combination
with past, present, and future actions will result in no cumulative impacts to the three species.
Determination
Suitable habitat is present and field surveys have not been completed in all areas and undiscovered
populations of the seven species may be present. Past timber harvest and fuel reduction actions affected
over a million acres of heavy impacts to the seven species. Suitable habitat and populations have probably
been lost because of those actions. Resource protection measures will be incorporated into the proposed
treatments to minimize impacts of treatments and in some cases eliminate potential impacts. The
proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for mountain
lady’s-slipper, Brownie lady’s-slipper, Umpqua green gentian, Pacific fuzzwort, red-pored bolete,
branched collybia, or olive phaeocollybia.
Comparison of Alternatives
As shown in Table 3-67, Alternatives 2, 4, 5, and the Proposed Action may affect equal numbers of
populations of each of the seven Sensitive species, but Alternative 2 treats about 500 acres more and
Alternative 3 treats almost twice as many acres in late-seral forest. Regardless, with incorporation of
resource protection measures to eliminate the most impactful treatments, no alternative will result in more
impacts to any species than any other. In the end, with resource protection measures there is no effective
difference between alternatives.
Late-Seral Conifer Forest - Riparian Stream Channel Associated Species: Bug-on-a-stick and western
waterfan lichen
Bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan lichen are only found directly in perennial stream channels in lateseral conifer forest. Bug-on-a-stick grows on decayed logs in flowing streams. No populations of western
bug-on-a-stick are within any proposed treatment areas.

No populations of western waterfan lichen are within any proposed treatment areas, but there is a cluster
of subpopulations in the Collins Creek drainage, a perennial riparian area at the south end of the Mad
River Fire. These are found along Collins Creek between FS1S04 and FS1S26. Surveys haven’t been
completed, but additional plants are expected upstream of this site within a proposed treatment area
surrounding FS1S04.
Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action – Alternative 1
There are 8.9 miles (32.4 acres) of perennial stream habitat for bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan
lichen in treatments under the Proposed Action.
Protection measures for Riparian Reserves and perennial stream channels eliminate most impacts to either
species from most proposed treatments. Because bug-on-a-stick is found only on large wood in perennial
streams and western waterfan lichen is found only under water in perennial streams, no impacts would be
expected to occur to either species as a result of implementing treatments.
Spot rocking for stream crossings has the potential to disturb western waterfan lichen thalli as rocks are
placed in streams. Rock for this purpose is usually at least 1 inch or larger, which could tear lichen thalli
or remove them from the rocks they grown on. To prevent loss of any unidentified populations, spot
rocking and stream crossings will be prohibited on Collins Creek and its tributaries.
Alternative 2
There are 9.7 miles (35.3 acres) of suitable habitat in treatment areas under Alternative 2. As with the
Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures.
Alternative 3
There are 18.1 miles (65.8 acres) of suitable stream habitat present within proposed treatment areas under
Alternative 3.
As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures.
Alternative 4
There are 8.9 miles (32.4 acres) of suitable stream habitat in treatment areas under Alternative 4.
As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures.
Alternative 5
There are 8.9 miles (32.4 acres) of suitable stream habitat for bug-on-a-stick in treatments under
Alternative 5.
As with the Proposed Action, no impacts would occur because of Riparian Reserve protection measures.
Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts to bug-on-a-stick or western waterfan lichen would occur if the proposed action or any
alternatives are not implemented.
There is effectively no difference between the action and no action alternatives.
Resource Protection Measures
Best management practices and resource protection measures for Riparian Reserves will protect both
species from any impacts caused by the proposed treatments.

275

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Incorporation of these protection measures will exclude treatments in bug-on-a-stick and western
waterfan lichen habitat, resulting in no effect to these species or their habitat from the proposed
treatments.
Cumulative Impacts
Management of lichens and bryophytes began only after implementation of Survey and Manage
Standards and Guidelines in 1998. Population records for either didn’t exist on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest before that. Populations discovered since that time have been associated with field
surveys for proposed management actions or programmatic or strategic surveys to meet the requirements
of the 2001 Survey and Manage Record of Decision. All known populations have been protected from
impacts through exclusion from treatments or protection of necessary habitat characteristics.
Best management practices for riparian areas were first published in the early 1990’s. Prior to that few, if
any, timber practices were prohibited in stream courses. With over 1.1 million acres of timber harvest on
the west side Shasta-Trinity National Forest and neighboring private timberlands, there is a high
likelihood that historic populations of bug-on-a-stick and wester waterfan lichen were lost between 1950
and the 1990’s.
23,000 miles of roads were constructed on the west side of the Forest between 1970 and 2000. Design
standards for National Forest System roads were first published in the 1970’s in an effort to reduce soil
erosion, mass wasting, and sediment delivery into streams. Prior to that time western waterfan lichen
populations may have been lost when stream sediment accumulations degraded water quality and lichen
habitat quality.
Wildfires on about 985,000 acres on the west side of the Forest have contributed to sediment deposition in
perennial streams, especially where fires have burned at high intensity and on steep slopes. Wildfires in
the past have contributed to poor water quality and potential loss of western waterfan lichen populations.
The Beegum Watershed Restoration Project will implement road maintenance, road improvements, and
road decommissioning on 247 miles in the Beegum watershed in the near future. Restoration work under
this project will repair and decommission roads that are contributing sediment into streams and degrading
water quality and quality of habitat for western waterfan lichen.
Past management actions and wildfires, lack of road design standards, and lack of riparian stream
protection standards have contributed to probably losses of bug-on-a-stick and western waterfan lichen
populations on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Best management practices, road
design standards, Riparian Reserve protection measures, and State water quality standards have
dramatically reduced impacts from actions within some stream habitats and reversed water quality trends
in other.
With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of western
waterfan lichen or bug-on-a-stick from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action alternative. The
proposed treatments under each alternative are negligible in comparison to past actions. Impacts from the
proposed treatments in addition to past disturbance will not result in a cumulative impact to either species.
Determination
The proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for
western waterfan lichen or bug-on-a-stick.
Comparison of Alternatives
No populations of either species will be subjected to impacts under any action alternative. Suitable habitat
is greatest under Alternative 3, but all Riparian Reserves and perennial streams are protected from
treatment impacts, leading to no effective difference in impacts between alternatives.

Closed Cone Forest/Gravelly Flat and Chaparral Bench Associated Species: Tracy’s Wooly-Stars
Seven populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars are known from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, but none are
within any proposed treatment areas. There is a small population about ½ mile from Goods Gulch and
proposed treatments on FS31N42. The species is found in open gravelly habitats, usually outside of forest
communities and in chaparral, sometimes in association with gray pine. Suitable habitat in the project
area ranges from 43 acres under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 2, 4, and 5 to 73 acres under

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action – Alternative 1
There are 43 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under the Proposed Action.
There is a slight possibility that Tracy’s wooly-stars occupies old landings or unauthorized roads that are
proposed for use. If so, any individuals present would not survive the heavy disturbance associated with
these. Decommissioning after use will help to loosen soil and speed up soil recovery, as well as potential
recruitment of individuals from populations that may be located close to treatment areas.
Prescribed burning is unlikely to occur in suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars because of the lack of
fuel to carry fire. If it does occur within habitat, burning at low to moderate intensity would consume
some aboveground vegetation, including Tracy’s wooly-stars. All prescribed burning treatments,
including pile burning, would occur from fall to spring after seed have dispersed and there is more soil
moisture to buffer heat penetration. No data is available to confirm if fire stimulates Tracy’s wooly-stars
seed germination, but it likely plays a part.
Mastication blades are unlikely to come in contact with individual plants because of their small size, but
the residue generated from this and chipping could smother plants temporarily, possibly inhibiting seed
germination. Mastication residue subsides greatly by the following year, eliminating any smothering
impacts.
Tree planting would not occur in Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat, so there is no potential for impacts from that
treatment. Other low impact treatments, hand piling, lopping, pruning, and borate stump application will
have no direct or indirect impact on Tracy’s wooly-stars because there are few trees to apply these
treatments to in chaparral communities.
Alternative 2
There are 43 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under the Alternative 2.
Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-69, are the same as described for the
Proposed Action.
Alternative 3
There are 73 acres of suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars in treatments under Alternative 3.

Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented.
With incorporation of resource protection measures, there would be little effective difference between the
action alternatives and the No Action alternative for this species.
Resource Protections
There are no known populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars in the treatment areas, but should any be
discovered before or during operations, they would be flagged and all treatments excluded.
Cumulative Impacts
The locations of existing and historical records suggest that this species has been affected primarily by
development, road construction, use and maintenance, competition from invasive plants, and possibly fire
suppression. The species appears to tolerate or benefit from infrequent disturbance and wildfire, but is
subject to negative effects from the weeds that invade following disturbance, and from frequent
disturbance, including being driven and parked on.
Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat is considered unproductive for commercial forest development and has been
largely ignored for this purpose. Historic fuels management may have affected some sites because habitat
appears to provide easy to construct fuelbreak areas with little need for vegetation maintenance. Some
portion of the 114, 908 acres of fuel management work on the west side of the Forest has likely impacted
suitable habitat and possibly caused population losses.
Portions of the 984,523 acres of wildfire on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest have
occurred within suitable habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars. Direct impacts of fire in this habitat are more
positive than negative (i.e. reduction of decadent woody shrubs). Wildfires have become hotter and more
frequent in the past 20 years, encouraging the introduction and spread of non-native invasive species that
discourage native species recovery.
Although the majority of the habitat for the species is off of the National Forest, habitat is found within
the Ironside/Big Bar, Price Creek, Sailor Bar, Post Creek Salt Creek, and New Tedoc grazing allotments.
Trampling effects may have caused damage to some individuals since 1907 when livestock grazing was
first integrated into natural resource management on the Forest. Disruption of the soil crust in Tracy’s
wooly-stars habitat from livestock trampling has encouraged an increase in invasive non-natives that
speed up soil erosion and degrade habitat for the species. Ironside/Big Bar, Price Creek, and Sailor Bar
allotments have been vacant since 2013, but impacts may still be occurring from grazing in the Post
Creek, Salt Creek, and New Tedoc allotments.
About 23,000 miles of roads were built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since the
1950’s. New road construction was at its peak in the 1970’s and 1980’s to access mining operations and
278

facilitate timber harvest. It has dropped off significantly since the mid-1990’s and no new roads have been
built on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since 2003. Roads built to access mining may have been built
in suitable habitat, resulting in potential loss of populations.
The Beegum Watershed Restoration Project will implement road maintenance, road improvements, and
road decommissioning on 247 miles in the Beegum watershed in the near future. This watershed is
located where Tracy’s wooly-stars habitat and known sites are concentrated. Road restoration actions in
this area may facilitate recovery of habitat lost to past road building and potential expansion of existing
sites.
The geographic range and numbers of this species on the Shasta-Trinity NF are not likely to change in the
next two decades, although local extirpations and new recruits may happen after infrequent disturbances
to its habitat, including human-created habitat along roadsides and on fuelbreaks.
Habitat for Tracy’s wooly-stars contains very few trees and shrubs are usually stunted and dispersed.
Proposed treatments won’t be needed in most or all treatment areas because few hazard trees were created
and there is only low natural fuel accumulation. Standard best management practices are incorporated into
the project design, further reducing the potential for adverse impacts to the species. With resource
protection measures applied, few impacts from the proposed treatments are expected to occur. With
resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of Tracy’s
wooly-stars. The proposed treatments under each alternative are negligible in comparison to impacts from
past actions. Impacts from the proposed treatments in addition to past, present, and future disturbance will
not result in a cumulative impact to either species.
Determination
Suitable habitat is present and field surveys have not been completed in all areas and undiscovered
populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars may be present. Resource protection measures will be applied to
reduce impacts from the few proposed treatments where they may occur; other treatments are light with
no expected potential for heavy disturbance to known populations. It is my determination that the
proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Tracy’s
wooly-stars.
Comparison of Alternatives
Resource protection measures will exclude treatments within known populations of Tracy’s wooly-stars,
but a natural lack of hazardous fuels and hazard trees will eliminate most or all impacts from the proposed
action. Because of the lack of hazard and fuel reduction needs, there is effectively no difference between
any of the six alternatives.
Roadcut Associated Species - Serpentine and Non-Serpentine: Shasta chaenactis, Niles’ harmonia,
Stebbins’ harmonia
24 populations of Shasta chaenactis are known from the Shasta-Trinity NF. Five of these are on the west
side of the Forest, all of them on roadcuts or ridgelines with exposed bedrock. No populations of Shasta
chaenactis are found within any proposed treatment areas.
27 populations of Niles’ harmonia and 13 populations of Stebbins’ harmonia are documented on the
Shasta-Trinity NF, all within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. Both species grow on serpentine soils of
primarily serpentinite or peridotite minerology. Habitat is open with few or no conifer trees and sparse,
often unvegetated understories with little fuel to carry fire. One population of Niles’ harmonia is found
within proposed treatment areas under all action alternatives. No populations of Stebbins’ harmonia are
found within any proposed treatment area.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Direct and Indirect Impacts
There are no known populations of Shasta chaenactis within the proposed treatment areas, Habitat can be
found with bare soil and exposed bedrock on cut and fill slopes (roadcuts) that are made up wholly of
serpentine soils, or soils that have serpentine inclusions. Suitable habitat in the project areas is along all
224 miles of roads where cut and fill slopes are greater than six feet long. There is no difference in the
amount of suitable habitat between alternatives. Assuming a mathematical average of 8 feet of roadcut on
both sides of the road, there would be 434 acres of suitable habitat under each of the five action
alternatives.
There is a single population of Niles’s harmonia in the Fork Fire within proposed treatments along the
Bramlet Road (Forest Road 29). There are no known populations of Stebbins’ harmonia within any
proposed treatment areas. The two species grow almost exclusively within and are endemic to the
Rattlesnake Creek Terrane, which runs north/south through the overall project area. Within the 224 miles
of roads in the proposed project, 9 miles of roadcuts have serpentine soils, equivalent to 18 acres. As with
Shasta chaenactis, there is no difference in amount of suitable habitat between alternatives.

All Action Alternatives

Because habitat is found on roadcuts and roads provide the spatial foundation of treatment areas, each
action alternative is equal with respect to habitat for and potential impacts to Shasta chaenactis, Niles’
harmonia, and Stebbins’ harmonia. There are 434 acres of suitable habitat along 224 miles of roads
receiving hazard tree removal, road buffer, and fuelbreak construction treatments.
No impacts are expected to occur to Shasta chaenactis from proposed action treatments or connected
actions. The species grows firmly rooted in bedrock and rock outcrops, but of which would be avoided
during operations because of potential breakage to trees, logs, and equipment.

280

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Regardless of the action alternative, potential impacts could occur to Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia from
connected action road maintenance associated with implementing the proposed treatments. These
activities include cleaning ditches of woody debris that spills over from upslope road buffer, salvage, and
fuelbreak treatments and brushing roads to remove vegetation that obstructs vehicle line-of-sight.
Potential impacts include tearing or crushing foliage and dislodging individual plants. Shasta chaenactis is
a perennial species that lodges in exposed bedrock, so there is low potential for being dislodged or
uprooted. Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia are small annuals that could easily be pulled out of the loose soil
they grow in, so there is more potential from unintentional road maintenance impacts.
In the process of removing felled trees from sites, one end of some trees may be dragged over cut slopes
where Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia populations may be present. Some damage to the species may occur,
but this is expected to be minimal.
Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented.
Resource Protections
Each of the three species will be protected from impacts by a resource protection measure that restricts
ditch cleaning and brushing with heavy equipment to the lowest 24 inches of slopes. Above 24 inches
brushing will be done manually with hand tools or chainsaws and removed from the site by hand. These
species are occasionally found at the bottom of roadcuts and when this occurs there is good potential
those populations will be excavated from the site. But most often they occur higher on the roadcut and the
majority of currently unidentified populations will not be impacted by road maintenance activities.
A resource protection measure that prohibits use of blades to clean ditches above 24 inches from the base
of roadcuts will be incorporated into the project design. This will greatly minimize or even eliminate the
primary source of impacts to the three species.
A resource protection measure to directionally fell hazard trees away from rock outcrops will prevent
impacts to Canyon Creek stonecrop during operations.
While not on a roadside, the known population of Niles’ harmonia will be flagged and all treatments
excluded from the population.
Cumulative Impacts
Seismic activity and metamorphic soils are both common to northwest California have triggered
numerous small landslide on roads throughout the project area. Some populations of Niles’ and Stebbins’
harmonia on roadcuts where serpentine soils are present in slides. Routine scheduled road maintenance
may have contributed to loss of individuals located at the bottom of slopes in combination with ditch
cleaning.
Road construction was heavy in the 1970’s and 80’s to access timber sales and mining. Many miles of
roads were built directly through serpentine habitats and parts or whole populations of Niles’ and
Stebbins’ harmonia were lost. Awareness of naturally-occurring asbestos in serpentine soils has all but
eliminated plans to build roads in serpentine soils.
No future actions focused entirely on road maintenance are on the planning horizon, but routine road
maintenance activities such as ditch cleaning and road brushing continue to be done throughout the Forest
to insure the safety of Forest road travelers and avoid buildup of debris that could damage roads in storm
events. Some loss of individual plants could occur.
Road grading, dust abatement, and ditch cleaning will be required during operations as connected actions,
with no difference among alternatives.

281

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Road construction through serpentine soils was heavy in the past but almost less than 15 miles of new
road have been built since 2000 and none of that has been through serpentine soils. Routine road
maintenance to protect the integrity of Forest System roads will continue into the future as funding
allows.
Resource protection measures will be applied that will result in very few or no impacts from the proposed
treatments. Relative to natural impacts and impacts from heavy road construction in the past, impacts
from the proposed treatments are negligible in comparison. The combination of past, present, and future
actions in combination with the proposed treatments is not expected to result in cumulative impacts.
Determination
With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of three
species from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action alternative. The proposed project may
affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Shasta chaenactis, Niles’
harmonia, or Stebbins’ harmonia.
Comparison of Alternatives
All action alternative treat the same roads and roadside area doesn’t change between alternatives, 9 miles
of roadsides containing serpentine soils (Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia) and 224 miles of roadsides
containing non-serpentine soils (Shasta chaenactis). All alternative contain 1 population of Niles’
harmonia and no populations of the other two species. There is no difference between the five action
alternatives.
Serpentine Soil Associated Species: Niles’ Harmonia, Stebbins’ Harmonia, Peanut Sandwort
Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia grow on uplands as well as roadcuts, the common tie is bare soil free of
competing vegetation and surface litter and duff. They only grow on serpentine soils. No populations of
either species are known from any proposed treatment areas under any alternatives, but treatments being
implemented in the Fork Fire are within the southern half of the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane where
multiple populations of both species and abundant serpentine habitat can be found. There is a single
population of Peanut sandwort between East Tule Creek and Plummer Creek. Acres of suitable habitat
within proposed treatment areas range from 27 under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5, to 39
under Alternative 3.
Direct and Indirect Impacts
Proposed Action – Alternative 1
There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the
proposed treatment areas. The three species occupy serpentine openings either within Jeffrey pine,
incense cedar, and gray pine woodlands or in non-forested open areas sometimes called barrens.
Serpentine habitats carry very sparse vegetation on the ground and don’t accumulate fuels that carry fire
or require hazardous fuel reduction. There is a low likelihood that suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’
harmonia and Peanut sandwort will include many hazard trees that need to be felled. Where isolated
hazard trees may exist, a small number of individuals of the three species could be crushed or uprooted.
High quality serpentine soils (described below) that provide habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and
Peanut sandwort will be flagged and all treatments other than felling hazard trees will be excluded.
Excluded treatments include removing felled tree, lopping, pruning, hand piling, chipping, all prescribed
burning treatments, mastication, handline construction, landing construction, reuse of existing
unauthorized roads, and removal of trees felled for operational safety. Flagged areas will be marked on
implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling hazard trees, there will be no other impacts
from proposed treatments under any alternative.

There are 29 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the
proposed treatment areas.
Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-71, are the same as described for the
Proposed Action.
Alternative 3
There are 39 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the
proposed treatment areas. Treatments under this alternative are the same as under the Proposed Action,
but Alternative 3 includes development/decommissioning of up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized routes
for temporary road use.
Individual planned treatments that are appropriate in habitat for the three species and their potential
impacts, are described in Table 3-71, are the same as described for the Proposed Action, there will be no
other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 3.
Alternative 4
There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the
proposed treatment areas. Treatments under this alternative are the same as under the Proposed Action,
but salvage removal will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls. Northern spotted owl
habitat is very different than habitat for serpentine species, and there would be no additional benefit to the
three species from the excluded treatments.
Potential treatments and their impacts, as described in Table 3-71, are the same as described for the
Proposed Action there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 4.
Alternative 5
There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort in the
proposed treatment areas. There are no additional unique planned treatments under this alternative, but
salvage removal will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls, Riparian Reserves,
Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA), and At-Risk watersheds. A little over an acre of serpentine habitat is at
the far east edge of Salt Gulch IRA near Natural Bridge, but Northern spotted owl habitat is very different
than that for Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort and there would be no additional benefit
to the three species from the excluded treatments in those habitats. Suitable habitat is outside of Riparian
Reserves and any At-Risk watersheds.

283

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts from the proposed treatments would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not
implemented. Any unidentified Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort populations would
continue to persist until habitat or environmental conditions change and suitable habitat is no longer
available.
With incorporation of resource protection measures, there would be little effective difference between the
action alternatives and the No Action alternative for these species. Serpentine habitats are naturally free of
trees and other hazardous woody fuels to carry fire. Fuel reduction treatments are rarely, if ever needed
and the sites don’t produce trees that could fall if they die.
Resource Protections
Resource protection measures to protect Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort, are
incorporated into the project design. Known sites within proposed treatment areas will be flagged on the
ground and shown on implementation maps.
43-73 acres of high quality serpentine habitats are present within planned treatment areas, depending on
the alternative. These are unique habitats with a high biodiversity value and they will be protected from
impacts along with identified Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort populations. These
habitats and their resource protection measures are described below.
In general, management and protection measures correspond to two broad serpentine habitat descriptions,
Types 1 and Type 2. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant different management
requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site and these are described below. Hazard
trees will be felled where found in all Type 1 and Type 2 serpentine habitats. Type 1 and Type 2
serpentine sites will be identified on project implementation maps as control areas.
Serpentine Habitat Type #1. Open areas with a high content of serpentinite and peridotite minerology,
sparsely vegetated with occasional shrubs and few or no conifers:






Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or
roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction
through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after
botanist approval.
No pile burning.
Hazard trees will be left in place after falling.
No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist.

Serpentine Habitat Type #2. Forest or shrubland habitats with widely spaced trees (30 trees per acre or
less). There may be scattered large conifers, as well as distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of
which may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees. Forest or shrubland habitats with a
moderate or high number of openings between trees. There may be scattered clumps of large mature trees
[Jeffrey pine, incense cedar, hardwoods], as well as distinct clumps of small to large shrubs; all of which
may have burned in concentrations producing hazard trees.

botanist approval.
No pile burning.
Felled hazard trees will be left in place unless they can be removed from the site by full
suspension or endlined by equipment that remains on well-established existing roads.
No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Cumulative Impacts
Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia, Peanut sandwort inhabit serpentine openings in or adjacent to forests, and
often on ridgetops. These sites are ideal for roads, landings, parking, skid trails, and off-highway vehicle
recreation. Until the latter part of the 20th century there was little awareness of the sensitivity of these
serpentine habitats and the slow recovery rates after disturbance.
Approximately 23,000 miles of roads have been built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National
forest since the 1950’s to access timber sales and mining. Road building was especially heavy in the
1970’s and 80’s and a large part of that was through serpentine habitats on the South Fork Management
Unit (SFMU). Many populations of the three species were disturbed or lost during that time.
Serpentine soils were commonly mined for asbestos until asbestos was banned from use in manufacturing
in the 1980’s because of health concerns. Mining for other heavy metals such as chromium and nickel has
been done in the same area. Numerous mine sites for asbestos, heavy metals, and road base material are
present on serpentine sites on the SFMU; populations of the three species have been lost at mine sites.
Off-road vehicle use was relatively unmanaged until cross-country vehicle travel was prohibited in 2005
(USDA, 2010). Before then hundreds of miles of unauthorized routes were created on the SFMU, many
of them through serpentine habitats because of their lack of surface vegetation and gentle slopes. Many
populations of the three species were disturbed with this activity, where repeated travel occurred on
individual routes, populations have more likely been lost.
Climate change may have a more immediate effect on Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia, Peanut sandwort
than on other rare species due to the very restricted geographic ranges and pronounced fidelity to
ultramafic substrates. Increasing temperatures could affect the species negatively, as could changes in
amount and type of precipitation; specific effects are not known. These plants grow in openings, barrens,
and rock outcrops in mid-elevation Jeffrey pine/incense-cedar forests or isolated barrens. If temperatures
increase, there is limited additional higher ground with suitable substrate.
With incorporation of resource protection measures serpentine habitats and known sites of Niles’ and
Stebbins’ harmonia, and Peanut sandwort, will be only minimally impacted from proposed treatments.
Past actions of mining, roadbuilding, cross-country off-road vehicle use have resulted in loss of
populations of the three species. Continued illegal off-road vehicle use and climate change impacts in the
future will contribute to negative impacts and habitat degradation as well. Relative to past, present, and
future non-project-related actions, impacts of the proposed treatments with resource protection measures
will be minor to the point that together there will be no cumulative impacts.
Determination
With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to populations or habitat of
Niles’ or Stebbins’ harmonia, or Peanut sandwort from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action
alternative.
The proposed project may affect individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Niles’
or Stebbins’ harmonia, or Peanut sandwort.
Comparison of Alternatives
With incorporation of resource protection measures, there will be no difference in amount or severity of
impacts to the three species. There is no difference in number of known sites among the 5 action
alternatives. If resource protection measures were not applied, Alternative 3 holds 30 more acres of
suitable habitat that could be impacted by proposed treatments than the other 4 action alternatives and
could therefore be considered the most impactful alternative, but these impacts will be avoided by
implementation of the resource protection measures.

Barrens and Rock Outcrop Associated Species: Canyon Creek Stonecrop
Rock outcrops provide habitat for Canyon Creek stonecrop. Outcrops that are suitable for stonecrop
growth are usually at least 10 feet in diameter. They can be lower to the ground and appear as exposed
bedrock or they can extend up along vertical slopes. There are 83 acres of rock outcrops within the
Proposed Action and Alternatives 2, 4, and 5. There are 90 acres of barrens under Alternative 3. There are
no known populations of Canyon Creek stonecrop within the project area.
Direct and Indirect Impacts
All Alternatives
No impacts would occur to the species under the Proposed Action. A resource protection measure to
require directional felling away from rock outcrops will avoid any impacts from felled trees. All of the
proposed treatments under the action alternatives would intentionally avoid working on or near rock
outcrops because of the potential for damage or additional costs to operate. No impacts will occur from
tree felling or removal, lopping, pruning, hand piling, chipping, any prescribed burning treatments,
mastication, handline construction, landing and temp road construction, or reuse of existing unauthorized
roads. Canyon Creek stonecrop accepts shade or sunlight, so any changes in canopy cover from fuelbreak
construction treatments would have no impact.
Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts would occur if the action alternatives are not implemented.
Resource Protections
Because of the Resource Protection Measure to directionally fall trees away from rock outcrops and
because no other treatments would take place on them, there would be no effective difference between the
No Action and action alternatives and no direct or indirect impacts to Canyon Creek stonecrop from the
proposed treatments.
Cumulative Impacts
Twenty-six populations of Canyon Creek stonecrop are known for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Approximately half of those are within the geographic area of the proposed treatments, but none are in
proposed treatment areas.
Because of the unique habitat Canyon Creek stonecrop occupies, there are few known threats to the
species, natural or human-generated. Trees are directionally felled away from rock outcrops to avoid loss
of value from breakage. Lack of surface fuels prevents most wildfire impacts. Lack of vegetation that can
grow on the harsh environment eliminates the need for manual or mechanical fuel reduction treatments.
High cost discourages excavation of rock outcrops for road construction.
For all the same reasons, there are no past, present, or future planned activities that have potential to
impact Canyon Creek stonecrop. With few or no impacts from past, present, and future planned actions

286

Final Environmental Impact Statement

and a resource protection measure to avoid impacts to the species, the proposed treatments are not
expected to result in any cumulative impacts.
Determination
There will be no impacts to Canyon Creek stonecrop under any action alternative. The proposed project
will have no effect on Canyon Creek stonecrop.
Comparison of Alternatives
Incorporation of the resource protection measure for falling away from large outcrops will result in no
difference in effects among action alternatives, regardless of the number of acres treated or acres of
suitable habitat for Canyon Creek stonecrop.

Forest Plan Endemic Species

Endemic species are rare species that are confined mostly or wholly to a localized geographic area. Forest
Plan Endemics are rare endemic species confined wholly or mostly to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest
and management direction is described for them in the LRMP. Forest Plan Endemics are afforded the
same conservation and protection measures as Sensitive species. The following Forest Plan Species are
identified for the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest:
Veiny arnica (Arnica venosa). Grows in open, disturbed sites, often in old roadbeds, in eastern Trinity
County. The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project area is outside of the geographic
range of this species.
Dubakella buckwheat (Eriogonum libertini). Grows on serpentine soils within the Rattlesnake Creek
Terrane. This species will be addressed in this report.
Serpentine goldenbush (Ericameria ophitidis). Grows on serpentine soils within the Rattlesnake Creek
Terrane. This species will be addressed in this report.
Impact Analysis
Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush grow only in high quality serpentine habitats containing
exclusively serpentinite or peridotite minerology within the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane. No populations of
either species are known from within any proposed treatment areas under any alternatives, but habitat is
present, especially within the Fork Fire area. Acres of suitable habitat within proposed treatment areas
range from 27 under the Proposed Action and Alternatives 4 and 5, to 39 under Alternative 3.

gray pine woodlands or in non-treed open areas sometimes called barrens. Woodlands always have widely
spaced trees and both types have very little vegetation on the ground. Felled hazard trees may land on
individual plants and injure or kill them, but this is expected to be rare. Serpentine habitats are naturally
bare and don’t accumulate fuels that either carry fire or require hazardous fuel reduction. Because habitat
is substantially free of trees and other vegetation, there will be little incentive for fuels reduction
treatments or their connected actions.
High quality serpentine soils (described below) that provide habitat for serpentine goldenbush and
Dubakella buckwheat will be flagged and all treatments other than felling hazard trees will be excluded.
Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling isolated
hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under the Proposed Action.
Alternative 2
There are 29 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed
treatment areas under Alternative 2. Additional fuelbreak treatments, including a graduated, shaded
fuelbreak on selected roads and temporary road construction and decommissioning, are included under
Alternative 2. As described under the Proposed Action, serpentine habitats that support the two species
are not appropriate for fuelbreak treatments because there are very few trees, if any, growing on these
sites. Without fuelbreak construction or the need to remove felled hazard trees or reduce fuels, new
temporary roads and landings aren’t needed and won’t be constructed in these areas.
High quality serpentine soils (described below) that support the two species don’t warrant fuelbreak
treatments because there are very few trees, if any, growing on these sites. There will be no impacts from
the additional graduated shaded fuelbreak treatments and connected actions under Alternative 2. Flagged
areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling isolated hazard
trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 2.
Alternative 3
There are 39 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed
treatment areas under Alternative 3. Alternative 3 also includes an additional treatment of
development/decommissioning of up to 3 miles of existing unauthorized routes for temporary road use.
Because habitat is substantially free of trees and other vegetation, there will be little incentive for
fuelbreak construction, its connected actions, or other fuel reduction treatments. Felled hazard trees may
land on individual plants and injure or kill them, but this is expected to rare.
High quality serpentine soils (described below) that provide habitat for serpentine goldenbush and
Dubakella buckwheat will be flagged and all treatments other than felling hazard trees will be excluded.
Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical impacts of falling isolated
hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative 3.
Alternative 4
There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed
treatment areas. Treatments under this alternative are the same as under the Proposed Action, but salvage
removal and other fuels treatments (and their connected actions) will be excluded in selected habitats for
northern spotted owls. Individual planned treatments that are appropriate in habitat for the two species,
and their potential impacts, as described in Section B-Overall Impacts of Different Treatment Types, are
the same as described for the Proposed Action.
Alternative 5
There are 27 acres of suitable habitat for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush in the proposed
treatment areas. There are no additional unique planned treatments under this alternative, but salvage
removal will be excluded in selected habitats for northern spotted owls, Riparian Reserves, Inventoried
Roadless Areas (IRA), and At-Risk watersheds. A little over an acre of serpentine habitat is at the far east

edge of Salt Gulch IRA near Natural Bridge, but Northern spotted owl habitat is very different than that
for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush and there would be no additional benefit to the three
species from the excluded treatments in those habitats. Suitable habitat is outside of Riparian Reserves
and any At-Risk watersheds. Flagged areas will be marked on implementation maps. Aside from physical
impacts of falling hazard trees, there will be no other impacts from proposed treatments under Alternative
5.
Alternative 6-No Action
No impacts would occur if the proposed action or any alternatives are not implemented. Any unidentified
Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush populations would continue to persist until habitat or
environmental conditions change and suitable habitat is no longer available.
With incorporation of resource protection measures, there would be little effective difference between the
action alternatives and the No Action alternative for these species. Serpentine habitats are naturally free of
trees and other hazardous woody fuels to carry fire. Fuel reduction treatments are rarely, if ever needed
and the sites don’t produce trees that could fall if they die.
Resource Protection
Resource protection measures to protect Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush, are
incorporated into the project design. Known sites within proposed treatment areas will be flagged on the
ground and shown on implementation maps.
43-73 acres of high quality serpentine habitats are present within planned treatment areas, depending on
the alternative. These are unique habitats with a high biodiversity value and they will be protected from
impacts along with identified Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush populations. These
habitats and their resource protection measures are described in the following.
In general, management and protection measures correspond to three broad serpentine habitat
descriptions, Types 1, Type 2, and Type 3. Different types and mixes of serpentine habitats warrant
different management requirements based on the quality and/or sensitivity of each site and these are
described below. Hazard trees will be felled where found in all serpentine habitats, regardless of the type.
Serpentine habitats requiring additional protections will be identified on project implementation maps as
control areas.
Serpentine Habitat Type #1. Open areas with a high content of serpentinite and peridotite minerology,
sparsely vegetated with occasional shrubs and very few or no conifers:






Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or
roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction
through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after
botanist approval.
No pile burning.
Hazard trees will be left in place after falling.
No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist

Serpentine Habitat Type #2. Forest or shrubland habitats with widely spaced trees (10 trees per acre or
less), as well as individual small to large shrubs. There is a small potential for wildfire to have entered
these sites and generated fire-killed hazard trees.

Exclude heavy equipment from these sites. No machinery off of well-established tracks, routes or
roads; No vehicle or equipment staging, log decking, skid trail, landing or road construction
through these sites. Previously constructed sites that are heavily disturbed may be used after
botanist approval.
No pile burning.

Felled hazard trees will be left in place unless they can be removed from the site by full
suspension or endlined by equipment that remains on well-established existing roads.
No landing construction or use, unless approved by a botanist

Serpentine Habitat Type #3. Soils contain serpentine fragments, but a full diversity of trees, shrubs, and
forbs is present. No restrictions on any operations unless other protection measures apply.
Cumulative Impacts
The spatial and temporal boundaries are the same as those defined under the biological evaluation for
Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia; the geographic area of the Rattlesnake Creek Terrane and the time extent
of available records, about the 1950’s. Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush occupy the same
habitat as Niles’ and Stebbins’ harmonia and Peanut sandwort.
Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush inhabit serpentine openings in or adjacent to forests, and
often on ridgetops. These sites are ideal for roads, landings, parking, skid trails, and off-highway vehicle
recreation. Until the latter part of the 20th century there was little awareness of the sensitivity of these
habitats and the slow recovery rates for serpentine habitats.
23,000 miles of roads have been built on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National forest since the
1950’s to access timber sales and mining. Road building was especially heavy in the 1970’s and 80’s and
a large part of that was through serpentine habitats on the South Fork Management Unit (SFMU). Many
populations of the three species were disturbed or lost during that time.
Serpentine soils were commonly mined for asbestos until asbestos was banned from use in manufacturing
in the 1980’s because of health concerns. Mining for other heavy metals such as chromium and nickel has
been done in the same area. Numerous mine sites for asbestos, heavy metals, and road base material are
present on serpentine sites on the SFMU; populations of the three species have been lost at mine sites.
Off-road vehicle use was relatively unmanaged until cross-country vehicle travel was prohibited in 2005
(USDA, 2010). Before then hundreds of miles of unauthorized routes were created on the SFMU, many
of them through serpentine habitats because of their lack of surface vegetation and gentle slopes. Many
populations of the three species were disturbed with this activity, where repeated travel occurred on
individual routes, populations have more likely been lost.
Climate change may have a more immediate effect on Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush
than on other rare species of the very restricted geographic ranges and pronounced fidelity to ultramafic
substrates. Increasing temperatures could affect the species negatively, as could changes in amount and
type of precipitation; specific effects are not known. These plants grow in openings, barrens, and rock
outcrops in mid-elevation Jeffrey pine/incense-cedar forests or isolated barrens. If temperatures increase,
there is limited additional higher ground with suitable substrate.
With incorporation of resource protection measures, serpentine habitats and known sites of Dubakella
buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush, will be only minimally impacted from proposed treatments. Past
actions of mining, roadbuilding, cross-country off-road vehicle use have resulted in loss of populations of
the three species. Continued illegal off-road vehicle use and climate change impacts in the future will
contribute to negative impacts and habitat degradation as well. Relative to past, present, and future nonproject-related actions, the proposed treatments with resource protection measures will be minor and
together there will be no cumulative impacts.
Determination
With resource protection measures applied, there will be little or no impact to any populations of
Dubakella buckwheat or serpentine goldenbush from the proposed treatments, regardless of the action
alternative. Field surveys have not been completed and suitable habitat is present for Dubakella
buckwheat and serpentine goldenbush. It is my determination that the proposed project may affect
290

individuals but will not result in a trend toward federal listing for Dubakella buckwheat and serpentine
goldenbush.
Comparison of Alternatives
With incorporation of resource protection measures, there will be no difference in amount or severity of
impacts to the two species. There is no difference in number of known sites among the 5 action
alternatives. If resource protection measures were not applied, Alternative 3 holds 30 more acres of
suitable habitat that could be impacted by proposed treatments than the other 4 action alternatives and
could therefore be considered the most impactful alternative.

Survey & Manage Vascular Plant, Bryophyte, Lichen, and Fungi
Species

Guidance under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and
Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) requires the Forest Service to analyze proposed actions for
potential impacts to Survey and Manage species, using direction provided in the 2001 Record of Decision
and Standards and Guidelines for Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other
Mitigation Measures, Standards and Guidelines (”2001 ROD”) (USDA, 2001a), as amended by annual
species reviews to 2003.
The amended 2001 ROD identifies twelve physiographic provinces within the range of the northern
spotted owl, including three in California; California Klamath, California coast Range, and California
Cascades and provides a list of old-growth forest dependent species subject to that direction. Each species
on the list is assigned to one of six categories (A-F), depending on rarity and practicality of identification
without extensive lab testing. The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project is within the
California Klamath Province.
Management Direction
Four requirements of Survey and Manage direction must be addressed for all proposed management
actions that have potential to cause ground disturbance in old-growth forest habitat.
1. Category A and C species. Perform field surveys prior to habitat disturbing activities. Field
surveys are not required if the proposed action is not likely to result in a significant negative
impact on a species’ habitat or persistence of the species at the site.
2. Category B species. Complete strategic surveys for the province that encompass the project area,
or perform equivalent-area surveys in old-growth habitat to be disturbed.
3. Category A, B, and C species-Manage all known sites.
4. Category D and E, manage high priority known sites.
Pre-disturbance surveys are not required if delay in implementation of a proposed action to perform
surveys would result in an unacceptable environmental risk or the proposed action is designed to maintain
late-succession habitat characteristics required to allow those species to persist on the site.
Currently, nine Category A and C species have suitable habitat within the California Klamath Province.
All fungi species (other than Bridgeoporus nobilissimus) were moved to Categories B or D before 2003
through the Annual Species Review process. Pre-disturbance field surveys are no longer required because
the Category B strategic survey requirement has been completed, but known sites of species in Categories
A, B, C, D, and E are required to be managed.
Category A&C Species-Perform Field Surveys Prior to Disturbance
Field surveys must be performed prior to habitat disturbing activities within old growth forest. Field
surveys are not required if the proposed action is not likely to result in a significant negative impact on a
species’ habitat or persistence of the species at the site. Category A and C species that could be present in
the California Klamath Province are shown in Table 3-74.

Wayside aster

Eucephalus vialis

Tetraphis geniculata and Schistostegia pennata occupy large, decomposed logs or large, moist root wads
within coastal habitats that are moister than those found on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. To date,
neither species is known from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest; current professional thought is that
suitable habitat doesn’t exist for them within the California Klamath Province. There will be no impacts
to these species from the proposed action and field surveys are not required.
Eucephalis vialis is a rare perennial aster that is known to occupy habitat primarily between 500 and 1500
feet, in primarily coastal habitats in California. In 2004 it was considered restricted to Oregon (primarily
Willamette Valley), but a herbarium specimen from 1919 expanded the range of the species to California.
Five populations are currently known from California in strongly coastal plant communities. There is no
coastal habitat, therefore no suitable habitat for Eucephalis vialis, in the Trinity Post Fire Hazard
Reduction and Salvage project planning area. There will be no impacts to this species from the proposed
action and field surveys are not required.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Suitable habitat is present in the project area for four of the 9 species, and without mitigations, some
proposed treatments have potential to negatively affect the species’ habitat or persistence of the species on
the site. Impacts to Pacific fuzzwort (Ptilidium californicum), Brownie lady’s slipper (Cypripedium
fasciculatum), mountain lady’s slipper (Cypripedium montanum), and bug-on-a-stick (Buxbaumia viridis)
were discussed in detail in the biological evaluation. A summary of conclusions follows.
Pacific fuzzwort, Brownie and Mountain lady’s slipper, Bug-on-a-stick
Suitable habitat is present and field surveys have not been completed in all areas and undiscovered
populations of the four species may be present. Past actions were intensive over a large area that includes
all known populations and in areas that contain suitable habitat and likely eliminated populations of the
species. Resource protection measures are incorporated into the design of the proposed project to
eliminate impacts from heavy equipment use and other treatments are light. Resource protection measures
include:








Retention of course, woody, debris in advanced states of decay (snag and log decay classes 3-5)
for protection and maintenance of protected wildlife and anadromous fish habitat.
Hazard trees cut within the first 150 foot equipment exclusion zone (EEZ) within perennial
Riparian Reserves.
No green trees will be cut or removed in EEZs up to the high water mark; hand treatments will be
allowed to fell hazard trees but will be left, unless there is heavy fuel loading in excess of 20
tons/acre.
Hand piling and pile burning will not occur within EEZs.
No new landings will be constructed will be constructed within Riparian Reserves (Project RPM).
Roads, landings, and main skid trails will be located outside of Aquatic Management Zones to the
extent practicable (BMP Veg-3).
Heavy equipment will not be allowed to operate within 150’ of perennial streams. Within
Riparian Reserves tree felling will be restricted to hazard trees only and left on site.

If individuals of protected species are discovered after project implementation begins, all off-road grounddisturbing operations will be stopped temporarily in the area of discovery until a Forest Service Botanist
or representative recommends appropriate protection measures.
With incorporation of resource protection measures, the proposed project is not expected to cause a
significant negative effect on either species habitat or the persistence of those species at the site.
Category A through E Species-Manage high-priority known sites.
There are three known sites each of Brownie and mountain lady’s slipper orchids within the proposed
project area. All six sites will be flagged and only low intensity treatments will be allowed to occur within
flagged populations. These treatments include hazard tree felling (no removal), lop and scatter slash,
pruning, hand piling, chipping, tree planting, borate application to stumps, and hand felling of trees and
brush that have grown since fuelbreaks were created (future fuelbreak maintenance, Alternative 2 only).
In addition, jackpot and broadcast burning will be allowed because low intensity fire benefits
Cypripedium species.
Resource protection measures described in the section above will minimize potential impacts to known
Brownie and mountain lady’s slipper orchid populations within proposed treatment areas under all
alternatives. With incorporation of resource protection measures, the proposed project is not expected to
cause a significant negative effect on either species habitat or the persistence of those species at the site.
Conclusion
The proposed action complies with the 2001 Record of Decision and Standards and Guidelines for
Amendments to the Survey and Manage, Protection Buffer, and other Mitigation Measures Standards and
Guidelines, as amended by annual species reviews to 2003.

Climate Change Impacts
California is currently (2012-2014) experiencing the hottest and driest period in its recorded climate
history (since 1895 (Butz et al., 2015; Mann and Gleick 2015). The Northwestern California ecoregion,
which includes the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, shows an increase in mean (0.32° F, 0.18° C) and
minimum (0.85° F, 0.47° C) temperature and a decrease in maximum (-0.41° F, -0.23° C) temperature
over this same time period (Rapacciuolo et al. 2014).
Loarie et al. (2008) projected that 2/3 of California’s native flora will experience >80% reduction in range
size by 2100. Endemic plant species that specialize in uncommon or sparsely distributed habitat (e.g.
serpentine soils, montane meadows) will have difficulty responding to changing climatic conditions by
migrating (Conlisk et al. 2013). Such narrowly distributed species are also at high risk due to disturbances
like fires or floods that may extirpate entire populations. Conversely, areas resistant to change, such as
north facing slopes or areas with deep, well-watered soils, may provide potential refugia (Olson et al.
2012, van Mantgem and Sarr 2015). In the Klamath region, if warming climatic trends are accompanied
by drying during the growing season, mesic topographic microclimates are likely to become increasingly
important microrefugia (Dobrowski 2010, Copeland and Harrison, 2015).
Other studies indicate the current climate is within the historic range of variability for temperatures and
precipitation. One study found that During the Medieval Warm Period (1,100-650 YBP), temperatures
were higher (up to 3.2°C) and drier than current conditions (Estes, 2013; Axelrod 1977). Introduction of
non-native invasive species since historic periods, many of which are highly flammable, has made
comparison of historic and current climate conditions more difficult.
Mediterranean climate regions like California exhibit high levels of plant richness and endemism and are
also among those most sensitive to climate and land-use change (Butz et al., 2015) (Underwood et al.
2009). Where it is able, the distribution of vegetation in California is expected to move upslope and north
in response to climate change (Hayhoe et al. 2004, Loarie et al. 2008). Fire exclusion has resulted in
increased tree densities and a reduction in shade intolerant species (Parsons and DeBenedetti 1979; North
et al. 2007), although the ecological significance of these changes is more important in drier, historically
pine-dominated forests than in moister, fir-dominated forests.
The most recent Climate Change Vulnerability Index for California State-listed plants (CDFW, 2010)
indicates most State-listed species are considered moderately vulnerable to predicted climate change
impacts, meaning the abundance and/or range extent within the assessed geographic area is likely to
decrease by 2050. It also indicates a decrease in climate suitability for most of the 156 plant species
assessed to date (Anaker et al., 2011). Species that occupy naturally hotter and drier habitats were more
often rated as not vulnerable and likely to have increased habitat in the same timeframe.
Throughout all proposed treatment areas under all alternatives, elevation ranges between 1200 and 5760
feet. Under the premise that suitable habitat for naturally rare species will decrease and species will move
up in elevation and northward from their current geographic distribution, six of the sixteen species being
addressed in this analysis are adapted to hot, dry habitats and likely less vulnerable to hotter, drier climate
predicted under the California Department of Fish and Wildlife Climate Change Vulnerability model
(Canyon Creek stonecrop, Niles’ harmonia, Stebbins’ harmonia, Peanut sandwort, Shasta chaenactis, and
Tracy’s wooly-stars).
The remaining 10 species (California globe mallow, mountain lady’s-slipper, Brownie lady’s-slipper,
Umpqua green gentian, bug-on-a-stick, Pacific fuzzwort, red-pored bolete, branched collybia, olive
phaeocollybia and western waterfan lichen) requiring mesic conifer forest habitat are considered more
vulnerable to climate change impacts. The range of these species could be expected to move up in
elevation as well as farther north in latitude. Western waterfan lichen that grows completely inundated in
forested, perennial streams would be additionally impacted by potential changes in flow regime from

294

Final Environmental Impact Statement

perennial to intermittent as climatic precipitation decreases. Because this species cannot adapt to
intermittent stream flow, the likelihood of losing existing populations is high.
The elevation range is the same among the five action alternatives, 1280 to 5760 feet. Therefore, there
will be no difference between action alternatives in the degree or magnitude of shift upward or northward
in response to climate change into the future.

Noxious Weed Risk Assessment

Introduction
Non-native invasive plants, also referred to as noxious weeds, have the ability to disrupt local ecological
communities by quickly changing the species diversity and structure of habitats that wildlife and other
organisms have adapted to and depended on over thousands of years.
Noxious weeds can reproduce very quickly on disturbed sites, often more quickly than native species.
They can change a local community from one that had many different plant species in different sizes and
shapes that supported many different animals, insects, and other biological organisms who in turn assisted
and benefited those native species, to broad areas with only a few species (or even just one) in just a few
sizes and shapes. Noxious weeds are the thugs of local ecosystems; without weed management native
species can’t compete with weeds and will often just stop growing there.
Most plant communities in the western U.S. have at least a seed source of noxious weeds, but healthy
native plant communities have the ability to keep weeds from dominating because most weeds must have
bare soil and full sun to germinate and grow. Many things contribute to noxious weed infestations, but
most basically they have to be brought onto a site (introduction) and have bare soil and lots of sunlight to
germinate and grow (establishment). Over time, many noxious weeds have developed techniques to keep
native species from growing in the same area once they become established, such as sending chemicals
into surrounding soil that native plants can’t tolerate or taking up a large amount of physical space and
shading out natives.
Techniques like this allow weed populations to expand over time. Noxious weeds move to new locations
(spread) when weed seeds or pieces that regrow on their own come into contact with something that can
move them (animal fir, automobile tires). Noxious weeds, like other plant species, produce seeds that can
remain dormant for years or decades to germinate later when the right environmental conditions for
germination present themselves.
Noxious weeds do their best work when they are free of challenges to access bare soil and full sunlight.
Once the ground starts to get shaded or covered with organic matter or roots of native plants, existing
weeds can continue to grow, but new introductions usually have trouble germinating or getting
established. Noxious weeds affect many resources that contribute to an ecosystem functioning well, such
as soil productivity, wildlife habitat, native plant diversity, and water quality and availability (Bossard &
Randall 2007); so it is important to analyze and understand the effects of this project on weed
occurrences.
Changes to vegetation structure, soil disturbance, and dispersal factors can each contribute to the
introduction, spread and establishment of noxious weeds. Wildfires increase weed risk in several ways
(Table 3-75).

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Table 3-75. Wildfire effects on native species and weeds.
Wildfire Impact
Effects related to native species and weeds
Loss of canopy cover with
moderate and high severity
burns
Blackened soils

Increased sunlight dries out the soil quicker and increases the soil
temperatures. Native species accustomed to moist soil and shade can’t
survive.
Stores heat from increased sunlight longer than soil with organic matter
cover.
Winter snow melts quicker and doesn’t get absorbed for native plant
growth.

Loss of litter, duff, and other
organic matter on the
ground

Organic matter acts as a buffer and additional layer of moisture storage
over the soil. It releases it slowly into the growing season and allows soil
to provide moisture to native plants longer into the summer. If litter and
duff burn off, soil moisture evaporates much earlier in the growing season
because it doesn’t have a top layer of organic matter to hold it in.
Water can run off bare soil faster and remove top soil that provides
nutrients to native plants. Many weeds have learned to thrive in nutrientpoor soils, but many native plants have not.

Authorities and Guidelines
Direction relevant to the proposed action in regards to the management and prevention of weeds includes
the following:
FSM 2903.4 requiring a determination of the risk of introducing, establishing, or spreading invasive
species associated with any proposed action, as an integral component of project planning and
analysis, and where necessary provide for alternatives or mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate
that risk prior to project approval.
FSM 2903.5 requiring that all Forest Service management activities are designed to minimize or
eliminate the possibility of establishment or spread of invasive species on the National Forest System,
or to adjacent areas.
Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999, directs Federal agencies to prevent the introduction of
invasive species; detect and respond rapidly to, and control, such species; not authorize, fund, or carry out
actions that the agency believes are to cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species
unless the agency has determined and made public its determination that the benefits of such actions
clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by invasive species; and that all feasible and prudent measures
to minimize risk of harm will be taken in conjunction with these actions.
Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan for Forest Pests (4-18):
a) When conducting watershed/ecosystem analysis, consider the possible effects that the Forest pest
may have on management objectives and desired future conditions.
b) Implement an integrated pest management (IPM) program to maintain or reduce forest pest
impacts to acceptable levels and to maintain or enhance forest health and vigor. Any decision to
use pesticides will require site specific analysis.
The proposed action and all alternatives would be compliant with all of the above authorities.
Data Sources
Data used for this analysis comes from the California Invasive Plant Council (CalIPC) Invasive Plant
Inventory (2016), USDA Forest Service Natural Resource Information System (NRIS) database, USDA
Forest Service Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS), Shasta-Trinity GIS noxious weed
database, and field visits to the planning area. CalIPC is a statewide invasive plant research, education,
and policy development organization that focuses on management of wildland weeds, including all
National Forest lands in California. Species and weed management reference information is taken from
DiTomaso and Kyser (2013) and CalIPC.

Noxious Weed Management Criteria
Funding for noxious weed management is never limitless and resource management agencies usually
have to prioritize which species are treated and to what degree. Research and experience have identified
several strategies for prioritizing noxious weed treatment. Prevention is the most effective way to control
weeds. It is usually easier to prevent weeds from entering an area than to control or eradicate weeds once
they are present. When prevention isn’t an option because populations have already been introduced,
focus efforts on populations that meet these criteria:
1. Small populations; geographically restricted to no more than ¼ acre. Treatments have a high
potential for removing all aboveground stems and future individuals germinating from the
seedbank.
2. Populations that are a threat to high value resources, such as wilderness areas and known
locations of Sensitive or other protected botanical species.
3. Highly invasive species that have the ability to grow and expand significantly in a short time.
Where herbicides are not an option for treatment, an additional criteria for management is to focus
treatments on species that can effectively be managed with manual removal. Species that resprout when
cut, pulled, or dug up will rarely be controlled even if removed repeatedly over many years. Populations
of noxious weeds that can effectively be managed by manual methods will diminish in size until the
seedbank is exhausted and will require decreasing amounts of monitoring over time if removal efforts
were regular and complete. Herbicides are not currently an option for treatment of noxious weeds on the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest because environmental analysis has not been completed. No herbicides
will be used for weed management in the proposed project.
Most weed management prioritization strategies discourage spending valuable time and funding on
populations with widespread distributions. Limitless funding would still not reduce population levels
enough to allow prevention measures to effectively keep future spread and establishment at the same low
levels. Invasive weed species that meet one or more of the above criteria and are effectively managed
with manual treatments are considered high-priority weed species. Management of high priority weed
species are the best use of limited funding and resources.
Affected Environment
The footprint of the project area encompasses 15,991 when alternatives are combined and overlap
between alternatives is removed (alternatives overlap in some areas, but some alternatives may have
unique treatment sites). Species that are high priority for treatment on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest
based on the criteria described above are shown in Table 3-76. Spotted knapweed, diffuse knapweed, and
Dyer’s woad are all found in proposed treatment areas or within ¼ mile of them, and are the greatest
concern for introduction and spread. Like most invasive weed species, all three established first along
roads. Individual populations extend varying distances from the road edge, typically up to the edge of
adjacent forest canopy.

Direct and Indirect Impacts
Invasive weeds are stronger competitors than native plant species most of the time and easily germinate,
root, and spread in the presence of disturbed soil. Treatments that are moderately to heavily ground
disturbing have the highest potential to provide suitable habitat for weed introduction and spread. There
must also be a source of recruitment nearby, either an introduction vector or an established recruitment
source nearby. The extent and intensity of ground disturbance associated with an individual treatment will
determine the amount of suitable habitat for weeds. Over time, areas that have been allowed to stabilize
with ground cover for many years after an initial disturbance gradually hold less suitable habitat for
weeds.
Treatments that use heavy equipment have the greatest potential to cause ground disturbance because they
expose bare soil and degrade structure at the soil surface.
Treatments that use heavy equipment are commercial salvage, skid trail and landing development, and
temporary road construction and decommissioning (new and re-use of unauthorized routes). Machine
piling, which has the potential to cause heavy soil disturbance, will be restricted to landings and areas that
are already heavily disturbed, greatly reducing new soil disturbance and potential for weed spread. All
other treatments proposed in the project area have some potential to create suitable habitat, but to a much
lesser degree than those employing heavy equipment. Acres of heavy-equipment use proposed under each
action alternative are shown in Table 3-77.

roads and landings may be placed outside of treatment areas, resulting in acreage estimates that exceed alternative
footprint acres.

Alternative 2, which includes the full range of proposed roadside treatments plus fuelbreak construction
within a consistent 300 foot buffer (150 feet on each side), has the potential to create the most soil
disturbance and therefore contribute to the most potential suitable habitat for invasive weeds. Although
Alternative 3 covers a much larger footprint than Alternative 2, commercial salvage treatments would be
implemented on only about half of the area, rather than everywhere within the 9,522 acre footprint under
Alternative 2. The proposed action implements commercial salvage treatments on even fewer acres.
Alternatives 4 and 5 include areas that will be excluded from salvage treatments for protection of northern
spotted owls and other resources, greatly reducing the potential invasive weed habitat as a result of
implementing the project. No heavy machinery will be used under Alternative 5.
Cumulative Impacts
The proposed project area extends over a very large geographic area, but unlike most other proposed
management actions is subdivided into smaller inclusions (5 individual fire complexes + an individual
fire) within that larger geographic area. Cumulative impacts analysis areas for invasive weeds are best
delineated by the roads that provide access into a project area because transportation routes are considered
the primary vector for invasive species movement from place to place.
Spatial Boundary
Overall, the spatial boundary for invasive species analysis would span from north of the River Complex
to south of the Mad River and Fork Complexes, but contiguous geographic areas are a less meaningful
delineation of cumulative impacts analysis for weeds than transportation routes. The transportation routes
that provide major access to the treatment areas are shown in Table 3-78. Treatment areas are accessed
using the same roads under each alternative and there are no access routes that are unique to an individual
alternative.

Temporal Boundary
The primary source of weed introduction is roads. Roads were originally constructed on the Forest to
facilitate timber sales, mining, and other planned management activities, but vehicles are driven on those
same roads today for multiple other purposes, including accessing recreation sites, managing natural
resources, and fire suppression. Road building has been a part of Forest management since the early part
of the 20th century. While it would be appropriate to include past actions since the 1920’s (90 years) as
contributing to the existing map of noxious weed populations, it may be more meaningful to look at past
actions as far back as the time it would take for a disturbed community to recover and once again be a
part of a self-sustaining native plant community. This would probably be somewhere between 30 and 40
years, assuming low levels or no disturbance; longer with periodic disturbances (the more likely scenario.
Past, Present, and Future Actions
Road construction since the 1920s to access timber sales, recreational sites, and mining claims has been
responsible for noxious weeds that are present in the planning area today. Wildfire, timber harvest, fuel
reduction activities, and road construction have had the greatest influence on the amount of disturbed
ground for introduction and establishment of invasive weeds. Table 3-79 summarizes most of the past,
present, and future planned activities in the cumulative impacts analysis area.
Timber harvest within the cumulative impacts analysis area occurred regularly from the 1950’s through
1990’s. A large percentage of timber harvest prescriptions before the 1990’s were for clearcuts and
overstory removal, dramatically increasing sunlight to the forest floor and stimulating weed germination
and growth. Timber harvest required landings, skid trails, and temporary roads to be operational, most of
which were new construction.
Road construction ramped up considerably in the 1970s and 1980 to accommodate timber harvest and
mining needs, but few roads have been built since timber harvest activity decreased significantly with
implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan in the mid-1990’s.
Fuel reduction activities have increased in the past 20 years in an attempt to reduce fuels that have
accumulated as a result of fire suppression and reduced timber yields after implementation of the
Northwest Forest Plan and a desire to reduce wildfire threats to communities.
Wildfires have always been present, but the size and number of fires annually has increased dramatically
since the 1987. When combined with the increase in road construction in the 1970’s and 80’s,
significantly more habitat for invasive weed introduction and spread is present today than before the
1970’s.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Discussion
Noxious weed infestation levels in the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project area are a
product of historic acts and environmental events. Because invasive species have developed sophisticated
strategies to outcompete most native plants and persist under adverse environmental conditions, they have
the ability to modify their surroundings physically and chemically to facilitate weed growth and
discourage growth of native species. Almost always, once invasive weeds are established the only way to
reduce their impacts is through regular management over many years.
The proposed action alternatives would be implemented entirely along roads. In combination with
treatments concentrated where fires burned in 2015, the presence of weeds in multiple sites throughout
the project area is a given. There are no laws or regulations to prevent weeds from being introduced into
the project area by non-operational vehicles because roads will remain open to the public.
Several prevention measures are incorporated into the project design to prevent introduction and spread of
weeds within the project area. Alternative 5 treatments exclude salvage treatments and temporary roads.
Alternative 4 includes some salvage treatments, but less than 20% of the acres under the Proposed Action
alternative would be salvaged. Overall, in comparison to past, present, and planned future activities, the
proposed action will create far fewer acres of ground disturbance and is not expected to result in
cumulative impacts to the rate of invasive weed spread.
Invasive Species Mitigations
No herbicides will be used to treat or manage any invasive plant species.
Prevention measures are designed to reduce the chance of introducing weeds, but no measures can
completely eliminate this threat. Weeds can be introduced on anything that enters an area including motor
vehicles and equipment, foot traffic, and animals. Measures are usually the same regardless of how
individual species establish and spread once introduced (seed germination vs. regeneration from broken
plant parts).
To discourage introduction or establishment of noxious weeds into the project area a provision requiring
equipment cleaning will be included in all service contracts or agreements used to implement the project.
This provision requires all equipment or vehicles working off of established roads to be free of invasive
species of concern and to present equipment for inspection by the Forest Service. Operational equipment
will clean equipment to remove seeds, soil, vegetative matter, and other debris that could contain or hold
seeds before moving off-road equipment into the project area. This provision also applies to equipment
departure departing from project areas already infested with invasive weeds.
Old landings and unauthorized roads will be used for salvage operations whenever possible, reducing the
amount of new ground disturbance.
All heavy equipment operating off roads will be cleaned and inspected before entering the treatment area
to be sure they are free of debris that could contain weed propagules.
Prior to implementation of mechanical operations each season, some sites containing high priority
invasive weeds may be managed to reduce the potential for weed spread. High priority weed sites are
those that contain invasive species that are known to be very invasive, limited in geographic extent within
the project area, and/or are within close proximity to high value natural resources such as Sensitive plant
populations. Management options include but are not limited to scheduling treatments before seed has set,
avoiding infested sites with designated control areas, hand pulling weed sites before operations begin,
prohibiting parking on roadsides known to be heavily infested with high priority weeds, and covering
infested sites. Strategic scheduling of operations will occur between infested and non-infested areas.
Managed sites will be identified on a map.
Invasive species that respond positively to removal will be physically removed and disposed of off-site (if
necessary to avoid leaving plant parts that can regrow); removed plants with no propagative parts will be
302

left on site. High priority invasive species sites that cannot be treated effectively with manual removal
treatments (i.e. hand pulling stimulates resprouting) will be flagged and vehicles and equipment will be
excluded from those sites to reduce chance of weed spread. Weed removal in high priority weed sites will
occur no more than 30 days before timber operations begin.
To discourage establishment of invasive weeds in selected disturbed areas within the project area, native
grass and forb seed and/or non-persistent cereal grains may be spread where there is heavy soil
disturbance. These areas include but are not limited to temporary roads, landings, and main skid trails.
Cereal grains will be restricted to annual “recleaned” varieties (have been processed to reduce weed seeds
and other debris) that are expected to disappear from sites within 3-5 years.
Grass and forb seed will be species that are known from the Klamath Ranges, preferably species found on
similar habitats on the west side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Only seed that has been tested and
meets California State standards for noxious weed content and seed quality will be used. Species selection
will ultimately depend on seed availability, but under no circumstances will non-native perennial species
be used. All seeded areas will be mulched with weed-free straw or on-site organic materials.
Post-Implementation Seeding and Mulching Recommendations
Where sites are heavily disturbed after project implementation, 2011 Best Management Practices (BMPFSH 2509.22) (USDA, 2011b) will be followed for erosion control and to discourage establishment of
noxious weeds. BMPs to be followed include:
1.15 Revegetation of Areas Disturbed by Harvest Activities
1.16 Log Landing Erosion Control
2.3 Road Construction and Reconstruction
5.4 Revegetation of Surface-disturbed Areas
Each of these BMPs recommend revegetation with locally-appropriate seed or vegetative material and
application of and organic mulching material over exposed soil surfaces to stabilize soil, control runoff,
and/or meet wildlife needs. Disturbed sites that are determined to need revegetation will be seeded with a
total of 10#/acre of seed that includes at least 1 pound but no more than 3 pounds of re-cleaned wheat and
1 pound of either of the following species:
 Spanish clover (Lotus purshianus)
 Annual or miniature lupine (Lupinus bicolor)
The remaining mix will include one or more of the following species, using a seed source as
geographically close as possible to the proposed project area:






Blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus)
Mountain or California brome (Bromus carinatus)
Beardless wildrye (Leymus triticoides)
Squirreltail (Elymus elymoides)
California melic grass (Melica californica)

Seed will have a genetic origin from within California, preferably north of Sacramento. Documentation of
the seed source showing genetic origin shall accompany all seed and will be provided to the Sale
Administrator upon request. Any changes from the list must be approved by the Forest Service botanist in
advance.
Mulching material may include weed-free straw, wood chips, pine straw, or any other organic material.
On-site organic materials are preferable when adequate sources exist to reduce importation of invasive
weeds and reduce transportation costs and energy consumption.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Noxious weed introduction and spread will be reduced or avoided through the current standard contract
provision for equipment cleaning, or its equivalent if a stewardship or other federal agreement is used to
implement the project. This provision requires the operator to insure his equipment is free of weed seeds
or propagules prior to entering the project area. Equipment will be inspected by Forest Service Sale
Administration staff to be sure equipment has been cleaned.

Air Quality
Analysis Framework:
Statute, Regulation, Forest Plan and Other Direction
The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project area is located in Trinity County, California.
The analysis area for the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of project activities on air quality is the
North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District (AQMD).
The Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) identifies the
Standards and Guidelines that specifically apply to Air Quality for this project. The air quality standard on
the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is very high. Forest activities which contribute to air quality
degradation are: burning of forest vegetation, exhaust from vehicle and machinery use, and dust
generation from logging equipment and other vehicular use of unpaved roads. The project area is located
within the North Coast Air Basin. There are no major heavy industrial areas in either of these air basins.
Logging is the primary industrial activity that takes place on National Forest and private lands. Logging,
transportation vehicles, burning of logging slash, and burning for fuels reduction and wildlife habitat
improvement account for a large percentage of the pollutants emitted into the air. The Yolla Bolly-Middle
Eel Wilderness has been designated as a Class I air quality area. Because of this, management of the air
quality in this area requires identification of air quality related values (AQRVs) by measuring sensitive
indicators of those values. The AQRVs are inventoried and monitored in cooperation with the Mendocino
National Forest. The Forests are in compliance with all national ambient air quality standards. However,
like most air basins in the State, those within the Forests exceed the California ambient air quality
standard for PM-10 (particulates less than 10 microns in size). Primary sources for PM-10 are burning
and dust generating activities. Since no major industries are planned, other dominant pollutants would not
be a problem (Forest Plan 3-5). The Forest Plan contains the following direction concerning air quality:










305

Maintain air quality to meet or exceed applicable standards and regulations (Forest Plan 4-4).
Protect air quality while achieving land and resource management goals and objectives. Base line
levels will be established, and available technology will be used to predict and monitor changes.
Activities such as burning, which are under the Forest’s control, will be coordinated with affected
landowners and control agencies (Forest Plan 4-13).
Identify, assess, and monitor significant air quality related values (AQRV) and sensitive
indicators of those values in the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness in cooperation with the
Mendocino National Forest (Forest Plan 4-13).
Establish and maintain close coordination with Federal, State, and local officials in the research
and application of new air quality standards particularly in relation to smoke and dust
management (Forest Plan 4-13).
Incorporate smoke management controls into the development of prescribed burn plans, and
coordinate with local authorities (Forest Plan 4-14).
Yolly Bolly-Middle Wilderness is located in a Class I Federal airshed, subject to Section I 69A of
the Clean Air Act. It is governed by EPA regulations to assure progress toward the
Congressionally declared goal of; ..." the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any
existing, impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas in which impairment results
from manmade air pollution." Working together, personnel of the Mendocino and Shasta-Trinity
National Forests continue to gather baseline data on air quality to monitor the achievement of
Class I standards for this Wilderness (Forest Plan 4-97).
Protect air quality of this Class I area in accordance with the Clean Air Act. Determine sensitive
indicators for monitoring (Forest Plan 4-97).

Air Quality Management Practices
Smoke from prescribed fire is managed so that emissions meet applicable state and federal standards.
Prescribed fires are regulated and authorized by the local Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and the
California Air Resources Board under the process established by the California Smoke Management
Program. The legal basis of the program is found in the Smoke Management Guidelines for Agricultural
and Prescribed Burning adopted by the California Air Resources Board (ARB) on March 23, 2001
(CARB 2001). The Guidelines provide the framework for State and local air district regulators to conduct
the program. Elements of the program include:


Registering and Permitting of Agricultural and Prescribed Burns;



Meteorological and Smoke Management Forecasting;



Daily Burn Authorization; and



Enforcement.

The 1990 Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments and the 1998 EPA Interim Policy on Wildland and
Prescribed Fire form the federal requirements and guidance behind the California program (Ahuja et al.
2006). Burn days are allocated by the responsible air quality regulatory agency when dispersion
conditions are most likely to prevent exposure to unhealthy smoke concentrations. Allocations are
considered on a cumulative potential for the air basin by regulatory review of a unified reporting system,
the Prescribed Fire Information Reporting System (PFIRS), maintained by the California Air Resources
Board (CARB). The reporting system and a daily conference call between regulatory meteorologists,
resource agency meteorologists, and resource agency fire managers allow for a daily discussion of
ongoing events, smoke dispersion, allocations, and burn approval outlook. The objective of this system is
to facilitate fuel treatment and minimize smoke exposure to the public.

Effects Analysis Methodology
Emissions were calculated for machine pile burning, jackpot burning, and for wildfires using the EPA’s
Technology Transfer Network Clearinghouse for Inventories & Emissions Factors. Using the EPA’s
Technology Transfer Network Clearinghouse for Inventories & Emissions Factors the emissions for
biomass removed for wood products was also estimated. To estimate biomass removed for wood products
tons per acre of non-merchantable timber were calculated from post fire plot sampling. These data were
then used, along with treatment acres, to derive the average biomass emissions for each alternative.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Greenhouse gasses (GHG) are released in smoke emissions. GHG are important to track because they trap
solar radiation which increases global warming. The GHG’s found in smoke emissions are carbon
dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane.

Calculation of Emissions from Prescribed Fires
The emissions from prescribed fire were calculated using the following formula:
Ei (tons) equals (A multiplied by FL multiplied by percent C multiplied by EF) all divided by 2000 to
convert pounds to tons.

A∗FL∗%C∗EF
2000
Where:

⁡= Ei

Ei equals Emissions in tons for each emission type (e.g. PM2.5 or NOx or CH4)
A equals Area in acres
FL equals Fuel Loading in tons per acre
%C equals Percent fuel consumed
EF equals Emission factor for ith type (in pounds per ton of dry fuel consumed)
Assumptions used in calculations:


Average Fuel loading assumed under different treatments is 20 tons per acre (per field surveys)
per desired fuel loadings listed in the fuels section of this chapter as well as the fuels report.



Percent combustion under pile burning is 100 percent.



Percent combustion under jackpot burning is 50 percent.



Jackpot burns are similar to broadcast or under burns.



EFs for pile and jackpot burns were derived from Hardy et al. 2001: PM10 equals (12.4, 20.5),
PM2.5 equals (10.8, 18.8), CH4 equals (11.4, 12.8), NMHC equals (8, 9.8), CO equals (153, 201),
CO2 equals (3271, 3165), NOx equals (6, 6), SOx equals (2.4, .2.4).



GWP (Global Warming Potential) factors for greenhouse gas conversion to CO2 equivalent metric
tons from the 2007 synthesis report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC
2007a) assuming a 20-year time horizon.



Wildfire emissions were based on a wildfire burning under 90th percentile weather conditions at
year 20 for all scenarios.



Road construction, reconstruction, logging, and haul traffic, would have a minor effect on air
quality due to the project’s management requirements and implementation of standard dust
abatement requirements within all Forest Service timber sale contracts. Therefore, these
emissions are not calculated.

Air Quality Indicators
The Clean Air Act lists 189 hazardous air pollutants to be regulated. Some components of smoke, such as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are known to be carcinogenic. Probably the most carcinogenic
component is benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). Other components, such as aldehydes, are acute irritants. In 1994
and 1997, 18 air toxins were assessed relative to the exposure of humans to smoke from prescribed and
wildfires. The following seven pollutants are most commonly found in smoke from fire:

307

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage



Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10 a criteria pollutant): Particulates are the most prevalent air
pollutant from fires and are of the most concern to regulators. Research indicates a correlation
between hospitalizations for respiratory problems and high concentrations of fine particulates.
PM2.5 are fine particles that are 2.5 microns in diameter or less in size. PM10 are fine particles that
are between 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter or less in size. Particulates can include carcinogens
and other toxic compounds. Overexposure to particulates can cause irritation of mucous
membranes, decreased lung capacity and impaired lung function.



Methane (CH4): Methane is an odorless, colorless flammable gas. Short-term exposure to
methane may result in feeling tired, dizziness and headache. No long-term health effects are
currently associated with exposure to methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas (GHG) and
contributes to global climate warming (IPCC 2007b).



Carbon Monoxide (CO a criteria pollutant): Carbon monoxide reduces the oxygen carrying
capacity of the blood, a reversible effect. Low exposures can cause loss of time awareness, motor
skills and mental acuity. Also, exposure can lead to heart attacks, especially for persons with heart
disease. High exposures can lead to death due to lack of oxygen.



Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless and non-poisonous gas formed by
combustion of carbon and in the respiration of living organisms. Carbon dioxide is the primary
GHG emitted through human activities. Greenhouse gases act like a blanket around the Earth,
trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm. The buildup of GHGs can change the
Earth's climate and result in dangerous effects to human health and welfare and to ecosystems
(IPCC 2007b).



Nitrogen Oxide (NO2 a precursor to O3): Nitrous oxide gives rise to nitric oxide (NO) on reaction
with oxygen atoms, and this NO in turn reacts with ozone. As a result, it is the main naturallyoccurring regulator of stratospheric ozone. It is also a major greenhouse gas and air pollutant.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2 a criteria pollutant) is a reddish-brown gas. Small levels can cause nausea,
irritated eyes and/or nose, fluid forming in lungs and shortness of breath. Breathing in high levels
can lead to rapid, burning spasms, swelling of throat, reduced oxygen intake, a larger buildup of
fluids in lungs and/or death. N2O is a GHG and contributes to global warming.



Ozone (O3 a criteria pollutant) is the most widespread air quality problem in the state according
to the CARB (2010). It is not emitted directly but is formed from reactions of hydrocarbons and
NOx in the presence of sunlight. It can cause reduced lung function and irritated eyes, nose and
throat. It is known to cause damage to some vegetation, including ponderosa pine and Jeffrey
pine trees (Procter et al. 2003).



Sulfur Oxides (SOx a criteria pollutant): Short-term exposure to high enough levels of sulfur
dioxide (SO2) can be life threatening. Generally, exposures to SO2 cause a burning sensation in
the nose and throat. SO2 exposure can cause difficulty breathing, including changes in the body’s
ability to take a breath or breathe deeply, or take in as much air per breath. Long-term exposure to
sulfur dioxide can cause changes in lung function and aggravate existing heart disease.
Asthmatics may be sensitive to changes in respiratory effects due to SO2 exposure at low
concentrations. Sulfur dioxide is not classified as a human carcinogen (it has not been shown to
cause cancer in humans). SO2 is not an issue in the state and has not been analyzed.

County. The population of Trinity County according to the 2010 Census is just under 14,000 people. The
Forest Service follows the guidelines assigned by the CARB [ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP),
visibility SIPs, and Title 17] to limit state-wide exposure on a cumulative basis, in compliance with the
Clean Air Act (CARB 2001; 2008).
Air quality from the Fork Complex, South Complex, Mad River Complex, Route Complex, River
Complex, and Saddle Fires through the majority of the summer reached unhealthy levels according to
multiple alerts from AQMD. People were advised to avoid strenuous outdoor activity or to remain indoors
because fine particles in smoke can irritate the eyes and respiratory system and aggravate chronic heart
and lung disease. Figure 3- 22 shows the smoke from the Fork and River Complex Fires

Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to all Alternatives

Emissions for all the Alternatives including Alternative 6 (the no action alternative serves as the control)
are shown in Table 3-81 through Table 3-87. The tables are grouped by treatments: Prescribed Fires: Table
3-81 to Table 3-83; Wildfires: Table 3-84; Green House Gases are under Prescribed Fires, Table 3-85 to
Table 3-87.

Direct and Indirect Effects
Prescribed Fires
Table 3-81 displays emissions under pile burning, Table 3-83 shows emissions under jackpot burning, and
Table 3-83 displays the expected combined emissions for all alternatives under machine pile and jackpot
burning. Burning would be completed under approved burn and smoke management plans. Given the
ability to control ignition times to favor good smoke dispersion, it is not anticipated that prescribed
burning would impact the local communities. Smoke would be transported to the northeast by typically
southwest winds during the day. At night, some smoke from smoldering burns in the project area may
move down drainages. Piles would be burned under weather conditions that would allow efficient
combustion.

Generally, PM2.5 emissions are the dominant public health risk and can be viewed as the primary
indicator. The total treatment acres and emissions displayed have value as a relative comparison of
alternatives but not as an assessment of public exposure since the fuel treatments will take place over
multiple years and multiple times during each year. Public exposure of smoke emissions will be mitigated
by the daily burn day permission and allocation from the California Air Resources Board and the local air
pollution control districts. The objective of this program is to mitigate public exposure below health risk
thresholds. Most likely the total emissions occurring on any particular burn day may not be allowed to
exceed 100 to 200 tons of PM2.5 irrespective of the action alternative.
Wildfires
Emissions from wildfires within the project area after treatments were modeled. To compare emissions
from all alternatives in the event of a future wildfire, we modeled a wildfire across the 15,991 acre area
affected under any of the 5 action alternatives. For alternatives with fewer acres of treatment, we assumed
that the untreated acres would release the same level of emissions per acre as the no action alternative.
Table 3-84 is based on the First Order Fire Effects Model (FOFEM 6.0), the 90th percentile weather for
the project area and the estimated fuel loading under each Alternative at year 20 (Fuels Report).
Alternative 6 generates the maximum emissions compared to all other alternatives. This demonstrates the
emissions savings that can be generated from fuels treatments as opposed to wildfire scenarios.

Additional projects within and adjacent to the project area utilizing prescribed burning include USFS and
private timberlands. The USFS projects include The Trinity Alps Wilderness Prescribed Fire, Sims Fire
Restoration, Mud Springs, Westside Plantation Thin, and South Fuelbreak. Private timberlands burn
biomass piles for prepping their land for planting and to remove non-merchantable material on landings.
California’s Smoke Management Program is designed to prevent cumulative effects from prescribed fire
operations. The program provides allocations of emissions based on the airshed capacity and forecasted
dispersal characteristics. The allocation process considers all burn requests, meteorological conditions,
311

Final Environmental Impact Statement

forecasted air pollution levels (similar to the BSMPs described by the Natural Resource Conservation
Service (O’Neill and others, 2011)) and uncontrollable events like wildfire. Wildfire emissions can
overwhelm air basins and most prescribed burn requests are denied during wildfire events. As a result of
the California Smoke Management Program and agency oversight, none of the action alternatives are
expected to contribute toward significant air quality effects.

Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
Direct and Indirect Effects
The wildfire emissions for PM2.5 and other pollutants are higher under Alternative 1 as compared to
Alternative 2 and 3, but lower than Alternative 4 and 5. The more biomass removed, the less available to
burn in a wildfire.
The number of acres treated for biomass removal under Alternative 1 are lower (4,072 acres) compared to
Alternatives 3 and 2 (7,684 acres and 5,340 acres respectively). Alternative 1 removes more biomass than
alternative 4 and 5. The more biomass that can be removed without burning equates to less GHGs being
released into the atmosphere.
The total GHGs produced are 184,597 CO2 equivalent tons from prescribed fire treatments.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all Alternatives.

Alternative 2
Direct and Indirect Effects
The wildfire emissions for PM2.5 and other pollutants are higher under Alternative 2 as compared to
Alternative 3, but lower than Alternative 1, 4 and 5. The number of acres treated for biomass removal
under Alternative 2 are 5,340 acres as compared to 4,072 acres, 7,684, and 782 acres for Alternatives 1, 3
and 4 respectively. Alternative 2 removes more biomass than alternatives 1, 4 and 5.
The total GHGs produced are 218,675 CO2 equivalent tons from prescribed fire treatments.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all Alternatives.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
The highest number of acres being treated for prescribed burning are under Alternative 3 and it produces
the highest emissions followed by Alternatives 2 and 1 respectively. The highest benefit in emission
reduction compared to a wildfire event would occur under Alternative 3 because maximum biomass
would be removed (7,684 acres).
The total GHGs produced are 347,389 CO2 equivalent tons from prescribed fire treatments. This
alternative has the greatest amount of CO2 output because it has the greatest amount of prescribed fire
treatments.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all

312

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Alternative 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
The number of acres treated for biomass removal under Alternative 4 are the lowest (782 acres) compared
to 4,072, 5,340 acres and 7,684 acres for Alternatives1, 2, and 3 respectively but higher than alternative 5
which is not removing biomass.
The total GHGs produced are 127,456 CO2 equivalent tons from prescribed fire treatments.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all.

Alternative 5
Direct and Indirect Effects
There are no acres being treated for biomass removal. Pile burning and jackpot burning will occur on
4,062 acres. This alternative treats the smallest amount of acres compared to all other action alternatives.
The total GHGs produced are 88,618 CO2 equivalent tons from prescribed fire treatments. This alternative
has the lowest amount of CO2 output from prescribed fire compared to the other action alternatives,
because it has the least amount of fuel reduction treatments; however, wildfires that burn in the future
would have the greatest amount of CO2 output compared to the other action alternatives because of the
small amount of fuel reduction in this alternative.
Cumulative Effects
Cumulative Effects would be similar as described under Effects Common to all.

Summary of Effects Analysis across All Alternatives

Table 3-83 displays total emissions for understory and jackpot burning for each alternative. Total
emissions from wildfires were generated using the 90th percentile weather, fuel loading at year 20 and
multiplied by the number of acres treated for each alternative except Alternative 6. For Alternative 6, the
7,970 acres identified in Alternatives 1, 4, and 5 were used for the smoke emission analysis. Areas outside
treatment units would experience similar fire behavior, which would result in similar emissions.
The project is located in an area designated as non-attainment for PM10. PM10 is known to impact
human respiratory function and the health and vigor of vegetation and ecosystem health (Grantz et al.,
2003). The burn treatments under Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be conducted under an EPA approved
California Smoke Management Program (SMP). Under the revised Conformity Rules the EPA has
included a Presumption of Conformity for prescribed fires that are conducted in compliance with a SMP;
therefore, the federal actions will be presumed to conform and no separate conformity determination will
be made. The California Smoke Management Program provides for the allocation of emissions from
biomass burning with respect to cumulative effects. Biomass burning projects are regulated and
coordinated by air quality regulatory jurisdictions and all entities submitting burns for approval. In
making those decisions, air quality regulators consider forecasts, dispersion conditions, locations of
proposed projects and background air quality by air basin. These considerations have historical success in
preventing cumulative effects of smoke.

Equipment Emissions

Estimated logging truck emissions were based upon the assumptions that logging trucks average 1.7 km
per liter of fuel (EIA 2009, Mason et al. 2008), and that combustion emissions total 10.52 kg of
Carbon/liter of diesel110. Schwaiger and Zimmer (2001) reported a range of payload capacities among
European nations; the simulations reported here used an average capacity of 27.2 metric tonnes per
logging truck, following survey results from Washington State presented by Mason et al. (2008). It was
assumed that one m3 of roundwood weighs 0.9 tonnes (following Schwaiger and Zimmer 2001; similar to
the rate of 0.87 t/m3used by Lindholm and Berg 2005), although variation in specific gravity certainly
occurs among species. Accordingly, a factor of 0.0143 kg C/m3/km was used to identify fossil carbon
emissions related to timber transport. A factor of 150% was added Lindholm and Berg (2005) to account
for empty return trips and loading activities. Thus, the final carbon emission factor used in the simulations
below was 0.0214 kg C/m3/km. All transport was assumed to occur via logging trucks.

Economics
Introduction

This section evaluates the economic effects of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project
(the Project) using basic principles; measurements of inputs (revenue) versus outputs (cost). The analyses
is intended to help interested parties understand the economics between alternatives. In terms of
economics, the “best” investment will refer to the purpose and need of capturing economic value through
salvage (net present value) and supporting local communities (jobs and wages).
Wildfires that kill a large number of trees create an array of economic effects. If the damage is large
enough and expands across multiple land ownership, then sale of fire-killed timber can have effects on all
market participants (Prestemon et al. 2006). For example, salvage may increase supply so prices fall and
producers of undamaged timber suffer the losses. At the same time, however, the depressed timber prices
may benefit consumers of wood products.
This economics segment will look at how decaying wood (i.e. deterioration) progressively affects
revenue, private sector employment and total annual wages. Net Present Value will be used to determine
the best investment in the context of its local community and the benefits of the Forest offering wood
products within that community. In addition, this report will also quantify jobs and wages provided by
implementing fuels treatment activities outside of salvage units.

Past Trends and Existing Conditions

Active California primary wood products facilities have decreased from 216 sawmills in 1968 to 28
sawmills in 2016. Concurrently, revenue from lumber sales have decreased (inflation-adjusted) from $5
billion in 1968 to $0.5 billion in 2009. There has been a slow recovery to $0.9 billion in 2012 since the
“Great Recession” (McIver et al. 2015) and that positive but slow trend continues to today.
Private lands have provided the majority of California’s timber since the 1940s. However, during the
1960s-1980s, as private harvest volumes declined, national forests became an increasingly important
source of timber for California’s industry (McIver et al. 2015). Since the late 1980s, both private and
national forest harvest have declined with reductions in the harvest from national forests accounting for
the majority of the difference. The decline in national forest offerings is largely in part due to social,
political, and legal constraints on harvesting (Morgan et al. 2012).
Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. closed its Hayfork facility (Trinity County) in December, 1992, along with
150 jobs of a 2,500 population. To this date Trinity River Lumber Company is the single remaining wood
products facility in Trinity County. Nearly 60% of Trinity County’s land base is surrounded by ShastaTrinity National Forest. That number rises to 75% when including Six Rivers and Mendocino National
Forests (Figure 3- 23), yet only 18% of the total harvest in Trinity County comes from public lands and
timber offerings have been falling since 2007 (Bevington 2013).

Methods and Results

This section will describe the rates of wood deterioration and its effect on employment and annual wages.
It will also describe the type of economic analysis used and rationale behind that choice, the processes
used to quantify total volume and value of proposed salvage (revenue) and how fuels treatments (cost)
and deterioration effect Net Present Value (NPV). This section will also describe how fuels treatments
affect jobs and wages outside of areas identified for salvage treatments.

Deterioration

Many fire-killed tree species will lose a significant portion of their monetary value and volume for
products in a very short time (Lowell et al. 1992, Lowell and Cahill 1996, Sessions et al. 2004), with
several factors influencing the rate of deterioration (Lowell et al. 1992). Tree species, tree diameter, bark
thickness, percent sapwood, fire severity, season of fire, and local site conditions are just a few of these
factors. In addition, it has been recognized that many interactions occur between these factors and
different combinations of interaction will result in different rate of deterioration (Cluck and Smith 2007,
Ritchie et al. 2013). The cause and effect relationship of these interactions will not be explained here
because it is beyond the scope of this document, they have been studied in great detail by other
professionals (Lowell et al. 1992, Cluck and Smith 2007, Martinez et al. 2011), and the biological
principles of conifer decay haven’t changed.
Using relationships from Lowell et al. (1992) and the 2010 Region 5 supplement to the Forest Service
Handbook 2409.12 (Ch. 20), the amount of sound wood available for salvage was predicted within five
years (Figure 3-24). Smaller diameter trees deteriorate at faster rates than larger diameter trees and
approximately half of the deterioration occurs within the first three years. For example, a 10” (diameter at
breast height) white fir loses 80% of its monetary value within the first year of being fire-killed but less
316

Final Environmental Impact Statement

than 40% if it’s 70” in diameter. Ponderosa pine, however, takes three years to lose a comparable value by
equal diameter classes. Douglas-fir and sugar pine generally lose value at slower rates than white fir or
ponderosa pine. Rates of decay and loss of monetary value will be the driving variables in this analysis
because it 1) affects the viability of selling wood products and 2) affects the workforce harvesting and
processing the wood products.

Figure 3-24. Rates of deterioration for four conifer species by 10” diameter classes. Values are from
Region 5 supplement to the Forest Service Handbook 2409.12 (ch.20), approved December 16, 2010.
Forest Inventory and Pricing Index
A total of 96 nested ground-based plots were collected across a random strata of vegetation type, road
type, land ownership, slope position and four classes of remotely sensed fire severity data (Rapid
Assessment of Vegetation (RAVG), which assess basal area (ft2) loss) within the 2015 wildfires on the
Forest. Fixed- and variable-plot radius inventory included species, total height to the nearest foot,
diameter at breast height (DBH) to the nearest inch and survival of individual trees.
Total acres of salvage was approximated for each alternative111, as follows:





Alternative 1 = 700 acres
Alternative 2 = 950 acres
Alternative 3 = 1,400 acres
Alternative 4 = 110 acres

Variables like total trees per acre, basal area (ft2) per acre and quadratic mean diameter were calculated
using standard equations common to forestry. Net cubic foot volume was then calculated for individual
Note this acreage is less than approximated in Chapter 2 of the EIS. For this report “salvage acres” refers to areas of
concentrated stands of dead timber. As this concentration of mortality only occurs in pockets along the roads identified for
salvage, and rarely along whole roads (and only dead trees are identified for removal), the smaller subset identified in this report
is a more accurate depiction of volume that would be removed by alternative.

commercial species ≥ 14” DBH using the Wensel and Olson (1995) tree volume equations (merchantable
to 4” top, 1’ stump) and converted to board foot using a standard 0.5 conversion factor.
Volume per acre was highly variable across the landscape and distribution of that volume was skewed to
the left. As a result, normality was rejected for all tests and median board foot volume per acre was used
instead of an average, totaling 20.12 MBF (thousand board feet) before deterioration of fire-killed trees
(i.e. as of 2015). The median of 20.12 MBF per acre ranged from 13.17 – 26.44 MBF per acre (95%
lower and upper confidence levels, respectively). The median MBF per acre will be multiplied to each
alternative that includes X acres of salvage.
Using a recent Western Wood Products Summary of price per MBF by species (February 2016), total
value of volume per acre was calculated to be approximately $380 per MBF at the mill (Table 3-90). A
deduction of $180 per MBF was applied to this “stumpage value” using an average haul and log cost from
roadside salvage sales in the area. The result is a net surplus of $200 per MBF per acre as of February,
2016. The value per acre is then multiplied by the number of acres anticipated to be salvaged under each
alternative. Annual deterioration of all commercial tree species will be applied proportional to abundance
of each species on a per acre basis across alternatives and over time. The price per MBF will stay constant
throughout this analysis for comparisons between alternatives.

Jobs and Wages - Salvage

In an effort to help quantify the economic impacts of forest management, Sorenson et al. (2015) used
information from public databases to estimate direct forest industry employment from the harvesting and
processing of timber. Employment estimates per unit of timber harvested within that model were referred
to as direct response coefficients (DRCs). Employment DRCs can be expressed as number of workers per
million board feet (MMBF) of timber harvested and processed on an annual basis.
Sorenson et al. (2015) also produced a calculation of wage by DRC using County Business Patterns
(USDC, 2014b) data and the Regional Economic Information System (USDC, 2014a) wage and salary
employment data. Wage DRCs were rounded to the nearest $5,000 and represent annual wages per worker
using employment and wage data from calendar year 2011.
To illustrate the use of DRCs reported in this Project, the following example of Alternative 1 is provided.
A salvage sale of 11.36 MMBF is offered by the U.S. Forest Service in 2016 with the expectation that
90% of the timber will go to a sawmill and 10% will be used to produce energy. The expected annual
employment and wages from harvesting and processing of those logs are as follows:


Harvesting the 11.36 MMBF of timber would employ 40.9 workers in forestry and logging, each
earning $40,000 per year, for $1.64 million in total annual wages.

Processing the 10.22 MMBF of logs into lumber at the sawmill would employ 30.7 workers, each
earning $45,000 per year, for $1.38 million in total annual wages.
The use of the sawmill residue at other facilities would employ an additional 6.1 workers, each
earning $55,000 per year, for $0.34 million in total annual wages.
The use of wood chips to produce energy would employ 2.7 workers, each earning $45,000 per
year, for $0.12 million in total annual wages.

Thus, the total direct private sector employment from harvesting and processing 11.36 MMBF of logs in
Trinity County, based on the assumed product use, would be 80.4 workers for a year (2016), with total
annual wages of approximately $3,480,000 in 2011 dollars (Table 3-91).
As time progresses and wood continues to deteriorate (MMBF), the monetary worth (REVENUE) declines
along with the private sector of employment (JOBS) and total annual wages (WAGES). The complete
breakdown of jobs and wages by alternatives over time, including 2015, is located in Appendix A of the
economics report.

Approximately 80.4 jobs are created within the private sector for one year every 5 million board feet
(MMBF) harvested and processed. As time progresses, fire-killed trees deteriorate creating less volume
for harvesting, processing and associated jobs. Revenue is the projected value from salvage only and does
not include the cost of fuels treatment (except those generated by salvage activities such as slash).

Jobs and Wages - Fuels Treatments (outside of salvage)

Salvage is an opportunity to capture economic value before the natural resource deteriorates beyond its
monetary worth. However, salvage is only economically viable in areas with higher concentrations of
merchantable conifers. There are many other stand conditions across this project area that would not
support economically viable treatment of fuels. These include low severity burns with small pockets of
moderate severity, stands composed primarily of younger trees, stands with high hardwood or brush
components, etc. These “other conditions” also pose a hazard to users of National Forest System roads
due to potential hazard tree failures as well as high fuel loading. Under this project, fuels will be treated to
between 10-20 tons/acre depending on area and conditions.

Fuels work will be accomplished both by force account (utilizing Forest Service employees), through
agreements with partners, and through the award of service contracts. Work includes falling hazard trees
and treatment of fuels. Treatment of fuels will most commonly be accomplished by mastication or
hand/machine-piling and burning.
Sorenson et al. (2015) has a section for roundwood processing within California and Nevada. Those DRC
values were used to quantify total number of workers per MMBF (million board feet), which converts to
approximately 1.8 jobs per year. The type of worker and annual wage is highly variable because they
could be from different contractors or under force account within the Forest Service. As such, it is
estimated that an average annual wage would be approximately $30,000 per worker.
Using the volume estimates within the Forest Inventory and Pricing Index section, 20.12 MBF (thousand
board feet) is estimated on a per acre basis. The Fuels report shows more acres of treatment for each
Alternative than acres of salvage. Areas identified for salvage are accounted for above, however jobs
resulting from treating fuels outside salvage units was calculated utilizing a factor of 0.3 applied to
Alternatives 1-3, and 0.5 applied to Alternatives 4 and 5 due to low volume estimate because 1) not all
areas will have more than 10-20 tons per acre, and 2) non-commercial species like small diameter
conifers and hardwoods have less mass (or weight) than commercial species. A DRC of 1.8 will be
multiplied by 0.02 MMBF per acre. Therefore, 0.018 is the constant DRC to be multiplied by the total
acres of fuels treatments (outside of salvage), by Alternative.

Economic Analysis

One of the most commonly used methods for evaluating project viability is Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA).
Unfortunately, costs and benefits are not always tangible or can be expressed in monetary terms, thereby
limiting the usefulness of a CBA (Knowler and Lovett 1996, Prestemon et al. 2006, Salverda and
Hawkins 2003). Benefits are usually more difficult to assess than costs. This leads to difficulties in
establishing the worth of “unpriced values” such as scenery, clean air, clean water, genetic diversity,
ecosystem function, habitat quality and quantity, etc. Economists agree that these unpriced values have
worth, however, their monetary value is difficult or impossible to establish (Salverda and Hawkins 2003),
and these values are very open to personal interpretation (Silva 1996).
Timber salvage activities by private landowners can generally be predicted (e.g. mill value minus logging
costs). Optimal salvage harvest from public lands, however, are more difficult to predict because the
objective function is heavily influenced by competing interest groups and a body of natural resource law
(Prestemon et al. 2006). Public forests are managed for a complex of competing objectives that go far
beyond timber economics. For all the reasons stated above, net present value (NPV) will be used to
compare the costs of each alternative and the effectiveness of each alternative in the Project.
Net present value is the present value of cash generated by a project less the initial investment on the
project. It is one of the most reliable measures used in capital budgeting because it accounts for time
112 A

factor of 0.3 was applied to the volume estimations for alternatives 1-3 as it is assumed less fuel exists outside areas
identified for salvage, and 0.5 was applied to volume estimates in Alternatives 4 and 5 to account for the higher quantities of fuel
in project area in the absence or near absence of salvage removal

value of money by using discounted cash inflows. If the NPV of a proposed project is positive, it would
generally be accepted. However, if NPV is negative, the project would probably be rejected because cash
flows will also be negative. The formula for NPV is as follows:
∞

𝑁𝑃𝑉 = ∑ (⁡
𝑡=0

𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑡 − 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡
⁡)
(1 + 𝑟𝑖 )𝑡

Where,
t = time in years
ri = discount rate at t
Before calculating NPV, a target rate of return is typically set to discount the net cash inflows from a
project to ensure some level of profit. The target rate of return for salvage units, however, is to “break
even” so the target rate of return will be greater than or equal to zero. As such, if net cash inflow
(revenue) is equal to or greater than total cash inflow during a period less the expenses (cost), then the
project is considered economically viable and generally excepted. If, in contrast, an alternative costs more
than the revenue generated, then the project is not considered economically viable and generally not
excepted.
Revenue will be cash inflow generated from the commercial sale of fire-killed trees (i.e. salvage) and cost
will be the expense from fuels treatments within salvage units. The analysis for this project will look at
NPV of a single investment and compare the monetary worth of such an investment between alternatives
over time. NPV is only calculated for the alternatives that include salvage (Alternatives 1-4). Every
calculation of NPV over time will have salvage in year X and fuels treatment 1 year after salvage. The
discount rate for time (t) is 4% per year.
Deterioration begins immediately after a tree was killed. But for the purpose of this project, rates of
deteriorations were calculated after the wildfires were considered “contained.” That occurred, roughly, in
September-October of 2015. This is where time equals zero when calculating NPV.
Figure 3- 25 (and corresponding table, below) illustrates NPV of a single investment if made at 4
successive years after the 2015 wildfires. Again, it only shows the alternatives that includes salvage.
Weighted average of wood decay rates by successive years are 19.3% (2016), 61.4% (2017), 77.8%
(2018) and 85.4% (2019) for an average breast height diameter of all species at 25”. It’s expected that the
Project will see a surplus of $646,957 in Alternative 1 if the investment is made within the 2016 calendar
year. However, due to deterioration, it’s expected that the Project will be deficit -$476,527 if the
investment is made within the 2017 calendar year.
The pattern of lost revenue continues through succeeding years for all alternatives, but it’s the difference
between 2016 and 2017 that is noteworthy for this project. Fuels treatments (cost) will be greater than
salvage (revenue) at approximately 1.6 years after the 2015 wildfires for all alternatives including salvage
units.
Treatment of activity generated fuels from salvage treatments were calculated using averaged bids for
National Forest’s “Hazardous Fuels Reduction Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity” (HFR IDIQ)
Contracts in northern California. Fuels treatments specific to this project were then summed over the
entire treatment area for a total of approximately $1,906,235 for Alternative 1 (2017 cost at present
value), $2,587,033 for Alternative 2 (2017 cost at present value), $3,812,469 for Alternative 3 (2017 cost
at present value) and $299,552 for Alternative 4 (2017 cost at present value). This appraised value of
service also considered safety and insurance liability of working in hazardous conditions, long commute
to work sites, and distance between work sites. Each cost is based on 2015 estimated volumes per
alternative and a discount rate of 8% (2 years post fire times 4%).

Economic Consequences

This section will look at the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of a single purpose and need defined
within the EIS: Within the treated areas, capture the economic value of felled trees and support the
economies of local communities by providing forest products. The other two purpose and needs are near
impossible to quantify through a monetary lens as described earlier about the worth of “unpriced values”
(see Economic Analysis section). As such, the economic consequence will be defined by number of jobs,
annual wages and how rates of deterioration effect employment, annual wages and ability to capture
economic value.

Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
Direct and Indirect Effect
Salvage
Approximately 11.36 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $2,271,612 would be sold in year 2016,
harvested, brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. A little over 80 private
sector jobs would be sustained for one year, totaling $3,475,548 in annual wages. This alternative
322

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

provides about 26% fewer private sector jobs and wages than alternative 2, 50% fewer private sector jobs
and wages than alternative 3 and over six times more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 4. No
private sector jobs and wages relating to salvage are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison.
Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015
board feet volume (14.08 MMBF) for a total cost of $1,906,235. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue
from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less
than zero (2017 NPV = -$476,527). There is also a likelihood the Project will be rejected because it no
longer has economic viability, this is also true with alternatives 2, 3, and 4.
This concept is also true for the private sector in alternatives 1-4. There is the chance of not receiving bids
on the salvage sale(s) because the mill has their own bottom line that includes a target rate of return where
NPV must be greater than zero. The salvage sales need to be offered in a timely manner or else there is a
chance no mill can afford to harvest and process the material (American Forest Resource Council meeting
with the Forest, May of 2015). Generally speaking, the depreciation of wood needs to be less than 3040% for economic viability of operations (Trinity River Lumber Company, personal communication,
March 23, 2016).
Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage)
No economic value will be captured and approximately 44 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways
as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across over 7,200 acres is approximately
$9,957,100. It has also been estimated to take about 1225 days to achieve, totaling 264 jobs and
$7,916,100 in wages. This alternative 1 provides about 27% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 2, 72%
fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, 21% fewer jobs and wages than alternatives 4, and 25% more
than alternative 5. No private sector jobs and wages would be provided under Alternative 6.
Cumulative Effects
Past, present and future actions add up to be approximately 42,300 acres. Assuming 20.12 MBF per acre
(see Forest Inventory and Pricing Index section of the Economics Report), a total of 851 MMBF have
been, is, and will be cut by 2020. Removing areas already cut (past) from that total, the sum of present
and future actions is roughly 19,300 acres for a total of 388 MMBF harvested and processed up to 2020.
Trinity River Lumber Company currently averages 160-175 MMBF per year and needs at least 75-80
MMBF per year to sustain operations. Present and future actions from both U.S. Forest Service and the
private sector is predicted to supply just under 80 MMBF per year until 2020; the minimum the mill
needs to stay in business.
Past actions in the County of impact have led to a reduction in infrastructure capable of harvesting and
processing trees into lumber. Of the roughly 2 million acres within Trinity County, 18,230 acres had
harvest from the private sector and 4,765 acres had harvest from the Shasta-Trinity National Forest since
2005. This accounts for approximately 82% from the Private sector and 18% from the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest. Collectively, that’s only 1% of lands harvested in Trinity County within the last 10 years
for a total of about 23,000 acres in past actions. This equates to approximately 3,271 jobs and
$141,412,160 wages in the private sector, assuming 462 MMBF in the last 10 years.
Most of the private sector has already begun or completed fire salvage operations authorized under a
notice of emergency timber operations (Public Resources Code §4592 and Title 14 California Code of
Regulations §1052-1052.3). Therefore, present actions contributing to cumulative effects include an
estimated emergency fire salvage of 2,425 acres and an additional 418 acres of harvest on unburned forest
with the Private sector of Trinity County. The U.S. Forest Service has 4 thinning projects and multiple
deck sales for a total of 2,372 additional acres. The sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service present
actions is about 4,800 acres. This equates to approximately 687 jobs and $29,690,430 wages in the private
sector, assuming 97 MMBF.

323

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Foreseeable future actions include 12,415 acres of various cutting methods proposed on private lands
since 2005, but not yet harvested. The U.S. Forest Service has the proposal to salvage 700 acres of
roadside hazards within this project, another 189 acres of hazard trees near power lines and 2 thinning
projects for 1,200 acres. The sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 14,500
acres. This equates to approximately 2,068 jobs and $89,377,385 wages in the private sector, assuming
292 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020).

Alternative 2
Direct and Indirect Effects
Salvage
Approximately 15.41 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $3,082,900 will be sold, harvested,
brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. A little over 109 private sector jobs
would be sustained for one year, totaling $4,716,840 in annual wages. This alternative provides about
26% more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 1, 32% fewer private sector jobs and wages than
alternative 3 and over eight times more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 4. No private sector
jobs and wages relating to salvage are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison.
Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015
board feet volume (19.11 MMBF) for a total cost of $2,587,033. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue
from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less
than zero (2017 NPV = -$642,644). There is also a likelihood the Project will be rejected because it no
longer has economic viability.
Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage)
No economic value will be captured and approximately 51 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways
as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across 8,572 acres is approximately
$11,809,700. It has also been estimated to take about 1429 days to achieve, totaling 362 jobs and
$10,873,400 in wages. This alternative 2 provides about 1.4 times the jobs and wages than alternative 1,
62% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, 1.1 times the jobs and wages than alternatives 4, and 1.7
times the jobs and wages provided in Alternative 5.
Cumulative Effects
Past and present actions are the same in this Alternative (2) as in Alternative 1. However, Alternative 2
has an additional 250 acres of proposed salvage for a total of 950 acres in the foreseeable future. As a
result, the sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 14,750 acres. This equates
to 2,103 jobs and $90,907,820 wages in the private sector, assuming 297 MMBF within the next 5 years
(2020). In other words, it’s 35 more jobs and $1,530,435 more wages in the private sector than Alternative
1.

Alternative 3
Direct and Indirect Effects
Salvage
Approximately 22.72 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $4,543,224 will be sold, harvested,
brought to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. A little over 160 private sector jobs
would be sustained for one year, totaling $6,951,127 in annual wages. This alternative provides about
50% more private sector jobs and wages than alternative 1, 32% more private sector jobs and wages than
alternative 2 and over twelve times more jobs and wages than alternative 4. No private sector jobs and
wages are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison.
Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015
board feet volume (28.17 MMBF) for a total cost of $3,812,469. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue

from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less
than zero (2017 NPV = -$947,094). There is also a likelihood the Project will be rejected because it no
longer has economic viability.
Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage)
No economic value will be captured and approximately 83 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways
as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across 13,766 acres is approximately
$18,897,800. It has also been estimated to take about 2313 days to achieve, totaling 942 jobs and
$28,268,200 in wages. This alternative 3 provides about 3.6 times the jobs and wages than alternative 1,
2.6 times the jobs and wages of alternative 2, 2.8 times the jobs and wages for alternatives 4, and 4.5 time
the jobs and wages of Alternative 5.
Cumulative Effects
Past and present actions are the same in this Alternative (3) as in Alternative 1. However, Alternative 3
has an additional 700 acres of proposed salvage for a total of 1,400 acres in the foreseeable future.
Resultantly, the sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 15,200 acres. This
equates to 2,167 jobs and $93,662,600 wages in the private sector, assuming 306 MMBF within the next 5
years (2020). In other words, it’s 99 more jobs and $4,325,215 more wages in the private sector than
Alternative 1.

Alternative 4
Direct and Indirect Effects
Salvage
Approximately 1.78 MMBF of publically-owned wood worth $356,968 will be sold, harvested, brought
to a local mill and processed in the domestic marketplace. Over 12 private sector jobs would be sustained
for one year, totaling $546,149 in annual wages. This alternative provides about six times fewer private
sector jobs and wages than alternative 1, about 8 times fewer private sector jobs and wages than
alternative 2 and just over 12 times fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3. No private sector jobs and
wages are provided in alternatives 5 and 6 for comparison.
Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at 2015
board feet volume (2.21 MMBF) for a total cost of $299,552. If delayed until 2017 or beyond, revenue
from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments and NPV will be less
than zero (2017 NPV = -$130,159). There is a chance the Project will be rejected because it no longer has
economic viability.
Fuels Treatments (Outside Salvage)
No economic value will be captured and approximately 57 MMBF of fuels will be treated in various ways
as described in the Fuels Report. Total cost of those treatments across 5,731 acres is approximately
$7,110,200. It has also been estimated to take about 1176 days to achieve, totaling 332 jobs and
$9,971,000 in wages. This alternative 4 provides about 1.3 times the jobs and wages than alternative 1,
8% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 2, 65% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, and
approximately 1.6 times the jobs and wages of alternative 5.
Cumulative Effects
Past and present actions are the same in this Alternative (4) as in Alternative 1. However, Alternative 4
has 590 fewer acres of proposed salvage for a total of 110 acres in the foreseeable future. Resultantly, the
sum of both private and U.S. Forest Service future actions is about 13,910 acres. This equates to 1,983
jobs and $85,704,340 wages in the private sector, assuming 280 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020). In
other words, its 85 fewer jobs and $3,673,045 fewer wages in the private sector than Alternative 1.

325

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Alternative 5
Direct and Indirect Effects
This alternative does not generate any revenue from proposed treatments. The costs of all fuels treatments
is estimated to be approximately $10,517,200. The cost of fuels treatments would not be offset by any
volume removed from a salvage timber sale. However, the just over 4,000 acres of fuels treatments are
expected to take 2.9 years to achieve, totaling 212 jobs and $6,352,100 in wages. This alternative 5
provides about 20% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 1, 42% fewer jobs and wages than alternative
2, 78% fewer jobs and wages than alternative 3, and approximately 36% fewer jobs and wages as
alternative 4.
No private sector jobs and wages associated with the harvesting and processing of wood would be
supported. That’s a total of just over 80 jobs for $3,475,548 in annual wages compared with Alternative 1.
Some of the activities will be done by U.S. Forest Service fire and fuels personnel, but the proportion of
that work depends on available outyear funding and competing priorities, including fire suppression
needs.
Timber industry, including the last remaining sawmill in Trinity County would benefit from more wood
coming off U.S. Forest Service lands, but this Alternative would not contribute to that benefit. The $3.47
million in annual wages from Alternative 1 would not go back to the community through retail, food
services, manufacturing, wholesalers, etc. The Project will not send any wood to the mill for processing,
thereby reducing the contributed volume from U.S. Forest Service lands and increasing the pressure from
private sector lands to make up that difference.
Cumulative Effects
No harvest or processing under this project would place Trinity County below the State average of U.S.
Forest Service offerings, from 18% with Alternative 1 to less than 16%. A trend that may also be
exacerbated by wildfires and the exorbitant taxpayer cost associated with suppression activities. For
example, 568,600 acres have burned at mixed severities since 2005 in Trinity County alone for an average
cost approaching $1,000 per acre. What used to cost millions of dollars in recent years past is now costing
billions of dollars today. It’s having a significant effect on other U.S. Forest Service programs like
vegetation management, thereby reducing the probability of getting ahead of the issue by thinning forests
before wildfires and contributing a larger proportion of wood to the sawmill (Figure 3- 26). The more
fires are fought, the less wood will go to mills.

Alternative 6 – No Action
Direct, Indirect and Cumulative Effects
The U.S. Forest Service has been encouraged to provide opportunities that support local businesses in
rural communities like Trinity County. The no-action alternative will not support the local communities of
Trinity County. Rather, jeopardize human health and safety of those community members.
Roads will continue to be open, visitors and U.S. Forest Service personnel will have to access their lands
at their own risk. All of the standing hazards (fire-killed trees along roads) will eventually fall down and
slowly decay, with many of the trees striking the road. Those trees that do not strike the road will
accumulate and create a hazardous condition during the next wildfire. Fire fighters will not be able to
quickly respond to the next incident and protect the threatened communities. This is because fire behavior
will be too severe and unsafe to enter or exit along roads blocked by downed trees or under intense fire
conditions.
Loss of human life (greatest cost), Tort Claims on the U.S. Forest Service (costly and unpredictable),
increased intensity during the next wildfire (i.e. decreased success of wildfire suppression tactics) are
possible adverse effects if no action is taken to make roads safe. The local communities will not be
supported.

Economic Impacts of Decision Timing

An additional point to be considered is the effect of deterioration on timber yields. If a second year is to
pass before implementation of the project, the value of timber will have dropped below the cost for
activity generated fuels treatment (Figure 3- 25). The salvage and fuels treatment investments in 2016 is
worth from $43,687 - $1,293,914, depending on the selected alternative with salvage. However, if the
investment is made in 2017, then the investments worth becomes negative, ranging from -$130,159 to $642,644, depending on the selected alternative with salvage. The trees are losing their monetary value
rapidly and it’s just a matter of time before any investment will no longer be economically viable. If the
Project is not viable and cannot be sold, then jobs and wages of harvesting and processing wood products
are effected. Any investment in fuels treatments contribute to supporting jobs and wages in the local
community.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Archaeology/Heritage
Introduction

The Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project (Project) is a Section 106 action, and as such
an archaeological survey was carried out for the project area. The fire complexes being addressed in this
undertaking are located on the South Fork Management Unit and Trinity River Management Unit of the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest). A total of 18 sites lay within the Area of Potential Effect (APE)
for this project. Seven sites were severely affected by high intensity fire and two sites were impacted by
suppression work. To ensure the previously recorded sites will be protected, management measures
stipulated under the Programmatic Agreement among the U.S.D.A Forest Service, Pacific Southwest
Region (Region 5), California State Historic Preservation Officer, Nevada State Historic Preservation
Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the Processes for Compliance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for Management of Historic Properties by the
National Forests of the Pacific Southwest Region (Programmatic Agreement) 2012 shall be adhered to.

Proposed Actions and Alternatives Analyzed
See Chapter 2 for a full description of the project alternatives.

Methodology
Detailed Methodology

Archaeological survey methodology followed the procedures in APPENDIX H, REGION 5
HAZARDOUS FUELS PROTOCOL for NON-INTENSIVE INVENTORY STRATEGIES FOR
HAZARDOUS FUELS AND VEGETATION REDUCTION PROJECTS of the Programmatic
Agreement. These procedures correspond to a methodology followed for this Forest based on a predictive
model of site locations developed for the Shasta-Trinity National Forest by Theodoratus in 1981. This
model assumes that human habitation sites are going to be more likely on slopes of 0-15 percent. Level
ground is easier to camp and live on then steep ground. In this model Slopes between 0-15 percent are
considered areas of high sensitivity, 16-30 percent slopes are considered moderated and slopes greater
than 30 percent are considered low zones of archaeological sensitivity. The inventory strategy employed
is expected to be sufficient in identifying all historic properties that may be affected in the proposed
project’s APE (Theodoratus 1981). Reconnaissance survey of low sensitivity areas allowed for field
verification of slope and other sensitivity factors. All high zones of archaeological sensitivity within the
survey units, such as ridge tops, streams, terraces, saddles, and benches were inventoried.
Inventory was conducted along road margins and within the 300-foot buffer on either side of the 233
miles of roads identified in the Project. No inventory was conducted outside of the designated survey
units.
In addition to the salvage work, roads identified in the Sediment Source Inventory (SSI) needing
mitigation of erosion problems were examined. This work is needed to allow the Forest to obtain a Waiver
of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land
Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (“Waiver”).
Inventory was conducted as follows:


328

Intensive inventory strategy was employed whenever the slope was 30 percent or less within a
designated survey unit. Actual salvage logging and fuel reduction units were prioritized. Three
crew members were utilized for a majority of the survey work. Crewmembers were spaced no
more than 30 meters apart, beginning at the centerline of the road and lined up outwards into the
road side buffer. Transects were completed for a selected distance, and then reversed until the
entire survey unit was covered. Both sides of the road side buffers were inventoried in this

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

manner. All ridge tops, flats, streams, terraces, saddles, and benches were inventoried within
survey units.


Reconnaissance inventory strategy was employed where the slope was greater than 30 percent
within a designated survey unit. This inventory strategy was considered acceptable for these areas
due to safety concerns as well as low sensitivity for the presence of cultural resources. Areas were
spot-checked to verify assumed conditions of steep terrain. Binoculars were utilized if deemed
necessary to locate features such as structures, rock art, or small flat areas, or other high zones of
archaeological sensitivity.

Analysis Indicators

The affected resource area is called the Area of Potential Effect (APE). For Heritage resource
management analysis the APE is essentially the proposed project actions and area these actions will take
place within (treatment units). The APE has a total of 18 archaeological sites adjacent or within units
planned for salvage and fuel treatment.
Indicators for cultural resource management is the presence or absence of archaeological resources within
the project area that could be adversely effected by the proposed action. Recorded archaeological resource
sites will have management measures stipulated in the Programmatic Agreement applied to avoid any
adverse impacts from salvage or fuel treatment actions. These measures are from Appendix E of the
Programmatic Agreement, Standard Resource Protection Measures 1.0 Class I, and are as follows:


All historic properties shall be clearly delineated prior to implementing any associated activities
that have the potential to affect historic properties. Historic property boundaries shall be
delineated with coded flagging and/or other effective marking.



If mechanical equipment is used in treatment buffers, all recorded cultural and archaeological
resources will be flagged and avoided following the site protective guidelines in the Region 5
Section 106 Programmatic Agreement. However, vegetation within these sites can be removed
using tools such as hand tools, a grapple, or a rubber tired skidder so long as ground disturbance
is minimized and features avoided. Treatments within individual cultural and archeological sites
must be approved and monitored by a Forest Service archeologist.



Woody material may be chipped within the boundaries of historic properties so long as the
staging of chipping equipment on-site does not affect historic properties and staging areas are
specifically approved by HPMs or qualified Heritage Program staff.



Monitoring by heritage program specialists may be used to enhance the effectiveness of
protection measures.



The recorded historic properties will be noted in the contract as controlled areas to be avoided.
Contract administrators will insure these protective measures are followed.



If new cultural resources are discovered, all work in the vicinity will cease until qualified
Heritage Program staff examines and assesses the resource. Appropriate measures will be
undertaken to protect the new resource prior to activities resuming.

Spatial and Temporal Bounding of Analysis Area

The spatial bounding of the analysis area for Heritage is the proposed salvage and fuel treatment areas. It
is within this project area that the archaeological pre-field research and survey work focused.
The temporal bounding for effects to identified cultural resource sites are divided into short term and long
term. The short term effects would occur within one to two years during implementation of the proposed
action. Long term effects would occur up to 10 years after implementation is completed and may include
looting damage (due to soil surface visibility), until vegetation recovers.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Affected environment

The APE has a total of 18 archaeological sites adjacent or within units planned for salvage and fuel
treatment. Of this total 17 were previously recorded and one new site recorded. Seven sites were severely
impacted by high intensity fire on South Fork Mountain. The fires in this area burned at a high intensity
consuming all the live vegetation along with the heavy accumulation of fuels. This fuel loading
maintained a high heat over an extended period of time. This caused expansion of microscopic water in
the chert material resulting in spalling and shattering.

Environmental Consequences
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) and Alternative 2

The proposed hazard reduction, salvage, and road erosion mitigation for “North Coast Region Waiver”
actions will have no adverse effect to recorded archaeological sites because of the inclusion of then
archaeology resource protection measures. Alternative 2 even though it has more project acres will not
affect any additional recorded archaeological sites.
Direct and Indirect Effects
The RPMs for Cultural Resources will prevent any direct effects from the Alternatives 1 and 2. However,
indirect adverse effects may occur because the proposed salvage and fuel treatments may open up the
vegetation covering these sites within the APE, making them more vulnerable to looting. No known
archaeological sites will be affected by the connected actions.
Cumulative Effects
This project could have cumulative effects on cultural resources in the next ten years when combined with
the 2015 wildfires. Both the fires and the project open up ground visibility by removing vegetation, which
may make the cultural sites vulnerable to looting. Once vegetation is reestablished this cumulative effect
will be mitigated. The 2015 wildfires had direct negative impacts on cultural sites in the form of damage
from high temperatures; however, implementing the RPMs, and avoiding cultural sites, will prevent this
project from having direct impacts and thus prevents further cumulative impact on sites. Past effects to
these sites was logging and recreation use. By following the RPMs there should be no current or future
cumulative effects.

Alternative – 3

This alternative has the most proposed project acres; however, no additional sites will be impacted from
this alternative as determined from prefield research and survey work. The RPMs to be followed in
Alternative 1 and 2 will be adequate for Alternative 3. These measures will prevent, as in Alternatives 1
and 2, any direct adverse effects to recorded archaeological sites within the APE. Indirect adverse effects
may occur because the proposed salvage and fuel treatments may open up the vegetation covering these
sites within the APE, making them more vulnerable to looting. As in Alternatives 1 and 2 there have been
past effects from logging and recreation. Present and future cumulative will not occur due to the fact that
RPMs are in place.

Alternatives - 4-5

The salvage and fuels reduction proposed under Alternative 4 and the fuels reduction proposed under
Alternative 5 will not occur within the one newly recorded site or the previously recorded sites; therefore,
these activities will have no direct effects. No RPMs will be necessary even with salvage and fuels
reduction proposed under this alternative. However, the falling and leaving of hazardous dead trees and
vegetation on archaeological sites adds large (3 inch diameter or greater) thousand hour fuels. These fuels
have the potential to adversely affect lithic and organic cultural materials due to the high temperature of
combustion in the event of a future wildfire. Although dead trees could be directionally fell away from
these sites, many still have numerous dead trees within their boundaries. Dead trees felled within sites
will add to the untreated fuels already there. This will result in greater potential of adverse thermal
330

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

indirect effects. There have been past cumulative effects from logging and recreation. If there are heavy
fuels left on sites from hazard tree falling there will be current and future cumulative effects that could
adversely damage these archaeological sites.

Alternative 6 – No Action
Direct Effects and Indirect Effects
There will be no direct effects under the no action alternative. Indirect effects will be caused by untreated
fuel accumulation on recorded sites. Future wildland fires burning through these sites because of heavy
fuel loadings will cause thermal damage to chert and obsidian artifacts. Any organic cultural material will
be burned away.
Cumulative Effects
Under this alternative we will have no cumulative effects on cultural resources in the next ten years. As
stated in the cumulative effects statement for alternative 1 and 2, removal of vegetation does provide
better surface visibility. However, since there are no effects to sites under this alternative there will be no
cumulative effects.

Summary of Effects

Alternatives 1 and 2 will have the potential to effect 18 recorded archaeological sites. The increased
number of acres under Alternative 3 would not affect any additional archaeological site. This additional
acreage was checked for previously recorded sites but none were noted within this added area. Survey
work done for the project did not reveal any new sites within this added acreage. Impacts of Alternatives
1-3 would be reduced to zero with implementation of the RPMs. Alternatives 4 and 5 with their reduced
salvage acreage would not have treatments that occur within archeological sites, they too would have no
effect to recorded archaeological sites. Dead trees and vegetation that will be felled within a 300-foot
wide buffer on NFS lands along 233 miles of roads open to the public that burned during the 2015 will
have no immediate effect.
However, if Alternatives 4 or 5 are chosen, the falling of dead trees and vegetation within sites will add to
the untreated fuels already there. This will result in greater potential of adverse thermal effects from
wildland fire in the future.

Compliance with law, regulation, policy, and the Forest Plan

All historic sites within the APE will be protected and managed under the Programmatic Agreement.
Compliance with the Programmatic Agreement’s management stipulations for protecting and managing
heritage resources will meet the Forest’s Section 106 compliance obligations under the National Historic
Preservation Act for this undertaking.
At the end of each calendar year a report is generated by the Heritage staff listing various projects covered
under the Programmatic Agreement for that year. This report is sent to the State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO) and to the Regional Office for review. SHPO reviews this report to determine how well
the Forest is meeting the guidelines set in the Programmatic Agreement. This annual report is part of the
compliance process with SHPO in meeting the Forest’s Section 106 obligations under the National
Historic Preservation Act.

Inventoried Roadless Areas
Introduction

This section will analyze the effects of each alternative on Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) within the
project area. Alternatives 1-5 would result in treatments within IRA boundaries. Many of the acres
proposed for treatment are the outer edges of buffers originating from roads outside, but adjacent to the
IRAs. However, there are some roads proposed for treatment within the IRA boundaries as well.
Treatments have the potential to impact the Bell Quinby, Chanchelulla, Cow Creek, Little French Creek,
Pattison and Salt Gulch IRAs. The 2001 roadless rule identifies nine characteristics that are common to
most inventoried roadless areas. These will serve as the criteria by which treatments will be evaluated.

Regulatory Framework

For the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, the RARE II study identified 48 areas as roadless study areas
subject to evaluation for potential wilderness designation. Some of these areas were designated as
wilderness in the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the California Wilderness Act of 1984. Inventoried roadless
areas are identified in the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management Plan. Additionally, the 1984
California Wilderness Act released 29 inventoried RARE II roadless areas, to be managed for multipleuses other than wilderness (from Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, p.
3-24). These included Backbone, Bell-Quimby, Bonanza King, Castle Crags, Chanchelulla, China
Springs, Chinquapin, Cow Creek, Devils Rock, Dog Creek, Eagle: East Beegum, East Fork, East Girard,
Fisher Gulch, Kettle Mountain, Little French Creek, Mt. Shasta, Murphy Glade, Panther, Pattison, Penner
Ridge, Salt Gulch, Slate Creek, South Fork, Underwood, Wells Mountain, West Beegum, and West Girard
(from Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan Appendix C). They are
managed in accordance to the 2001 Roadless Rule.
In 2001, the Roadless Area Conservation Rule (36 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 294, Special Areas)
was adopted which changed how the Forest Service managed the inventoried roadless areas by
establishing nationwide prohibitions which generally limited, with some exceptions, timber harvest, road
construction, and road reconstruction within the areas because these activities “…have the greatest
likelihood of altering and fragmenting landscapes, resulting in immediate, long-term loss of roadless area
values and characteristics. Inventoried roadless areas provide clean drinking water and function as
biological strongholds for populations of threatened and endangered species. They provide large,
relatively undisturbed landscapes that are important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of
many at risk species. Inventoried roadless areas provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation,
opportunities that diminish as open space and natural settings are developed elsewhere. They also serve as
bulwarks against the spread of non-native invasive plant species and provide reference areas for study and
research”. [Roadless Rule, 2001] These nationally applied prohibitions superseded the land management
plan prescriptions for inventoried roadless areas.”
The 2001 Roadless Rule describes exemptions that can be applied to allow management activities within
the IRA. They are also described in 36 CFR 294.13. The exemption for the removal of hazard trees and
fireline construction is described in 36 CFR 294.13(b)(2). This exemption will be applied in all treatment
areas to fell hazard trees of any size and if needed to create adequate control features for prescribed fire
activities. The exemption for the removal of ladder fuels and other small diameter material to reduce the
risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects is described in 36 CFR 294.13(b)(1)(ii). This exemption will be
applied to remove generally small diameter material in order to meet fuels reduction objectives. For
Alternatives 1 and 4 only dead trees would be cut and for Alternatives 2 and 3 trees that had 60% or
greater risk of mortality or were already dead could be felled.

Methodology

The 2001 Roadless Rule identifies nine values or features that often characterize inventoried roadless
areas. They are: high quality or undisturbed soil, water, and air; sources of public drinking water;
332

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

diversity of plant and animal communities; habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate, and
sensitive species and for those species dependent on large, undisturbed areas of land; primitive, semiprimitive non-motorized, and semi-primitive motorized classes of dispersed recreation; reference
landscapes; natural appearing landscapes with high scenic quality; traditional cultural properties and
sacred sites; and other locally identified unique characteristics. Descriptions for each of these
characteristics is provided in Table 3-94.
Table 3-94. Descriptions of the nine roadless area characteristics (SS Fed. Reg. 3245).
Roadless Characteristics

Roadless Character Descriptions (66 Fed. Reg. 3245 (Jan. 12 2001))

High Quality or Undisturbed Soil,
Water and Air Resources

“These three key resources are the foundation upon which other resource
values and outputs depend. Healthy watersheds catch, store, and safely
release water over time, protecting downstream communities from flooding;
providing clean water for domestic, agricultural and industrial uses: helping
maintain abundant and healthy fish and wildlife populations; and are the
basis for many forms of outdoor recreation.”

Sources of Public Drinking Water

“Maintaining [watersheds contributing to drinking water] in a relatively
undisturbed condition saves downstream water filtration costs. Careful
management of these watersheds is crucial in maintaining the flow and
affordability of clean water to a growing population.”

Diversity of Plant and Animal
Communities

“Roadless areas are more likely than roaded areas to support greater
ecosystem health, including the diversity of native and desired nonnative
plant and animal communities due to the absence of disturbances caused
by roads and accompanying activities. Inventoried roadless areas also
conserve native biodiversity by serving as a bulwark against the spread of
nonnative invasive species.”

Habitat for Threatened,
Endangered, Proposed, Candidate,
and Sensitive Species and Species
Dependent on Large Undisturbed
Areas of Land

“Roadless areas serve as biological strong holds and refuges for many
species. Roadless areas support a diversity of aquatic habitats and
communities, providing or affecting habitat for more than 280 TES species.”

Primitive and Semi-Primitive Nonmotorized, and Semi- primitive
Motorized classes of Dispersed
Recreation

“Roadless areas often provide outstanding dispersed recreation
opportunities such as hiking, camping, picnicking, wildlife viewing, hunting,
fishing, cross-country skiing and canoeing. These areas can also take
pressure off heavily used wilderness areas by providing solitude and quiet,
and dispersed recreation opportunities.”

Reference Landscapes

“Reference landscapes of relatively undisturbed areas serve as a barometer
to measure the effects of development on other parts of the landscape

Natural Appearing Landscapes
with High Scenic Quality

“High quality scenery, especially scenery with natural-appearing
landscapes, is a primary reason that people choose to recreate. In addition,
quality scenery contributes directly to real estate values in nearby
communities and residential areas.”

333

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Roadless Characteristics

Roadless Character Descriptions (66 Fed. Reg. 3245 (Jan. 12 2001))

Traditional cultural properties and
sacred sites

“Traditional cultural properties are places, sites, structures, art, or objects
that have played an important role in the cultural history of a group. Sacred
sites are places that have special religious significance to a group.
Traditional cultural properties and sacred sites may be eligible for protection
under the National Historic Preservation Act. However, many of them have
not yet been inventoried, especially those that occur in inventoried roadless
areas.”

Other locally identified unique
characteristics

“Inventoried roadless areas may offer other locally identified unique
characteristics and values. Examples include uncommon geological
formations, which are valued for their scientific and scenic qualities, or
unique wetland complexes. Unique social, cultural or historical
characteristics may also depend on the roadless character of the landscape.
Examples include ceremonial sites, places for local events, areas prized for
collection of non- timber forest products or exceptional hunting and fishing
opportunities.”

Information pertaining to the methodology used to assess the affects to high quality or undisturbed soil,
water and air resources; sources of public drinking water; diversity of plant and animal communities;
habitat for threatened, endangered, proposed, candidate, and sensitive species and species dependent on
large undisturbed areas of land; and, traditional cultural properties and sacred sites can be found in the
specialist reports for botany, wildlife, heritage, hydrology, and soils.
To assess the effects of the treatments on primitive, semi-primitive non-motorized, and semi-primitive
motorized dispersed recreation classes, the limits of acceptable change characterized by the recreation
opportunity spectrum will be used. Of the seven setting indicators used to describe each level of the
spectrum, naturalness is the element most likely to be impacted by the action alternatives. This setting
indicator refers to the degree of naturalness of the setting; it affects psychological outcomes associated
with enjoying nature and utilizes visual quality objectives to describe acceptable conditions.
The presence of large contiguous areas of unmanaged land will be used to evaluate the effects of
treatments on the reference landscape characteristic. The arrangement of new treatment areas on the
landscape relative to existing patterns will be considered.
The natural appearing landscapes with high scenic quality characteristic will be evaluated with respect to
patterns across the landscape as well as what a typical user will likely see when traveling through the
IRAs.
No locally identified unique characteristics will be evaluated.

Affected Environment
Existing Condition

This section will provide descriptions for each IRA as stated in Appendix C of the Final Environmental
Impact Statement for the Shasta-Trinity National Forests Land and Resource Management Plan as well as
other characteristics relevant to this project. The miles of road within a quarter mile of each IRA is
provided in this section to show how relatively un-roaded the IRAs are compared to adjacent lands. It is
also presented to highlight the fact that many of the treatment areas within the IRA are the result of the
treatment buffer placed on roads that are adjacent to, but not within the IRAs. Treatments proposed to

334

Final Environmental Impact Statement

mitigate hazards along open roads, within the fire footprints, both adjacent to and within the IRAs are
included in the effects analysis.
Bell Quinby
The Bell Quinby IRA is comprised of 11,707 acres. This area is located approximately six miles north of
Burnt ranch on the west side of the New River drainage. It is almost entirely surrounded by roads and is
bounded on the north by the Trinity Alps Wilderness. The area is extremely rugged and steep with
elevations ranging from 1,380 feet along New River and Quinby Creek to 5,864 feet at the north end of
the unit. Vegetation ranges from mixed conifer species on the north slopes to brush fields and hardwoods
on the south slopes. Present recreation use centers around hiking along a jeep and foot trail that runs
through the unit (Forest Plan FEIS, C-9).
Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 11,556 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This
includes the 1999 Megram Fire (11,507 acres) and the 2015 River Complex (11,555 acres).
There are currently 2.60 miles of National Forest System (NFS) roads within the Bell Quinby IRA. This
includes portions of 7N12A, 7N18, 7N28, 6N06, 7N20, 7N22, and 07N26. There is an additional 0.1
miles of non-National Forest System road within the IRA (U7N04A, U402A, U402B). Expanding the
area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 13.14 miles of NFS
roads and 10.79 miles of non-NFS roads.
Chanchelulla
The Chanchelulla IRA is comprised of 3,865 acres. This area is located approximately 10 miles southeast
of the community of Hayfork adjacent to the Chanchelulla Wilderness. Elevation ranges from 2,700 feet
near the East Fork of Hayfork Creek to about 5,000 feet in the southeast corner along the Wilderness
boundary. Vegetation consists of extensive brush fields on south-facing slopes and mixed conifer on
north-facing ones. Significant commercial sized timber stands are found in the area. The area contains
deer habitat. There are some trails in the area. Present dispersed recreation use is very low and occurs
primarily as fishing (Forest Plan FEIS, C-9).
Until 2015 this IRA had experienced very little, if any, wildfire activity. Approximately 3,890 acres of the
IRA burned in the 2015 Shiell fire.
There are currently 0.8 miles of National Forest System road within the Chanchelulla IRA. This includes
portions of 31N04 and 31N04A. There is an additional 0.81 miles of County road (302) within the IRA.
Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 4.4
miles of NFS roads and 5.7 miles of non-NFS roads.
Cow Creek
The Cow Creek IRA is comprised of 23,152 acres. This area is located about 30 miles west of Weaverville
north of U.S. Highway 299. Elevations range from 5,255 feet at Ironside Mountain to 1,500 feet in the
Trinity and New River canyons. Rock bluffs and steep talus slopes are predominant throughout the area.
Vegetation consists of mixed conifer, oak, chaparral, digger pine, and manzanita. Present dispersed
recreation use is confined along the Trinity River and New River. Fishing, rafting, hiking, and hunting
occur within this corridor (Forest Plan FEIS, C-10).
Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 27,116 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This
includes the 1999 Onion Fire (9,882 acres), the 2008 Ironside and Ziegler Fires (10,877 acres and 2,169
acres) and the 2015 River Complex (10,627 acres).
There are currently 0.98 miles of National Forest System roads within the Cow Creek IRA. This includes
portions of 5N18B, 5N24, and 5N04. There is an additional 0.39 miles of non-NFS road (U402C and
5N28) within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there
are an additional 25.89 miles of NFS roads and 22.41 miles of non-NFS roads.

Little French Creek
The Little French Creek IRA is comprised of 11,227 acres. This area is adjacent to and bounded on the
north by the Trinity Alps Wilderness. It is located north of the town of Big Bar and about 21 air miles
from Weaverville. The area is characterized by rugged terrain and steep slopes. Vegetation consists of
brush fields, hardwoods, and digger pine at lower elevations (1,400 feet) while the higher elevations
(approximately 5,900 feet) support mixed conifer stands. The area is used as an entrance to the southern
edges of the Trinity Alps Wilderness area (Forest Plan FEIS, C-11).
Between 1999 and 2015, approximately 10,761 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This
includes the 1999 Onion Fire (7 acres), the 2003 Loma Fire (2,434 acres), the 2006 Bake Oven-Pigeon
Fires (4,226 acres), the 2008 Buckhorn Fire (1,827 acres) and the 2015 River Complex (2,520 acres).
There are currently 5.01 miles of National Forest System roads within the Little French Creek IRA. This
includes portions of 5N16A, 5N32, 6N19, 5N04M, 33N71, 6N04, 5N13, 5N16, 5N37, 33N46, 34N14B,
34N07Y, 34N14, 33N46A, 6N04C, and 5N04. There is an additional 0.64 miles of County road (421 and
426) and 0.71 miles of private road (6N04D) within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a
quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an additional 28.21 miles of NFS roads and 21.17 miles of
non-NFS roads.
Pattison
The Pattison IRA is comprised of 28,326 acres. This area is located 14 miles northwest of the Hayfork
valley. It is located equidistant from the Trinity Alps Wilderness to the north and the Yolla Bolly-Middle
Eel Wilderness to the south. Elevations range from 1,650 feet along Hayfork Creek to more than 5,100
feet near Pattison Peak. Vegetation consists of large brush fields, mixed conifer timber stands, and true fir
communities. At least one cultural site (an Indian village) is known to exist. The area provides habitat for
some older over-mature dependent species as well as bear (Forest Plan FEIS, C-11). Recreation in the
IRA includes hiking, hunting and fishing.
Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 27,116 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one. This
includes the 1987 Bear and Gulch Fires (3,449 acres and 130 acres), the 2001 Hyampom Fire (262 acres),
the 2008 Eagle and Miners Fires (11 acres and 20,542 acres) and the 2015 Pattison Fire (6,834 acres).
There are currently 12.44 miles of National Forest System roads within the Pattison IRA. This includes
portions of 3N05B, 3N05F, 4N29, 32N31, 3N02, 3N46, 4N40, 32N30A, 33N68, 32N26, 32N16,
32N16B, 32N29, 31N50, 3N22, and 3N05. There is an additional 5.71 miles of County (301) or Private
(3N04Y and U32N29AA) roads within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of
the IRA boundary there are an additional 35.04 miles of NFS roads and 12.88 miles of non-NFS roads.
Salt Gulch
The Salt Gulch IRA is comprised of 6,657 acres. The area has been substantially roaded since the RARE
II roadless inventory. It is located approximately nine miles southeast of the community of Hayfork.
Elevations range from 2,800 feet near Hayfork Creek to over 4,300 feet. The area is generally situated on
a large, highly dissected ridge which forms a divide between Salt Creek and Hayfork Creek. Vegetation
consists of Douglas-fir-pine-mixed conifer forests on moist, north slopes, mixed conifer forests on the less
moist, north-facing slopes. And woodland-chaparral on the south-facing, dry slopes of the unit. The area
contains wildlife habitat for deer. Timber harvest has occurred in the area in the past. Present recreation
use is low and consists mainly of fishing (Forest Plan FEIS, C-12).
Between 1987 and 2015, approximately 6,060 acres of the IRA has experienced at least one fire. This
includes the 2008 Telephone Fire (2,960 acres) and the 2015 Rail and Shiell Fires (1,706 acres and 1,508
acres).
There are currently 10.98 miles of National Forest System road within the Salt Gulch IRA. This includes
portions of 30N22M, 30N62, 30N22A, 30N22J, 30N40, 30N22G, 30N22K, 30N43, 30N43A, 30N22,

30N22D, 30N22H, 30N22L and 30N62A. There is an additional 0.14 miles of non-NFS road (U30N22N)
within the IRA. Expanding the area of interest to within a quarter mile of the IRA boundary there are an
additional 8.15 miles of NFS roads and 8.96 miles of non-NFS roads.

Desired Condition

Each IRA is comprised of a unique blend of habitats, species, and recreational opportunities. Rather than
describing the ideal mix for each IRA potentially impacted by the project, the desired condition can be
summed up by the ecosystem services this designation is intended to provide for current and future
generations.
“Inventoried roadless areas provide clean drinking water and function as biological strongholds for
populations of threatened and endangered species. They provide large, relatively undisturbed landscapes
that are important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of many at risk species. Inventoried
roadless areas provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation, opportunities that diminish as open
space and natural settings are developed elsewhere. They also serve as bulwarks against the spread of
non-native invasive plant species and provide reference areas for study and research.” (66 Fed. Reg. 3244,
3245 (Jan 12, 2001)).

Environmental Consequences
Alternative Descriptions

A full description of treatment alternatives is described in Chapter 2. This section summarizes the type
and amount of treatments proposed in the inventoried roadless areas. The Roadside treatments include
hazard tree abatement, commercial timber removal, fuels treatments and maintenance, planting and
reforestation release elements of each alternative. Since all temporary road use, road maintenance and
road reconstruction activities are imbedded within the analyses for soil, hydrology and fisheries (see those
sections for details), these activities will not be explicitly discussed in this section. All acres referenced in
the environmental consequences section are approximate.
Alternative 1 – Proposed Action
This alternative would impact 226 acres across all six IRAs. Impacts within individual roadless areas
range from a low of 6 acres in the Pattison IRA to a high of 62 acres in Salt Gulch IRA. Table 3-95

Alternative 6 – No Action
As the name implies, this alternative would not implement any treatment activities on the landscape,
including within the IRAs.

Direct, Indirect Effects
Alternatives 1-5
The direct and indirect effects for alternatives 1-5 will be similar. The primary difference between
alternatives is the total area and types of proposed treatments within the IRAs. Alternative 3 would result
in the largest treated area with a footprint of 742 acres. Alternative 4 would result in the least amount of
treated area with a footprint of 210 acres. Alternatives 1, 2 and 5 fall in-between with total footprints of
226, 432 and 226 acres respectively.
High Quality or Undisturbed Soil, Water, and Air
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on soil, water and air, refer to
the air quality and physical sciences specialist reports or their corresponding sections in this Chapter.
Soil & Water
Impacts described in this paragraph pertain to all treatment areas including those within the IRAs. Direct
effects of proposed treatments on the soil ecosystem include soil disturbance, redistribution of organic
matter and changes in biological properties. With the resource protection measures in place, expected
compaction from mechanical operations will only increase by an average of 2 to 4% on 40% of the unit,
leaving about 60% of each unit undisturbed and well below soil quality standards for compaction and
extent of disturbance. Indirect effects of compaction, reduced vegetative cover and soil displacement
include increased potential for rilling and erosion. However, soil cover will be improved by 15 to 35% by
lopping and scattering tree tops and limbs. This will help reduce erosion potential. With soil resource
protection measures in place, impacts to soils within treatment units will be minor and within thresholds
described in the Forest Plan. Due to the limited area treated, any mitigating effects are small compared to
the widespread damage created by the fires, resulting in insignificant changes in landslide potential.
Alternative 3 and Alternative 5 will result in the greatest and least impacts to soils within the IRAs.
Resource protection measures incorporated into each alternative will minimize direct impacts to water
sources. Treatments may indirectly impact water quality by changing the amount and timing of sediment
339

Final Environmental Impact Statement

delivery into the stream and changing the water temperature. Felling of trees within riparian reserves can
potentially reduce stream shade. Additionally, sediment deposits have the potential to create a wider,
shallower stream which can also increase temperatures. Coarse woody debris in the stream channels
should minimize this potential since they capture sediment before it can be deposited downstream and
help form deeper pools.
Air
Pile burning and jackpot burning in and adjacent to the IRAs will create smoke reducing air quality and
visibility within the IRAs. Given the ability to control ignition times to favor good smoke dispersion, it is
not anticipated that prescribed burning would impact the local communities. Due to the relative positions
of the IRAs to the communities, it is likely burning will occur on days that will disperse smoke in the
direction of the IRAs. Smoke may settle in drainages overnight. Most likely the total emissions occurring
on a particular burn day may not be allowed to exceed 100-200 tons of PM2.5 irrespective of the action
alternative. The amount of smoke produced is directly related to the number of acres treated with some
form of prescribed fire. Alternative 3 will produce the most CO2 equivalent metric tons of greenhouse gas
emissions, followed by Alternative 2, Alternative 1, and Alternative 4.
Alternative 5 does not implement any treatments within the IRA boundary. However, it will implement
prescribed fire treatments adjacent to the IRAs which will create smoke. The impacts of this smoke on the
IRA will be similar to those described for Alternatives 1-4. However, since Alternative 5 has the fewest
treatment acres, the amount of smoke produced and potentially impacting the IRAs will be less than all of
the other action alternatives.
Sources of Public Drinking Water
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on sources of public drinking
water, refer to the hydrology specialist report or the hydrology section in chapter 3 of the EIS.
Treatment activities can result in sediment directly entering streams from felled trees or increased use of
stream crossings on roads. Water temperature can increase as a result of decreased shading from riparian
vegetation as well as channel widening occurring after increased sedimentation. Large woody debris in
the streams will help capture sediment to help maintain or increase pool depths. Project resource
protection measures will minimize impacts of treatment activities on water quality (both from sediment
and temperature). It is anticipated that increases in stream temperatures will be negligible.
The Middle South Fork Trinity River, Upper Hayfork Creek, New River, and Burnt Ranch watersheds
(HUC5) all contain some IRA. In the Middle South Fork Trinity River watershed, the Sulphur Glade
Creek – Waldorf Flat subwatershed would be over the threshold of concern for all alternatives. Hitchcock
Creek – Oak Flat subwatershed would have high to very high disturbance levels, but remain under the
threshold of concern for both Alternative 1 and Alternative 2. In the Upper Hayfork Creek watershed, a
subdrainage of Halls City Creek – Wilson Creek would have a very high disturbance level for Alternative
3. The New River and Burnt Ranch watersheds are under the threshold of concern for all alternatives.
Diversity of Plant and Animal Communities
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on plant and animal species,
refer to the botany, wildlife and fisheries specialist reports or their corresponding sections in this Chapter.
Plant Communities
The biggest threat to native plant diversity in the project area is the introduction of invasive, non-native
weeds. Species diversity is typically high in healthy, intact native plant communities. Introduction of
invasive species that are better competitors for limited water and nutrients almost always trigger a
decrease in native species diversity in surrounding plant communities. Invasive species communities can
be dominated by as few as a single weed species that cannot possibly provide the diverse habitat and
forage benefits that the native communities they displaced provided. Invasive weeds are present along
340

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

most roadsides throughout the project area. Proposed treatments will increase bare, mineral soil that
provides habitat for invasive, non-native weeds.
All ground disturbing treatments will create or increase bare, mineral soil providing habitat for nonnative, invasive species. Resource protection measures are included in the project design to reduce weed
introduction and spread into the project area, but they are unlikely to stop it entirely. The magnitude of
invasive weed displacement depends on how much soil gets disturbed and the proximity of the newly
exposed sites to existing populations.
Overall, Roadside treatments under Alternative 3 will create soil disturbance on the most acres in the
project, and has the greatest potential to introduce or spread invasive weeds and reduce native species
diversity. Impacts from Alternatives 1, 2, 4 and 5 will be less than those from Alternative 3.
Animal Communities
The relatively narrow zone of treatment limits the potential for treatments to fragment habitat in ways
meaningfully measurable to wildlife species. Due to the proximity of treatments to roads, species present
in and adjacent to the treatment areas have likely become somewhat habituated to human disturbance
because of the effects of the existing road system and associated traffic. It is not anticipated that the
treatments will have any measurable effects to diversity in the animal community.
Habitat for Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, Candidate, and Sensitive Species and for Those
Species Dependent on Large, Undisturbed Areas of Land
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on special status species and
species dependent on large undisturbed areas, refer to the botany and wildlife specialist reports or the
botany and wildlife sections in this Chapter.
Plant Species
There are no federally-listed plant species within the IRAs. There are also no botanical species that
require large, undisturbed areas of land to persist within any of the IRAs. Sensitive botanical species
populations are rare and restricted in size by definition.
None of the sixteen Sensitive botanical species that have suitable habitat in proposed treatment areas have
populations within any of the six IRAs. There will be no loss of protected botanical species integrity in
IRAs from the proposed treatments under any alternative.
Animal Species
Species that need large, undisturbed areas are unlikely to inhabit the project area, including the IRAs,
which has been subject to timber harvest, road building and other human influences for over a century.
Species requiring undisturbed areas are much more likely to occur in more secluded places such as
Wilderness or remote portions of the IRAs.
Roadside treatments that remove habitat suitable for a given wildlife species will decrease the total habitat
available for that species, and may also decrease the value of adjacent habitats by fragmenting it. Hazard
tree abatement and potential log removal through commercial salvage is likely to have the greatest effect
on wildlife species of concern. The overall size of the treatment area and the extent of hazard tree
abatement and salvage will therefore be the primary factors determining the effects of a given alternative
on wildlife species of concern.
Since the focus of this project is on treatment of dead vegetation, effects to habitat suitability for protected
wildlife species are much more limited than they would be if the focus was on removal of living trees.
Forest stands that retain high levels of canopy cover are valuable to these species. These areas have a
much lower incidence of fire-killed trees that may be felled/removed by project activities compared to
areas where fire severity and tree mortality was high. As a result, fewer trees will be felled and/or
removed, and project effects will be lower than in areas of high fire severity. The areas that will receive
341

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

the most intensive treatments are those most heavily affected by wildfire, and these habitats provide the
least benefit to the majority of protected wildlife species. Riparian habitats are also especially valuable to
wildlife, and riparian protections built into the project resource protection measures will also greatly limit
potential effects to these wildlife species.
The biological assessment for impacts to northern spotted owl determined that all treatments (within and
outside the IRAs) are likely to adversely affect northern spotted owl and its critical habitat. Treatments in
the IRAs represent such a small portion of the overall treatment area, it is unlikely that leaving the IRAs
untreated would alter the overall effects determinations for northern spotted owl and its associated critical
habitat.
Aquatic Species
The Trinity River system including the New River, the South Fork Trinity River and many of their
tributaries are considered essential fish habitat for coho and Chinook salmon and is designated as critical
habitat for the Southern Oregon Northern California Coasts (SONCC) Evolutionarily Significant Unit of
coho salmon. Other species of interest in this river system include Upper Klamath-Trinity Rivers Chinook
salmon, Klamath Mountains Province steelhead trout, pacific lamprey, spring-run Chinook salmon,
summer steelhead (South Fork Trinity only) and resident rainbow trout.
There are several rivers and creeks that flow within or adjacent to IRAs that are considered critical habitat
for coho salmon. Hayfork Creek flows within and adjacent to the Chanchelulla IRA and the East Fork
Hayfork Creek marks the northern boundary of the IRA. Salt Creek flows adjacent to the Salt Creek IRA
while one of its tributaries, Deer Gulch, flows within the IRA. The Pattison IRA contains portions of
Hayfork Creek as well as several tributaries including Corral Creek, Miner’s Creek, West Fork Miner’s
Creek, Bear Creek and Little Creek. The Trinity River flows adjacent to the Little French Creek IRA as
well as within and adjacent to the Cow Creek IRA. Manzanita Creek, Prairie Creek, Little French Creek,
Big French Creek and Italian Creek are all tributaries to the Trinity River that flow in Little French Creek
IRA. Don Juan Creek and the New River are Trinity River tributaries flowing in the Cow Creek IRA. The
New River also flows adjacent to the Bell Quinby IRA. Although all of this critical habitat exists within
the impacted IRAs, only the portion of Hayfork Creek adjacent to the Chanchelulla IRA and the portion
of New River between Bell Quinby and Cow Creek IRAs are in close proximity to proposed treatments.
The biological assessment and the biological evaluation – management indicator species reports
determined that all of the action alternatives (within and outside the IRAs) may affect, but is not likely to
adversely affect SONCC coho salmon and SONCC coho salmon Critical Habitat. They also determined
that there would be no adverse effects to Essential Fish Habitat. A trend toward listing under the ESA is
not anticipated and viability of Forest Service sensitive species is not at risk.
Primitive, Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized, and Semi-Primitive Motorized Classes of Dispersed
Recreation
A very short section of NFS Road 33N68 intersects the Patterson IRA which is classified as semiprimitive non-motorized. The semi-primitive non-motorized class is the most restrictive in treated areas
requiring a visual quality objective of preservation or retention to meet the naturalness setting indicator
(ROS Field Guide). All of the remaining treatments within IRAs occur within the roaded natural and
semi-primitive Motorized classes of dispersed recreation. These areas provide more flexibility allowing
for a visual quality objective or modification in roaded natural and partial retention in semi-primitive
motorized (ROS Field Guide).
The most effective way to meet retention is to repeat form, line, color, texture, pattern and scale common
to the valued landscape character being viewed (USDA, 1995d). If this is done well the management
activities blend into the surrounding landscape so the change is not evident. The 33N68 was used as a
control line during fire suppression activities including felling hazardous trees and clearing brush. The
proposed treatments are similar to these types of activities and will likely blend well with the current
342

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

conditions. Additionally the portion of this treatment within the IRA is less than five acres on a short
section of a much larger road that is being treated. It is likely that without treatment, this small area would
stand out rather than blending in with its surroundings.
The partial retention and modification visual quality objectives allow for management to be more evident.
Treatments along the roads both in and out of the IRAs will provide for a consistent visual experience in
the foreground, which will likely include evidence of management.
Reference Landscapes
A majority of the treatment acres proposed in these alternatives are the result of roadside treatments along
roads outside of, but adjacent to, the IRAs. Approximately 33 miles of National Forest System roads and
8 miles of non-National Forest System roads exist within the IRAs. However, only 7.38 of those miles are
proposed for treatment. This includes portions of: 07N26, 6N06, 7N28 and U402B in Bell Quinby; 5N04
in Cow Creek; 6N04C in Little French Creek; 31N04 and County Road 302 in Chanchelulla; and 30N22
in Salt Gulch.
Collectively all treatments proposed in IRAs would directly impact less than 1 percent of the total
combined area of the IRAs. Alternative 3 would have the largest footprint touching 0.87 percent of the
IRAs. The treatment footprint for Alternative 2 covers 0.51 percent of the area while Alternatives 1 and 5
cover 0.27 percent and Alternative 4 covers 0.22 percent. Impacts to individual IRAs range from 3.19
percent of Chanchelulla IRA impacted under Alternative 3 to 0.02 percent of Pattison IRA impacted in
Alternatives 1, 4 and 5. Table 104 shows the relative footprint of the proposed treatments under each
alternative compared to the total IRA area.
The amount of treated area within the IRA is very small compared to the total area and it is concentrated
along existing motorized travel corridors. Additionally the proposed fuels treatments will reduce fire
loading adjacent to these roads which will also reduce the potential for human caused fires to burn in or
adjacent to the IRA in the future. Therefore, all of these alternatives will maintain the integrity of the
larger reference landscape.
Table 3-100 shows the total number of acres in each inventoried roadless area, the total treatment
footprint acres for each alternative in each inventoried roadless area and then calculates the percentage of
area proposed for treatment.

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Natural Appearing Landscapes with High Scenic Quality
Treatments will be limited to a buffer no greater than 600 feet across centered on the road. Of the 233
miles of road proposed for treatments only 7 miles are directly within the IRA. The treatments on these 7
miles will alter the naturally appearing landscape in the short term as treatments are being implemented
and medium term as cut stumps and boles are visible on the landscape. Once the understory vegetation
begins to recover the visual impacts of the stumps will diminish as they become hidden by shrubs and
young trees. All of the other treatments that impact the IRA are the outer edge of buffers on roads outside
of, but adjacent to, the IRAs. It is likely that users of these roads will experience the same signs of
management, however due to the distance to the IRA boundary will unlikely be able to distinguish the
boundary between the IRA and non-IRA. Additionally the treatments follow already established road
corridors in and adjacent to the IRAs there will be minimal impacts to the scenic quality and natural
appearance of the larger landscape.
Traditional Cultural Properties and Sacred Sites
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of these alternatives on traditional cultural
properties and sacred sites, refer to the heritage specialist report or the heritage section in this Chapter.
With the use of resource protection measures that require treatments to be excluded from sacred sites,
there will be little if any impact to known historic or archaeological sites within the project area, including
any found within the IRAs. Additionally, there are no known traditional cultural properties that will be
impacted by treatments.
Alternative 6
Since there will be no treatments implemented by this alternative, there will be no direct impacts to the
IRAs. The ecological processes at work within the IRAs will continue.
High Quality or Undisturbed Soil, Water, and Air
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of alternative 6 on soil, water and air, refer to the
air quality and physical sciences specialist reports or their corresponding sections in this Chapter.
Soil & Water
Under alternative 6, there would be no new disturbance resulting from forest management activities,
however existing disturbance would persist. No new adverse effects would result from this action, but in
some locations productivity potential in the short term may not be as high when compared to Alternatives
1-5 because past disturbance would not be alleviated through increases in soil cover. Hydrologic function,
compaction, and soil disturbance would remain at existing levels. Organic matter remaining after the 2015
wildfires would not be disturbed by management. However, soil cover standards would continue to not be
met and erosion potential will remain high due to the length of time for the litter/duff layer to rebuild.
Additionally, in the event of another wildfire, the chances of high-severity fire effects on soils can be
much higher in areas with excessively heavy fuel loads compared to those that have been treated.
Including salvage logging treatments. Additionally, future high severity fires would have an increased
probability for landslides.
Air
Alternative 6 does not implement any treatments. Therefore, there will be no impacts to high quality air
from management activities. Modeling results of a wildfire occurring in the next 20 years suggest that at
least 10 percent more greenhouse gasses would be released if no management occurs than any action
alternative, including emissions due to treatment and subsequent wildfire. Timing of this release is also
significant since all of the emissions would occur in one event under Alternative 6 and would be spread
over several years for all other Alternatives.

Sources of Public Drinking Water
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of Alternative 6 on sources of public drinking
water, refer to the hydrology specialist report or the hydrology section of this Chapter.
Existing beneficial uses of water for the Trinity River and South Fork Trinity River include: municipal,
domestic, agricultural and industrial supply; ground water recharge and freshwater replenishment;
navigation; hydropower generation; recreation and fish and wildlife habitat. Portions of both river systems
are currently listed as 303d for high levels of sediment. Some sections are also temperature impaired.
Of the watersheds evaluated for cumulative watershed effects Middle South Fork Trinity River, Upper
Hayfork Creek, Burnt Ranch and New River include portions of the IRAs. Based on the cumulative
watershed effects analysis Middle South Fork Trinity River and Burnt Ranch watersheds have a moderate
risk ratio. This means that the potential for increases in sediment are small and there is no anticipated
impact to water quality. Conversely, Upper Hayfork Creek and New River all have a low risk ratio. This
means that the potential for increased sediment is not measurable or negligible with respect to magnitude,
extent and duration.
Diversity of Plant and Animal Communities
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of Alternative 6 on plant and animal species, refer
to the botany and wildlife specialist reports or the botany and wildlife sections of this Chapter.
Plant Communities
The biggest threat to species diversity in the project area is the introduction and spread of non-native
invasive species. The 2015 fires created patches of bare mineral soil, which can be a good seed bed for
both native and non-native species. Precautions were taken during fire suppression and fire rehabilitation
efforts to minimize the introduction of non-native species in order to favor the seeding and development
of native communities. Post-fire early seral habitats are very diverse, often including species that hadn’t
been present on the site for decades due to increased canopy cover and resulting change in microclimates.
Species diversity will likely be higher compared to pre-fire conditions as a result of these post-fire early
seral habitats. This diversity will continue until these habitats mature and begin to get shaded out
becoming similar in species composition to the surrounding shrub and/or forested stands. Species
diversity is typically high in healthy, intact native plant communities.
Animal Communities
Many of the IRAs are already bisected by roads. It is likely that species living in these areas have become
somewhat habituated to humans using these corridors. The effects of the 2015 fires may result in the
expansion, contraction or creation of some habitat types. For example there is less old growth on the
landscape which has been replaced with early seral habitat. This will benefit some species already
inhabiting the area. It will cause others to move to new areas, and it will create habitat for new species to
move into the area. Diversity has likely remained stable.
Habitat for Threatened, Endangered, Proposed, Candidate, and Sensitive Species and for Those
Species Dependent on Large, Undisturbed Areas of Land
For a more in depth description of the potential impacts of Alternative 6 on special status species and
species dependent on large undisturbed areas, refer to the botany, fisheries, and wildlife specialist reports
or the botany, fisheries, and wildlife sections in this chapter
Plant Species
There are no federally-listed plant species or botanical species that large, undisturbed areas of land to
persist within any of the six IRAs. Sensitive botanical species populations are rare and restricted in size
by definition. None of the sixteen Sensitive botanical species that have suitable habitat in proposed
treatment areas have populations within any of the six IRAs.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Animal Species
Species that need large, undisturbed areas are unlikely to inhabit the project area, including the IRAs,
which have been subject to timber harvest, road building and other human influences for over a century.
Species requiring undisturbed areas are much more likely to occur in more secluded places such as
Wilderness or remote portions of the IRAs.
This alternative would authorize no federal actions and have no direct or indirect effects on Northern
Spotted Owl or survey and manage species. Under this alternative, no vegetation will be treated. Trees
and vegetation impacted by the wildfires will continue to decay and fall without human influence. No
reduction in fuel loading levels or fire hazard will be achieved. Long-term effects of this alternative on
these species include continued limitations on use of the existing road system for wildfire suppression due
to safety concerns, and a higher risk of widespread loss of suitable habitats to high-severity wildfire.
Aquatic Species
Fuels would not be reduced within any potential treatment buffers, hazard trees may not be felled and left
onsite at least to the degree proposed in this Project and/or commercially disposed of, and legacy streamroad crossings may not be improved nor any roads decommissioned or addressed in any way outside of
routine maintenance that would have occurred regardless of this Project.
Although there would be no direct impacts, over time, there could be consequences from taking no action
that could indirectly cause adverse effects to the fish or their required habitats addressed in this report.
This could result from illegal or unauthorized harvest of trees within the treatment buffer because of ease
of access. Any such activities that could occur would not honor Project RPMs or BMPs so the activity
would surely promote greater sedimentation or other adverse effects (Physical Sciences Report). Later in
time, more frequent or more severe and intense wildfires could occur if no fuels treatments were initiated
in areas calculated to require them via the Project. Road maintenance and legacy treatments including
stream-road crossings and culvert upgrades would not occur resulting in a continuation of existing
sediment delivery to critical habitat.
Primitive, Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized, and Semi-Primitive Motorized Classes of Dispersed
Recreation
Approximately 33 miles of National Forest System roads and 8 miles of non-National Forest System
roads are present within the IRAs. A majority of these roads are located in Bell Quinby and Chanchelulla
IRAs. The limited road system has resulted in minimal management within these IRAs. There is an
additional 27 miles of National Forest System Trail within the IRAs. Most of these (21 miles) are located
within the Pattison IRA. The remainder of the IRAs are free from improvement and available for
dispersed recreation opportunities, including opportunities for solitude.
Based on the recreation opportunity spectrum classes identified in the Forest Plan, the inventoried
roadless areas included in this analysis are 42 percent Roaded Natural, 36 percent Semi-Primitive
Motorized, 21 percent Semi-Primitive Non-Motorized and 2 percent other.
Reference Landscapes
Reference landscapes are areas that are considered undisturbed and can be used to study the effects of
human impacts on other parts of the landscape. The IRAs included in this analysis are relatively
contiguous and in many instances located adjacent to each other with narrow road corridors separating
their boundaries. The limited road system and adjacency of the IRAs results in large areas inaccessible by
vehicles. Consequently little, if any, active management has occurred within the IRAs in the past two
decades and the reference landscape remains intact.

346

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Natural Appearing Landscapes with High Scenic Quality
The seven roadless areas identified in this analysis represent a variety of habitat types and landscapes
representative of the Klamath Mountains. Approximately 95 percent of the total combined area of these
IRAs has burned at least once since 1987 with most of that activity occurring between 1999 and 2015.
Impacts to individual IRAs range from 92 percent (Pattison IRA) to 100 percent (Bell Quinby) of the area
burned in the past 17 years. Some areas have burned more than once during that same timeframe.
Although this is a lot of disturbance, fire is a natural part of these ecosystems. The variation in fire effects
and the time since a given area burned has resulted in a diversified mosaic of vegetation conditions and
scenery across the IRAs.
Many visitors to the roadless areas will be traveling along roads or trails. Some will leave these primary
travel routes and hike into the interior of the IRAs. As noted above, the natural landscape these visitors
would experience is one of post-fire recovery. All of the IRAs have experienced the full range of fire
severities from relatively un-touched to complete mortality creating mosaics across the landscape. In
addition to the natural impacts of the fires, visitors will also be able to see the lasting impacts of fire
suppression as fire control lines continue to heal and hazard tree stumps continue to rot.
Traditional Cultural Properties and Sacred Sites
For a more in depth description of the impacts of this alternative on traditional cultural properties and
sacred sites, refer to the heritage specialist report or the heritage section of this Chapter.
Since no management activities will be implemented, this alternative would have no impacts to traditional
cultural properties or sacred sites.

Cumulative Effects

The cumulative effects are bounded in space by the IRA boundaries and in time at five years after
implementation ends.

Alternatives 1-5
There have been numerous past treatments within the IRAs leading up to the 2015 fire season. This
includes timber harvest, reforestation (site prep, plant, etc.), fuels treatments, seeding of understory
species and pre-commercial thinning. There has also been ongoing activities associated with powerline
maintenance in the Cow Creek, Little French Creek and Salt Gulch IRAs and grazing activities in the
Pattison and Salt Gulch IRAs. The impacts of these activities are incorporated into the description of the
existing condition. The only future foreseeable actions in the inventoried roadless areas is reforestation
within the 2015 fire perimeters and the Trinity Alps Prescribed Fire Project within the Bell Quinby IRA.
Reforestation will have cumulative impacts on both, the reference landscape and naturally appearing
landscape roadless characteristic. The treatment footprint for Alternatives 1-4 is relatively small compared
to the full extent of the inventoried roadless areas impacted and the proximity of the treatments to roads,
which already fragment the landscape. Reforestation will result in a minimal impact on the ability of each
IRA to continue to be used as a reference landscape. Reforestation may or may not occur outside of the
treatment areas identified for this project potentially resulting in management on more acres within the
IRAs. The objective of these reforestation activities will be to return the burned area to a forested
landscape as soon as possible. Areas that are reforested often appear managed for several decades as the
stand matures and naturally begins to seed in improving both age class and species diversity. The presence
of these reforestation areas will be visually apparent and detract from the naturally appearing landscape
until the stands mature.
See the physical sciences, air quality, fisheries, wildlife, botany, and heritage sections of this Chapter for a
full discussion of the cumulative effects to those resources. Although these sections describe the impacts
from the full project and not just the IRA’s, lands within the IRA’s contribute to these cumulative effects,
and in many cases will experience the cumulative impacts described.
347

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Summary
All of the IRAs are already experiencing significant impacts as a result of recent large wildfires. With the
emphasis on treating in areas adjacent to existing roads and the relatively low mileage of roads within
each IRA, the activities proposed in Alternatives 1-5 will not affect the ability of the IRA to meet the nine
roadless characteristics. This holds true when the impacts of the proposed activities are combined with the
impacts other known and foreseeable management activities within the IRAs. Alternatives 6 would result
in no treatment in the IRAs. Therefore, there would be no direct effects from treatment activities.

Compliance with the Forest Plan and Other Regulatory Direction
All six alternatives would comply with the Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan and the 2001 Roadless Rule
direction.
The Roadless Rule states, “timber may be cut, sold, or removed in inventoried roadless areas if the
Responsible Official determines that one of the following circumstances exists…to maintain or restore the
characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure, such as to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic
wildfire effects, within the range of variability that would be expected to occur under natural disturbance
regimes of the current climatic period [36 CFR § 294.13 (B)(1)].” The rule also allows timber cutting,
sale or removal in inventoried roadless areas when incidental to implementation of a management activity
including the removal of hazard trees adjacent to classified roads for public safety reasons [36 CFR §
294.13 (B)(2)].
Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of
failure. In Alternatives 1-5 hazard trees will be felled along roads open to the public that are located
within the areas that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. The primary difference between these
alternatives include the criteria utilized for identification of hazards and the level of fuel reduction
treatments prescribed to treat (or not treat) felled trees. Since the intent of these activities are to improve
public safety along the road system and to mitigate the increased fuel loading and subsequent increase in
fire hazard, the activities proposed in Alternatives 1-4 meet the criteria stated in 36 CFR § 294.13.
Alternative 5 will not treat fuels within the IRAs.
Alternatives 6 would maintain the status quo and would not implement any treatments within IRAs. The
2001 Roadless Rule is intended to provide lasting protection to IRAs and sets up a system that
management activities are categorized as exceptions in order to be compliant with the rule. Since no
management activities would occur within the IRAs Alternative 6 complies with the rule by default.

Wild & Scenic Rivers
Introduction

A Wild & Scenic Rivers analysis was conducted for two designated rivers as part of the Trinity Post Fire
Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project. The analysis used Wild & Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 90-542, as
amended) protection requirements in conjunction with existing Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and
Resource Management Plan direction.
Analysis determined that all action alternatives would protect these values and would be fully compliant
with all Wild and Scenic Rivers Act protection requirements and Forest Plan Standards & Guidelines.
Select information on resource effects for outstandingly remarkable values is reiterated in this report.

Methodology

Project activities were evaluated using field review, GIS analysis, and professional judgment for their
potential effects to: 1) free flowing conditions; 2) water quality; and 3) identified outstandingly
remarkable value(s). Each river shall be managed to protect and enhance the values for which the river
was designated, while providing for public recreation and resource uses which do not adversely impact
or degrade those values.
Indicators:
Fisheries: sediment, stream temperatures, and large wood;

Spatial and Temporal Context

The spatial analysis boundary for free flowing, water quality and outstandingly remarkable value is the
river area or designated corridor within the 2015 fire footprints. This corridor is approximately ¼ mile on
each side of the river. Temporal bounding is three years for short term effects. Long term effects would be
ten years or longer.

Affected Environment

In 1968 the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act was established to protect American rivers, including free-flowing
conditions, water quality and their many values “for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future
generations”. As of 2012, 203 rivers encompassing 12,598 miles had been included in the National Wild
and Scenic River (Wild and Scenic Rivers) System. Rivers or sections of rivers must be free-flowing and
possess at least one “outstandingly remarkable” value, such as fish, wildlife, recreation, scenery, geology,
history, cultural features, or other values including ecology. Rivers displaying varying degrees of
existing human alteration are assigned corresponding classification levels of Recreational, Scenic or
Wild.

Designation

There are two designated and one recommended Wild & Scenic Rivers segments which are potentially
affected by the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project. These are identified and
described below:

349



The Trinity River was designated by the Secretary of Interior in 1981 as part of the National
Wild & Scenic River System, which included the South Fork and New River segments that this
project overlaps. The South Fork of the Trinity River from the Trinity River confluence to the
California State Highway 36 Bridge crossing was designated for its outstandingly remarkable
fishery values. The New River from the Trinity River confluence to the Salmon-Trinity
Primitive Area.



The Forest Plan recommends the Upper South Fork of the Trinity River for designation as a Wild
& Scenic River. River segments identified as Recommended in the Forest Plan (1995) are to be
managed under similar guidance as designated rivers. This preliminary administrative

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

recommendation to the Secretary of Agriculture is retained until such time as Congress takes
action.

Classification

The Trinity River has segments classified as recreational, scenic, and wild classification. Rivers
classified as “Recreational” Wild and Scenic Rivers segments display the most level of development, and
may include roads, bridges, buildings, and agricultural or forest clearings. The “ Scenic” classification
applies to those rivers or sections of rivers that are free of impoundments, with shorelines or watersheds
still largely primitive and shorelines largely undeveloped, but may be accessible in places by roads. The
“ Wild” classification applies to those rivers or sections of rivers that are free of impoundments and
generally inaccessible except by trail, with watersheds or shorelines essentially primitive and waters
unpolluted. River classifications that overlap the project area are listed in Table 3-101 below.

Boundaries

Boundaries for designated Wild & Scenic River corridors were established in the Forest Plan, with legal
descriptions listed in Appendix E of the Forest Plan EIS. The corridor boundaries vary in width to include
key river features, generally averaging about ½ mile wide (including both sides of the river) for the length
of the river.
Boundaries for Recommended Wild and Scenic River corridors were identified in the Forest Plan. The
corridor boundaries are a uniform ½ mile width - ¼ mile wide on each side of the river for the length of
the river.

Management of Wild and Scenic Rivers through Forest Plan Standards &
Guidelines

Recreation Rivers within the Wild & Scenic Rivers System will be managed to protect or enhance the
values that caused them to be designated as Recreation Rivers. (Forest Plan, Roaded Natural Recreation)

Scenic Rivers within the Wild & Scenic Rivers System and rivers or sections of rivers that are free of
impoundments, with shorelines largely undeveloped but accessible in places by roads, will be managed to

protect or enhance the values which caused them to be designated as Scenic Rivers. (Forest Plan, Semiprimitive Motorized Recreation)
Wild Rivers within the Wild & Scenic Rivers System, and rivers or sections of outstandingly remarkable
rivers free of impoundments and generally inaccessible except by trail, will be managed to protect or
enhance the values which caused them to be designated as Wild Rivers. (Forest Plan, Semi-primitive

Environmental Consequences
Alternatives 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

Because of minute differences between alternatives in the Wild & Scenic River corridor, the analysis for
all action alternatives has been combined into one section. The five action alternatives would authorize
salvage harvest, fuels treatments, roadside hazard treatments, and/or site prep/planting within the river
corridors for South Fork of the Trinity River and New River (see Table 3-102). For a detailed description
of the alternatives, see Chapter 2 of this document.

Direct Effects and Indirect Effects
The full scope of the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act’s protections can be summarized as requiring activities
to protect: free-flowing conditions, water quality, and identified “outstandingly remarkable” river value(s).
Free Flowing Conditions
As applied to any river or section of a river, means existing or flowing in natural condition without
impoundment, diversion, straightening, rip-rapping, or other modification of the waterway.
Although there are portions of harvest units proposed within the river corridor boundaries of the South
Fork of the Trinity River and New River, they are located several hundred feet upslope from the river and
351

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

not proposed within the bed and banks of these WSRs. Therefore each alternative would have no effect on
the free flowing conditions of the Wild and Scenic Rivers, since no activities are proposed within Rivers’
bed or banks.
Note: Section 7 of the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act does not apply to this project, because it is only pertinent
to a “water resource project” such as a dam, water conduit, reservoir, hydropower project, powerhouse or
transmission line, and does not directly affect the bed and bank of a Wild & Scenic Rivers. In 1984 the
“water resource project” definition was evaluated for its use within the Wild & Scenic Rivers Act, and
the Forest Service clarified that timber harvesting or similar activities would not be subject to Section 7
review unless it resulted in an obstruction or modification of the free-flowing river characteristics 49 Fed
Reg. 1901, Jan. 16, 1984). Therefore all five alternatives will have no effect to free flowing conditions.
Water Quality
All five action alternatives are not expected to have direct effect on beneficial uses but should help
protect water quality for South Fork of the Trinity River and New River and proposed Upper South Fork
of the Trinity by fixing legacy (existing) sediment sites. The alternatives are not expected to significantly
increase sediment or stream temperature regimes over no action. A beneficial effect would be legacy site
repair. (See Hydrology Report)
Outstandingly Remarkable Value(s)
Each river shall be managed to protect and enhance the values for which the river was designated, while
providing for public recreation and resource uses which do not adversely impact or degrade those values.
The primary outstandingly remarkable value for all Wild & Scenic Rivers or Recommended Wild &
Scenic Rivers within the project area is fisheries. Project activities under all action alternatives would not
impede free flowing conditions or cause direct and adverse effects on the identified Outstandingly
Remarkable values. Considering all cumulative and foreseeable effects, implementation of any of the
action alternatives will protect or enhance the Outstandingly Remarkable fisheries and cultural values,
particularly in the intermediate to long-term. The outstandingly remarkable value of fisheries will benefit
in the intermediate and long-term from the actions proposed.
Fisheries [South Fork of the Trinity River, New River, and Upper South Fork Trinity (Recommended)]
Minor and insignificant direct effects from water drafting. Overall effects to sediment, stream shade, and
temperature from project treatments are expected to be discountable and effects to aquatic species are
expected to be minor under all action alternatives. Should a severe wildfire occur, cumulative impacts to
fish associated with increases in sediment supply, localized increases in water temperature, and reduced
long-term large woody debris recruitment could result. Impacts are expected to minor to moderate
depending on the spatial pattern of a high intensity wildfire.
Cumulative Effects
In considering current and reasonably foreseeable future projects, three other projects propose activities
along the designated Wild & Scenic River corridors within the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Trinity
Alps Prescribed Burn (373 acres of prescribed burning) propose activities in the New River Wild &
Scenic Rivers corridor; Burnt Ranch Fire Resilient Community (50 acres of thinning and hazardous fuels
reduction near community) propose activities in the Trinity River Wild & Scenic River corridor; Trinity
County Transmission Line Hazard Tree Removal and Salvage (20 acres of hazard tree removal for safety)
proposes activities within the South Fork of the Trinity Wild & Scenic River corridor. While these
projects are currently under analysis, it is anticipated that design features incorporated would result in no
effect to Wild & Scenic Rivers values. The additive effect from this project’s actions under alternatives 15 are not anticipated to have any cumulative effects to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act’s “protect and
enhance” standards.

352

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Alternative 6

Under Alternative 6, no salvage harvest, fuels treatments, or vegetation management would occur.
Existing management direction would continue to guide management of the project area. A detailed
description of the alternatives can be found in chapter 2 of this document.
Direct Effects and Indirect Effects
Because there would be no management actions under Alternative 6, free flowing conditions and
identified Outstandingly Remarkable Value(s) listed in Table 3-102 above would be maintained in this
alternative.
The risk posed to water quality (sediment) from identified 218 legacy sediment sites is moderate to high.
Should a significant storm, such as a 10-year event occur, there is a moderate risk of failure. These
impacts would adversely affect beneficial uses.
The risk to water quality and beneficial uses from increased stream temperature related to burned
Riparian Reserve areas is low.
Cumulative Effects
The additive effect from this project’s lack of action in this alternative is not anticipated to have any
cumulative effects to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act’s “protect and enhance” standards.

Compliance with law, regulation, policy, and the Forest Plan

All Wild & Scenic Rivers Act protection requirements will be met for this project. Free flowing
conditions, water quality, and identified outstandingly remarkable value(s) will be protected. River
classifications will be maintained.
The desired future conditions for wild, scenic, and recreational rivers will be met.

Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity ____
NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the
maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by the
Congress, this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical
assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain
conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic,
and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans (Sec. 101 [42 USC § 4331]).
The harvesting of dead trees (in all of the action alternatives) and the harvesting of dying trees (in
alternatives 2 and 3) constitutes the short-term use of a renewable resource. As a renewable resource,
trees can be reestablished and grown again if long-term soil productivity is maintained.
The 2015 fires caused a reduction in soil productivity where the fires burned with moderate to high
intensity. Salvage logging and fuels treatments such as mastication can improve soil productivity in postfire areas by increasing soil cover and adding organic material to the soil. In addition, fuels treatments are
expected to reduce the fire behavior of future wildfires in the area. As a result, within treated areas, future
wildfires are expected to have less of a negative effect on soil productivity than those wildfires would
have in untreated (or less intensively treated) areas.
Other actions have a negative effect on soil productivity. Using heavy equipment does create erosion
(which can reduce soil productivity), but erosion will be minimized through the use of Resource
Protection Measures. Also, there would be a short-term loss of soil productivity on new constructed
landings. Topsoil is removed when landings are constructed and this will lead to a reduction in soil
productivity. However, wherever possible, this project will utilize natural, non-constructed landings
(where topsoil is not removed). When landings are restored, the soil will be tilled with a winged subsoiler
in order to encourage the growth of appropriate vegetation for the site. A more thorough discussion of soil
353

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

productivity can be found in the soils section of Chapter 3. On the whole, this project will maintain (and
in some areas increase) soil productivity.
The proposed action and action alternatives will increase forest productivity by planting trees. The
amount of biomass produced by a forest depends on the number and size of the trees—larger trees
produce more biomass per year than small trees. Planting shortens the time that it takes for late seral
forest to appear on a landscape. By planting trees, this project will ensure that greater numbers of larger
trees are present on the landscape sooner than would be present if trees were not planted. Fuels treatments
will help reduce the effects of future fires so that these new forests are maintained into the future.

Unavoidable Adverse Effects __________________
Unavoidable adverse effects often result from managing the land for one goal at the expense or condition
of other resources. In order to meet the Purpose and Need for this project (mitigating hazards, sustaining
forest cover, capturing economic value; See Chapter 1) some adverse effects are unavoidable. Falling
trees takes away snags that can serve as habitat for wildlife. Treating fuels reduces the total quantity of
down woody material that can serve as habitat for wildlife. Capturing the economic value of the trees
involves the use of heavy equipment that emits pollutants into the atmosphere and mobilizes sediment
that is transported to streams where it can affect water quality and aquatic habitat. However, the extent
and intensity of adverse effects will be minimized through the use of Resource Protection Measures
(Chapter 2– Alternatives, Including the Proposed Action), Best Management Practices (Appendix C –
Best Management Practices), and the hydrologic restoration of roads (Appendix D – Legacy Sediment
Site Plan).
Based on the analysis contained in this document, it is generally the case that the level of adverse effects
correlates with the level of beneficial effects. Alternatives 2 and 3 have both the greatest beneficial effects
and the greatest adverse effects. Listed in decreasing order: Alternative 1, Alternative 4, and Alternative 5,
have lower beneficial and adverse effects. The no action alternative has no beneficial effects and no
adverse effects.
While adverse effects of the action alternatives fall within Forest Plan standards and comply with the
regulatory framework, some may view these losses as an adverse impact to the environment. Conversely,
taking no action would fail to mitigate the risk of falling trees on 233 miles of road and the fire risk
associated with high levels of dead vegetation.
Adverse effects are discussed in detail by resource throughout this Chapter.

Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of
Resources _________________________________
Activities proposed under the action alternatives such as felling trees, logging, hauling timber, fuels
treatments, and road treatment actions will all be accomplished through the use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels
are effectively a finite resource that cannot be replenished.
Soil erosion results in a loss of the soil resource. Project activities are expected to create some soil
erosion, but the level of erosion will be insignificant in comparison to background levels and also due to
application of Resource Protection Measures. At the same time, the fuels treatments proposed under all of
the action alternatives are expected to reduce the fire behavior of future wildfires in the area. As a result,
lower post-fire erosion rates can be expected in treated areas than would be expected in untreated (or less
intensively treated) areas. Further, reconstruction of roads will reduce future erosion rates from the road
system. A more complete discussion of soil erosion can be found in the Soil Section of Chapter 3 and the
Physical Sciences Report. Also, none of the action alternatives are expected to cause new landslides or
reactivate existing ones (see the Geology Section of this Chapter).
354

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Some changes to habitat for wildlife, fish, and plants are expected but the habitat will recover from any
negative changes (see Wildlife, Fish, and Botany sections of this Chapter). Similarly, effects to water
quality and air quality are expected to be temporary. Greenhouse gas emissions may result in a permanent
increase in the quantity of atmospheric CO2 if the gases are not later removed through carbon
sequestration. However, any potential increase will be at such a small scale relative to the global
atmosphere that its climate-forcing effect will not be meaningfully measurable. Finally, reforestation
within the treatment areas will help those areas more rapidly recover to their historic forested conditions
than they would otherwise recover.

Energy Requirements & Conservation Potential __
Activities proposed under the action alternatives such as felling trees, logging, hauling timber, other fuels
treatments, and road treatment actions each consume energy (primarily fossil fuels). There are no unusual
energy requirements associated with the action alternatives nor is it the type of proposal that provides an
opportunity to conserve energy at a large scale. Wood is a renewable resource. Some of the timber cut
could be utilized by the purchaser to produce energy which would offset fossil fuel use; however, the
timber cut as part of this project is not expected to produce energy on a meaningful scale. By applying
Forest Plan Standards & Guidelines and the Resource Protection Measures listed in Chapter 2, the
proposed action and alternatives will conserve resources.

Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the
design of the built environment ________________
Through the implementation of Resource Protection Measures for Cultural Resources (see Chapter 2),
direct effects of this project on historic and cultural resources will be prevented. Some indirect and
cumulative effects to historic and cultural resources may occur due to changes in vegetation cover and
fuel loading (see the Archaeology/Heritage section of Chapter 3 for additional details). Insofar as portions
of this project are located within the Wildland-Urban Interface (see Map F-29), hazard reduction along
roads will improve urban quality proportionate to the extent and intensity of treatments. Hazard reduction
along roads will also improve the quality of the built environment by improving road access (fewer trees
falling blocking the road) and safety. A single segment of national forest system road (Road 31N49) will
be closed, but this road has been identified as having safety concerns inherent in its design. Additional
discussion of road-related activities can be found in the Connected Actions section of Chapter 2, the
Hydrology Section of this Chapter, and Appendices A and D.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance _____________
NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft
environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with …other environmental review
laws and executive orders.” The proposed action and alternatives must comply with following:

Principal Environmental Laws and Regulations
The following laws and regulations contain requirements for protection of the environment that apply to
the proposed action and alternatives. The sections below explain where to find analysis of compliance
with the appropriate laws and regulation. A brief discussion of any required consultation or coordination
required under the applicable law is also included. In some cases, a permit or other form or approval is
also required, as explained below:

Endangered Species Act

Discussions of Endangered Species Act (ESA) compliance can be found in the following sections:
Chapter 3 Wildlife, Chapter 3 Fish. There are no threatened or endangered plants so there is no analysis of
ESA compliance.
The Forest Service has been working under the Streamlining MOU and developed an agreed upon
Biological Assessment in August 2017. This BA was submitted to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)
on August 16, 2017. This BA was submitted to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on August 16, 2017.
A no effect determination was made for gray wolf, marbled murrelet, western snowy plover, yellow-billed
cuckoo, California red-legged frog, and valley elderberry longhorn beetle. The ESA determination for 12
of the 92 NSO activity centers in the action area is “May Affect, Likely to Adversely Affect” (MALAA)
and for the remaining 80 NSO activity centers in the action area is “May Affect, Not Likely to Adversely
Affect” (MANLAA). The Proposed Action is likely to adversely affect NSO Critical Habitat, but the
effect on the physical and biological features (PBFs) of NSO Critical Habitat will be limited. A Biological
Opinion will be received from FWS prior to implementation.
The Forest Service consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the effects of this
project on the Southern Oregon Northern California Coast (SONCC) coho salmon, which is listed as
threatened under ESA. The project Biological Assessment makes a determination that this project “May
Affect and is Not Likely to Adversely Affect” SONCC coho salmon or its designated Critical Habitat.
NMFS issued a letter of concurrence with this determination on March 21, 2017.

Clean Water Act
The Clean Water Act is discussed in the Hydrology Section of Chapter 3, the Sediment Source Inventory
(Appendix D – Legacy Sediment Site Plan) and in the Physical Sciences Report. As part of compliance
with the Clean Water Act, the Shasta-Trinity National forest has a “Waiver of Waste Discharge
Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain Federal Land Management Activities
on National Forest System Lands in the North Coast Region” (Waiver) from the California Regional
Water Quality Control Board, North Coast Water Board (Regional Water Board). The Forest consults with
the Regional Water Board on each project to ensure that the project meets the terms of the Waiver. The
Forest has had numerous contacts with the Regional Water Board on this project including document
submittals, telephone conversations, emails, and field trips. The Forest submitted a draft Alternative
Legacy Sediment Site Treatment Plan to the Regional Water Board on December 6, 2016 that included a
draft of the Sediment Source Inventory Report and a Past Legacy Sediment Site Treatment GIS file. The
Forest will submit a Waiver Application after the Record of Decision for this has been signed, and the
Regional Water Board will then have a 30-day review period prior to enrollment in the Waiver.

Clean Air Act
The effect of the project on Air Quality and compliance with the Clean Air Act is discussed in the Air
Quality Section of Chapter 3 and the Air Quality Report. Prescribed fires are regulated and authorized by
the local Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and the California Air Resources Board under the process
established by the California Smoke Management Program. The legal basis of the program is found in the
Smoke Management Guidelines for Agricultural and Prescribed Burning adopted by the California Air
Resources Board (ARB) on March 23, 2001. Implementation of prescribed fire will require a burn permit
from the North Coast Air Quality Management District, and prescribed burning will occur on approved
burn days, as determined by the North Coast Air Quality Management District.

National Historic Preservation Act

As part of our compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106, and in accordance
with the Programmatic Agreement (PA),115 the Shasta-Trinity National Forest conducted archaeological
surveys, tribal consultation, and consultation with interested parties. Formal consultation letters were
mailed to the Hoopa Valley Tribe, the Karuk Tribe, and the Yurok Tribe.
From this work a cultural resource report was prepared and submitted for review in accordance with the
PA. This report was concurred with by the Shasta-Trinity Heritage Program manager and will be reported
in the Forest’s annual PA report to the State Historic Preservation Officer and Region 5 Heritage Program
Manager.

National Forest Management Act

The National Forest Management requires that projects proposed on a National Forest be consistent with
the Forest’s Land and Resource Management Plan. General direction from the Forest Plan can be found in
the “Management Direction” section of Chapter 1. Chapter 3 analyzes the action alternatives for
consistency with the Standards & Guidelines contained in the Forest Plan.

Roadless Area Conservation Rule of 2001 (2001 Roadless Rule)

The 2001 Roadless Rule is described in Chapter 1, management direction. The Inventoried Roadless
Areas section of Chapter 3 addresses the consistency of this project with the 2001 Roadless Rule. The
effect of the proposed action and alternatives on roadless characteristics is also discussed in Chapter 3.
Actions within inventoried roadless areas were reviewed and approved by the Regional Forester on June
29, 2017.

Executive Orders

The following executive orders provide direction to federal agencies that apply to the proposed action and
alternatives. No inconsistencies with any executive orders have been identified.
 Indian Sacred Sites, Executive Order 13007 of May 24, 1996
 Invasive Species, Executive Order 13112 of February 3, 1999
 Recreational Fisheries, Executive Order 12962 of June 6, 1995
 Migratory Birds, Executive Order 13186 of January 10, 2001
 Floodplain Management, Executive Order 11988 of May 24, 1977
 Protection of Wetlands, Executive Order 11990 of May 24, 1977
 Use of Off-Road Vehicles, Executive Order 11644, February 8, 1972
 Environmental Justice, Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994
 Use of Off-Road Vehicles, Executive Order 11644, February 8, 1972

Environmental Justice

As stated in Executive Order 12898, it is required that all federal actions consider the potential of
disproportionate effects on minority and low-income populations in the local region. The principles of
Environmental Justice require agencies to address the equity and fairness implications associated with
Federal land management actions. The Council on Environmental Quality (1997) provides guidance to
help federal agencies comply with Environmental Justice requirements.
In cases where the management decisions are expected to create jobs and income in the local economy, it
is unlikely that there would be a disproportionate adverse effect on minority and low income populations.
Individuals in that population may benefit from any increase in jobs and income in the area. The reduced
risk of hazard trees would likely sustain visitor use and corresponding revenues in the area at or above
Programmatic Agreement among the U.S.D.A Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Region (Region 5), California State Historic
Preservation Officer, Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding
the Processes for Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for Management of Historic Properties
by the National Forests of the Pacific Southwest Region (2012).

current levels therefore no disproportionate adverse effects are expected to low income or minority
populations as a result of implementing either action alternative.
Local jobs will be generated by the many service contracts that will be utilized to accomplish the myriad
of proposed treatments regardless of the action alternative, with the exception of the no action alternative.
Jobs will be created to accomplish the following types of service work: fuels treatments, salvage sales
(both small and commercial), reforestation and plantation maintenance, and road restoration and
decommissioning work. These activities will generate both private sector and government jobs.
Individuals in minority and low income populations will not be harmed by the generation of these jobs,
rather, they are likely to benefit from the additional available employment opportunities. Additionally,
public access won’t change and firewood opportunities will be increased.

Special Area Designations
The selected alternative is designed to comply with laws, regulations and policies that pertain to the
following special areas:
 Inventoried Roadless Areas
 Wild and Scenic Rivers
 Municipal Watersheds (FSM 2540)
Research Natural Areas and Wilderness Areas are found within the project boundary (the project
boundary includes the extent of all of the fires); however no treatments are being proposed in these areas.

A biological determination of the reach of the proposed action on a
particular listed species. Defined by USFWS regulation as all areas to
be affected directly or indirectly by the Federal action and not merely
the immediate area involved in the action (50 CFR §402.02).
A crown fire in which the entire fuel complex is involved in flame, but
the crowning phase remains dependent on heat released from surface
fuel for continued spread. An active crown fire may also be also called
a running crown fire or continuous crown fire. An active crown fire
presents a solid wall of flame from the surface through the canopy
fuel layers. Flames appear to emanate from the canopy as a whole
rather than from individual trees within the canopy. Active crown fire
is one of several types of crown fire and is contrasted with passive
crown fires which are less vigorous types of crown fire that do not
emit continuous, solid flames from the canopy (Scott and Reinhardt
2007).
Fuels created by management actions
The most biologically relevant point in a northern spotted owl (NSO)
territory, around which the territory is centered. The activity center is
typically defined by (in order of importance) an NSO nest, pair
sighting, daytime detection of a single NSO, or nighttime detection of
a single NSO.
In the NEPA process, the area that will be involved, influenced or
created by the alternatives under consideration.
Fish species, commonly salmon and steelhead, which are born in fresh
water, migrate to the ocean to mature, and return to fresh water to
lay eggs (spawn).
A strategy developed to restore and maintain the ecological health of
watersheds and aquatic ecosystems contained within them on public
lands.
Objectives that “define the context for the agency review and
implementation of management activities”. Complying with the ACS
objectives means that an agency is managing the riparian-dependent
resources to maintain the existing condition or implement actions to
restore ecosystem health.
The area within which project activities are expected to occur that
may affect historic properties.
The total cross-sectional area of all stems in a stand measured at
breast height, and expressed as per unit of land area (typically square
feet per acre). Used as a means of describing the average density of a
tree stand.
Best Management Practices (BMP) are specific practices or actions
used to reduce or control impacts to water bodies from nonpoint
sources of pollution, most commonly by reducing the loading of
pollutants from such sources into storm water and waterways. The US
Forest Service BMP Program was developed to improve management

sedimentation, flooding, etc.
A satellite-derived data layer of post-fire vegetation condition that
classifies soil burn severity resulting from fire into four classes: high,
moderate, low and very low.
Dead woody materials in various stages of decomposition, including
sound and rotting logs, snags, and large branches. Generally
considered to be at least 20-inches in diameter by all resource areas
with the exception of fuels. In terms of fuels, woody material greater
than 3” in diameter is considered CWD. Used interchangeably with
LWD
A codification of the general and permanent rules published in the
Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the
Federal Government.
Cone bearing tree. Generally retain leaves/needles all year.
Actions that (i) automatically trigger other actions which may require
environmental impact statements; (ii) cannot or will not proceed
unless other actions are taken previously or simultaneously; or (iii) are
interdependent parts of a larger action and depend on the larger
action for their justification (40 CFR 1508.25).
The degree to which the landscape facilitates animal movement and
other ecological flows. The linkage of similar but separated vegetation
stands by patches, corridors, or “stepping stones” of like vegetation.
This term can also refer to the degree to which similar habitats are
linked.
An area defined by a 0.5-mile radius around a northern spotted owl
activity center that owls use most often, especially during the nesting
season.
Areas designated for the survival and recovery of federally listed
threatened or endangered species and that may require special

time. Cumulative effects can result from the incremental effect of an
action when added to past, present and reasonably foreseeable future
actions regardless of ownership. “Cumulative effects can result from
individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over
a period of time" (FEMAT, 1993). The Equivalent Roaded Acres (ERA)

foraging habitat, such as even-aged, pole-sized stands, if such stands
contain some roosting structures and at least minimal foraging
opportunities to allow for temporary resting and feeding during the
transience phase.
Habitat prior to treatment will no longer function as that type of
habitat but will function as a lower quality habitat (i.e. previously
nesting and roosting habitat would function as foraging following
treatment).

Streams that naturally support the presence of any species of fish for
any duration.
The length of flames in a fire front measured along the slant of the
flame, from the midpoint of its base to its tip.
Forested stands that sustain abundant and available prey populations
(primarily woodrats). Descriptions of foraging habitat range from
mature forest stands with complex structure (Solis and Gutierrez
1990) to mature forests with lower canopy closure and smaller
diameter trees than those associated with nesting/roosting habitat
(Gutierrez 1996).
The rate of change of the moisture content is dependent on the
diameter of the woody fuel particle and the amount of change in
environment conditions. Historically, the diameters of the woody fuel
particles have been classified according to their "time lag". Time lag
refers to the length of time that a particle responds to within 63.2%
(1-1/e) of the new equilibrium moisture content (either drying or
wetting). Larger diameter fuels generally have longer time-lags,
meaning they respond more slowly to changes in environmental
conditions. The time lag categories traditionally used for fire behavior
and fire danger rating are specified as: 1hr (0-1/4” diameter), 10hr
(1/4”-1” diameter), 100hr (1”-3” diameter), and 1000hr (3” and
greater diameter).
The process of removing and/or modifying natural or human created
fuels to reduce fire hazard and achieve other resource objectives.
A strip of land strategically placed where hazardous fuels have been
replaced with less burnable materials. Fuelbreaks divide fire-prone
areas into smaller parcels for easier fire control and provide access for
firefighting.
Refer to Unstable Lands
Natural organic and inorganic material that covers the watershed
ground surface in sufficient quantity to allow a satisfactory rate of
water to infiltrate to replenish ground water and limit erosion to
natural rates. Ground cover usually consists of perennial vegetation,
forest floor litter and duff, rock, downed wood, or similar erosion
resistant material.
The removing of all vegetation within a minimum of a three-foot
radius from planted or naturally regenerated seedlings. This is most
often done by hand.
Refer to Connectivity
The piling of small diameter trees, branches and/or brush by hand for
burning at a later time.
Naturally shed (e.g. leaves or fruit). Perennial plants that are normally
leafless for some time during the year, usually winter months.
Tree hazards include dead or dying tree, dead parts of live trees or
unstable live trees (due to structural defects or other factors) that are
within striking distance of people or property (a target, such as a
road). Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage,
personal injury or fatality in the event of a failure. Also called danger
tree for the purposes of this project.

Hazard tree rating is defined in the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest
Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific Southwest Region (Report
#RO-12-01). The Hazard Potential is determined by the probability of
the tree falling and its potential effect. A high hazard potential
requires prompt removal of the tree or other mitigation.
Sites identified by the Forest and the US Fish and Wildlife Service as
most valuable to northern spotted owls and most likely to support
northern spotted owl reproduction.
Riparian Reserves associated with intermittent stream channels,
perennial stream channels, wetlands or springs.
Activities that restore hydrologic connectivity, restore soil porosity,
disperse flows that may have been concentrated, and promote more
natural flow paths and stability more comparable to an undisturbed
site. Methods for hydrologic stabilization include subsoiling,
outsloping, berm removal, water-barring, removing culverts, and
providing ground cover (seeding and or mulching).
Those effects occurring later in time or that are spatially removed
from the activity.
A route that allows access into an area.
Slopes greater than 65% which occur along rivers and streams.
Any non-permanently flowing drainage feature having (1) a definable
channel and (2) evidence of annual scour or deposition. An
intermittent stream typically flows longer and has more stream power
than an ephemeral stream.
IRAs provide large, relatively undisturbed landscapes that are
important to biological diversity and the long-term survival of many at
risk species, provide opportunities for dispersed outdoor recreation,
clean water, etc. These areas are managed under the guidance of the
2001 Roadless Rule.
A term that applies to the loss of production, harvest, or use of
natural resources. For example, some or all of the timber production
from an area is an irretrievable loss while an area is serving as a winter
sports site. The production lost is irretrievable, but the action is not
irreversible. If the uses changes, it is possible to resume timber
production.
A term that describes the loss of future options, applying primarily to
the effects of use of nonrenewable resources such as minerals or
cultural resource, or to those factors such as soil productivity that are
renewable only over long periods of time.
Point of discussion, debate or dispute about the environmental effects
of the proposed action.
Shrubs and young trees that provide continuous fine material from
the forest floor into the crowns of dominant trees.
Any place on or adjacent to a logging site where logs are assembled
for further transport.
Woody material at least 24-inches in diameter and 50-feet long that is
dead and lying on the forest floor, generally in contact with the stream
bed and banks. Term used for aquatic habitat, as it influences flow

managed to provide habitat for late-successional and “old growth”
dependent species.
Specified dates that restrict management activities (1) near known
wildlife nesting sites or unsurveyed suitable nesting habitat during the
breeding season; or (2) restrict equipment use during periods of wet
weather to avoid sedimentation into streams (also known as periods
when wet weather operating standards will apply – typically October
15 to May 15).
The piling of forest debris with the use of a bulldozer or excavator.
Often accomplished on landings.
Defines the level of service provided by, and maintenance required for
a specific road, consistent with road management objectives and
maintenance criteria.
Roads that have been placed in storage between intermittent uses. A
Maintenance Level 1 road is closed to vehicular traffic but may be
available and suitable for non-motorized uses.
Roads open for use by high clearance vehicles. Constitutes the
majority of National Forest System Roads on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest.
Roads open and maintained for travel by a prudent driver in a
standard passenger car. Roads in this maintenance level are typically
low speed and may have stretches of single lanes with turnouts.
Roads that provide a moderate degree of user comfort and
convenience at moderate travel speeds. Most are double lane and
aggregate surfaced, paved, and/or dust abated.
A distinct geographic area with specified objectives and prescriptions
under the Forest Plan.
Grinding, crushing or chewing vegetative material using equipment
(e.g. masticator).
Hazard tree rating defined in the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest
Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific Southwest Region (Report
#RO-12-01). The hazard potential is determined by the probability of
the tree falling and the potential effect of the tree falling. A moderate
hazard potential requires the documentation and tag and map of the
tree (monitor) or removal of hazard tree (mitigation).
Process of collecting information to evaluate if objective and
anticipated or assumed results of a management plan are being
realized or if implementation is proceeding as planned.
Signed into law in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the
environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making
decisions. Using the NEPA process, agencies evaluate the
environmental and related social and economic effects of their

A 1976 amendment to the Forest and Rangeland Renewable
Resources Planning Act (1974) which called for management of
natural resources on National Forest System lands. NFMA provided
direction for the development of land and resource management
plans.
Consists of units of federally owned forest, range and related lands
united into a nationally significant system dedicated to the long0term
benefit for present and future generations. The NFS includes all
national forest lands acquired through purchase, exchange, donation
or other means; national grasslands; and other lands, waters or
interests which are administered by the Forest Service.
The system of National Forest System roads, National Forest System
trails and airfields on National Forest System lands.
Natural geologic occurrence of various types of asbestos minerals that
pose a potential health risk if released into the air through ground
disturbing activities. Often found in serpentine soils.
Northern spotted owl habitat where owls generally nest and roost.
Forest characteristics include multi-layered, multi-species (including
hardwoods) canopy dominated by large overstory trees; moderate to
high canopy closure (60 to 90 percent); a high incidence of trees with
large cavities and other types of deformities; numerous large snags;
an abundance of large down logs; and open space within and below
the upper canopy for spotted owls to fly. Nest sites are usually located
within stands of old-growth and late-successional (late seral) forest
dominated by Douglas-fir containing structures such as cavities and
broken tree tops.
For the purposes of this project, applies to plant species that are 1)
that are not native to the ecosystem under consideration and 2)
whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or
environmental harm or harm to human health.
See Non-native Invasive Species
A method of draining roads that slightly tilts the roadbed to deflect
surface water downhill perpendicular to the travel way. Contrary to
outsloping, insloped roads are tilted toward the upper slope and
direct water into roadside ditches that parallel the road on the uphill
side. Insloped roads require a greater level of maintenance to keep
ditches clear and functioning and result in greater erosion and
sedimentation potential.
A river-related value must be a unique, rare, or exemplary feature that
is significant at a regional or national scale.
A stream which normally flows throughout the year.
A stand composed primarily of trees established by planting or
artificial seeding.
Foraging habitat that burned at moderate or high vegetation severity
or nesting/roosting that burned at high severity.

A planned fire intentionally ignited to meet management objectives.
The physical and biological features that provide the essential life
history requirements of the species.
Mitigations developed and incorporated into the alternatives
considered in detail to minimize or adverse impacts of the project.
The product is generated for National Forest Service Lands (including
wilderness) to provide information that can assist post-fire vegetation
management planning designed to address a number of management
objectives. The basal area loss summary table and GIS products are
produced by a change detection process using two Landsat Thematic
Mapper (TM) images or other multi-spectral imagery captured before
and after a wildfire. The algorithm uses the Relative Differenced
Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which is sensitive to vegetation
mortality resulting from the wildfire event.
A method for road decommissioning where a portion of the old
roadbed is retained and is more gently outsloped than the
surrounding hill slopes.
The natural or artificial (e.g. planting) restocking of an area with trees.
The act of renewing tree cover by establishing young trees naturally or
artificially (e.g. planted), promptly after the previous stand or forest
has been removed.
Release treatments include manually removing competing plants or
water uptake from competing plant roots by “grubbing” around
conifer seedlings or natural hardwood seedlings.
For salvage, removal of trees and fuels includes felling, yarding,
intermediate decking of logs and hauling of the logs off-site. Removal
of fuels can also apply to prescribed burning.
The relative difficulty of constructing and holding a control line as
affected by resistance to line construction and fire behavior; also
called difficulty of control.
A Forest Plan land allocation that includes an aquatic ecosystem and
the adjacent upland areas directly affecting it. It also includes unstable
and potentially unstable lands that are not associated with aquatic
areas. Specific Standards & Guidelines provide direction for these
areas.
The amount of disturbance in the watershed relative to a threshold
that is based on soils, geology, topography and geomorphic sensitivity
of the watershed to disturbance.
Soil or rock material removed during road construction, usually from
the upslope side of the road.
The removal of dead trees after a natural event (such as a wildfire or
insect and disease infestation) to remove hazards to public safety,
capture the economic value of burned trees, and/or remove excessive
fuel accumulation. Dead trees (or snags) exceeding those needed by
other resources (e.g. wildlife habitat) are removed. Salvage harvest is
also a fuels reduction activity.

The aggregate of features and traits that form the individual scenic
nature of an area.
Plant or animal species which are susceptible to habitat changes or
impacts from management activities. The official designation is made
by the USDA Forest Service at the regional level and is not part of the
designation of threatened or endangered species associated by the US
Fish and Wildlife Service.
The art and science of growing and tending forest vegetation that
includes influencing the establishment, composition and growth of
forests for specified management objectives.
The removal or reduction of competing vegetation or logging debris,
to prepare an area for planting and to promote the growth and
survival of desired tree species.
A standing dead or dying tree that has lost most of its branches, or the
standing portion of a broken-top tree. Snags provide cavities for
nesting, perches, and feeding sites for wildlife.
The effect of a fire on ground surface characteristics, described in
terms of char depth, organic matter loss, altered color and structure
of soil, and reduced infiltration. Soil burn severity is measured in high,
moderate and low classes based upon the degree of effects utilizing
BARC data (See BARC).
Pores or holes in the soil that hold air or water; permeability
A group of trees that occupies a specific area and is similar in species
composition, age, or condition.
Mechanical lifting and shattering of the layer of soil beneath the
topsoil in order to reduce soil density and strength, improve moisture
infiltration and retention, and increase root penetration in the soil.
Roads authorized by contract, permit, lease, other written
authorization, or emergency operation not intended to be a part of
the forest transportation system and not for long-term resource
management. Any new temporary roads created during
implementation of this project would be restored.
An area defined by a 1.3 mile radius around a northern spotted owl
activity center within which owls forage, nest and roost. The terms
home range and territory are often used interchangeably.
Vegetation (trees or shrubs) growing under the canopy formed by
taller trees.
A prescribed fire in forests or woodlands that is not lethal to the
dominant, overstory vegetation and thus does not change stand
structure substantially.
Riparian Reserves associated with active landslides (including earth
flows), inner gorges, toe zones of dormant landslides, or steepweathered granitic lands.
The effect of a fire on vegetation, often described by the degree of
scorch, consumption, and mortality of vegetation. Vegetation burn
severity is measured by classes of canopy mortality or basal area
mortality (basal area mortality in the case of this project).

APPENDIX B – SCOPING COMMENT ANALYSIS
Issue Disposition Process ____________________
Issues are statements of cause and effect, linking environmental effects to actions (FSH 1909.15
Environmental Policies and Procedures Handbook Ch. 12.41 Considering Issues in Preparation
of Environmental Impact Statements). Issues serve to highlight effects or unintended
consequences that may occur from the proposed action and alternatives, giving opportunities
during the analysis to reduce adverse effects and compare trade-offs for the decision maker and
public to understand (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.42).
The Interdisciplinary Team reviewed comments from the public and other agencies in order to
identify key issues. Key issues will then be carried forward in the environmental analysis process
as a way to develop alternatives (alternative driving issues) or analyze alternatives (analysisdriving issues) (FSH 1909.15 Ch. 12.4).

Comment Analysis

Comments and concerns were assigned to one of the following categories. Similar issues were
grouped by subject matter. This process is documented below.
1. Alternative-Driving Issue (key issue): Alternative-driving issues generally concern
resources that may be impacted by implementation of the proposed action and cannot be
completely resolved through project design. An alternative-driving issue is addressed by
developing and analyzing an alternative to the proposed action or by creating a
modification to the proposed action. Such modifications may take the form of resource
protection measures or mitigation measures that are applied to the proposed action as
well as multiple alternatives. If a new alternative is created, it may be analyzed fully or, if
it does not meet the purpose and need, is illegal, is based on inadequate scientific
evidence or is sufficiently similar to an alternative already considered in detail, the
alternative will not be considered in detail. Some alternative-driving issues are also
analysis-driving issues, as described below.
2. Analysis-Driving Issue (key issue): Analysis-driving issues relate to a cause and effect
relationship between the proposed action and its effects. They suggest a method to
measure effects and identify potential effects caused by the proposed action that are
relevant to the decision to be made and suggest how important or ‘significant’ an effect
might be. Analysis issues are carried through effects analyses by project specialists.
Analysis issues will be analyzed in the project effects portion of environmental impact
documentation. A description of the indicators used and the reasons for using those
indicators can be found in the relevant resource section of the EA.
Procedural Concern (non-key issue): These are issues that may be addressed through
implementation of standard design features, or completion of processes routinely conducted by
the interdisciplinary team. It is common to receive scoping comments reminding the agency to
consider or conduct certain processes, such as consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, or cumulative effects analyses. Procedural concerns may also address the methodology
behind the analysis and why it is appropriate. For example, the analysis may include the use of a
model or qualitative discussion of key resource characteristics based on professional expertise.
3. Other concern (non-key issue). Other concerns are designated as such for any of the
following reasons:
382

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

a) The issue is beyond the scope of the project. The issue does not meet the purpose and
need for action, falls outside of the project area, or is beyond the power of the agency
to address.
b) The issue is unrelated to the decision to be made.
c) The issue is already decided or required by law, regulation, or policy.
d) The issue is conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence.
e) The comment is general in nature, such as a position statement, and does not provide
sufficient specific information which can be used to analyze effects.
f) The comment asks a question that can be answered succinctly in the analysis
document or in the response to comments.
g) The comment requests a modification to the proposed action without explaining the
environmental, social, or economic effect that such modification would address.
Although not a true issue, these comments are carried forward to the alternative
development stage.
h) The comment has been resolved through inclusion of a project design feature or a
resource protection measure.
i) Statement of support.

Summary of Issue Statements:
Alternative Driving Issues:

1. Removing dead trees will negatively impact native species, habitat, clean water and forest
resources; therefore, include an alternative that not include post-fire logging where it's
not directly impacting busy roads. Addressed in Alternative 7.
2. Removal of burned trees would have a negative impact on northern spotted owls;
therefore, analyze an alternative that would not remove burned trees in high value
northern spotted owl areas. Addressed in Alternative 4 and 5.
3. Salvage logging has a negative impact on use of burned areas by northern spotted owls;
therefore, consider an alternative that does not impact areas that would be used for post
fire foraging by northern spotted owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5.
4. The project could have a negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an
alternative should be considered that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted
owls. Addressed in Alternatives 4 and 5.
5. Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and could
have a negative impact on TES species; therefore, consider an alternative that does not
treat in IRAs. Addressed in Alternative 5.
6. The proposed action does not fully address the hazard tree conditions; therefore, an
alternative should be considered that allows a wider treatment buffer where necessary to
address the hazard. Addressed in Alternative 3.
7. Future high severity fire is a concern in the project area which will not be addressed by
the proposed action; therefore, analyze an alternative that includes effective fuelbreaks,
including treatments of green vegetation and maintenance. Addressed in Alternative 2.
8. The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads; therefore,
analyze an alternative that includes silvicultural treatments (including thinning green
vegetation) downhill from treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 2.
9. The proposed action should do more to address traveler safety along roads during fires;
therefore, analyze an alternative that includes wider treatments, especially downhill from
treated roads. Addressed in Alternative 3.

383

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

10. The proposed action would leave felled hazard trees outside the treatment buffer, which
leads to heavy fuel loading; therefore, consider an alternative with a wider treatment
buffer that would allow all felled hazard trees to be removed. Addressed in Alternative 3.
11. The proposed action only proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of
implementation, but this does not address all of the trees that will die from fire damage,
which means the treatments do not fully address the hazard; analyze an alternative that
would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with the Region 5 Hazard Tree
Guidelines and the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines. Addressed in Alternatives 2
and 3.
12. The Limited Operating Periods impact ability to implement salvage treatments; therefore,
consider an alternative that does not include LOPs. Addressed in Alternative 8.
13. The proposed planting density is lower than recommended for future timber
management; therefore, analyze an alternative that would have a heavier planting density.
Addressed in Alternative 3.
14. The project could negatively impact watersheds that are already over the threshold of
concern; therefore, consider an alternative that minimizes treatments in those watersheds.
Addressed in Alternative 5.
15. Machine piling has a negative impact on soils; therefore, analyze an alternative that
would not include machine piling. Addressed in Alternative 5.
16. Logging has a negative impact in Riparian Reserves; therefore, analyze an alternative that
does not include logging in Riparian Reserves. Addressed in Alternative 5.

Analysis Driving Issues:

1. Project activities will produce sediment that could reach streams; therefore estimate the
quantity of sediment delivery.

2. The proposed action will generate CO2 emissions; therefore, estimate CO2 emissions for
each alternative.

Comments and Responses
1 . EPIC
50T

Comment: Using Healthy Forest Restoration Act authority the Project proposes approximately
8,100 acres of post-fire logging and other treatment methods on 233 miles of road, including 153
miles of Maintenance Level 2, 34 miles of Level 3, 19 miles of Level 4 and 27 miles of state and
county roads. Treatments would be used to treat up to a 300 foot total buffer. The Project area is
proposed within five different fire complexes and the Saddle Fire, containing multiple land
allocations including Late Successional Reserves and Riparian Reserves and is also within
Critical Habitat for northern spotted owl (NSO) and possibly for coho salmon.
Response: That summary is accurate; however, since scoping began, it has been determined that
HFRA will not be used for this project.
Issue Disposition: General in nature

2 . EPIC
50T

Comment: While the Shasta-Trinity National Forest website did provide a map of the multiple
6th field watersheds, the Scoping notice did not provide a list of all affected watersheds. Please be
descriptive in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement as to which are Key watersheds, 303(d)
listed watersheds and which serve as coho critical habitat. Please also provide a list of the
384

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Management Areas that are proposed for treatment. These details will be needed in order to
provide site-specific concerns and more well informed comments.
Response: A map showing management allocations is shown in Chapter 1 of the EIS. The
description of watersheds in the Hydrology Section of Chapter 3 notes whether the watershed is a
Key Watershed. Streams which serve as Critical Habitat for coho can be found in Table 3 of the
document labeled “Fish BE and MIS Report” under “Miles of Anadromous Fish Streams”. All of
the HUC 5 watersheds are listed as sediment-impaired under section 303(d) of the clean water act
except for the Canyon Creek and New River watersheds. These latter watersheds are considered
reference watersheds.
Issue Disposition: Procedural concern

3 . EPIC
50T

Comment: We realize the need for public safety and believe that public safety can be addressed
while limiting the impacts to wildlife, clean water, and forest resources. Focus on Highest Priority
Areas Please focus treatments on the highest priority areas-these include essential ingress/egress
routes, strategic firefighting and fire lighting positions, homes and other structures.
Response: Impacts to wildlife, water and forest resources are considered in the effects analysis,
vary between alternatives, and are minimized to the extent practicable in the Resource Protection
Measures. Burned-forest as wildlife and plant habitat is considered in the wildlife and botany
effects analyses in Chapter 3 of the EIS.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue Statement: Removing dead trees will
negatively impact habitat, clean water and forest resources; therefore, an alternative should
analyze fewer treatments on lower use roads.

4 . EPIC
50T

Comment: We note that Level 2 roads comprise the vast majority of the treatment areas. We
question whether there is a need to do the same amount of roadside treatment along these roads as
other, higher priority roads. An equal level of public safety could likely be achieved through
individual hazard tree removal. Level 2 roads, generally speaking, contain a higher level of
sediment legacy sites and are more likely to run through Late Successional Reserves (LSRs) and
northern spotted owl (NSO) Activity Centers.
Response: Maintenance Level 2 roads are open to the public; therefore, they must be maintained
at a level that provides for user safety as much as possible. Impacts to northern spotted owls and
their habitat will be analyzed in the EIS. Legacy sediment sites will be considered in the
hydrology analysis.

50T

Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #1. Issue statement: Removing dead trees will
negatively impact habitat; therefore, an alternative should analyze fewer treatments on lower use
roads.

5 . EPIC
Comment: As highlighted in the most recent demographic study, Katie M. Dugger et al. The
effects of habitat, climate, and Barred Owls on long-term demography of Northern Spotted Owls.
The Condor: Ornithological Applications, December 2015, the owl is in decline across its entire
range and that rate of decline in increasing. As the best available science shows, northern spotted
owls readily utilize forests that have burned at high-severity for foraging. Logging post-fire
forests removes structural complexity and reduces the habitat value to owls. Given the decline of
the owls, EPIC and other conservation groups are strongly opposed to removing habitat within
LSRs and owl circles. Furthermore, inclusion of these areas may trigger formal consultation with
USFWS, potentially delaying implementation of the Project.
385

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Response: The project wildlife biological assessment will address the potential effects of climate
change and barred owls on northern spotted owls in the project area. Effects to northern spotted
owl critical habitat units and LSR's will also be addressed.
Issue Disposition: Alternative Driving Issue #2. Issue statement: Removal of burned trees would
have a negative impact on northern spotted owls; therefore, analyze an alternative that would not
remove burned trees in LSR and northern spotted owl home ranges.

6 . EPIC
50T

Comment: Retain All Live Trees Please follow the recommendation of the Trinity Collaborative
to retain all live trees, meaning trees with any green foliage. Please note that this recommendation
was likewise made by AFRC in their scoping letter: "Prioritize areas of completely dead. Mixed
green will create a longer analysis period and will also make sale preparation more complex."
Response: The proposed action includes the retention of all live trees at time of implementation.
Other alternatives may be analyzed that include removal of fire-injured trees with a high
probability of mortality, as requested by other interested parties including AFRC ("utilize
Regional Salvage Guidelines"). The Regional Salvage Guidelines refers to the Forest Service
Publication Marking Guidelines for Fire-injured Trees in California (Smith and Cluck 2011)
which provides scientifically-based direction in identifying trees with a high probability of
mortality based on crown scorch, cambium injury and insect evidence during post-fire salvage
operations.

50T

Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action

7 . EPIC
Comment: Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pines, and red fir often appear dead after a fire (i.e., 0% green
needles). However, given time, the trees will "flush" the dead needles and regenerate. The Service
should take care when marking trees for removal and avoid marking ponderosa pine, red fir, or
Jeffrey pine trees before late summer. A recent study on tree flushing provided the following
recommendation: The ability of large red fir, and ponderosa and Jeffrey pines to flush and survive
high or complete levels of crown scorch implies a need for caution in making early estimates of
fire effects in large-diameter stands. To avoid overestimating high-severity effects, our study
suggests remote-sensing and field-based assessments of fire severity should be conducted after
flushing is completed in the late summer of the year following the fire. Similarly, where managers
seek to remove roadside hazard trees along popular recreation roads, as was the case in our
McNally fire study sites, early severity estimates (i.e. before completion of the following year's
growing season) may lead to needless felling of many large, old trees based on the erroneous
assumption that they are dead. Our data strongly suggest assessments of post-fire mortality be
postponed until the passage of one post-fire growing season. Additional study is needed to more
completely determine the degree of flushing and survival in a variety of site conditions for
ponderosa and Jeffrey pines, and red fir (Hanson, C.T., and M.P. North. 2009. Post-fire survival
and flushing in three Sierra Nevada conifers with high initial crown scorch. International Journal
of Wildland Fire 18: 857-864).
Response: The paper provided (Post-fire survival and flushing in three Sierra Nevada conifers
with high initial crown scorch; Hanson and North 2009) refers to the direct effects of a fast
moving fire that defoliates a crown but does not kill the cambium. This was not the case with the
majority of the fire-affected area that burned slowly in August 2015. Needle flushing, as
discussed in the article, occurs in the growing season after the areas burned. For this burned area,
that would begin in spring of 2016. The proposed action only proposes to treat dead trees at the
time of implementation, and implementation would occur in August 2016 at the earliest, after any
potential flushing would occur.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action

Comment: Any proposal to extract live trees raises the controversial issue of mortality models
and marking guidelines for designating "dying" trees. There is an extensive scientific literature on
the delayed mortality of fire-damaged conifers on forests of the western United States. Inspection
of the cambium layer can provide a more accurate indication of potential tree mortality.
Response: There is extensive scientific literature on the delayed mortality of fire-damaged
conifers in western forests. The current guiding document for our purposes is the Marking
Guidelines for Fire-Injured Trees in California ("Region 5 Salvage Guidelines"; Smith and Cluck
2011) which is a synthesis of contemporary science. This document utilizes cambium injury,
combined with crown scorch and insect activity to come up with a probability of (delayed)
mortality on an individual tree basis. Recurring years of drought is further contributing to higher
than normal levels of mortality not fully accounted for in these mortality predictions. The
proposed action would remove only trees fully dead at time of implementation, and not utilize
mortality prediction models. An alternative may be developed that does use the Region 5 Salvage
Guidelines.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action.

9 . EPIC
50T

Comment: Ecosystems on sites damaged by the passage of fire are in a stressed condition and are
the least able to withstand further disturbance. All trees that have a chance of surviving are
needed to play critical roles in natural site regeneration. They should be preserved, even if some
will later die. They provide site-adapted seed sources for new trees, shade for seedlings that is
critical under the xeric conditions of most western forests, and a host of benefits to wildlife. If a
few later succumb, they will provide snag habitat useful to wildlife. Surviving trees in LSRs
provide a significant residual of larger trees in developing stands. Defects caused by fire may
accelerate the development of structural characteristics suitable for associated species. All
standing live trees should be retained including those injured.
Response: The proposed action includes removal of only trees that are dead at time of
implementation. Other alternatives may analyze removal of fire injured trees that pose hazards to
roads consistent with Forest Service Region 5 policy. Fire-injured trees that are likely to survive
will not be removed under any alternative associated with this project unless they pose a hazard to
operations. Please note that this proposal does not include landscape salvage efforts, but focuses
on the areas adjacent to open roads in order to reduce public safety hazards. Over 144,000 acres
that burned in 2015 on the Forest are not being treated, providing a substantial amount of fireaffected structural characteristics for associated species.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action.

Comment: Snag and Coarse Woody Debris Retention "Snags provide a variety of habitat benefits
for a variety of wildlife species associated with late-successional forests. Accordingly, following
stand-replacing disturbances, management should focus on retaining snags that are likely to
persist until late-successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again producing
large snags." -FEMAT 1993, p. III-37 Please include a per acre snag retention requirement of the
largest diameter class snags within treatment areas. The ecosystem benefits of snag forest stands
cannot be overstated, as explained in the Northwest Forest Plan and Shasta-Trinity Land
Resource Managements Plan (LRMP). Large diameter snags persist the longest on the landscape
and increase the habitat value of early seral forests. They store the most carbon and provide
necessary habitat for many species.
387

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Response: The Forest recognizes the importance of snag retention as an ecosystem component.
Over 160,000 acres burned during the 2015 fires. The purpose and need of this project is to
reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety
along open National Forest System, County, and State roads. Snags deemed hazards to these
roads within the narrow treatment buffer will be removed. Only snags that are not hazardous
would be retained in the treatment buffer. It is unlikely these will occur consistently or
predictably; therefore, it is infeasible to develop a snag retention requirement beyond a statement
that says snags that are not hazardous will be retained. However, the proposed action does not
include treatment on the remaining 144,000 acres that burned in the 2015 wildfires on the ShastaTrinity. The large amounts of snags in these burned areas would contribute to the snag habitat
component on the landscape, which occur at levels far exceeding minimum retention standards
directed in the Forest Plan and Forest Level Late Successional Reserve Assessment (USDA,
1999a).
Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project

11. EPIC
50T

Comment: Some species of snags, in particular Sugar pines on ridgetops may have significant
cultural value.
Response: There is no current or historic ethnographic information suggesting dead standing
snags along ridgelines and in particular Sugar Pine were spiritually important. Various tree
species were culturally important to the Wintu people but as living food sources; oaks for their
acorns, Ponderosa pine (yellow pine) Cambium layer as a last ditch starvation food, and gray pine
for their nuts. Sugar pine were used for their nuts and the resin (sumukurkur) gathered in summer
mornings before it melted and eaten as candy. Cora A. Dubois 1935. Wintu Ethnography,
University of California Press, Berkeley, California. The fine roots of the Sugar and Ponderosa
Pine were also used for basketry. Douglas fir and Incense cedar bark was also collected from dead
snags for roofing material on lodges and bark shelters. The tree species mentioned had no more or
less importance if they were found along a ridgeline, side of a canyon, or valley bottom (R.
Patton, personal communication, October 15, 2016).

Comment: Leaving the largest material on the ground should also be considered. Further, we
recommend the retention of all legacy snags (snags which were standing before the fires) or snags
that already feature complex structures, such as cavities. We also recommend that the Service
retain all hardwood snags.
Response: The Forest recognizes the value of snags and logs as ecosystem and habitat
components. Under this project proposal, over 144,000 acres burned in the 2015 wildfires will not
be affected and will retain legacy snags as well as those killed by wildfire and/or resulting from
secondary mortality (insects, disease, and cambium injury). As such, treatments proposed under
this project are not stand or watershed-level treatments, but instead are limited to the removal of
hazards along open roads. Snags deemed hazards within an identified buffer from an open road
will be felled, regardless of whether they existed prior to the fire or not and regardless of species.
Snags outside of buffers will only be felled if they are operational hazards and will not be
removed.

Comment: Because of the important role of dead wood in late-successional and old-growth
forest ecosystems, and because there is much to learn about the role of dead wood in the
388

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

development of forests, only limited salvage is appropriate in Late-Successional Reserves. The
Final Draft Recovery Plan [for the NSO] would allow removal of small-diameter snags and logs,
but would also require retention of snags and logs likely to persist until the new stand begins to
contribute significant quantities of coarse woody debris." -FEMAT 1993, p. IV-37
Response: Tree mortality is a natural process in a forest ecosystem and snags and logs are an
important ecosystem component. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the
landscape. The proposed action would treat less than 5% of affected area on the Forest. This
action is focused along open roads, where hazards pose a danger to humans. Fuels reduction
would occur in the road buffer, but would only remove logs that exceed desired habitat
conditions. Landscape or watershed-level salvage and fuels reduction treatments are not a
component of the proposed action. Management for late successional characteristics within LSRs
does acknowledge and promote decadence, which provides habitat value for many species. The
LSRA provides direction on appropriate treatments following large-scale disturbance, and
recommends all standing live trees with a likelihood of survival be retained as well as standing
snags with a likelihood to persist and large logs present prior to the disturbance. It also
acknowledges that removal (salvage) of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to
humans along roads and trails. These principles are incorporated into this project's design.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action

1 4. EPIC
50T

Comment: Please note that the contribution of very large logs (> 20 inches in diameter) to fire
severity and intensity is negligible, as they are the fuels least available for combustion. When
these large logs do burn, it is because the smaller fuels needed to ignite them and sustain
combustion are present. Logs also burn mainly by smoldering combustion, which is not
considered in the calculation of fire intensity. This is the reason why relatively high fuel loads
comprised primarily of large-diameter woody material can be present without eliciting high
intensity fire effects. Large downed logs can also provide important shade structures that obstruct
solar radiation and surface winds. These microclimate influences can result in lower ground
surface temperatures and reduced surface wind speeds, which translate into higher live and dead
fuel moisture levels compared to areas cleared of shade from standing or downed trees. Large
downed logs can also reduce the speed and variability of surface winds, which inhibits extreme or
erratic fire behavior. Thus, the ability of large downed logs to store water and provide shade from
the sun and wind can function to lower the fire intensity and rate of spread on those specific sites.
Concerns with the removal of large standing dead and down trees (Modernizing Federal Forest
Management To Mitigate and Prepare for Climate Disruption: Science-based Recommendations
to The Obama Administration in Response to The President's November 1, 2013 Executive Order:
Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change), (National Old-Growth
Conservation Policy -Scientist Letter) collectively known as coarse wood, include the numerous
ecological roles that it plays in forest ecosystems including roles as: * Long-term sources of
energy and nutrients; * Aggregated sources of soil organic matter, which form important parts of
soil matrices; * Structural elements of the landscape that influence hydrologic and geomorphic
processes within aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems; * Significant modifiers of microclimatic
regimes in the post-disturbance ecosystem; and, most profoundly; * Habitat for a large array of
animals, including the majority of vertebrate and large numbers of invertebrate species.
Response: The Forest understands the importance of large log retention. To meet the ecological
role of large logs, the proposed action includes retention of 10-20 tons per acre of greater than 3"
diameter wood, with a preference for retention of the largest diameter logs. Large logs in excess
of 20 tons per acre would pose safety concerns for wildland firefighters in suppressing fires
(Brown et al. 2003). Treatments under this project are restricted to a narrow buffer along roads;
less than 5% of the burned area would be treated, leaving large areas with high levels of coarse

of the EIS.

Comment: Tree mortality is a natural process in a forest ecosystem. Diseased, damaged and dead
trees are key structural components of late-successional forests. Accordingly, management
planning for LSRs must acknowledge the considerable value of retaining dead and dying trees.
All standing live trees should be retained and management should focus on retaining snags that
are likely to persist until late successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again
producing large snags.
Response: Tree mortality is a natural process in a forest ecosystem and snags are an important
ecosystem component. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the landscape. The
proposed action would treat less than 5% of affected area on the Forest. This action is focused

Comment: Please include in the analysis how each LSR would be affected, why it was included
in the reserve system and how the proposed project would alter LSR function or connectivity.
Response: Actions proposed under this EIS are consistent with the LSRA. Design Criteria #7
(Fuels Reduction) pertains to "area(s) that received a stand-replacing event such as those caused
by wind, fires, insect infestation, volcanic eruptions, or diseases. The area impacted is larger than
10 acres in size and has had crown closure reduced to less than 40% except in areas with heavy
concentrations along roads that can pose a risk as a point of ignition.” This project affects trees
and snags impacted by the 2015 wildfires along open roads, and it is not anticipated to
significantly affect the functionality of any LSR with treatments. The analysis will cover the
effects of the project on Critical Habitat (2012) which incorporates much of the LSR system as
well and substantial additional areas of habitat suitable for the northern spotted owl. The
designation of LSR as a land allocation indicates a general wildlife emphasis for prescriptive
management, but is not in itself an entity that would be relevant for a project impact analysis.
Information on each LSR and their intended function is incorporated in the Forest Level LSRA as
well as the Clear Creek LSRA (USDA, 1997b). These assessments and the direction therein was
reviewed and approved by the Regional Ecosystem Office, tasked with interagency issue
resolution and interpretation of implementation under the Northwest Forest Plan.

emphasis added): Legal and Regulatory Structure # 26, "The conditions in this Waiver provide
reasonable assurance that sediment, temperature, and nutrient impairments on NFS lands will be
restored by requiring: 1) protection, maintenance, and enhancement of riparian conditions and
shade; 2) inventories and remediation of legacy sediment sites; 3) the application of BMPs and
on--the--ground prescriptions on NFS land to avoid excess sediment discharges and to improve
shade; and 4) periodic review, monitoring, and reassessment." # 32 of the USFS 2015 Waiver,
"This Waiver contains four primary components. The primary components are: 1) the
maintenance and restoration of designated riparian zones pursuant to the Aquatic Conservation
Strategy and Aquatic Management Strategy; 2) the timely implementation of watershed
restoration plans that require inventories, prioritization, and treatment of legacy sediment sites; 3)
BMPs for site--specific activities including the implementation of on--the--ground prescriptions;
and 4) a Monitoring and Reporting Program (MRP)." # 34 of the USFS 2015 Waiver, "The USFS
will actively addresses legacy sediment sites or pre-existing threats to water quality through
identification, prioritization, and treatment of such sites within Category B projects and/or
through essential projects in the WCF process as described in Finding Nos. 13--15. This Waiver
requires that all active and potential legacy sediment sites be identified, inventoried, prioritized,
scheduled, and implemented for treatment for all Category B projects and/or through the WRAP
(see Category B Condition No. 1). If the USFS does not have a WRAP for the sixth field
subwatershed where a Category B activity is proposed for coverage under this Waiver, the USFS
must propose treatments of all existing legacy sediment sites within the project area as part of the
proposed project. Grazing allotments are exempt from the requirement to identify and treat legacy
sediment sites. Trading the treatment of legacy sediment sites inside a Category B project area
with legacy sediment sites outside of the project area may be acceptable, provided the treatment
sites are within the same sixth field subwatershed and it can be demonstrated that the proposed
treatments provide an equal or greater benefit to water quality. Such alternatives shall be
submitted to the Executive Officer for approval. (See Category B Condition No. 2)" On page 17
of the 2015 USFS Waiver, "This Waiver is consistent with Resolution No. 68--16 because overall
it will result in a net benefit to water quality by setting forth conditions that implement riparian
and shade protections and enhancements, address legacy sediment sites, and implement BMPs
and on--the--ground prescriptions for new activities. The activities permitted under this Waiver
have been determined to have a low potential impact to water quality when conducted pursuant to
the terms of the Waiver, resulting in compliance with applicable water quality control plans,
including applicable water quality objectives." Under the 2015 waiver it is clear that the treatment
of legacy sediment sites is mandatory. It is not adequate to rely on Project Design Features (PDF)

Comment: Cavity-nesting species are prime beneficiaries of fires, and 62 species of birds and
mammals use snags, broken-topped, diseased or otherwise "defective" trees for roosting, denning,
foraging, or other life functions. The Northwest Forest Plan (NFP) at C-45-46, "White-headed
Woodpecker, Black-backed Wood Pecker, Pygmy nuthatch and Flammulated Owl- These species
will not be sufficiently aided by application of mitigation measures for riparian habitat protection
or for marbled murrelets alone." "Specifically, the Scientific Analysis team recommends that no
snags over 20 inches DBH be marked for cutting." The White-headed Woodpecker, Pygmy
nuthatch and Flammulated Owl all have habitat ranges within the project area. Please describe
how the Project will consider these species in treatment planning.
Response: The "Record of Decision and Standards & Guidelines for Amendments to the Survey

the recommendation cited in this comment, as well as recommended levels of snags per acre for
the species addressed in this comment. The potential effects to these species will be analyzed in
the project wildlife reports. The information in this document was taken into account in designing
the proposed action, which achieves the purpose and need while minimizing potential effects to
these species. The purpose and need of this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and
excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System,
County, and State roads. In this case, over 144,000 acres experienced wildfire on the ShastaTrinity National Forest, adding a considerable number of dead and dying trees to the landscape.

Comment: The value of CWD, which provides vital forest structure for the fisher, is without
question. Because the agency has not performed surveys as required by the LRMP at page 4-30

ample adequate habitat. The LRMP states that, "current management direction is to provide a

Comment: Please consider marking only trees that have an imminent danger and a high hazard
rating as provided in the Region 5 guidelines. Please provide hazard tree evaluation forms for
trees in moderate and low fire severity areas.
Response: Trees that are likely to fail and cause injury to people or property on Forest Service
System lands along open roads will be identified as hazard trees, consistent with the Region 5
Hazard Tree Guidelines (Angwin et al. 2012). Tree hazards include dead or dying trees, dead
parts of live trees, or unstable live trees (due to structural defects or other factors) that are within
striking distance of people or property (a target). Hazard trees have the potential to cause property
damage, personal injury or fatality in the event of a failure (Hazard Tree Guidelines, page 2). It is
important to note that a dead tree with potential to hit an open road will receive a high hazard
rating and the treatment areas under all alternatives are focused along roads. Under the proposed
action, certain sensitive areas will only have imminent danger trees addressed as identified under
the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines (e.g. Nesting/Roosting, Foraging, and Post Fire Foraging
Habitat for the Northern Spotted owl within High Value Wildlife Conservation Areas—See
Resource Protection Measure 2 in Chapter 2). Under Alternative 4 and 5 large areas of treatment
will have hazard tree mitigation only, and under Alternative 5 there will be no salvage removal at
all. Treatment of only imminent hazard trees and not the excessive fuels that pose a hazard to the
road does not meet the purpose and need of the project.
The purpose of completing hazard tree evaluation forms is to have a record of the overall
structural condition of a tree that can be used to determine progression of defects over time and to
document the frequency of certain defects within developed sites (Hazard Tree Guidelines, page
32). Completion of these time-intensive forms is not feasible for this large project area when the
purpose of this project is focused on high-rated hazard trees along roads that must be treated in a
time sensitive manner.

Response: The interdisciplinary team considered the use of whole-tree yarding during project
development. Whole tree yarding of dead trees can have a greater impact on soils because dead
trees tend to be less flexible than live trees. Also, the areas that burned at high severity often lack
of soil cover, so leaving some of the smaller material in the stand can help mitigate soil cover loss
from the fires. The DEIS will include details regarding slash treatments.

Comment: Given the overall affects to our watersheds from the multiple fire complexes, the
amount of different land allocations, the occurrence of coho and NSO and their Critical Habitat
and the number of watersheds proposed for treatment we believe that an EIS is the appropriate
choice for analysis.
Response: The level of NEPA analysis is dictated by the level of impacts expected to occur from
the proposed action. An EIS is required when project impacts are expected to be significant.
Impacts of the proposed action are expected to be significant due to the size of this project, the
cumulative effects of the fire impacts, and the number of watersheds impacted by fire and the
proposed action, and the amount of sensitive wildlife habitat in and within close proximity to the
proposed action; therefore, an EIS is the correct NEPA analysis type. The scale of the project
would need to be significantly changed to reduce the level of impacts to non-significant, which
would leave many miles of wildfire impacted roadside untreated.

Comment: We urge the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to retain all live trees, retain an adequate
amount of the largest snags and CWD (including hardwoods) in treatment units, limit roadwork,
road use and landing construction and adequately consider the watershed effects of the road
system including haul routes and treatment areas.
Response: The proposed action would only treat dead vegetation, and would retain all live trees.
Snags would be considered for retention where they do not pose a hazard to the road or to
workers, and snags would only be treated in a narrow buffer along roads leaving 95% of the
burned area providing snag habitat. Given the narrow buffer proposed, it is likely that most, if not
all, snags would be considered hazardous; however, the buffer is narrow, allowing for retention of
large amounts of snags immediately adjacent to the buffer. The proposed action includes retention
of 10-20 tons per acre of coarse woody debris, which would include hardwood logs. The
proposed action includes no temporary roads, and only proposes road maintenance, which would
improve or protect water quality. Resource Protection Measures are being developed for landing
construction. Impacts of the project on watersheds will be analyzed in chapter 3 of the EIS.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action (retain all live trees, retain an adequate
amount of snags and CWD, limit roadwork, road use and landing construction). Procedural

would like to know how the project was developed and what criteria was used.
Response: The proposed action includes treatment along all open roads (National Forest System
roads with a maintenance level of 2, 3, or 4, as well as county and state roads) within the
footprints of wildfires that burned in 2015 on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, in order to make
them safer for travel. Some areas along these roads were identified for salvage (removal of dead
trees through a timber sale or related contract) based on economic viability. All roads were first
evaluated using GIS maps overlaid with RAVG fire severity data. The areas identified in RAVG
data as having burned at high and moderate severity were field verified by Forest Service
personnel with expertise in identifying commercial timber value. During these field verification
visits, they identified areas that experienced high and moderate vegetation burn severity that
contained economic viability, which is comprised of merchantable timber that is large enough to
retain structurally sound segments after 1 year of post-fire deterioration. Fuels reduction and
salvage treatments proposed are entirely a function of open road mileage through lands
administered by the Forest Service that burned in 2015.

Comment: Why is the FS seeking an ESD? It would appear that with the proposed analyses the
project can't proceed for at least one year post fire. That hardly demonstrates an "emergency" or

by denying any opportunities to file an Objection. If the FS considers the areas a threat to public
safety are all roads identified on the map closed to public travel? If not, why?

Comment: The FS claims this project is within the WUI. Please define the WUI the FS is using?
About 67% of the roads proposed for logging are along class 2 roads that are not open to
passenger level vehicles. They can only be traveled by ATVs or high clearance vehicles. Is the FS

claiming these roads are regularly used by the residents in the WUI for transportation to and from
their communities? We request the distance from each class 2 road to the nearest community.
Response: The WUI boundaries for this project are defined in the EIS using the Trinity County
Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). The Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) is a general
term derived from the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (HFRA) to describe the area where homes
and wildland meet. The Federal Register (Region 5. January 4, 2001. Vol. 66, No.3. Pp. 751-754)
defines the WUI as the “line, area, or zone where structures and other human development meet
or intermingle with undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuel.” The WUI boundaries established in
this Trinity County CWPP Update were developed to help prioritize project planning and funding
for pre-fire (prevention) projects to help aid in protecting communities at risk for wildfire
(TCRCD and WRTC, 2010).While Maintenance Level 2 roads are generally not recommended
for use by passenger vehicles, the condition of and amount of use of those roads varies widely.
Regardless of the amount of use, the hazard trees still pose a hazard to people that are using them.
While much of the project is in WUI, and many of the roads are used for ingress and egress from
rural communities, that is not the driving factor behind the purpose and need, and proposed
action. The primary purpose of the project is to reduce hazards along roads open to the public.
Roads and communities will be shown on project maps in the EIS for proximity.

Comment: The majority of the project area is within Northern spotted owl designated critical
habitat and LSRs set aside for late-successional species such as NSO, fisher and marten. The best
available science demonstrates NSO will use all levels of burned habitat but will not use salvage
logged habitat. We incorporate by reference in their entirety the comments being submitted by
Wild Nature Institute and written by Monica Bond (attached - CC is submitting on her behalf).
We request the FS seriously consider the science cited in her comments and respond to it in the
DEIS. We have previously provided these papers to the STNF but if it requires them again let us
know and we will send them.
Response: Project impacts to at-risk species, including the fisher, marten and northern spotted
owl and other bird species, will be analyzed in the wildlife reports. Impacts to potential northern
spotted owl post-fire foraging habitat will be included in the analysis. The analysis of the
potential project impacts will be based on the available scientific data and pertinent scientific
literature. The review of scientific literature will include the documents cited in comments.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue. Issue Statement: Salvage logging has a negative
impact on use of burned areas by northern spotted owls; therefore, consider an alternative that
does not impact areas that would be used for foraging by northern spotted owls.

Comment: In addition, we are including a new paper "The effects of habitat, climate and barred
owls on long-term demography of northern spotted owls," published in The Condor and authored
by Katie M. Duggar, Eric Forsman, Alan Franklin and Raymond Davis who is a Forest Service
researcher. The paper may be found at: http://www.aoucospubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1650/CONDOR15-24.1. This paper shows NSO populations declined by 55-77% in WA; 31-68% in OR; and 3255% in CA. Furthermore, the FWS has stated the NSO may be considered for up-listing to
endangered status and that review is ongoing. Not all of the declines are blamed on Barred owls.
"The amount of suitable habitat required by spotted owls for nesting and roosting is important
because spotted owl survival, colonization of empty territories, and number of young produced
tends to be higher in areas with larger amounts of suitable habitat." The revised recovery plan
also speaks to agencies protecting all suitable habitat used by NSO, and burned habitat remains
398

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

suitable. Based on the information in Ms. Bond's comments; the scientific peer-reviewed papers
she cites; and this new paper we believe the NSO should be a driving factor in the development of
this project and at least one alternative should be developed with the NSOs life needs considered
as a priority.
Response: The scientific paper cited, and the revised Recovery Plan, are two of many documents
that will be considered in the project design process and the analysis of potential effects to
northern spotted owls. As a species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act, it is
necessary for all project alternatives to consider the life needs of northern spotted owls, and
include measures to limit potential effects to this species while still meeting the purpose and need
of the project. This process will include assessing the suitability of burned areas for northern
spotted owls and the potential effects of activities in burned areas. Acres of suitable habitat
available to this species, and the effects of proposed activities on these habitats, will be analyzed
in the wildlife biological assessment for the project.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #4, Issue Statement: The project could have a
negative impact on northern spotted owl habitat; therefore, an alternative should be considered
that minimizes or eliminates impacts to northern spotted owls.

Comment: Per the revised recovery plan for the NSO we quest all historic territories, new
territories and suitable habitat within all home ranges be protected from proposed activities. If the
FS chooses not to do so, please explain why and how removal of habitat from territories is
beneficial to the NSO. Along these lines, what is the STNF doing to protect, maintain, and/or
restore owl populations on the Forest, as required under the ESA? Project by project we see
intrusions into designated critical habitat, LSRs and more recently IRAs. These areas are to be
managed for TES species yet they all experience large commercial logging operations and the
NSO continues to decline across the STNF and throughout its range.
Response: Resource Protection Measures are being developed that will minimize potential
effects to northern spotted owls while still meeting the project purpose and need. The primary
purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels)
that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and State
roads. Impacts to the northern spotted owl, including impacts to suitable habitat and home ranges
will be included in the Biological Assessment. The Forest actively coordinates with the US Fish
and Wildlife Service in designing projects that will have long-term benefits to northern spotted
owls while minimizing potential short-term impacts to this species.

Comment: The STNF has enough time to implement at least one season of NSO protocol
surveys using the 2012 protocol, which is the best available scientific protocol. We request it do
so and if it doesn't explain why. We also request any survey results be included in the DEIS along
with the dates the surveys were conducted. Please include all NSO territories in the project area
including the amount of habitat in the nest core and home range.
Response: Due to the urgent need to address hazards to public safety, there will not be adequate
time or opportunity to conduct protocol surveys for northern spotted owls in this very large
project area. Analysis of potential effects will be based on the extensive existing data in Forest
and State of California wildlife databases. The analysis will address NSO home range locations,
potential direct effects to NSO, current habitat levels for NSO, and effects of project activities on
the suitability of these habitats for NSO.

Comment: Barred owls are habitat generalists and will use more open habitat. Since some
burned areas have become more open and salvage logging will open them up even more, the FS
must consider how the project may exacerbate barred owl invasion.
Response: Recent scientific literature and the revised recovery plan for northern spotted owls
identifies barred owls as a major threat to northern spotted owls. Accordingly, the project wildlife
biological assessment will address the potential effects of barred owls on northern spotted owls in
the project action area.

Comment: The Forest also must consider climate change to NSO. The Duggar paper mentioned
above suggests survival of young spotted owls and their ability to become part of the breeding
population increased when winters were drier, yet climate predictions include warmer, wetter
winters in the Pacific Northwest. How will this large project area contribute to climate impacts on
NSO?

Comment: Please include the Environmental Baseline for the NSO used in this project. Virtually
every large timber sale on the Trinity has included removal of some owl habitat. Take has also
been authorized in some of these projects. We encourage the FS to develop a legitimate and
defensible EB because it has not used one in the past as we demonstrated in our 60-Day NOI back
in 2010 [Re: Glitzenstein]. The EB and its methodology should be included in the DEIS or posted

Comment: The scoping notice states none of the logging is proposed in wilderness but is silent
on entries into IRAs. Please clarify. The FS must follow the Roadless Rule for any entries into
IRAs and there are restrictions on logging limited to small diameter trees. And specific criteria
must be met to remove those small trees. We encourage the FS to stay out of IRAs because they
are to be managed for TES species habitat per the LRMP; as well as retain their natural
environment. Furthermore, please clarify how any IRAs are in WUIs.
Response: The Forest is aware of and intends to comply with the Roadless Rule. This proposal,
and the removal of hazards along open roads is consistent with the Roadless Rule (2001) which
states: "Under this final rule, management actions that do not require the construction of new
roads will still be allowed, including activities such as timber harvesting for clearly defined,
limited purposes, development of valid claims of locatable minerals, grazing of livestock, and offhighway vehicle use where specifically permitted. Existing classified roads in inventoried
roadless areas may be maintained and used for these and other activities as well. Forest health
treatments for the purposes of improving threatened, endangered, proposed, or sensitive species
habitat or maintaining or restoring the characteristics of ecosystem composition and structure,

such as reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects, will be allowed where access can be
gained through existing roads or by equipment not requiring roads." (66 Fed. Reg. 3244, 3250
(Jan 12, 2001)). The Forest is not proposing landscape-level treatments within IRA, but is
committed to improving safety on already existing, open roads within the IRA. Further
information will be included in an IRA report. WUI is a function of existing infrastructure. Some
Inventoried Roadless Areas are within WUI. Maps showing WUI and IRA will be provided in the

Roadless Areas would affect the natural environment and could have a negative impact on TES
species; therefore, consider an alternative that does not treat in IRAs.

Comment: The scoping notice states high severity burned areas "generally" have no remaining
live trees, and areas burned at moderate severity also have a high likelihood of deforestation or
large pockets of mortality due to fire injury. The notice also states that all levels of burned areas
exist along the proposed roads, yet states only "dead" vegetation will be "treated." Please clarify
whether any trees that are not "dead" will be proposed for logging.
Response: The proposed action would only treat dead vegetation. No green vegetation would be
treated under the proposed action in either timber harvest or fuels reduction treatments. However,
removal of trees injured by the fire (with some green remaining) that are likely to die or that
would pose a hazard as defined by the Hazard Tree Guidelines will be analyzed under an
alternative.

Comment: We request the FS verify the accuracy of its assumptions pertaining to hazard trees.
The Bagley Fire Complex area that burned on the STNF in August 2012 was also considered a
threat to public safety because of "dead and dying" trees. We went on a fieldtrip with FS
personnel in August 2015 - 3 years after the fire - and did not find downed trees everywhere. In
fact, the FS opened the roads for hunting in September 2015 yet no logs had been removed. We
asked the FS to show us what they considered a "hazard tree" and FS personnel did not show us
even one tree. This example of a similar project on the same forest is important because it
demonstrates the FS assumptions regarding hazard trees are invalid.
Response: Tree hazards include dead or dying trees, dead parts of live trees, or unstable live trees
(due to structural defects or other factors) that are within striking distance of people or property (a
target). Hazard trees have the potential to cause property damage, personal injury or fatality in the
event of a failure (Angwin et al. 2012). Forest Service personnel identified hazard trees consistent
with the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in Pacific Southwest
Region (Angwin et al. 2012), which is based on best available science, Forest Service policy and
OSHA regulations.

Comment: Water quality is a significant issue on the Trinity River due in large part to logging
and the erosion it has caused, as well as road construction. We request the FS take a "hard look"
at the cumulative impacts of salvage logging to each affected watershed as well as the cumulative
effects to the Trinity River.
Response: Cumulative watershed effects analyses will be completed for each HUC 5, 6, 7 and 8

Comment: The scoping notice states the areas logged will be replanted using a species
composition consistent with historic conditions. We simply remind the FS that would be mixed
conifer and not predominantly Ponderosa pine - which is not utilized much by NSO. We have also
seen the FS propose conversion of mixed conifer forest to Ponderosa pine in designated critical
habitat for the NSO. While this makes no sense and fails to comply with owl recovery the Forest
continues to do it.
Response: Areas treated that are lacking sufficient forest cover will be replanted to historic
conditions. Ponderosa pine is a component of a mixed conifer forest, especially within this project
area. Ponderosa pine will be a component of the species mix, which will also include Douglas-fir
and minor amounts of incense cedar, white fir and red fir (geographically dependent). Following
fire, shade intolerant species such has ponderosa pine have a higher likelihood of survival than
shade tolerant (i.e. white fir, incense cedar) or intermediate shade tolerant (i.e. Douglas-fir, sugar
pine, red fir) conifer species.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action

Comment: Finally, we request the FS take the requisite "hard look" at cumulative effects. The FS
has chosen a very large project area so that analysis may take some time. We don't consider a

Comment: This project proposes to harvest trees, live or dead, along 233 miles of roads in areas
affected by several wildfires that burned in 2015. The majority of acreage to be harvested occurs
along Level 2 roads, which are accessible only with high-clearance vehicles. While the Forest
Service's scoping letter considers the standing dead trees to be "hazards" to public safety, the
reality is that these dead and dying trees constitute Complex Early Seral Forest habitat (Della Sala
et al. 2014)-habitat that is not only natural but critically important to the health of most western
forest ecosystems including the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and the Project will harm the
many species that thrive within this habitat.
Response: The proposed action only includes treatment of dead trees. Dying trees (trees with
remaining green foliage) would be retained under the proposed action. Removal of dying trees
will be considered under alternatives 2 & 3. Dead and dying trees in forest ecosystems near roads
open to the public are both hazards to public safety and also a habitat component beneficial to
many wildlife species. Project design features and resource protection measures are being
developed to minimize potential effects to wildlife habitat suitability while still meeting the
purpose and need of the project related to public safety.

Comment: The Project area also includes late-successional reserves and designated Critical
Habitat for the declining and federally listed northern spotted owl. I urge the Shasta-Trinity to
consider wildfires as restorative for the many species that depend upon complex early seral
forests for their life history, including potential foraging habitat for spotted owls, and not simply
as safety hazards that must be cleared away and re-planted. A thorough analysis of the Project's
impacts must disclose all the myriad adverse effects on biological diversity that would result from
removing this habitat.
Response: The roads that were selected for treatment in the proposed action are roads that are
open to the public. Some of those roads are Maintenance Level 2 roads (maintained to a level that
allows use by high clearance vehicles). These Maintenance Level 2 roads receive varying degrees
of use, with some being used frequently. However, any roads open to the public must be
maintained at a safe operating level, which includes treatment of hazardous trees and snags that
may fall on the roadbed. The impacts of each alternative on biological diversity will be addressed
in the botany, wildlife and fish analyses in chapter 3 of the EIS.

spotted owl, the two subspecies have generally similar life histories, diets, and habitat
requirements. Moreover, fire regimes in northwestern California where the northern spotted owl
resides are comparable to fire regimes in the Sierra Nevada where the California spotted owl
resides. Little has been published in the peer-reviewed literature about the effects of fire on the
northern spotted owl. Thus the current published literature, including my own on California
spotted owls, constitutes the best available science for analyzing impacts on northern spotted
owls. I will discuss and provide my own scientific studies about California spotted owls as well
as the few studies published on fire effects to northern spotted owls and Mexican spotted owls. It
is my great hope that the Shasta-Trinity National Forest will utilize these scientific studies on fire
and salvage logging to better inform your post-fire management decisions, and to fully disclose
how these decisions will impact a spotted owl population that is continuing to decline.

Comment: Fire and Spotted Owls-A decade ago, it was understandable that the U.S. Forest
Service would presume that post-fire logging would not harm spotted owls. Early studies on
spotted owl habitat relations and correlations to reproductive success were conducted in unburned
areas where the 'non-suitable' owl habitat was typically a result of logging rather than fire. As
spotted owls are usually associated with older, dense forests, it was assumed that the effects of
higher-severity wildfires were similar to logged clearcuts, resulting in a total loss of owl habitat.
Fire, however, is a fundamentally different type of disturbance than logging. Enough research has
now been conducted disproving the assumption that post-fire logging of dense forests burned at
high intensity will not harm spotted owls. While high-intensity fire likely reduces habitat
suitability for nesting and roosting because it lowers canopy cover, two studies found that spotted
owls utilize and show a preference for intensely burned forests for foraging when the burned
stands occurred close to the nest and core roost sites (Clark 2007 [Figure 6.2], Bond et al. 2009).
These studies have been available to the U.S. Forest Service for years, yet the agency continues to
propose harmful post-fire logging in spotted owl potentially suitable foraging habitat for spotted
owls. I strongly oppose the Proposed Action and urge the Shasta-Trinity National Forest to refrain
from logging any burned trees that are not a direct hazard to humans (e.g., leaning trees directly
adjacent to well-traveled roads).
Response: The roads that were selected for treatment in the proposed action are roads that are
open to the public. Some of those roads are Maintenance Level 2 roads (maintained to a level that
allows use by high clearance vehicles). These Maintenance Level 2 roads receive varying degrees
of use, with some being used frequently. However, any roads open to the public must be
maintained at a safe operating level, which includes treatment of hazardous trees and snags that
may fall on the roadbed. Resource protection measures are being developed to protect northern
spotted owl habitat, including post fire foraging habitat.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue. Issue Statement: Treatments may remove habitat
that northern spotted owls use for foraging; therefore, include an alternative that does not impact
habitat that could be used for post-fire foraging.

Comment: I co-authored a study (Bond et al. 2009) that quantified habitat selection in forests
that recently experienced significant amounts of moderate- and high-severity fire. Habitat
selection estimates how much owls used forest that burned at a particular severity compared with
the availability of that burn severity. We radio-tracked seven California spotted owls occupying
the McNally Fire in the Sequoia National Forest throughout the breeding season four years after
fire. Very little (< 3 percent) of the combined foraging ranges of these owls was post-fire logged,
so there were essentially no confounding effects of logging with high-intensity fire. Furthermore,
405

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

all owls had unburned, low, moderate, and highly burned patches of forest in their foraging ranges
from which to choose, so we could quantify whether owls selected or avoided any of these burn
intensities. This was the first study to specifically examine foraging habitat selection by spotted
owls in burned forests, and it is particularly important that these forests had not been subjected to
substantial post-fire logging so we could assess the owls' preference or avoidance for forests
burned at varying intensities. Spotted owls used all burn severities for foraging, but the
probability of an owl using a site for foraging was strongest in severely burned forests, after
accounting for distance from nest. Spotted owls used unburned mature/old forest for foraging less
than would be expected based upon availability, where post-fire habitat was available for
foraging. We also measured vegetation within owl foraging ranges and found that high-intensity
burned sites had the greatest herb and shrub cover and basal area of snags. This result suggests
that snags, herb, and shrub cover are important components of a post-fire forest that supports
foraging habitat for spotted owls. We documented that when it is available to them, foraging owls
appear to select high-severity burned forests not subjected to significant post-fire logging.
Possible explanations for the selection of intensely burned forests for foraging may be increased
accessibility or abundance of prey with fire-caused growth in shrubs and forbs. Spotted owls are
perch-and-pounce predators, and thus must have an adequate supply of trees (such as snags) upon
which to perch and wait for prey. Because intensely burned, non-salvage-logged forests can offer
suitable habitat for foraging spotted owls, Bond et al. (2009) recommended "that burned forests
within 1.5 km of nests or roosts of California spotted owls not be salvage-logged until long-term
effects of fire on spotted owls and their prey are understood more fully." Also using radiotelemetry, Clark (2007) found similar selection by northern spotted owls for mature/old forest
areas that burned at high-severity fire and were not subsequently salvage logged (see, e.g., Figure
6.2 of Clark 2007). Many California spotted owl sites have continued to be occupied and
reproductively successful after fires burned portions of their home ranges, including portions of
the core area, at least over a moderate time scale (1 year post-fire [Bond et al. 2002, Lee and
Bond 2015a], from 5 to 7 years after fire [Lee et al. 2012], and up to 16 years post-fire [Roberts et
al. 2011]). After accounting for effects of fire on occupancy, amount of severe fire had no effect
on reproduction of California spotted owls in southern California (Lee and Bond 2015b). Other
research indicates that the structural legacies created by high-intensity fire provide benefits to
spotted owls for much longer periods of time post-fire. For example, North et al. (1999) noted in
a study of foraging habitat selection by northern spotted owls, "In our study area, stands with high
use by owls typically included many 'legacies' (large trees and snags) that survived a fire or
windstorm that destroyed much of the previous stand. The survival of just a few dominant and codominant trees from the original old-growth stand increased structural heterogeneity and
produced more height class diversity in the regenerating stands." The authors went on to note:
"Large snags were created when tree tops were snapped in early-century windstorms or rotresistant tree species were killed by fire. The carry-over of these large structures into the
regenerating stands may have produced sufficient foraging habitat for the owl even though other
attributes of the stand were typical of younger forests." In a large-scale occupancy study in
managed forests throughout the Sierra Nevada, of which I am also a co-author (Lee et al. 2012),
we examined 11 years of U.S. Forest Service breeding-season survey data from 41 California
spotted owl sites burned in 6 forest fires and 145 sites in long-unburned areas. This represented
all available data for fires in spotted owl habitat where pre-fire and post-fire occupancy data had
been gathered, during that time period and remains the largest and most comprehensive study of
its kind ever published. We found no significant effects of fire on probabilities of local extinction
and colonization at burned versus unburned sites over the period of study (2001-2007), after
accounting for annual and site-specific variation in detectability. Mean occupancy was actually
slightly higher at burned sites (80 percent) than in unburned forest (76 percent), but the difference
was not statistically significant. Post-fire logging occurred on 8 of the 41 burned sites; 7 of the 8
sites were occupied immediately after the fire but none were occupied after post-fire logging,
suggesting salvage logging adversely impacted occupancy rates of the burned sites. Fire has
406

affected proportionately more spotted owl sites in the San Bernardino National Forest of southern
California than any other national forest in the range of the subspecies. This region is at the edge
of the subspecies' range, and is subject to widespread high-intensity fire resulting from extreme
fire weather in Santa Ana winds. Using occupancy survey data from 2003 to 2011 for alldetections and pairs-only data, another study I co-authored (Lee et al. 2013) estimated annual
extinction and colonization probabilities at 71 burned and 97 long-unburned breeding-season sites
before and after fire, while controlling for confounding effects of non-fire-related temporal
variation and among-site differences in habitat characteristics. We found no statistically
significant effects of fire on occupancy dynamics in this population, although we did find
potential biologically significant adverse effects on occupancy when extremely large areas within
owl core areas were burned by high-severity fire. However, a further analysis of the data (Lee and
Bond 2015b) indicated that only sites that were marginal, lower-quality, and less productive
showed lower occupancy-the highly productive sites remained occupied and reproductive
regardless of amount of high-severity fire in the core area. Furthermore, Lee et al. 2013 found
post-fire salvage logging further reduced occupancy of sites. In mostly mixed-conifer forests of
the western Sierra Nevada, my colleague and I published a study using U.S. Forest Service survey
data that found high California spotted owl occupancy at one year post-fire (before post-fire
logging) in the 257,314-acre Rim Fire of 2013 on the Stanislaus National Forest (Lee and Bond
2015a). One-year post-fire occupancy probability of historical territories (territories occupied in
one or more years over the past two decades or so) was 92 percent. We also found that, in these
post-fire territories of the Rim Fire which had not yet been subjected to post-fire logging, pair
occupancy was not lower in territories with mostly high-intensity fire effects (occupancy in such
territories was still over 90 percent). Similar results have been documented in other subspecies of
spotted owl. Jenness et al. (2004) published a peer-reviewed paper examining pre- and post-fire
occupancy and reproduction of a sample of 64 Mexican spotted owl sites in mixed-conifer, pine,
and pine-oak forests in four national forests in New Mexico and Arizona. The authors selected
owl sites in fires that burned from 1993-1996, and compared levels of occupancy [single, pair,
failed reproduction, successful reproduction] in 33 burned and 31 unburned sites, including 29
paired burned and unburned sites within 12 km of each other, in 1997. Post-fire occupancy rates
were not significantly different between burned and unburned sites, and did not statistically differ
with time since fire. The percent of high-intensity fire in a burned territory had no significant
influence on whether the site was occupied. Post-fire logging was relatively minor in most of the
fires (Coronado and Gila national forests, personal communication with M. Bond). A recent study
by Ganey et al. (2014) showed radio-marked Mexican spotted owls traveled considerable
distances to utilize burned habitat during the winter, likely because of greater prey biomass in the
burned wintering area as compared to the nest core area. Clark et al. (2013) examined how postfire logging affected occupancy dynamics of northern spotted owls in the Timbered Rock Fire and
an unburned area in southwestern Oregon. They found colonization probabilities declined over
time at both burned and unburned sites, but extinction probabilities were greater after post-fire
logging. Clark et al. (2013), on p. 15, concluded the following: Our results also indicated a
negative impact of salvage logging on site occupancy by spotted owls. We recommend restricting
salvage logging after fires on public lands within 2.2 km of spotted owl territories (the median
home range size in this portion of the spotted owl's range) to limit the negative impacts of salvage
logging. Only one study has examined the effects of fire on survival rates of marked spotted owls
in the absence of post-fire logging, also co-authored by me (Bond et al. 2002). We found no effect
of fire on short-term (1 year) survival. We examined short-term post-fire survival of 21 banded
spotted owls in 4 demography study areas encompassing all 3 subspecies. Our field biologists resighted bands and determined reproductive status of owls before and after fire in mixed-conifer
and mixed-evergreen forests of northwestern California (similar to the Shasta-Trinity), the San
Bernardino Mountains of southern California, the Tularosa Mountains of New Mexico, and in
pine-oak forests on the Coconino Plateau in Arizona. All nest and roost areas were burned, and no
post-fire logging had occurred before owls were surveyed the year after fire. We found that
407

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

survival rates were the same in burned and unburned territories. All pairs were faithful to their
pre-fire territory and mate. Post-fire logging such as that proposed in the Trinity Project is
harming spotted owls, and spotted owls are declining partly as a result of such logging based
upon the best available scientific evidence: * Lee et al. (2012) studied 6 representative fires,
covering 11 years of breeding season data, and spanning the southern Sierra Nevada to the
northern Sierra Nevada. We reported that mixed-severity fire, averaging 32 percent high-severity
fire effects in a 400-ha core area around nests or roost sites, did not reduce occupancy of
California spotted owls in the Sierra Nevada and, in fact, occupancy in mixed-severity fire areas
was slightly higher than in unburned mature forest, and even territories with > 50 percent highseverity fire remained occupied (at levels of occupancy comparable to unburned forests). This,
however, was not the case in post-fire logged sites, as every site that was salvage logged lost
occupancy, even though they were occupied after the fire but before the salvage logging.
Specifically, post-fire logging occurred on at least 8 of the 41 burned sites; 7 of the 8 sites were
occupied immediately after the fire but none were occupied after post-fire logging. * In the
Moonlight fire of 2007 on the Plumas National Forest, while a larger number of spotted owl 300acre Protected Activity Centers (PACs) remained in the system due to historical occupancy, at the
time of the Moonlight Fire there were only 9 California spotted owl sites occupied by pairs (much
of the area had been logged in previous years/decades), based upon occupancy data provided by
the Plumas National Forest. All 9 sites lost occupancy by the pairs following extensive post-fire
logging on adjacent private timberlands (and, later, on national forest lands), which began in the
summer of 2007, just days and weeks after the fire occurred, indicating that post-fire logging, not
fire, was the cause of lost occupancy (DellaSala et al. 2010). This demonstrates that PACs alone
are not sufficient to sustain spotted owls (which have home ranges many times larger than mere
~120 ha PACs). This is broadly consistent with the findings of Clark et al. (2013), who found that
post-fire salvage logging in high-severity fire areas significantly increased territory extinction of
northern spotted owls in southwestern Oregon. The available scientific data indicate that post-fire
logging on both public and private lands is a major threat to spotted owl occupancy and
populations. * Bond et al. (2009) quantified habitat selection, which is how much owls used
forest that burned at a particular severity compared with the availability of that burn severity. The
probability of an owl using a site for foraging was significantly greater in burned-especially
severely burned-forests than unburned forest. Bond et al. (2009) also measured vegetation and
found that high-intensity burned sites had the greatest herb and shrub cover and basal area of
snags. This result suggests that snags, herb, and shrub cover are important components of a postfire forest that supports foraging habitat for spotted owls, as these features provide excellent
habitat for the owl's small mammal prey base. * With regards to foraging habitat selection, Clark
(2007) states on page 100 of his M.S. thesis: …[all owls were] 2.33 times more likely (95% CI =
1.75-3.09, p < 0.0001) to use NRF habitat with high severity burn than early-seral forests. NRF
habitats with moderate and high severity burn and RF with moderate severity burns were selected
and used more frequently than available, but overall use of these habitats was relatively low."
Salvage logged sites were used less frequently than available, and in the same fashion as early
seral forest stands. For just owls within the perimeter of the burn, "NRF habitats of any fire
severity were selected, with low/unburned stands being 3.23 times…, moderate severity stands
being 4.48 times…, and high severity stands being 3.58 times more likely used than early seral
habitat." (Clark 2007, page 103). The owls also used salvage logged areas, but only where
associated with riparian buffers and patches of leave trees, and some locations were from the
logged areas prior to or during timber harvest (although number of these locations was unknown.
"Areas that received clear-cut salvage were rarely used." (Clark 2007, page 103, emphasis added).
It is true that Clark's radio-tagged Northern Spotted Owls preferred old, structurally diverse forest
as foraging habitat, but they also preferred severely burned forest (i.e., used it more than it was
available)-a point that cannot be discounted by the Forest Service during analysis of effects of
removing this foraging habitat. These severely burned patches were rare within owl home ranges
in the study, yet were used more frequently than available. Clark (2007) specifically stated:
408

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

"[w]hile, these areas of stand replacement may not provide high quality habitat, they likely
provided some benefit to owls following wildfire because owls did make use of these stands. I
hypothesize that high severity burns in NRF habitat which created early seral stands may be used
by owls because they may provide increased prey abundance…but I was unable to test this
hypothesis. Furthermore, large dead trees created by wildfire are likely to serve as "legacy
structures", and provide coarse woody debris and snags for future late-successional forests…,
potentially making these stands important to creation of spotted owl habitat in the future. In
addition, early seral forests created by disturbance events that are not altered by timber harvest
are extremely rare…and support some of the highest levels of biodiversity…Therefore, the
potential ecological benefits of large standing dead trees should be weighed against social and
economic objectives when considering land management activities." (Clark 2007, page 115).
Response: The scientific literature includes a wide range of findings on northern spotted owls
and their use of burned areas, and some authors have proposed management recommendations in
addition to reporting research results. The wildlife biological assessment will consider the
relevant scientific studies and associated recommendations in assessing potential effects of
proposed activities on northern spotted owls and formulating resource protection measures related
to this species. The analysis will include consideration of impacts on northern spotted owl habitat,
including post fire foraging habitat.

Comment: The Shasta-Trinity's NEPA analysis must discuss cumulative effects incorporating
private lands that have been heavily logged in the distant and recent past, and amount of post-fire
logging on these lands, and how this might affect the potential for northern spotted owl recovery.
Please also include a discussion of the published literature quantifying actual fire rotation in
forests occupied by northern spotted owl forests, as the scoping letter suggests the purpose and
need is to prevent future severe fire in the region. Such literature includes: Odion, DC, Hanson
CT, Della Sala DA, Baker WL, Bond ML 2014. Effects of fire and commercial thinning on future
habitat of the Northern Spotted Owl. Open Journal of Ecology 7:37-51.
Response: The purpose of the project is to reduce hazards along roads, including heavy fuel
loading, to provide for public and firefighter safety using the roads; it is not to prevent future
severe fire in the region as stated in the comment. The proposed action consists of a very narrow
buffer along roads; this narrow buffer is unlikely to affect fire behavior across the landscape, but
is designed to reduce fire intensity along the roads. The assessment of potential effects of this
project, including impacts to northern spotted owls, will include an analysis of cumulative effects,
which is necessary under both NEPA and ESA. Future Foreseeable treatments on adjacent private
lands will be considered in the analysis to the extent that it is available on the CalFire private
timber harvest database. Salvage harvest on private lands is considered a present/ongoing action
and is estimated within the relevant resource reports. The fire regime in this area will also be
addressed in the project analysis, and the scientific study listed in the comment will be reviewed.

Comment: I strongly disagree with any post-fire logging of burned trees on national forest lands
that are not directly threatening busy thoroughfares, as these trees provide critical habitat for
many native species (Della Sala et al. 2014).
Response: A range of alternatives will be developed and analyzed in the project EIS. This will
include a No Action alternative, which would involve no tree removal or any other activities. The
primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive
fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and
State roads. Closed roads would not be treated under the proposed action.

Comment: At the very minimum I recommend the following, based on the best available science:
(1) Conduct comprehensive, protocol-level occupancy surveys of every historical spotted owl
territory. This includes at least 6 visits in each site if conducted over one year. Better yet, conduct
surveys for at least 2 or more years following the fire before any logging is conducted, as
unoccupied sites can become colonized (Lee et al. 2012);
Response: Due to the urgent need to address hazards to public safety, there will not be adequate
time or opportunity to conduct protocol surveys for northern spotted owls on this very large scale.
Analysis of potential effects will be based on the extensive existing data in Forest and State of
California wildlife databases. The analysis will address northern spotted owl home range
locations, current habitat levels for northern spotted owls, and effects of project activities on the
suitability of these habitats for northern spotted owls. Suitable northern spotted owl habitat will
be assumed to be occupied. Consultation will occur with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to
comply with the Endangered Species Act.

Response: The scientific literature on northern spotted owl use of burned areas and potential
effects of management activities includes a number of management recommendations. These
recommendations and the research results they are based on will be reviewed, and their
pertinence to the proposed project activities will be assessed. The No Action alternative, which
would include no logging within 1500 meters of NSO cores, will be analyzed and included in the

Comment: (5) Notwithstanding Recommendation 4, I urge the U.S. Forest Service to not log any
suitable owl nesting, roosting, or foraging habitat (this includes burned forest) given the natural
territory-shifting that may occur after fire, and given that the Mexican spotted owl study showed
owls will move to new burned areas away from their nest cores to take advantage of greater prey
biomass. A no-logging alternative should be thoroughly analyzed in the forthcoming EIS using
the best available scientific data.
Response: The wildlife biological assessment will address the potential for northern spotted owls
to shift behavior patterns in response to fire effects. The No Action alternative, which includes no
logging or any other activities, will be analyzed along with all other project alternatives. Limits to
logging activities will also be considered in the project design process for other project
alternatives.

Comment: 1) CFA believes the Forest should consider a variable width buffer for dead and dying
tree removal along existing roads. On steeper side slopes above the road, often the width should
be 1 ½ to 2 tree lengths to assure a falling tree does not fall and a portion of the tree break off and
slide to the road. On the downhill side of the road, the buffer width should be 1 tree length so that
no part of a falling tree can hit the road.
Response: Hazard trees along haul routes and treatment units would be felled during
implementation, but those that are felled outside of treatment buffers would be left onsite. The
treatment in the proposed action only includes a variable buffer up to 300 feet in width. An
alternative to the proposed action is being developed that would have a wider buffer width,
consistent with the Hazard Tree Guidelines for Forest Service Facilities and Roads in the Pacific
Southwest Region (Angwin et al. 2012).

collaborated with the US Fish and Wildlife Service regarding appropriate levels of protection that
will also allow us to meet the project's purpose and need, which includes reducing safety hazards

Comment: 1.) The project must state that there will be no timber harvest in Wilderness areas or
in Designated Roadless areas.
Response: The proposed action states that there are no proposed treatments in wilderness. This
project, however, does treat along roads open for public use (National Forest System roads with a
maintenance level of 2, 3, or 4, as well as county and state roads). Some of these open roads
occur in Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA). These roads will be treated, consistent with the
purpose and need of the project, but will have additional resource protection measures (i.e.
limited mechanical treatments outside of road prism) in place to maintain the existing integrity of
the IRA.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action (no treatment in wilderness). Alternative
driving issue #5(no treatment in IRA). Issue Statement: Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas

Comment: 2.) I understand the Project proposes to reduce downed logs greater than 3" in
diameter to 10-20 tons/acre and reduce dead brush by 50-100%. Would this happen in a minimum
or maximum corridor of 300 feet along roads? Or, would this happen within all severely burned
areas also?
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside
of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat
dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under the proposed action. Other

of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat
dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under the proposed action. Salvage
refers to the sale of trees where they are dead and/or dying in large areas, usually due to fire,
insect or disease, but also sometimes weather events can create large pockets of dead and broken
trees. Where dead trees are in sufficient quantity and quality to provide commercial value along
roads in the project area, they would be sold in a salvage timber sale.

System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must
be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically
located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire
impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the roads in the project area burned at very low

Comment: 6. In addition to safety and fire resilience, please consider waterbars and other
measures necessary for water quality, as a result of fire suppression activities, in case they were
not addressed before the current winter 2015-16. These will be important for years because of
potential erosion in the burned areas, whether they are planted soon or not. Water quality is
critical for the health of all aspects of the forests, including timber production.
Response: Fire suppression repair and Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts have
addressed some of these issues directly, by repairing some of the suppression impacts, including
installing water bars, and making improvements to the road system in the burned area. The
primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive
fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and
State roads. Additional repair of fire and suppression damage within the fire boundary but away
from roads is beyond the scope of this project; however, resource protection measures and Best
Management Practices designed to protect water quality will be required within the area treated in
the project. Additional mitigations in the watersheds that were most impacted by fire are also
being considered as part of the mitigation measures.

on page four of the scoping document. Maintenance timeframes were not explicitly detailed in the
scoping package, but will occur within 15 years following implementation (see Chapter 2 for
more information on maintenance). The NEPA analysis does not prescribe particular labor
sources in order to allow flexibility in implementation when other labor options are more

Comment: 3) Shaded fuelbreak with existing crown cover - then using "high risk" marking
prescription - remove old fire risk trees likely to die within next 10 years or showing dead wood,
limbs, spike tops, big forks full of trash, etc. Secondly, remove "career understory" suppressed
and unlikely to ever respond to release. Residual stand should be a healthy open stand of young
thrifty mature and pole timber.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must
be contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically
located (not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire
impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a
fuelbreak would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed
action would only treat dead vegetation. Also, the treatments in the proposed action would have
maintenance, as described on page four of the scoping document. Maintenance timeframes were
not explicitly detailed in the scoping package, but this will be covered in chapter 3 of the DEIS.
Roadside fuelbreaks will be considered under alternatives to the proposed action.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #7. Issue Statement: Future high severity fire is a
concern in the project area which will not be addressed by the proposed action; therefore, analyze

Comment: 4) Crown closure/spacing: Ideally when you walk a fuelbreak and look up, you
should see more blue than you do green - rule of thumb 40% crown closure with sufficient
spacing to prevent fire from carrying through the canopy. This too will take maintenance and
provide a few sawlogs.

Comment: 5) Planting: openings and burn areas - recommend planting ponderosa pine - it will
survive and thrive in full direct sunlight and be less attractive to browsing than other species. Not
to worry about "monoculture" other native timber species will come in naturally if within
wind/rodent range and the ponderosa pine will serve as a nurse crop.
Response: Reforestation prescriptions will be consistent with historic species composition
(consistent with the National Forest Management Act of 1976). Therefore, ponderosa pine will be
in the mix of species planted, along with incense cedar, Douglas fir, white fir, red fir, and sugar
pine. As planting will only occur in areas deforested due to fire mortality, species that thrive in
the full sun will be favored in the planting mix. There are, however, areas where existing seed
sources are substantially limited due to fire mortality, and would result in a monoculture if an
appropriate species mix is not planted. Ponderosa pine thrives in full sun and is relatively fire
resilient when mature thereby making it a valuable stand component in fire affected stands. See
Response #105 regarding spacing.

and seed exposed soils to grass (Timothy, Orchard grass, perennial rye and sweet clover or
similar) which will also provide wildlife/livestock feed and can be quickly burned off if the
fuelbreak is employed for suppression.

Comment: 8) Mid-slope fuelbreak: silvicultural treatment/thinning along roads below ridge top
effect. While probably not truly fuelbreak, particularly on a steep slope, nonetheless thinning
along such roads certainly contributes to greater traveler safety, especially in the escape mode,
and can be effective for "flanking" a fire. Thinning should favor the downhill side as a fire spread
is largely slope driven up hill.
Response: The proposed action only proposes to treat dead vegetation where it poses a hazard to
people using the roads, which is consistent with the purpose and need to reduce hazards along
open roads. Thinning of green vegetation is not included in the proposed action. For a fuelbreak
to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider than the treatments
proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in areas that would be
strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that many areas along
the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require treatment of green
vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat dead vegetation.
Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternatives. An alternative is also
being considered that includes a wider treatment on the downhill side of roads as a way to more
effectively impact fire behavior along the roads.

Comment: As a forester, (Bachelor of Science, University of Maine, 1956) I was trained that in
the event of disaster such as fire, wind throw, or insect/disease epidemic the forester needs to
move quickly and decisively to minimize damage, capture and utilize residual value, and
maintain land productivity.
Response: Removal of dead and dying trees immediately following fire impacts would capture
much more of the economic value of fire-impacted trees. However, unlike logging on private
lands, any planned activities on National Forest System lands must comply with federal laws and
regulations such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA has specific
requirements for analysis of impacts to resources that must be accomplished, along with
solicitation of public input, for every action. During and following fire suppression, imminent
hazard trees were felled which is consistent with actions categorically excluded from
documentation. However, utilizing mechanical equipment such as skidders, road construction,
etc. requires an appropriate level of analysis under NEPA, which in this case is an EIS.

Comment: Specifically 1) as soon as the air is clear and safe, get grass seed on barren burned
areas utilizing fixed wing or helicopter.
Response: Seeding with grass seed is not standard practice in this area. The Forest is in a
Mediterranean climate where most precipitation comes in the winter. Grass seed is unable to
become established before the first heavy rains wash them into creeks. The grass seed germinates
in and along creek beds, which causes an over-abundance of grass in these areas. The Burned
Area Emergency Response (BAER) process evaluated all burned barren areas within the burned
areas for erosion and values at risk (roads, private residents, endangered species, etc.) and
concluded that mulching was not necessary to protect critical values at risk. The BAER process
identified many roads that were in need of repair and they were treated with various types of
storm proofing to reduce road-related erosion. Erosion control in the greater burned area is
outside the scope of this project; however, erosion control measures will be implemented where
necessary during project implementation.

Comment: 3) as soon as suppression activities thin, commence salvage logging of dead and

Comment: Some crowns may remain green but increment boring, sounding, or sample falling
will verify "cambium cooked-tree dead". Don't know how to do this? Contact Roseburg Lumber
Co - 100,000 acres in two years and they even made a training film - "Fountain Fire".
Response: The Forest recognizes that green needles do not indicate that a tree will survive and
thrive. Cambial death does often take time for the needles to respond to lack of resources and turn
brown. The Forest does have experience in determining the probability of mortality (as referenced
in the comment regarding the Stafford Fire Salvage of 2013). If the proposed action were
consistent with the Stafford Fire Salvage Project, the Forest would evaluate cambium injury
under the direction of Marking Guidelines for Fire-injured Trees in California (Smith and Cluck
2011). The proposed action includes removal of dead trees at time of implementation. At the time
of implementation, most mortality directly due to cambium injury should be realized; however,
additional mortality (primarily due to secondary agents such as insects exploiting weakened trees)
is anticipated for a few more years. Utilizing the probability of mortality as directed in the
Marking Guidelines for fire-injured trees in California may be considered under an alternative to
the proposed action.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #11. Issue Statement: The proposed action only
proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all
of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the
hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees.

impotent and not cost effective for the last 20+ years. Does anyone remember the foundational
direction of the 1897 Organic Act - "Produce wood and water on a sustained yield basis to help

must be managed for forestry/timber, recreation, wildlife habitat, range, and water resources. The
primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive
fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and
State roads; however, secondarily, the purpose and need also includes an aspect to produce timber
products where hazard trees are abundant enough to create commercial opportunity. Planting is
being proposed in treated areas appropriate for reforestation. Additional planting outside of
treatment boundaries may be considered under a different project. The impacts of logging on
federal lands must be considered in the context of impacts to resources in the analysis area.

Comment: P3-last paragraph item 4 starting "create" disagree strongly. Fire was commonly by
"native Americans" to keep the forest open for travel, the production of food stuffs, and probably
harass competing tribes. "Natural fire" is probably indefinable but is attested to by signs such as
large cat faces, bark charring as high as 15 feet and areas of discolored erosion pavement. The
intent of modern forestry was to bring in silvicultural practices which access the forest while
redirecting fuel loads and respecting property boundaries, which did not exist 200 years ago-all in
a fiscally responsible manner.
Response: Within the last 100 years forest practices and fire suppression have created a large
build-up of fuels on the forest floor. High severity wildfires add to the heavy fuel loading with
dead and dying trees (becoming logs) and dead brush. This high fuel loading decreases firefighter
safety and increases detrimental fire effects on the landscape. The project identifies a need to
"Create conditions that will support the restoration of fire to its natural role in the ecosystem"
because it is a primary "Forest Goal" identified in the Management Direction section of the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.
While the exact extent and frequency of Native American ignitions remains unknown, it is clear
from historic accounts that most tribes used fire for many reasons. Native American burning
appears to have been most frequent in low-elevation oak woodlands, prairies in the coastal forest
belt, and eastside ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests (Sugihara et al. 1987). Aside from these
generalities, it is not possible to separate the role of Native American ignitions from lightning
sources over the last several thousand years. The most common belief is that while Native
American ignitions were locally important, lightning was responsible for a large majority of
historic fires and is sufficient to explain long-term fire regimes (Swetnam & Baisan 1996, Agee
1991b, Burke 1979).

Comment: P2-last paragraph-"purpose" can't anyone say silviculture anymore or is it not
politically correct, specifically a major purpose for action should be the opportunity to apply
scientific silviculture to help make/keep the forest healthy and productive. There was a time in the
60's and 70's when there was widespread pride within the USFS that aside from the five southern
California "Fire Forests" the USFS was an asset to the American taxpayer.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. A post-fire project with a silvicultural purpose and need would
look considerably different than this proposal and focus on restoration of the landscape through
strategic salvage and reforestation to effectively restore forest cover at the landscape scale. Given
the scale of disturbance and existing capacity, this objective is not feasible to achieve in a timely
manner, which is so critical when dealing with deteriorating trees. However, planting on a larger
landscape scale may be considered as a separate project.

However, this direction does not outweigh other resource protection direction outlined in the

factors determine the most efficient means of implementation. Implementation could include use
of inmate labor, but such details are not prescribed in the NEPA analysis in order to allow
flexibility in implementation when other labor options are more available and/or efficient. Inmate
crews are certainly a tool often utilized by the Forest Service to achieve resource objectives
including handwork and will be considered during implementation of this project. Timber sales
will be designed as economically as possible, incorporating areas with high densities of larger,
dead timber; weighing high priority areas with lesser priority areas; balancing higher cost logging
systems and resource protection measures with lower cost areas of implementation. Industry input
will be taken into consideration in that process.

Comment: P4-mid page starting "utilize" salvage should be of sufficient volume to financially

Response: Removal of larger dead trees while they can pay for themselves instead of requiring
appropriated funding to treat is the most efficient and productive way of dealing with the
excessive fuels and hazards left after these wildfire events. It is important to note that the Forest
does not expect the revenue generated by road-side salvage to cover or exceed the cost of hazard
tree abatement, fuels treatment and reforestation efforts. However, revenue generated
substantially offsets the cost of implementation, and timber sales would be completed by

Response: While 12x12 is typical (and often past practices promoted even denser plantations),
the long-term goal of these roadside areas is to promote conditions suitable for a shaded
fuelbreak, and therefore wider spacing than what is typical for managed stands is appropriate in
this situation. Spacing will vary based on conditions. Additional reforestation efforts (beyond

Response: Comment refers to "Trees or snags that are imminent hazards to the road and/or
operations would be felled; trees that are felled outside the treatment buffer would be left onsite."
The intention is that hazard trees felled outside of treatment areas would be of a lower
concentration, thus not contributing significantly to fuel loading than areas of highly concentrated
mortality. This suggestion may be considered in an alternative to the proposed action.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #10. Issue Statement: The proposed action would
leave felled hazard trees outside the treatment buffer, which leads to heavy fuel loading;

Comment: We are concerned and disappointed that this document has drifted from the core ideas
expressed in the Trinity Collaborative’s "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" proposal. The core ideas
of the Trinity Collaborative are ecologically sound, economically sustainable, and socially
accepted management of forest lands.
Response: We assume that the references to "watering-down of key proposed items" and "drifted
from the core ideas" refer to the tree planting spacing and the ripping of the soil proposed in the
Trinity Collaborative's proposal. These items were adjusted in order to improve the ecological
soundness of the proposal. Soils can be seriously damaged during high severity fires, especially
sensitive soils; ripping of soils would cause further damage in many cases, rather than repairing
fire damage. Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions for tilling of landings,
temporary roads, and main skid trails which will perform a similar function as “ripping” of soils.
Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions to rip soils in areas that are compacted
by implementation activities; these typically include landings and parts of skid trails. While 40
mature trees per acre comprises an effective shaded fuelbreak and contributes to wildlife habitat
without the appearance of a plantation, the 40 trees in a shaded fuel break are the hardy persistent
trees that withstood natural mortality over the decades until they effectively started to contribute
shade. Without the use of herbicides and intensive tending, a high mortality rate is anticipated
with post-fire reforestation. A stand is considered stocked when 75 conifer seedlings per acre
survive five years after the initial planting. In areas lacking any residual live trees (contributing to
a future seed source), planting a total of 40 trees per acre would do little to contribute to future
forested conditions.

1 06. TCC
Comment: The main focus of our "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" proposal is to create the
groundwork for a network of shaded fuel breaks along our forest and county roads. Removing the
fuels while they can still pay their way out of the forest is a crucial element of any real recovery
plan. All proposed projects involving timber harvest to help pay the costs, needs to be offered and
423

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

completed while merchantable timber still has value and has not deteriorated significantly.
Otherwise, there will be no viable offers received and nothing will be achieved. Harvesting
operations expected to meet this constraint must be completed in calendar year 2016.
Response: For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be contiguous, wider
than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located (not all roads are in
areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is spotty, meaning that
many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak would require
treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action would only treat
dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in alternative 2. While
the premise for "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" may have been to lay the groundwork for a
network of road-based fuelbreaks, the proposal will not achieve that end result due to other
constraints incorporated into the proposal (treatment of only dead vegetation and a 300-foot
buffer width). The proposal does allow removal of large fuels (where commercially viable) and
treatment of smaller fuels, which will reduce severity of fire behavior in the immediate road-side
vicinity, upon completion of the required level of environmental analysis (EIS in this case).The
Forest recognizes the importance of timely implementation of this project in order to capture any
economic value still remaining in these dead trees. Removal of larger dead trees while they can
pay for themselves instead of requiring appropriated funding to treat is definitely the most
efficient and productive way of dealing with the excessive fuels and hazards left after these
wildfire events. While federal and agency regulations regarding the NEPA process for analysis
must be followed, the Forest is committed to expediting the processes as much as possible by
utilizing tight analysis deadlines, concurrent reviews by collaborating specialists, concurrent
collaboration with regulatory agencies. The proposed action is likely to have significant impacts
so it must be analyzed under an EIS. Implementation of this project in early summer is not
possible due to required steps (specialist analysis, consultation with regulatory agencies, public
comment periods and responses, etc.) under NEPA and ESA. It is important to note that the Forest
does not expect the revenue generated by road-side salvage to cover or exceed the cost of hazard
tree abatement, fuels treatment and reforestation efforts. However, revenue generated
substantially offsets the cost of implementation, and timber sales would be completed by
contractors which would allow the public hazard along roads to be addressed in a shorter
timeframe. Addressing that hazard with Forest Service personnel alone in a short timeframe is not
within our capability due to the large area affected by the fires and limited personnel.

Comment: The inclusion of the Emergency Situation Determination request and the absence or
watering-down of key proposed items, risks damaging the credibility of collaborative members
who have publicized the proposal with community members and environmental groups in
attempts to obtain "social license" (i.e., support or agreement not to block or object to) these
projects. The document doesn't highlight that this project was developed as a partnership with the
Trinity County Collaborative group, which will help maintain the social license.
Response: An Emergency Situation Determination was considered earlier in the planning process
but is not being pursued at this time. The “Public Involvement” section of chapter 1 explains that

soundness" of the proposal. Soils can be seriously damaged during high severity fires, especially
sensitive soils; ripping of soils would cause further damage in many cases, rather than repairing
fire damage. Standard Resource Protection Measures include provisions for tilling of landings,
temporary roads, and main skid trails which will perform a similar function as “ripping” of soils.

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

While 40 mature trees per acre comprises an effective shaded fuelbreak and contributes to
wildlife habitat without the appearance of a plantation, the 40 trees in a shaded fuel break are the
hardy persistent trees that withstood natural mortality over the decades until they effectively
started to contribute shade. Without the use of herbicides and intensive tending, a high mortality
rate is anticipated with post-fire reforestation. A stand is considered stocked when 75 conifer
seedlings per acre survive five years after the initial planting. In areas lacking any residual live
trees (contributing to a future seed source), planting a total of 40 trees per acre would do little to
contribute to future forested conditions.
Issue Disposition: General in Nature, position statement.

Comment: Failing to capture this opportunity to pay for the removal of all these dead fuels along
the road network will create the worst possible conditions for the future control and containment
of catastrophic wild fire. This would mean the loss of even more critical habit and diminished
opportunities for recovery of species at risk.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads, and to attain commercial value where it is available when
meeting the hazard reduction need. The intent is to salvage timber in the treated areas, where
feasible. We understand that the time frame is potentially problematic. When planning a large,
complex project like this, even when the action mitigates a safety hazard, the impacts must still be
assessed at the appropriate National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) level. The appropriate
level of analysis for a project like this that is likely to have significant effects is an EIS, which is a
time consuming process. The Forest Service is pursuing options to reduce the timeline, where
available, with the intent of providing a salvage timber sale in a timely manner. While this project
has the intent to reduce hazards along roads, including heavy fuel loads, the proposed action only
proposes to treat dead material. The intent of the fuel reduction treatments is to reduce the
severity of fire immediately adjacent to roads to allow for ingress and egress during wildfires. To
impact fire behavior across a landscape, treatments would need to include fuelbreaks and be
much more extensive. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be
contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located
(not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is
spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak
would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action
would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in
alternatives.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action

Comment: 2. Replace language in bullet point 5 on page 3 with original language from
Collaborative’s proposal, "Plant mixed conifers (40-50 trees per acre at approximately 30' spacing

between planted trees" . . . etc.) This comment also applies to bullet point 3 of the middle set of
points on page 4 concerning "spacing of seedling of 18 to 30 feet. Our desired future condition is
a (long-lived) shaded fuelbreak, not a plantation.
Response: The spacing of seedlings (18-30 feet) included in the proposal includes the
collaborative proposal's figure of 30-foot spacing and may be used if specifically appropriate for
the ground. However, planting at 30-foot spacing is unlikely to yield the desired condition of a
shaded fuelbreak due to mortality. The Forest concedes that 40 mature trees per acre comprises an
effective shaded fuelbreak and contributes to wildlife habitat without the appearance of a
plantation. However, those 40 trees in a shaded fuel break are the hardy persistent trees that
withstood natural mortality over the decades until they effectively started to contribute shade.
Without the use of herbicides and intensive tending, a high mortality rate is anticipated with postfire reforestation. A stand is considered stocked when 75 conifer seedlings per acre survive five
years after the initial planting. In areas lacking any residual live trees (contributing to a future
seed source), planting a total of 40 seedlings per acre would do little to contribute to future
forested conditions. Reforestation (planting) for the purposes of even-aged management
historically included spacing of 6' by 6' to 8' by 8'. In the last decade or so, reforestation generally
consists of 12' by 12' spacing. Due to the long-term goal of these roadside areas for promoting
conditions suitable for a shaded fuelbreak, and not plantation management, a wider spacing is
being prescribed than is typical for managed stands. Spacing will vary based on site conditions
and likelihood of success.
Issue Disposition: Conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence.

Comment: Regarding fuelbreak width, there may be some places where 300' (plus road width) is
not feasible, so we proposed to change the language near the bottom of page 3 to "will not exceed

Comment: Regarding soil ripping (sub-soiling) to improve runoff infiltration, we clarify our

ripping of soils would cause further damage in many cases, rather than repairing fire damage.

roads, and main skid trails which will perform a similar function as “ripping” of soils.

Response: New landings are placed in the most favorable terrain available, unless over-ridden by
other resource constraints. Areas such as riparian reserves, sensitive botanical habitat (such as
serpentine), archeological sites, unstable land mass, etc. add constraints to landing placement.
Access ramps to landings not exceeding 100 feet will be incorporated into the proposed action to

Comment: The document needs to clearly state; There will be no project activities occurring
within Wilderness Areas or Inventoried Roadless Areas.
Response: The proposed action states that there are no proposed treatments in wilderness. This
project, however, does treat along roads open for public use (National Forest System roads with a
maintenance level of 2, 3, or 4, as well as county and state roads). Some of these open roads
occur in Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA). These roads will be treated, consistent with the
purpose and need of the project, but will have additional resource protection measures (i.e.
limited mechanical treatments outside of road prism) in place to maintain the existing integrity of
the IRA.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action (no treatment in wilderness). Alternative
driving issue (no treatment in IRA). Issue Statement: Treatments in Inventoried Roadless Areas
would have a negative impact; therefore, include an alternative that does not treat in IRAs.

Comment: In conclusion we believe the choice in this circumstance of doing a full
Environmental Impact Statement is the wrong vehicle to protect the environment and allow for
economic success or to achieve the desired future conditions, as outlined in the Trinity
Collaborative "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" and the "Pilot Roadside shaded fuel break project".
Because of EIS timelines it is our very real concern that this course of action will fail and that no
restoration and fuel removal will occur. To this end, we urge Shasta-Trinity National Forest to
choose to either; 1) pursue our recommendation to do an expedited EIS with significantly shorten
time frames that would allow the Forest Service to complete the whole project or 2) if all other
attempts fail, to select strategic locations with the best timber value and least environmental
constraints, utilizing multiple CE's based on either a watershed criteria or the individual fires.
Response: The level of NEPA analysis is dictated by the level of impacts expected to occur from
the proposed action. An EIS is required when project impacts are expected to be significant.
Impacts of the proposed action are expected to be significant due to the cumulative effects of the
fire impacts, the number of watersheds impacted by fire and the proposed action, and the amount
of sensitive wildlife habitat in and within close proximity to the proposed action; therefore, an
EIS is the correct NEPA analysis type. The scale of the project would need to be significantly
changed to reduce the level of impacts to non-significant, which would leave many miles of
wildfire impacted roadside untreated. The current timeline to develop an EIS is an estimate based
partly on legally required timelines such as comment periods, and on the amount of time it
typically takes to complete the complex level of analysis required for an EIS.

Comment: The proposed project will only address a small percentage of the forest area affected
by the 2015 fires on the Shasta Trinity National Forest. The project should include all areas
within or adjacent to the wildland urban interface areas around communities as suggested in the
Community Wildfire Protection Plans.
Response: The Forest Service recognizes the high fuel loading on the Forest is a concern for fire
hazard, especially to rural communities. This project is one project that has the goal to move
towards desired fuel loading conditions. It is focused on roads, which can be used as ingress and
egress for rural communities. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards
(i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open
National Forest System, County, and State roads. Because the intent of this project is to treat
roadside areas, larger fuel reduction treatments within WUI are outside the scope of this project,
but could be considered under other projects in the future.
Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project.

119. Jaegel, Roger

Comment: Research suggests fuel loading of greater than 20-30 tons/acre in mixed conifer forest
will result in unacceptable risk in terms of excessive fuel loads and extreme resistance to control
factors. These conditions will persist for over 60 years if fuels are not reduced. It is most
important to reduce the heavy (1000 hr.+) fuels. This fuel type is the most difficult and costly to
mitigate and often removal is the only answer.
Response: The proposed action would reduce downed logs to 10-20 tons per acre in the treatment
buffer along roads. Downed logs includes woody material >3-inches in diameter including fuels
created by salvage and suppression actions. The Forest Service agrees that the large logs are the
most difficult to treat with fuels reduction treatments, and that the most effective way to meet the
desired fuel tonnage is to remove the logs from the unit. However, this does have an impact on
soils that must be analyzed and reduced to the extent practicable.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action.

1 20. Jaegel, Roger
50T

Comment: The current drought and accelerated insect and disease in the conifers around the fire
areas will continue to add fuel loading for years and possibly decades to come. It's past time to
consider the current research, science and our experience in analysis of these fuel conditions and
the importance of mitigation to our communities and adjacent resources.
Response: The Forest Service recognizes the high fuel loading on National Forest System lands
is a concern for fire hazard, especially to rural communities. This project has the goal to move
towards desired fuel loading conditions. It is focused on roads, which can be used as ingress and
egress for rural communities. Because the intent of this project is to treat roadside areas, larger
fuel reduction treatments within WUI are not appropriate under this project, but could be
considered under other projects.

Comment: After attending the meeting regarding fire salvage, I am disappointed in the USFS's
decision to capitulate to the pressure of an organization whose interest is not in addressing the
needs of the burned areas, but is more directed at meeting political agendas. I am referring
specifically to the USFS's endorsement of the Collaborative's proposal for fire salvage.

Comment: I believe the USFS should remove all hazard trees based on the REGION 5 FIRE
INJURED TREE GUIDELINES such as were used on the Stafford Fire Salvage. These guidelines
based on science, fire events, and compiled by experts, allow fire damaged trees meeting a
specific probability of mortality to be removed. This allows removal on the first entry, of trees
which are dying, rather than hoping for a second or third entry some months later. Economically,
with the discussion that no extra money will be allocated for this project, this seems reasonable.
The Collaborative proposes to remove only trees which are completely dead, and the USFS has
agreed to this, but this neither fully addresses the damage nor meets the needs of the land.
Response: The Forest recognizes that green needles does not indicate that a tree will survive and
thrive. Cambial death does often take time for the needles to respond to lack of resources and turn
brown. The Forest does have experience in determining the probability of mortality (as referenced
in the comment regarding the Stafford Fire Salvage of 2013). If the proposed action were
consistent with the Stafford Fire Salvage Project, the Forest would evaluate cambium injury
under the direction of Marking guidelines for fire-injured trees in California (Smith and Cluck
2011).The proposed action includes removal of dead trees at time of implementation. At the time
of implementation, most mortality directly due to cambium injury should be realized; however,
additional mortality (primarily due to secondary agents such as insects exploiting weakened trees)
is anticipated for a few more years. Utilizing the probability of mortality as directed in the
Marking Guidelines for fire-injured trees in California may be considered under an alternative to
the proposed action.

50T

Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #11. Issue Statement: The proposed action only
proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all
of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the
hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with
the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines.

Comment: I believe the USFS should address ALL hazard trees on roads in the fire areas
including those roads that are categorized as LEVEL I. Although you've stated that LEVEL I
roads are supposed to be closed to vehicle traffic, I am here to tell you that as a 45 year resident
of Hyampom, and an avid hiker, these roads are not closed to foot travel. A hazard tree falls
where and when despite who or what's underneath it.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads.
Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project

1 25. McKinney, Lisa
50T

Comment: The time frame for producing the necessary analysis is also troubling. Fire damaged
trees degrade at a rapid rate, but when species and diameter are added, degradation is accelerated,
and the time frame for removal is shortened. The length of time to complete the analysis is
important to a perspective purchaser whose economic pressures are compounded by length of
time, Limited Operating Periods, market prices, etc.
Response: Fire killed and damaged trees can deteriorate at a more rapid rate than those naturally
fading due to insects, certain diseases, and parasites. In addition, this deterioration does vary
depending on species, diameter and extent of injury (Smith and Clack, 2007). Small diameter
sawtimber killed by the fire are likely to have lost merchantability potential by the time
implementation of this project occurs. Therefore, areas identified for commercial removal will
have larger diameter trees, and merchantability specifications in timber removal contracts will be
adjusted according to conditions. The Forest Service recognizes the economic complexities
surrounding removal of deteriorating timber in a timely manner, especially when combined with
limited operating periods and weather constraints.

Comment: In addition, I believe the USFS needs to address as soon as possible, the fire injured
areas comprised of tractor ground which have no stream course protection issues, wildlife
concerns, or road building requirements. There are substantial areas within the fire area meeting
these, and this alone would require a formidable effort, but this would help reduce fuel loading,
provide a treated area for replanting, and capture some of the value of the burned resource.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. Areas that are outside of this narrow focus are outside the scope
of this analysis but may be considered under a different project analysis, including planting on a
larger landscape scale. Unfortunately, due to the unique character of the Forest, there are few
areas that can be classified as not having wildlife concerns, watershed concerns, and road
building needs, consistent with Forest Plan direction and located on flat ground. While these
constraints are not prohibitive of action, they do require an appropriate level of analysis under
NEPA, in this case, an EIS.

Comment: Further, I feel that the USFS should temporarily remove road restrictions within the
fire area for gathering and removal of fire wood for personal use. This could be instrumental in
alleviating some of the road side fuel loading and would serve the community in a valuable way.
Response: Temporary forest road closure orders within the footprints of the 2015 wildfires were
lifted on November 24, 2015. Removal of personal use firewood is permitted with a valid 2016
Shasta-Trinity National Forest Fuelwood Cutting Permit both within and outside the fire
footprints. Note that some open roads may be closed seasonally to protect various resources (i.e.
wildlife, erosion, etc.). Refer to the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Motor Vehicle Use Map (free

Comment: Other concerns voiced by the USFS at the meeting: * Fear that an aggressive plan of
action, as perceived by other organizations, could result in legal action. * No additional funding is
being allocated for the fire salvage project. * Concern of contributing to cumulative watershed
sedimentation. These are all topics of concern. However, cumulative watershed sedimentation
will be immaterial to a watershed that has been rendered unproductive due to fire damage with
increased fuel loading and no regeneration. The threat of legal action and the lack of funding are
not adequate reasons for failing to take appropriate and timely action. Without an aggressive and
comprehensive plan, the Shasta-Trinity National Forest will once again become a tinder box
awaiting ignition from the next lightning storm.
Response: The Forest continues to plan projects to appropriately manage Forest Service System
lands regardless of litigation pressure. Project planning and associated impact analysis must be
conducted carefully and thoughtfully under these conditions to ensure that projects can be
implemented. Availability of Forest personnel and funding to address the hazards along roads, as
well as the necessary fire restoration, are limited. Projects must be prioritized and carefully
planned to ensure the best use of our limited planning and implementation resources. Additional
restoration activities (beyond road buffers associated with the purpose and need for this project),
including fuels reduction and reforestation, may be considered under other projects. Impacts of
the project on watersheds must be analyzed, including an analysis of the cumulative watershed
effects. Some watersheds may already be over established disturbance threshold due to fire
impacts, as well as impacts from other past and present actions (logging on private land, etc.).
Regardless of the level of effect anticipated from this action, it must be evaluated on a
landscape/watershed scale and disclosed in the Hydrology Specialist Report. Mitigations may be
required to reduce the level of impacts from this project in these sensitive, over threshold
watersheds to comply with the Forest Plan and regulations under the Clean Water Act.

Comment: It is important that the USFS does everything within agency power to execute the job
to which it is charged. It seems that by removing only completely dead trees on LEVEL II
ROADS and above as the only focus for fire salvage is not sufficient. As the USDA Forest
Service mission states, "Sustaining the health, diversity, and productivity of the Nation's forests
and grasslands in order to meet the needs of present and future generations" should come before
political agendas, capitulation, fear of litigation, and lack of funding.

Comment: We recommend that the DEIS include a range of alternatives that meets the stated
purpose and need, goals and objectives, and, responds to issues identified during the scoping
process. The alternatives analysis should compare alternatives with respect to how well they
respond to the stated purpose and need, goals and objectives, and, scoping issues. The Council on
Environmental Quality recommends that all reasonable alternatives be considered, even if some
of them could be outside the capability of the applicant or the jurisdiction of the agency preparing

that protect, restore and enhance the environment. We support efforts to identify and select
alternatives which maximize environmental benefits, and, avoid, minimize, and/or otherwise
mitigate environmental impacts. If a Preferred Alternative is identified, it should be included in

Comment: EPA encourages the Forest Service to include in the DEIS the results of a
comprehensive biological survey of the Project area if available. Without such a survey, it would
be difficult to accurately evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed action.
Response: The wildfires of 2015 created public safety hazards across a large area on the ShastaTrinity National Forest. Even if adequate funding were available, it would not be possible to
conduct comprehensive field surveys for every wildlife species of concern across the entire
project area in the time frame necessary to respond to the urgent need for hazard abatement. The
best available science will be used to assess potential effects to wildlife. The Shasta-Trinity
National Forest maintains an extensive database of wildlife observations that have been collected
over several decades. Potential effects will be assessed using this database, as well as wildlife
observations documented in the State of California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB).

Comment: EPA recommends the Forest Service determine which aspects of the project comply
with EPA's Interim Air Quality Policy on Wildland and Prescribed Fires and are included as part
of the applicable EPA approved Smoke Management Program. All other aspects of the project
should be evaluated for general conformity applicability to determine whether a full conformity
analysis needs to be conducted. The applicable EPA approved SMPs should be included as part of
the DEIS.
Response: Smoke from prescribed fire is managed so that emissions meet applicable state and
federal standards, including the EPA’s Smoke Management Program. For prescribed burning, the
Forest Service utilizes Best Available Control Measures (BACMs) for smoke and Best Smoke
Management Practices (BSMPS) (O’Neill and others, 2011) to reduce particulate emissions.
BACMs are a combination of practices intended to reduce emissions to the lowest practicable
amount. BACMs are accomplished by diluting or dispersing emissions, or by preventing potential
emission sources whenever possible.
Smoke emissions will be calculated for machine pile burning, jackpot burning and for potential
future wildfires under scenarios created by each alternative, including the no action. Greenhouse
gas emissions will be calculated and evaluated for general conformity applicability. According to
the EPA Green Book, updated November 17, 2015, Trinity County is Designated a NonAttainment Area for PM10; the project area falls within this county. The Yolla-Bolly-Middle-Eel
Wilderness Area is a Federal Class 1 area adjacent to the project area. The Forest Service also
follows the guidelines assigned by the CARB [ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP), visibility
SIPs, and Title 17] to limit state-wide exposure on a cumulative basis, in compliance with the

describe relevant climate change impacts from the project and analyze reasonable alternatives
and/or practicable mitigation measures to reduce project-related GHG emissions.

Comment: EPA suggests that the DEIS include a systematic and comprehensive discussion of the
impacts of climate change on the project area. We recommend considering climate change
adaptation measures where appropriate. For example, adding a discussion of the increased
vulnerability of specific species under a reasonably anticipated climate change scenario, and an
explanation of the projected shift of forest species to more suitable range elevations. We also
recommend that the DEIS discuss measures to improve forest adaptation to climate change, such
as the selection of certain species for replanting.

Response: Climate change will be addressed for each resource area in which it is relevant. Given
the size of the atmospheric pool of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in relation to the GHGs emitted by
this project, this project is not expected to have a meaningfully measureable effect on climate,
much less species ranges. As a result, cumulative effects of this project on species ranges will not
be discussed. When planting trees, the mix of conifer seedlings will include conifer seedlings that
were germinated from seed collected from lower elevation bands within the seed zone. Regarding
other species, there is no national or regional policy regarding techniques such as utilizing seeds
from different elevations for potential replanting sites and employing other forms of assisted
migration of species (Johnson et al. 2013).

Comment: We also recommend the DEIS include a comprehensive survey of noxious weed
species within the project area, as well as possible mitigation measures, such as: clean all off-road
logging and construction equipment prior to entering the project area to remove dirt, plant parts
and material that may carry weed seeds; include equipment cleaning in the timber sale contract;
and require equipment to avoid weed infested areas.
Response: Prevention and management measures to minimize introduction and spread of noxious
weeds will be incorporated into the design of the proposed action. Resource protection measures
to prevent introduction and spread of noxious weeds as a result of planned actions will be applied
project-wide. These resource protection measures are consistent with those suggested by the
commenter. Weeds will be removed in the project area as funding allows.

Comment: We support robust road, landing maintenance and restoration programs that fully
offset adverse effects of the proposed project such as reduction of sediment sources to benefit fish

Response: Roads and landings that would be used in this project would be maintained and
rehabilitated, respectively. Road and trail rehabilitation or decommissioning is outside the scope
of this project, but may be considered under other projects. Resource protection measures
addressing rehabilitation of landings, including recontouring, planting, ripping or scarifying, and
a schedule will be included. The proposed action does not include the use of temporary roads.

Comment: We recommend the Forest Service consider alternatives which avoid or minimize
extensive roadwork in watersheds that exceed the Threshold of Concern for cumulative watershed

reasonable alternatives will be considered. The preferred alternative will be identified in the
DEIS. Mitigations will be considered in any watersheds that exceed the threshold of concern and
will be included in each alternative.

impact watersheds that are already over the threshold concern; therefore, consider an alternative
that minimizes treatments in those watersheds.

Comment: The project may call for the decommissioning and restoration of roads. We encourage
the Forest Service to include a plan with a list and map of the roads, landings and trails that will
be impacted by the project. This plan would benefit if the DEIS included specific information on
the extent to which these roads and landings would be recontoured, replanted with appropriate
vegetation, monitored, and closed to off highway vehicle use. We recommend the DEIS include a
specific post-harvest schedule for closure of the temporary roads and landings. The DEIS should
commit to scarifying the surface of roads, landings, and trails selected for decommissioning to
break up compacted soils, seeding such areas, and blocking vehicle traffic with rocks and/or
barricades.
Response: Roads and landings that would be used in this project would be maintained and
rehabilitated, respectively. Some road reconstruction, restoration, and maintenance will be
performed as connected actions and are disclosed in chapter 2. Some legacy sediment sites will be
treated as a condition of the North Coast Regional Water Board Waiver which will be determined
as part of the Waiver coverage after the signing of the ROD. Resource protection measures
addressing rehabilitation of landings, including recontouring, planting, ripping or scarifying, and
a schedule will be included. The proposed action does not include the use of temporary roads.

Comment: * Please do not yard hazard trees in or through Riparian Reserves. Snags in Riparian
Reserves provide a vital source of course woody debris that is essential to riparian function.
Please do not retard riparian recovery through logging actions that necessitate yarding in or
through Riparian Reserves.
Response: Riparian Reserves consist of two zones: a near stream zone that contains riparian
vegetation and a second zone of upland vegetation further from the stream. An equipment
exclusion zone will be established in the near stream zone to protect stream bank and riparian
vegetation integrity. Hazard trees may be skidded or yarded out of the upland area of the Riparian
Reserves where it has been determined that the remaining amount of downed coarse woody
debris (CWD) and non-hazardous snags left on site are sufficient to maintain a properly
functioning stream riparian zone. Logs in excess of this standard create a fuel loading that can
have negative impacts on the health of the riparian area in future fires. All hazard tree skidding
and yarding, regardless of the land allocation, will be accomplished with the leading end of the
log suspended in order to minimize ground disturbance.

Comment: * We understand that a Portland-based timber industry trade association group is
requesting that the Forest Service ignore or reject the recommendations of the Trinity
Collaborative and instead conduct controversial non-road related salvage logging activities that
will harm forest recovery. This "timber first" approach was tried in the Klamath National Forest
in the recent Westside Salvage project and has proven to be an unwise use of federal planning
resources.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to "Reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads". All alternatives considered under this project analysis must be
consistent with this stated purpose and need for action. Alternatives proposed during scoping that

Comment: The first question is why an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)? The current
proposal only plans to accomplish roadside treatments with emphasis on reducing public hazards
and promoting public safety. The reduction of hazards and public safety should be the only key
issue identified with the proposed action. It should override any other issues identified. During
wildfires public/firefighter safety is the number one objective and that should continue until these
issues have adequately been dealt with during post fire restoration. With that being the overriding
437

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

purpose and need we believe the Forest should approach this project with a CE or at the most an
EA for NEPA documentation. By proposing an EIS it appears that significant issues are going to
occur through the implementation of public safety work. Taking care of emergency public safety
issues should be done as soon as possible and in a time frame to minimize the current risk and
hazards. If reducing roadside hazard conditions are so important we believe you should look at
options of completing the necessary work to reduce risk to human health and safety in a quicker
time frame.
Response: Planning a project using a Categorical Exclusion (CE) requires the availability of a CE
category that applies to the proposed action. In the case of this project, the proposed action is not
covered by a CE category due to its size (number of acres proposed for treatment). To use a CE,
there must be no extraordinary circumstances (36 CFR 220.6). An Environmental Assessment
(EA) is prepared when the level of effects is unknown; when the effects analysis completed for
the EA determines that no significant impacts would occur, a decision can be made using that
analysis. When effects are found to be significant, an EIS must be prepared. For this project,
preliminary analysis indicates that impacts of the proposed action are likely to be significant,
precluding the use of either a CE or an EA for the proposed action. The fact that the condition
constitutes an emergency does not negate the fact that the impacts of mitigating the emergency
condition are significant. Late summer implementation would accomplish the goal of salvaging
some areas to produce a commercial timber output. Snags along roads that present an imminent
health and safety hazard may be abated before a project decision is made (felled and left onsite).
Fuels buildup from those actions would not be treated prior to a decision, and timber value from
felled snags would not be available for sale until after the decision is made.

Comment: While we concur that reducing hazards along the road system is necessary we also
have serious concerns about the lack of proposed treatment of areas with high fire severity away
from the 300 foot road buffer. [...] why aren't you looking at doing additional restorative
activities? There are many areas away from the proposed road treatments that could be easily
accessed to promote recovery and producing future forests through responsible management. By
not doing anything away from the road systems it gives the appearance the Shasta Trinity has no
desire to put an effort into restoring green forests for the future. We believe you should at least
look at areas of high mortality immediately adjacent to the road treatment units that are easily
accessible.
Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional
alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects.
Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project

Comment: The Yreka Office of the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) submitted a letter to the
Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors referencing a letter previously sent to the Klamath
National Forest concerning their attempt at reducing public risk. The letter stated; "In a letter
from our Regional Director to the Regional Forester of the Forest Service dated May 11, 2015,
the FWS communicated to the Forest Service that if the Forest Service believes there is a risk to
human health and safety, then it is our view that this project would be an emergency action under
50 C.F.R. 402.05. Under these provisions the Forest Service can, and should, implement the
Westside Fire Recovery Project immediately. The FWS would then complete consultation on this
project after the threats to human health and safety have been addressed." It appears that your
proposal falls within these bounds and we ask that you look at all options to utilize this direction
from the FWS in your project planning. As a minimum you should consider consulting after the
438

fact on state and county roads, and we feel Forest Service roads should meet these guidelines as
well. Take the FWS up on their view point! I have attached a copy of this letter for your

Council for its feasibility.

Comment: Without treatment these areas will recover very slowly. As stated in your scoping
letter, these areas will burn again and with greater intensity. This is about as close as one can
come to true deforestation. Without any type of treatment and reforestation these areas will be
prone to recurring burns which will promote the constant establishment of brush fields and no
reliance on future conifers stands. As a minimum, those areas of moderate and high fire severity
will not see green, resilient, healthy forests for at least 300 years.
Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional
alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects.
Issue Disposition: General in nature, position statement

1 57. AFRC

Comment: Reforestation is an essential element that seems to be missing in your proposal. It is
imperative that reforestation occur in order to quickly establish conifers on the land base while
assuring the correct and desired species is promoted. The dry Mediterranean climate is not
conducive to promoting natural regeneration, especially in terms of desired conifer numbers and
species. With that being said we also want to go on record of not supporting reforestation in areas
where there has been no salvage and/or fuel reduction. Reforestation in these conditions is like
throwing tax payers money away as they will burn again and all the money and efforts spent
reestablishing a forest will be lost.
Response: Reforestation is included in the road treatment buffer under the proposed action.
Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional alternatives, and
treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects. .
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the proposed action

Comment: If the Forest is determined to stick with completing an EIS, that will not be completed
until August, 2016, we believe you should look for additional restoration acres that are away from
the 300 foot road buffer but easily accessible for potential salvage/restoration activities.
Response: Additional restoration/reforestation and salvage are considered under additional
alternatives, and treatments away from roads may be considered under other projects.

Comment: We have a major concern about the proposed August 2016 decision date for this
project. This is probably an optimistic date. Past experience on these types of projects have
shown these dates are never met. More than one year after a fire reduces the amount of
merchantable wood that will be available, reducing the effectiveness of your hazard reduction. A
CE and EA would allow for a quicker time frame.
Response: Planning a project using a Categorical Exclusion (CE) requires the availability of a CE
category that applies to the proposed action. In the case of this project, the proposed action is not

Comment: The proposed 300 foot buffer is a good start, but may not prove workable in some
situations. You may have trees on both sides of the road that are more than 150 feet tall with the
ability to fall on the road. In other cases there may be shorter trees than what the 300 foot buffer
needs. We ask that you consider doing a true hazard tree prescription and remove all trees that
have the potential to hit the road and pose serious hazards to the public.
Response: A wider buffer will be addressed in a separate alternative; however, trees and snags
that pose a hazard to roads or workers outside of identified treatment buffers would be abated and
left onsite under the proposed action. The proposed action only proposes to treat along roads that
are open to the public; closed roads would not be treated unless they are necessary for operations,
and then hazards would be abated and left onsite. Areas that burned at low severity where
substantial green trees remain would likely not contain enough commercial value for the logs to
be salvaged; imminent hazards would be abated in these areas and left onsite to contribute to log
retention and erosion control where desired fuel loading would not be exceeded. All open roads
will be treated to the same standard. The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce
hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along
open National Forest System, County, and State roads, fuels treatments around private properties
outside of road buffers is outside the scope of this project, but may be considered in other future
projects.

Comment: We understand this proposal came from the Trinity Collaborative and we commend
them for finding some common ground to accomplish some of the needed restorative work. But
we also ask the Forest to look at the proposal and see if it is truly accomplishing the job in terms
of adequately and fully reducing public risk. It is your responsibility to manage these lands and
take input from all concerned publics, not just one small group. What they have is a start but we
believe more work should be done and some modification to the roadside prescription is
necessary, including additional restoration outside the roadside zones, in order fully meet your
purpose and need for the project.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. A wider road buffer width will be considered under other
alternatives. Additional treatments outside of the road buffer along roads are not considered in
this project because it is outside of the purpose and need, but may be considered under other
projects. The proposed action moves the landscape towards the desired future condition outlined
in the purpose and need.

roads impacted by wildfire). While all open roads are analyzed for hazard tree felling and fuels
441

Final Environmental Impact Statement Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

treatment, salvage (removal) of fire killed and mortally injured trees is influenced by land
allocation and ecological function. Salvage removal will not be prioritized in riparian reserves,
certain inventoried roadless areas, or known northern spotted owl nesting cores. Salvage and fuels
treatment is prohibited in designated Wilderness Areas. The majority of treatment areas are in the
Adaptive Management Area and Late Successional Reserves. Matrix lands comprise a relatively
small percentage (5%) of area adjacent to open roads affected by wildfire.

Comment: Search for those areas that contain the lower cost harvest systems. Only incorporate
higher cost logging systems when you have a considerable amount of ground based that can
offset costs and there are enough concentrated acres of higher cost logging systems.
Response: Salvage logging proposed under this analysis will include the use of ground and cable
logging systems. This will be clarified in the Proposed Action description within the EIS. Many
factors determine the most efficient means of implementation. Timber sales will be designed as
economically as possible, incorporating areas with high densities of larger, dead timber; weighing
high priority areas with lesser priority areas; balancing higher cost logging systems and resource
protection measures with lower cost areas of implementation. Industry input will be taken into
consideration in that process.

Comment: Since this project will not be implemented until next field season much of the smaller
diameter material will not be merchantable. Concentrate your efforts in stands that contain larger
diameter material, >16 inches DBH.
Response: Fire killed and damaged trees can deteriorate at a more rapid rate than those naturally
fading due to insects, certain diseases, and parasites. In addition, this deterioration does vary
depending on species, diameter and extent of injury (Smith and Cluck 2007). Small diameter
sawtimber killed by the fire are likely to have lost merchantability potential by the time
implementation occurs. Therefore, areas identified for commercial removal will have larger
diameter trees, and merchantability specifications in timber removal contracts will be adjusted
according to conditions. The Forest Service recognizes the economic complexities surrounding
removal of deteriorating timber in a timely manner, especially when combined with limited
operating periods and weather constraints.

Response: While snag requirements are met across the landscape, at the project level snag
retention does play a role in individual wildlife habitat requirements. As standing snags will not
be retained when posing an imminent danger to public safety, snags leaning away from the road

Comment: Utilize the Regional Salvage Guidelines.
Response: The proposed action includes the retention of all live and dying trees at time of
implementation. Other alternatives may be analyzed that include removal of fire-injured trees
with a high probability of mortality, as requested by other interested parties including AFRC
("utilize Regional Salvage Guidelines"). The Regional Salvage Guidelines refers to the Forest
Service Publication Marking Guidelines for Fire-injured Trees in California (Smith and Cluck
2011) which provides scientifically-based direction in identifying trees with a high probability of
mortality based on crown scorch, cambium injury and insect evidence during post-fire salvage
operations.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #11. Issue statement: The proposed action only
proposes to remove trees that are dead at the time of implementation, but this does not address all
of the trees that will die from fire damage, which means the treatments do not fully address the
hazard; analyze an alternative that would remove dying trees as well as dead trees, consistent with
the Region 5 Hazard Tree Guidelines and the Region 5 Fire Injured Tree Guidelines.

Comment: Reduce Hazards: Fire Killed Trees and Excessive Fuels that threaten public and
firefighter safety along forest system, county and state roads. In order to minimize the threat to
the public and provide for firefighter safety it is crucial to perpetually maintain all roads to a level
that shall provide safety from future fires. This shall include executing the project to a level of
fire resilience and protection to all adjacent resource values. Allowing the valuable resource and
fuels to remain on the landscape for years is not beneficial concerning public and firefighter
safety.
Response: The purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and
excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System,
County, and State roads. This is consistent with Forest Plan direction to a) provide for public
safety and protection of structures by managing fuel loading, distribution and arrangement within
Wildland Urban Interface for low flame lengths and rate of spread (4-18), b) remove
danger/hazard trees (4-26), and c) perform road maintenance activities to meet a variety of
management objectives. Not all roads will be maintained every year due to the maintenance level
assigned by management, use, and other factors (4-16). This project involves reducing hazards
along all open roads affected by the 2015 fires to improve safety during ingress and egress in the
event of a fire. More intensive treatments along these roads will be considered under alternatives
to the proposed action. The Forest Service does not have the financial and personnel capability to
maintain every mile of road as a fuelbreak, which is what would be required to provide fire
resilience and protection to all adjacent resource values. The Forest strives to provide a safe road
system for public use of National Forest System Lands; this project would address hazardous
conditions within the area that burned in the 2015 fires.

the process of preparing an Environmental Impact Statement shall be expedited. The timeline of
an Environmental Impact Statement is a concern that the proposed project will not quickly
recover the monetary value of wood through salvage and sale. The monetary value of wood value
is decreasing daily as the wood deteriorates and the degradation process will accelerate as the
temperatures increase and insect cycles intensify. In order to quickly recover the economic value
this project needs to be fully executed and operated by early summer 2016. Therefore we urge the
Shasta Trinity National Forest to pursue other environmental processes and or avenues in order to
quickly recover the monetary value of timber and potentially develop a viable salvage project.
Response: The Forest recognizes the importance of timely implementation of this project in order
to capture any economic value still remaining in these dead trees. Removal of larger dead trees
while they can pay for themselves instead of requiring appropriated funding to treat is definitely
the most efficient and productive way of dealing with the excessive fuels and hazards left after
these wildfire events. While federal and agency regulations regarding the NEPA process for
analysis must be followed, the Forest is committed to expediting the processes as much as
possible by utilizing tight analysis deadlines, concurrent reviews by collaborating specialists and
concurrent collaboration with regulatory agencies. The proposed action is likely to have
significant impacts so it must be analyzed under an EIS. Implementation of this project in early
summer is not possible due to required steps (specialist analysis, consultation with regulatory
agencies, public comment periods and responses, etc.) under NEPA and ESA. Consequently,
recognizing timber deterioration began while the fire was active and will continue,
merchantability specifications will be adjusted accordingly, based on existing conditions at time
of implementation. Other projects may consider additional salvage opportunities.

Comment: The Forest sub-committee of the Trinity Collaborative recently presented a blue-print
for a proposed project "From Fire-killed to Shaded Fuel Break". This proposal focuses on
rehabilitation and restoration of a strip of burned timberland adjacent to public roads with the 5
complexes of fires and the additional fires near Weaverville affecting the Shasta Trinity, BLM and
Six Rivers Forests. The key element is moving those burned acres into a future desired condition
of a shaded fuel break along those roads. Those desired future conditions provide protection to
infrastructure, access for management and a logical anchor to use for future fire-fighting or
prescribed burning. We believe private property adjacent to public lands within the burned area of
the complexes should be treated in a similar manner with a desired future condition of a shaded
fuel break adjacent to the public/private property line border. We request the same measures being
proposed for implementation along roads be incorporated into a second project that is
implemented along the public/private land borders. With the public lands carrying an ever
increasing amount of biomass, private lands adjacent to over-crowded public lands are in the
cross-hairs of each fire incident. Long term management of our public forest that move them
towards a condition of increasing fire resiliency is a prime objective at both the Forest and
National levels. The recent fires are an example of the impacts public land fires can have on
private property. Sierra Pacific Industries had fire go through almost 2000 acres of our properties
within Trinity County. We had mortality in over 1000 acres of existing plantations to the extent
that we have to start those acres over. While we invest in restoring our property we are
surrounded by dead trees and an incredibly high fuel load on public lands. [...]In summary the
private landowner is greatly affected by public land decisions and fire policies. We request that
you direct your staff to prepare and analyze for your proposed projects within the burned areas of
Trinity County a project that encompasses the public/private property line borders and
implements the "Fire-killed to Shaded Fuel Break" actions along those property lines.

Comment: From a global view, the private reforested lands are leading to long term greater
onsite sequestration of carbon, significant off-site climate benefits in the form of long term
storage in products and the production of carbon free power in biomass cogeneration. These
atmospheric benefits alone warrant great valuation, and therefore we believe the risk to private
land values is equal to or higher than the risk to public values along roads.
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads; and to sustain and establish forest cover. Treatment along the
private land/Forest Service boundary are outside the scope of this proposed action, but would be
considered in other projects that treat within 2015 wildfire perimeters along private and public
land boundaries. Effects of this project on climate change, greenhouse gasses, and carbon
sequestration will be included in chapter 3 of the EIS.

Comment: Although you describe the many miles of road being proposed for use for the project,
I didn't see an element that described how roads would be prepared for use, maintained/upgraded,
and treated post-harvest. In particular we have specific concerns about the Underwood Mountain
Road from Burnt Ranch to Hyampom, and the Denny Rd. from Hawkins Bar to Denny.[...] Our
landowners (Trinity Timberlands, LLC) through our company, were required by the USFS to
conduct extensive upgrades and maintenance on the Pelletreau Ridge Road for salvage efforts we
conducted there this fall. We expect the USFS and its contractors to be held to at least an equally
high standard as we were. Such efforts are not cheap and will lower timber stumpage rates
considerably, but leaving roads in good condition is a primary responsibility associated with
sustainable forest management, and we expect the USFS to represent the highest level of
commitment to this goal.
Response: The fire suppression repair process and the Burned Area Emergency Response process
both addressed road condition issues in the burned area. Forest Service roads used during fire
suppression will be maintained at the appropriate level for their projected use. Some roads fall
under cost-share agreements, in which case the Forest would contribute to the maintenance of
those roads. County roads that are not included in cost-share agreements are the responsibility of
the County to maintain. Roads used for implementation of this project would be maintained to the
appropriate Forest Service standard.
Issue Disposition: Consistent with the Proposed Action

Comment: These sections of road, including the portion of the Underwood Mtn. Rd. that is
county road, took a real beating during fire suppression efforts (which, by the way, we really
appreciate - the efforts, not the road damage). We expect the USFS to make a point of
contributing to the rehabilitation and upgrading of damaged roads resulting from suppression
efforts as well as new impacts from fire salvage. We would like the USFS to prioritize
rehabilitation of the county portion of the Underwood Mtn. Rd as well as the subsequent 5 miles
of USFS road toward Hyampom which local residents use to access their properties, as well as
the Denny Rd. in the immediate area of Hawkins Bar and on into the community of Denny. These
areas are vital to the local community and are not in good shape now, and we expect that USFS to
leave them in a much better condition than they presently are
Response: The fire suppression repair process and the Burned Area Emergency Response process
both addressed road condition issues in the burned area. Forest Service roads used during fire
suppression will be maintained at the appropriate level for their projected use. Some roads fall
under cost-share agreements, in which case the Forest would contribute to the maintenance of
those roads. County roads that are not included in cost-share agreements are the responsibility of
the County to maintain. Roads used for implementation of this project would be maintained to the
appropriate Forest Service standard.

Comment: Another minor comment is that I thought your proposed planting spacing of 18-30
feet was too low for stands that are planned for future timber management. A spacing of 12'x12' is
typical of planting of logged areas in this area, and as you know some trees can be expected not to
survive, so more trees need to be planted than are typical of stocking of a mature stand.
Response: While 12x12 is typical (and often past practices promoted even denser plantations),
the long-term goal of these roadside areas is to promote conditions suitable for a shaded
fuelbreak, and therefore wider spacing than what is typical for managed stands is appropriate in
this situation. Spacing will vary based on conditions. Additional reforestation efforts (beyond
roadside areas proposed for treatment under this analysis) many be considered under a separate
project analysis. See Comment/Response #109 for more information regarding planting species
mix, including ponderosa pine.
Issue Disposition: Alternative driving issue #13. Issue Statement: The proposed planting density
is too low; therefore, analyze an alternative that would have a heavier planting density.

Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside
of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat
dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under this analysis. Where dead
trees are in sufficient quantity and quality to provide commercial value, they would be sold in a
salvage timber sale. For a fuelbreak to be effective at reducing fire behavior, it must be
contiguous, wider than the treatments proposed in the proposed action, and strategically located
(not all roads are in areas that would be strategic for fuelbreaks). The nature of the fire impact is
spotty, meaning that many areas along the road burned at very low severity. To create a fuelbreak
would require treatment of green vegetation in these low severity areas; the proposed action
would only treat dead vegetation. Fuelbreak creation and maintenance will be considered in
alternatives.

Comment: * Hazard reduction/removal project? I understand the Project proposes to reduce
downed logs greater than 3" in diameter to 10-20 tons/acre and reduce dead brush by 50-100%.
Would this happen in a minimum or maximum corridor of 300 feet along roads? Or, would this
happen within all severely burned areas also?
Response: The proposed action includes reduction of hazards (hazardous trees and heavy fuel
loading) within a buffer that is a maximum of 300 feet wide. Fuels reduction away from roads is
not being considered in this project; it is beyond the scope of the purpose and need. It may be
considered in other projects in the future. The proposed action includes fuel reduction treatments
in the road buffer that would reduce fuels greater than 3" in diameter to 10-20 tons per acre and a
reduction of dead brush.

Comment: Removing dead or hazardous trees in a corridor along roads would add to fire
resilience as well as provide for safety to people. It would seem important to do this as soon as
possible while protecting resources. Is this the aspect that needs an Emergency Situation
Determination?

but is not being pursued at this time.

Comment: * Green Tree project? Salvage project? Implications that this is proposed as a Green
Tree project are found in the areas shown in purple showing "potential commercial
opportunities." In the areas I am most familiar with, it appears these are all in LSRs and would
need a full EIS under NEPA. The time it would take for that analysis and the limited operating
periods would preclude accomplishing the hazard reduction in a timely manner.
Response: Due to the size and complexity of the proposed action (hazard tree and fuel loading
reduction, and associated log removal) and potential effects, the National Environmental Policy
Act regulations require completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).

Comment: Timber sale along 128 miles of road. What does that mean? Green trees? Black trees?
What is Salvage?
Response: The primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed
trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads. The proposed action does not include treatment of areas outside
of the roadside buffer (maximum 300-feet total width). The proposed action would only treat
dead trees. Healthy and dying green trees would not be treated under this alternative. Where dead
trees are in sufficient quantity and quality to provide commercial value, they would be sold in a
salvage timber sale. It is estimated that there are approximately 128 miles of the roads proposed
that these conditions exist for large salvage timber sales.

Comment: * Fuelbreak project? Enclosed please find a well-researched, comprehensive, and still
up-to-date Report on a Literature Search Pertaining to Fuelbreaks and Fire Behavior, by Kenneth
C. Baldwin for Trinity RCD Council. I suggest that an evaluation of fire behavior during the 2015
Trinity Fires, especially as it relates to existing Fuelbreaks, be added to the literature on the
subject. Were existing fuelbreaks (prior to fires) regularly maintained? At what time intervals?
Please show existing fuelbreaks on maps.
Response: The fuels report will discuss fire behavior during the 2015 wildfires on the ShastaTrinity National Forest. The fuels report will discuss the expected fire behavior under each
alternative out 20 years from implementation. The proposed action is not designed to function as
a strategic fuelbreak and so the effectiveness of past fuelbreaks on the 2015 wildfires is outside of
the scope of this analysis. We agree that maintaining fuels treatments is an important contributor
to their effectiveness and as a result Fuel Treatment Maintenance is part of the proposed action.

Comment: Since fire resilience is desired, please be aware of the recommendations made by
Prof. James K. Agee, April 25, 2008 Klamath Fire Ecology Conference in Orleans, CA, that fuels
treatments most likely to create fire resilience in the mixed-fire regime forests of the Klamath
Mountains are, in order: (1) Reduce surface fuels (2) Increase canopy base height (3) Keep the
big trees (4) Reduce canopy density Shaded Fuelbreaks need less maintenance, and are most
effective. In severely burned areas, shade is not possible, so please provide for more frequent
maintenance if not shaded. Does this project include fuelbreaks?
Response: The proposed action includes reducing surface fuels and standing dead fuels (when
they pose a hazard) in a buffer along open roads. The proposed action only includes treatment of
dead vegetation, which would occur primarily in the moderate and high severity burned areas
where the canopy has been mostly, if not entirely, removed; therefore, there is not canopy to treat
for increasing base height or decreasing canopy density. All live large trees would be retained in
the proposed action. Fuelbreaks are not included in the proposed action. To be effective,
fuelbreaks must be contiguous (which requires treatment of green vegetation including the
suggested treatments in the comment), they must be wider than the buffer in the proposed action,
and they must be placed strategically (not all roads are in strategic locations for fuelbreaks). The
development of fuelbreaks will be considered in alternatives to the proposed action.

timely manner.
Response: Due to the size and complexity of the proposed action (hazard tree and fuel loading

Comment: In addition to safety and fire resilience, please consider waterbars and other measures
necessary for water quality, as a result of fire suppression activities, in case they were not
addressed before the current winter 2015-16. These will be important for years because of
potential erosion in the burned areas, whether they are planted soon or not. Water quality is
critical for the health of all aspects of the forests, including timber production.
Response: Fire suppression repair and Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) efforts have
addressed some of these issues directly, by repairing some of the suppression impacts, including
installing water bars, and making improvements to the road system in the burned area. The
primary purpose and need for this project is to reduce hazards (i.e. fire-killed trees and excessive
fuels) that threaten public and firefighter safety along open National Forest System, County, and
State roads. Resource protection measures and Best Management Practices designed to protect
water quality will be required within the area treated in the project. Additional mitigations in the
watersheds that were most impacted by fire are also being considered.
Issue Disposition: Beyond the scope of the project (repairing fire suppression damage),
consistent with the proposed action (including waterbars and other water quality protection
measures in areas where the project is implemented).

features to avoid or minimize surface erosion, gully formation, and mass failure in the AMZ
and sediment transport to the waterbody.
Monitor the AMZ during mechanical operations to evaluate compliance with prescription and
mitigation requirements in the authorizing document.
o Adjust operations in the AMZ to avoid, minimize, or mitigate detrimental soil impacts
where they are occurring.

felling-to-the-lead).
o Directionally fell trees away from streambanks, shorelines, and other waterbody
edges.
o Remove logs from wet meadows or AMZs using suitable techniques to minimize
equipment operations in the sensitive area and minimize dragging the logs on the
ground.
o Winch or skid logs upslope, away from waterbodies.

APPENDIX D – LEGACY SEDIMENT SITE PLAN
Introduction
An inventory of controllable sediment discharge sources and other legacy sites that may affect
water quality within project boundaries and along appurtenant Forest Service roads is required for
NEPA analyses for timber harvest, fuels, and vegetation management actions that include grounddisturbing activities (USDA Forest Service, 2011). A purpose of this report is to comply with this
requirement by summarizing the known sediment sources that lie within the proposed boundaries
and along the haul routes of the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage project.
The Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to Certain
Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (“Waiver”)
addresses nonpoint source discharges of waste to waters of California from activities associated
with specific uses of NFS lands (NCRWQCB, 2015). The Waiver requires that legacy sediment
sites for this project must be identified and prioritized as a part of the project activities. The
Waiver acknowledges that some projects may be so large that it is infeasible or unnecessary to
treat all legacy sediment sites. In such cases, alternative legacy sediment site treatment plans that
inventory and propose to treat some portion of the largest sediment producing sites within the
project area may be submitted to the Executive Officer of the North Coast Regional Water
Quality Control Board (Water Board) for approval. The Water Board has agreed that an
alternative legacy sediment site treatment plan is appropriate for this project (M Robinson,
written communication, 2016). Therefore, the Forest Service proposes to treat only the high and
moderate-high risk features within the project area, and the high risk features along the haul
routes. A purpose of this report is to present the proposed Alternative Legacy Sediment Site
Treatment Plan.
Watersheds that are over the threshold of concern (TOC) are not to be further impacted unless
they can be improved with appropriate mitigation measures (Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land
and Resource Management Plan, page 4-25 (USDA, 1995a)). Hyampom and Sulphur GladeWaldorf Flat sub-watersheds are over TOC. Non-system roads in Hyampom and Sulphur GladeWaldorf Flat are identified in this report, and may be restored as part of the mitigation
requirement.

Legacy Sediment Site Identification
Sediment Source Inventory (SSI) reports used to identify sediment sites include: NSR 2011
(Lower Hayfork Creek, Middle South Fork Trinity River, Upper Hayfork Creek and Upper South
Fork Trinity River), NRM 2012 (Burnt Ranch), NRM 2012 (New River), NSR 2012 (Browns
Creek, Canyon Creek, Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River and Upper Hayfork
Creek). Sites identified in the SSI reports are provided for each sub-watershed (HUC 6).
Some Forest Service roads in the project area and some haul routes were not inventoried prior to
the 2015 fires. The stream crossings of these roads have since been inspected, and any features
judged to be high or moderate-high risk have been included in this report.

Summary of Inventoried Features

A total of 1052 sediment site features118 have been identified on Forest Service roads in the
project area and along the haul routes. Table D-1 summarizes the breakdown of the risk ratings of

118 Feature

descriptions are provided in Appendix D-3: Sedimentation and Erosion Feature Descriptions.

these features by project area and haul route. The percentages were calculated comparing the
number of features with that risk rating compared to the total number of features of that type.

Sub-watershed: Corral Creek
Problem
Long highly erodible gully that forms two erosion
features. Not connected but compromises route access.

Sub-watershed: Salt Creek-Hayfork Creek
Problem
Cross-drain is partially plugged, has evidence of
overtopping, and has diversion potential to a
hydrologically connected ditch. Structure is connected to
perennial stream.
This segment is highly connected to the stream network
and most structures have varying degrees of diversion
potential.
This section of road has numerous cross-drains to divert
surface runoff and prevent route surface erosion. The
listed cross-drains are non-functional, partiallyfunctioning, or are eroding road fill at the outlet.
Route surface gully forms and drains off the road prism
causing erosion.
Route surface gully forms and drains off the road prism
causing erosion.

Sub-watershed: Salt Creek-Hayfork Creek
Problem
Route exists in erodible soils and is gullied to varying
degrees. Existing cross-drains are ineffective.
Deep gully forms in route surface. Feature is not
connected but will continue to increase in size.
Route surface has no engineered drainage structures
and is eroding. Route alignment is parallel to an
intermittent stream and in close proximity. Route does
not lead to a specific feature.

In Corral Creek, there is only one moderate-high to high risk feature (Table D-4). It is a gully located on
road 33N68 (Figure D-2). The risk was rated high because it compromises access to the route. However,
it is not hydrologically connected (Table D-3), so it should not be considered a high risk as a source of
sediment to any nearby stream.
In Grassy Flat-Miners Creek, there are numerous high and moderate-high risk features, including twelve
CMP stream crossings, six connected CMPs, three connected cross drains, three gullies, three ditches,
and a spring (Table D-4). These features are located on roads 33N68, 3N05, 3N40, 4N04, 4N24 and
5N60 (Figure D-2 of Appendix D-1: Sediment Source Maps). On roads 4N24 and 5N60, BAER funds
were used after the 2015 fires to improve six of the CMP stream crossings (E29, E30, E32, E45, E47,
and E48).
In Rusch Creek, there are seventeen high and moderate-high risk features, including a stream ford
crossing, a stream crossing CMP, two connected CMPs, seven connected cross drains, five gullies, and
one erosion feature (Table D-4). These features are all located on roads 31N14 and 31N42 (Figure D-3 of
Appendix D-1).
In Salt Creek-Hayfork Creek, there are numerous high and moderate-high risk features on roads 30N27,
30N28, 30N75, 31N19, 31N38, 31N40, 31N42, 31N48A and 31N64 (Figure D-3 of Appendix A and
Table D-4). Roads 31N38 and 31N42 were upgraded by TCRCD in 2013 (TCRCD, 2013b) and road
30N75 was upgraded with BAER funds after the 2015 fires. The remaining fifteen features include two
stream crossing CMPs, one connected CMP, one connected cross drain, four erosion features, and seven
gullies.

In Tule Creek, there are seventeen high and moderate-high risk features, including two stream crossing
CMPs, three connected CMPs, seven connected cross drains, one ditch, two gullies, and two erosion
features (Table D-4). These features are located on roads 31N33 and 31N48 (Figure D-3 of Appendix D1: Sediment Source Maps).

Lower South Fork Trinity River

Risk ratings of the roads in Lower South Fork Trinity River that were inventoried by NSR in 2012 and
lie within (or partially within) the proposed project boundaries are identified in Table D-5 and are shown
in Figures D-2 and D-3 of Appendix D-1. Specific problems for the moderate-high to high risk roads are
described in Table D-6. High and moderate-high risk features that lie within the proposed project
boundaries, and high risk features that lie along the haul routes are identified in Table D-7.

In Eltapom Creek, there are numerous high and moderate-high risk features on roads 4N24,
4N25, 4N41, 4N41A, 4N48A, and 5N50 (Table D-7 and Figure D-2 of Appendix D-1). On road
4N24, BAER funds were used to improve three stream crossing CMPs after the 2015 fires. The
remaining identified high and moderate-high risk features include: ten stream crossing CMPs, 21
connected CMPs, one connected cross drain, 38 ditches, and one erosion feature.
In Hyampom, there are two inventoried high risk features – a connected CMP and a ditch on road
4N24 (Table D-7 and Figure D-4 of Appendix D-1).
In Hyampom, unauthorized roads that have been identified to be restored are identified in Table
D-8 and Figure D-4 of Appendix D-1.

In Dubakella Creek, there are numerous high and moderate-high risk features, including six
stream crossing CMPs, five connected CMPs, ten connected cross drains, two erosion features,
one spring, six ditches, and eight gullies (Table D-14). These features are located on roads 30N04,
30N04A, 30N15, 30N16, and 30N65 (Figure D-6 of Appendix D-1: Sediment Source Maps).
In Duncan Gulch-Barker Creek, there are two moderate-high risk features, including a stream
crossing CMP and a connected CMP (Table D-14). These features are located on road 32N25
(Figure D-7 of Appendix D-1: Sediment Source Maps).
In East Fork Hayfork Creek, there are two moderate-high risk features – a stream crossing CMP
and a ditch located on road 31N04 (Table D-14 and Figure D-6 of Appendix D-1: Sediment
Source Maps).
In Natural Bridge, there are sixteen high and moderate-high risk features, including two stream
crossing CMPs, two connected CMPs, two connected cross drains, two erosion features, four
ditches, and four gullies (Table D-14). These features are located on roads 31N13, 31N19, 31N20,
and 31N49 (Figure D-3 of Appendix D-1: Sediment Source Maps).
Forest Road 31N49 (located in Natural Bridge sub-watershed) lies within the streambed of
Carrier Gulch for most of its 1.6 mile length. This road is a former jeep trail that was not designed
to Forest Service standards, and cannot be upgraded to comply with the standards (Greg Glass,
Forest Service Engineering Equipment Operator, personal communication). Maggie Robinson
(North Coast Region Water Quality Control Board, personal communication) has indicated that it
will not be possible to receive waiver coverage for the proposed project on this road because it is
prohibited by the Water Quality Control Plan for the North Coast Region. Therefore, this road
will not be included in the record of decision, and the road will be closed.

In East Fork Browns Creek, there are eleven high to moderate-high risk features, including one
stream crossing CMP, one connected CMP, one connected cross drain, one erosion feature, a
spring, four ditches, and two gullies (Table D-18). These features are located on roads 30N01,
30N16, 30N16E, 30N16F, and 30N47 (Figure D-6 of Appendix D-1: Sediment Source Maps).

Burnt Ranch

Risk ratings of the roads in Burnt Ranch that were inventoried by NRM and lie within (or
partially within) the proposed project boundaries are identified in Table D-19. There are no roads
located within the proposed project area that were rated at high risk.

There is only one road in the proposed project area in Canyon Creek (Figure D-7 of Appendix D1: Sediment Source Maps). Road 32N25 lies in Lower Canyon Creek and was not inventoried.
There are no stream crossings on this road in the project area, so it was not inspected for high risk
features.

Alternative Legacy Sediment Site Treatment Plan
This Alternative Legacy Sediment Site Treatment Plan is being submitted because the proposed
project is considered to be so large that it is infeasible to treat all of the identified legacy sediment
sites. Alternative plan submittals are to include a proposal to treat some portion of the largest
sediment producing sites within the project area, as well as a description of past legacy sediment
site treatments and restoration efforts implemented within the same sixth-field watershed within
the past twenty years. This Alternative Plan is being submitted to meet the requirements of the
Waiver.

Proposed Legacy Sediment Site Treatment Plan
The Forest Service proposes to treat only the high and moderate-high risk features within the
project area, and the high risk features along the haul routes. There are 224 identified high and
moderate-high risk sediment site features and 4.7 miles of unauthorized roads prioritized for
treatment over a 10 year period (Table D-21). The treatments in the suggested schedule are
grouped by road or locality based on the number of features on a road or within a relatively small
area. This is to divide the work into manageable portions and within geographic areas to
minimize travel between features to treat and to maximize efficiency. Additionally, there are a
few sediment site features that will require treatment before the project can cross that feature (e.g.
the ford on the 31N14 road).

Summaries of the watershed restoration work in the Region’s forests were compiled and
presented in a presentation by the Forest Service Northern Region in August 2015 to the Water
Board in support of the 2015 Waiver renewal (USDA, 2015b). In the Shasta-Trinity National
Forest, 718 miles of roads were upgraded, 179 miles of road were decommissioned, and 5 fish
passage structures were installed since 1995.

Appendix D-3: Sedimentation and Erosion Feature
Descriptions
Stream Crossing (Xing CMP and Ford): Stream crossings are anywhere perennial, intermittent,
or ephemeral creeks cross a road or trail as well as swale drainages. Stream crossings can be
either a culvert (usually corrugated metal pipe (CMP)) or a ford. Culverts that are undersized or
not maintained can be significant sediment sources; a clogged culvert can overtop and wash out,
sending the entire fill volume of sediment to the stream. Ford crossings can be of several different
designs and are usually only used on lightly travelled roads.
Cross Drain (XDR and XDR CMP): Cross drains are in the form of a culvert, a rolling dip, a
critical dip, or a water bar. The dips either drain surface flow from the road or from a ditch on an
insloped road. They can be natural surface, graveled, or armored with rip rap. A poorly designed
or poorly maintained cross drain (or an inadequate number of cross drains) can result in erosion
and sediment delivery to streams.
Ditch: Ditches convey drainage along insloped roads. Ditch relief culverts and dips drain the
inboard ditches. An insufficient number of drains can lead to ditch erosion and/or road surface
flow and sedimentation. Hillslope erosion, woody or rock debris, or brush can clog ditches and
drainage will be diverted onto the road surface causing more road damage and sedimentation.
Gully: Gullies form in ditches or on the road surface when there is an insufficient number of nonfunctioning drainage features.
Erosion: Erosion features include rills, gullies (not on a road surface or in a ditch), slumps, and
landslides. Erosion affects roads due to the disturbance of natural hydrologic function near the
road.
Spring: Spring features include seeps which can cause road drainage, stability, and erosion
problems when either in the road prism or nearby.

APPENDIX E – AQUATIC CONSERVATION STRATEGY
CONSISTENCY
Table E-1 below illustrates how treatments proposed in this project meet the Aquatic
Conservation Strategy Objectives
Table E- 1. Effects of Treatments in relations to Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) objectives

Aquatic Conservation Strategy
Objectives

Effect of treatments from the various action alternatives in relation to
the ACS

1.) Maintain and restore the
distribution, diversity, and
complexity of watershed and
landscape-scale features to ensure
protection of the aquatic systems to
which species, populations and
communities are uniquely adapted.

Existing Condition: The 2015 fires burned ten watersheds (HUC5) that have
proposed hazard tree removal. Three watersheds (Upper Hayfork, New River &
Lower Hayfork) had more than 5% of the watershed burn at moderate and high
severities combined (11, 8 & 6 percent respectively), while all other watersheds
had smaller areas burned within them. While the wildfire significantly affected
portions of these watersheds, most of the later seral vegetation that provides
watershed diversity and complexity in the watersheds is retained in all of the
watersheds.
Portions that burned at low severities or that didn’t burn within the fire perimeter
are actually considered to have greater diversity and complexity within the
watersheds with new vegetative growth and reduced ground fuels since the fires
decreased the presence of small twigs and branches that typically carry fires
which has also helped to break up fuel bed continuity. The natural successional
processes that commence literally as soon as the heat subsides has contributed
to increased complexity and diversity. Refer to ACS Objective 8 for a description
of effects at smaller hydrologic unit scales that better correlate to potential
changes in stream reaches and site specific changes on the landscape.
Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) Dead and dying trees
on private lands are assumed to be harvested in all areas that burned at a
moderate or high severity and are considered to be clear cut. It is expected that
these privately harvested areas will be reforested more rapidly than adjacent
federal lands due to the aggressive reforestation programs implemented on
private lands; which typically includes the use of herbicides. The USFS is also
planning a reforestation project which will not include the use of herbicides, so
vegetation is expected to recover at a much slower rate on the public lands. The
different rates of recovery also contribute to greater vegetative diversity and stand
structures that are increasing complexity across the burned portions of the
watersheds. This hazard tree removal project, is expected to create a safer
environment for implementing the reforestation projects on private and public
lands by keeping roads open and safer to travel. Felling and possible hauling of
hazard trees will not disrupt recovery processes. Fuels reduction will promote
more rapid healing of intermediate to long term successional recovery by
preventing or reducing the scope and magnitude of future conflagration-level
wildfires, particularly in riparian areas. Proposed road improvement work and
closures are expected to reduce up to 30,000 cubic yards of sedimentation by
treating legacy road problem sites; this will help protect aquatic ecosystems which
could otherwise be adversely affected or virtually eliminated for many acres and
miles if these legacy sites were not ‘defused’ of their threat.
Regardless of the alternative selected, there will be no appreciable impact on the
physical and biotic features captured by this Objective. Cumulative watershed
effects results documented in the hydrology section of the EIS confirm such, at
the larger scales.
Therefore, Project implementation via selection of any action alternative will
maintain and promote attainment of this ACS objective at the watershed and
project site scale (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs.

2.) Maintain and restore spatial and
temporal connectivity within and
between watersheds. Lateral,
longitudinal, and drainage network
connections include floodplains,
wetlands, upslope areas,
headwater tributaries, and intact
refugia. These network connections
must provide chemically and
physically unobstructed routes to
areas critical for fulfilling life history
requirements of aquatic and
riparian-dependent species.

Existing Conditions: The 2015 wildfires burned portions of many ridgetops that
severed vegetative connectivity between watersheds. Portions of riparian
reserves that burned at moderate and high severities have also lost the
continuity of shading along the streams over the short term. However, over the
long term the trees killed along the riparian reserves will contribute woody
debris to streams that is expected to aid in metering sediment through the
stream system and will likely to contribute to the development of desirable
aquatic habitats.The longitudinal connectivity between watersheds and the
drainage networks have fewer impacts from the 2015 fires and more significant
impacts from historic mining activities with tailing piles stacked in significant
portions of historic floodplains that have dramatically decreased flood prone
areas along the larger rivers. In addition the legacy road networks have also
impeded drainage continuity at stream crossings.
Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project)
The reforestation projects of private and public lands will help to restore the
continuity in vegetation along streams restoring the thermal insulation along the
streams, which will take roughly 30 years to develop shading to pre-fire
conditions.
This hazard tree removal project includes active fuels treatments done to
decrease the frequency and probability of serious future intense wildfires which
promote the essence of this ACS objective. Major disruptions to connectivity
may be decreased for terrestrial and aquatic habitat-dependent organisms.
Felling of hazard trees into stream channels when growing within 150 feet of
streams can create minor physical obstructions, or even promote deposition of
additional wood pieces, but such large wood ‘jams’ are a natural part of a
healthy stream ecosystem. Such wood can collect fine sediments above their
temporary dams and create large pools on occasion. Often fish spawning
gravels deposit at the upper end of these pools. Prevention of large legacy road
sedimentation catastrophes also prevents site by site aquatic connectivity
severing and disruption. If any of the untreated legacy sites later became a
physical barrier to aquatic organisms, then their treatment will instead promote
continued connectivity.
Stream crossing upgrades are a connected action associated with the
implementation of this project. Treating legacy road sites that are considered
existing or potential sediment sourcesthat are required as part of the North
Coast Water Board Waiver are likely to improve stream bed and woody debris
transport at stream crossings which restores streambed continuity.
Project implementation via any of the action alternatives could help to promote
recovery in areas as described above and will not prevent attainment of this
ACS objective at the Project site scale(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs,
and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the
intermediate to long-term.

3.) Maintain and restore the
physical integrity of the aquatic
system, including shorelines,
banks, and bottom configurations.

Existing Conditions: The wildfires of 2015 resulted in increased erosion and
sedimentation to the watersheds affected by this project. The South Fork Trinity
River and Hayfork Creek which were most disturbed by the wildfires are under a
TMDL (EPA 1998) to reduce the excess sediment loads that are adversely
affecting the cold water fisheries including coho and fall run Chinook salmon
and steelhead trout. Road improvements associated with the BAER treatments
helped to significantly decrease the erosion and sedimentation associated with
the fire by reducing risks of failure at stream crossings and reducing road
erosion that was accelerated by the fires.
Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project) The reforestation
projects on private and public lands will help to stabilize the watersheds over the
long term, providing mature vegetation within the next 30 years.
This hazard tree removal project includes Felling hazard trees within 150 feet of
streams into or toward streams to reside in place which helps restore the
physical integrity of aquatic ecosystems directly by providing improved habitats
through changes in bottom configurations (often by creating pools) and by
providing energy through wood decomposition via insect contribution to the
water column.
The associated fuels treatments will help maintain proper riparian habitat
functions by preventing future large-scale riparian mortality. Prevention of large
sedimentation disasters through legacy road site treatments will also maintain
the physical integrity of aquatic habitat. Peak and base flows will not appreciably
change via Project implementation so aquatic habitat will not differ from
background at any time of the year after Project implementation.
Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent
attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term
(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at
the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.

4.) Maintain and restore water
quality necessary to support healthy
riparian, aquatic, and wetland
ecosystems. Water quality must
remain within the range that
maintains the biological, physical,
and chemical integrity of the system
and benefits survival, growth,
reproduction, and migration of
individuals composing aquatic and
riparian communities.

Existing Conditions: The South Fork Trinity River is included on California’s
Clean Water Act section 303(d) list for sediment and temperature impairment
and has a TMDL in place (EPA 1998). The mainstem Trinity River is on the
same list for sediment and mercury and has a sediment TMDL in place as well
(EPA 2001). The New River watershed which is a tributary to the main stem
Trinity River is designated as a Key Watershed in the SHF LRMP and is
considered as high quality habitat providing refugia for aquatic species. It is also
considered a reference watershed that was utilized to set the TMDL and is clear
of mercury issues. The 2015 wildfires delayed the water quality recovery of the
portions of the watersheds that burned at high and moderate burn severities
yielding higher than normal peak flows and elevated erosion and sedimentation
rates, as well as a decrease in thermal cover for sections of streams.

1T

Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project)
The reforestation projects on private and public lands will help to restore
watersheds, which should promote improved water quality over the next 30
years as mature forests again redevelop.
Water quality ‘indicators’ that could potentially be affected by Project
implementation are temperature, suspended sediment, chemical contamination,
and water quantity via water drafting or peak and base flow changes. These
issues are discussed throughout the Project fish BA, the fisheries and hydrology
sections of the EIS and their various reports developed for this project.
Sediment yield calculations are in the Physical Sciences Report and the CWE
analysis have largely been maintaining values below the Threshold of Concern
except in a few areas where the value exceeds the Threshold pre-Project.
Water temperature is discussed in the physical sciences report and the fish BA.
There will be no anticipated means by which stream temperature will change.
Chemical contamination possibilities are extremely limited due to proper
application of EEZs, RPMs, and BMPs.
No probable measureable effects will occur to water quality at the Project level
scale due to the riparian reserve EEZs, the Project RMPs and the BMPs.
Shading of water surfaces will not appreciably change due to occasional hazard
tree felling within 150 feet of stream channels. Large log wood felled into
channels will promote all aspects of this Objective. The prevention of up to
30,000 cubic yards of fine-grained sediment from entering stream courses via
the legacy road work site treatments will certainly promote the aspects of this
Objective.
Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent
attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term
(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at
the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.

5.) Maintain and restore the
sediment regime under which
aquatic ecosystems evolved.
Elements of the sediment regime
include the timing, volume, rate,
and character of sediment input,
storage, and transport.

Existing Conditions: The sediment regime is in recovery from the initial impacts
resulting from the 2015 wildfires, especially in severely burned areas. At a subdrainage scale (HUC8) the wildfire effects to the smaller hydrologic units are
more extreme. Sixty-five percent of the 159 sub-drainages had more than 5% of
the area burned at high and moderate severities. Six percent of these (9 subdrainages) had more than 50% burn at high and moderate severities. Six of
these were dispersed in different drainages, but 3 of them are in the
Chanchelulla –Shiell Gulch drainage that all drain into the Dubakella Subdrainage in the Upper Hayfork Creek Watershed. The fire in these areas
adversely altered thermal regulation, nutrient filtering and erosion rates at reach
scales. The BAER treatments that followed the wildfire accomplished
considerable road improvements to reduce erosion and sedimentation rates
from the wildfires throughout all watersheds.
Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project)
The reforestation projects on private and public lands will help to restore
watersheds, which should promote improved water quality over the next 30
years as mature forests again redevelop.
Project implementation effects in the Physical Science report display the results
of a sediment yield analysis per alternative. Although there are measureable
quantities of sediment tonnage to be generated at the Project and HUC5-8
scale levels, none of the Project related quantities are large enough to
appreciably affect the CWE analysis results and move any HUC5 watershed
into a different TOC category. Project implementation via any of the action
alternatives will not prevent attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site
scale or in the short term (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs),
and meets the objective at the landscape scale and in the intermediate to longterm.
None of the action alternatives would adversely impact the sediment regime at
the Project and larger landscape scales. The aquatic ecosystem no doubt has
been impacted by the wildfire events and acreages affected pre-Project. Such
events are part of the aquatic ecosystem evolution process. The alternatives will
not appreciably add to existing post-wildfire enhanced sediment production
loads.

6.) Maintain and restore in-stream
flows sufficient to create and
sustain riparian, aquatic, and
wetland habitats, and to retain
patterns of sediment, nutrient, and
wood routing. The timing,
magnitude, duration, and spatial
distribution of peak, high and low
flows must be protected.

Existing Conditions: The mainstem Trinity River has an inter-basin transfer that
has transported Trinity River water to the Sacramento River Basin since 1963.
Unless this diversion is discontinued there is no way to restore instream flows to
historic conditions. The South Fork Trinity River however is the largest
remaining undammed river in California. Over the last decade with the increase
in cannabis plantations a considerable increase in illegal water drafting has also
resulted. Late summer flows have nearly been depleted by this drafting in many
of the perennially flowing tributaries.

1T

7.) Maintain and restore the timing,
variability, and duration of floodplain
inundation and water table
elevation in meadows and
wetlands.

The 2015 wildfires will result in slight increases in adjacent tributary peak flows
and are also likely to have augmented low flows as fewer trees are utilizing
moisture due to the replacement of living trees with dead trees on large scales..
This increase in flow is negligible in comparison to the flow alterations described
above.
This project proposes no new road construction that could otherwise result in
surface runoff increases. Legacy road site treatments will decrease the
possibility of site diversions at later dates. The most direct way that instream
flows could be modified by this project would be during the time it takes to draft
water from designated sites long enough to fill water tank vehicles. Both LRMP
and NMFS water drafting standards and drafting specifications included as
Appendix E in the Project Fish BE will be closely adhered to, which will minimize
such impacts to acceptable levels when drafting occurs. Otherwise, there is no
aspect of any of the potential action alternatives that could appreciably affect
instream flows or the natural hydrographs of such flows.
Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent
attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term
(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at
the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.
Existing Conditions: floodplains along the mainstem Trinity River have
experienced impacts from historic mining activities with tailing piles stacked
throughout portions of them that have dramatically decreased flood prone
areas. Seeps and springs throughout the areas burned by the 2015 wildfires are
receiving higher than normal rates of soil saturation due to the loss of mature
green trees. Therefore small areas of perennial soil saturation are likely
providing additional aquatic habitats that were more limited before the wildfires.
Proposed treatments where hazard trees are felled into perennial streams could
alter local site patterns of floodplain inundation, water table elevation. However,
it would have no effect or only minor effect to existing flow patterns and stream
channel conditions. Floodplains, meadows, springs and wetlands are all
included within Riparian Reserve designations. No ground disturbing activities
would take place within these areas and the proposed activities would not affect
timing, variability, and duration of floodplain inundation.
Treated areas may have increased soil moisture but not enough to measurably
affect water table elevations. Protecting riparian areas as well as not
constructing system roads or operating within floodplains would help to maintain
existing conditions. Proposed treatments will maintain and restore the variability
of floodplain inundation. There will be no effect on wetlands. Project
implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent attainment of
this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term (aided greatly by
Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the landscape
scale and in the intermediate to long-term.

8. Maintain and restore the species
composition and structural diversity
of plant communities in riparian
areas and wetlands to provide
adequate summer and winter
thermal regulation, nutrient filtering,
appropriate rates of surface
erosion, bank erosion, and channel
migration and to supply amounts
and distributions of coarse woody
debris sufficient to sustain physical
complexity and stability.

Existing Conditions: The 2015 fires did not significantly alter structural
distributions of plant communities in riparian areas with a maximum of 11% of
Upper Hayfork Watershed burned at moderate and high burn severities. At a subdrainage scale (HUC8) the 2015 wildfire effects to the hydrologic units are much
more pronounced. Sixty-five percent of the 159 sub-drainages had more than 5%
of the area burned at high and moderate severities. Six percent of these (9 subdrainages) had more than 50% burn at high and moderate severities. Six of these
were dispersed in different drainages, but 3 of them are in the Chanchelulla –
Shiell Gulch drainage that all drain into the Dubakella Sub-drainage. The fire in
these areas adversely altered thermal regulation, nutrient filtering and erosion
rates at reach scales.

1T

Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project)
The reforestation projects of private and public lands will help to restore the
continuity in vegetation along streams restoring the thermal insulation, which will
take roughly 30 years to develop shading to pre fire conditions.
Proposed treatments would not alter the restoration of the species composition
and structural diversity of plant communities in untreated areas. Riparian
vegetation would be protected as required by resource protection measures and
EEZs. Large overstory vegetation would remain intact except where hazard trees
are already dead, and would continue to provide thermal regulation. So hazard
trees within 150 feet of streams would be felled to become LWD but the healthy
trees remain to become future LWD. In the long-term, treatments in riparian
reserves are expected to promote the growth of larger conifer and hardwood
species already present, resulting in a more diverse forest structure and a source
of coarse woody debris. Project activities move treated riparian reserves towards
being more resilient to wildfire and maintain riparian processes and function.
Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent
attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term
(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at the
landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.

9. Maintain and restore habitat to
support well-distributed populations
of native plant, invertebrate, and
vertebrate riparian-dependent
species

Existing Conditions: The South Fork Trinity River has a TMDL in place (EPA
1998) to restore aquatic habitat conditions by reducing sedimentation. The
mainstem Trinity River also has a sediment TMDL in place (EPA 2001). The
New River Watershed which is a tributary to the main stem Trinity River is
designated as a Key Watershed in the STNF LRMP and is considered as high
quality habitat providing refugia for aquatic species. It is also considered a
reference watershed that was utilized to set the TMDL and is also clear of
mercury issues.
Existing and Future Activities – (not including this project)
The reforestation projects of private and public lands will help to restore the
continuity in vegetation along streams restoring the thermal insulation which will
take roughly 30 years to develop shading to pre fire conditions.
The proposed treatments in the action alternatives are designed in part to
reduce fuel loading and move the fire regime closer to that which occurred
historically on the landscape and within riparian reserves. No adverse impacts
to aquatic species are expected to occur in or downstream of the Project area
as a result of the Project in the short term. Beneficial effects to riparian and
aquatic habitat are expected in the long-term.
Proposed treatments which include the connected actions of treating legacy
sediment sites would contribute to the more immediate restoration of local
habitat above and below stream crossings that are improved as a condition of
the enrollment of this project under the North Coast Regional Water Quality
Waiver. Over the long term these actions are expected to support welldistributed populations of riparian-dependent species by increasing habitat
continuity, reducing sediment loads and speeding the development of latesuccessional forest characteristics, including large trees and a multi-story
canopy, in the Riparian Reserve areas that would receive fuels treatments.
Proposed treatments could cause a very minor short-term reduction in canopy
closure in the Riparian Reserve areas having individual hazard trees felled, but
any effect on species would be negligible because of the over-riding effect of
the residual trees and because of the small proportion of the Riparian Reserve
that would be treated. Habitat would be restored spatially and temporally.
Project implementation via any of the action alternatives will not prevent
attainment of this ACS objective at the Project site scale or in the short term
(aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs), and meets the objective at
the landscape scale and in the intermediate to long-term.

River Complexes. As a result, Maps F-9 and F-10 do not show any fuelbreaks. This is not a
mistake.
Note 5: Map F-20 shows treatments for Alternative 4. No salvage removal is proposed within the
extent of the Mad River complex under Alternative 4; hence, no salvage treatments are shown on

Comment: "The Conservation Congress - Denise Boggs (CC) and Safe Alternatives for our
Forest Environment - Larry Glass (S.A.F.E.) appreciate the opportunity to comment on the DEIS
for the Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage Project (hereafter referred to as project).
We request our comments be considered prior to making a final decision.
CC provided scoping comments on this project and while they are already in the administrative
record, we incorporate them again here. We also incorporate by reference the comments and
attachments submitted by WNI during both scoping and this DEIS comment period. The DEIS
fails to address many of the issues raised during scoping."
Response: Thank you for your continued interest in the management of the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest. All comments submitted during the comment period on the DEIS were
considered and responded to. Since you have not identified any specific comments for which the
responses were inadequate, we are unable to determine what issues you believe were not
adequately addressed.

Comment: In our scoping comments, we asked how the areas selected for logging were chosen.
The FS responded that roads identified for salvage were based on economic viability. This
generally means large diameter trees. There is no mention or charts of the DBHs in the project
area but the economic analysis mentions an average of 25" DBH. Considering the number of owl
territories and designated critical habitat in the project, we don't believe it was appropriate to use
economics as the driving factor, and it certainly isn't in concert with the ESA. The roads were
evaluated using GIS and then overlaid with RAVG fire severity data. According to Appendix 2:
RAVG Calibration the calibration is not accurate with an upper and lower confidence level of
42.71% - 33.76% respectively. "All one can say about the results is there is a difference and that
difference is approximately 40%." This is important because the areas the RAVG found to have
burned at moderate intensity are being considered as high intensity for this project. The FS claims
some of the sites likely experienced moderate fire severity, but the calibration provides a much
more accurate overall estimation of the actual effects of the fire on vegetation. We would disagree
that a 60% accuracy rate, which would be a "D" grade at maximum is providing a more accurate
estimation. Considering moderate burned trees as high burned trees could result in green trees
being logged, when the project is proposed as cutting only dead trees.
Response: First, it is important to note that salvage and hazard tree felling are different actions.
Salvage deals with the sale and removal of felled trees (logging), while hazard tree falling does
not involve logging. The purpose of this project is to mitigate hazards that threaten public safety
along open roads, sustain and establish forest cover, and capture economic value and support the
economies of local communities by providing forest products. While capturing economic value
(e.g. salvage logging) is a component of the Purpose and Need it is not the primary driver as
much as a tool to achieve the goals of hazard mitigation. As hazard mitigation will occur along all
open roads in the fire footprints, the major benefit of salvage logging is that it will offset the cost
of some of the fuel treatment activities since, otherwise, fuels treatments alone would have to
mitigate the increase in fuel loads created by addition of numerous felled trees to the forest floor.
As indicated in the response to your Scoping Comment 35 (DEIS pg. 391), the economic
opportunity or viability of any one treatment area was a determining factor in its inclusion in a

timber sale, not in the need for hazard mitigation. Areas with larger diameter trees generally have
a higher value than areas of smaller trees due in part to deterioration rates. These areas do not
necessarily correlate to northern spotted owl occupancy. Note that the scope of the project is
limited to the roadside hazards, thereby forgoing the areas of high economic viability that would
generally be associated with a salvage sale (see Alternative 9).
This comment includes some confusion over RAVG calibration. RAVG data looks at mortality of
a stand immediately following the fire; however, trees often continue to die due to secondary
mortality. As greater mortality was observed in the field than was represented in the RAVG data,
additional plots were taken a few months after RAVG was processed. The plot data indicated that
within moderate to high burn severity areas, mortality was approximately 40% higher (these are
not "confidence intervals" but percentage underestimate) than indicated by RAVG, due to
secondary mortality. This calibration increases the accuracy of analysis which may have
previously underestimated the impacts of the fires and therefore the hazards associated with it.
RAVG calibration does not in any way change the prescriptions associated with the project,
which only treats dead trees (under Alternatives 1, 4 and 5). If an area identified for salvage
logging has a majority of live, healthy trees that will not change the requirement that only the
dead trees within that stand may be cut. Implementation takes into account the conditions on the
ground, not projected conditions, when determining if a tree is dead.

Comment: Since 66% of the roads in the project are class 2 and not open to passenger level
vehicles, we don't see an urgent need to "protect" these areas from alleged hazards.
Response: The Purpose and Need on page 4 of the DEIS states: "Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed
or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads." This purpose for the project defines the scope of treatments
that are necessary, and limits the opportunity to analyze alternatives that either treat more or less
than those roads that are open to the public. This project is responding to conditions that already
exist. The fires have already burned and caused hazards along roads that are open to the public.
To exclude one type of road over another because of the type of vehicle and the assumed use
seems arbitrary and capricious. Alternative 7: Treat Along High Use Roads Only was considered
but eliminated from detailed study due to it not meeting the Purpose and Need. A different
Purpose and Need or another project might allow for a different range of miles analyzed, but that
is not being considered at this time.

Comment: The BA also mentions unauthorized routes that may be used by the public are not
included in the mileage numbers. It isn't clear whether the project will treat these unauthorized
routes.
Response: The intent of the footnote (BA, page 12) is to recognize that there may be other routes
in the project area, but are not included in the project because they are not authorized or open to
the public. These routes will not have a treatment along them under any alternative. The footnote
does not seem to be adding the desired clarification so it will be removed.

Comment: The FS has not conducted a substantive analysis for many resources using the excuse
the urgent need for the project prohibited the forest from doing certain analyses or surveys. The
FS decided not to seek an ESD for this project and the project is already past its economic value.
There is simply no excuse not to conduct the proper analyses as we outline in comments below.
One of the primary Purpose and Needs for the project is to recover the economic value of timber.
That boat sailed as the DEIS confirms. If the project is logged after 2016, not only will the timber
lose its value but the sale will be well below cost. In light of this we believe the DEIS should be
remanded and a new analysis conducted that is not driven by economics. Such an alternative

would likely be smaller in scale and far less harmful to imperiled species and their habitat, as well
as other resource values."
Response: As identified in Chapter 1 of the DEIS, the purposes of this project are to mitigate
hazards that threaten public safety, sustain and establish forest cover and capture economic value.
While large salvage timber sales would go farther to offset costs associated with hazard
mitigation, some economic value can still be captured by the public through other means such as
firewood cutting, biomass sales and small sales. More importantly, the hazards to the public are
still present and still need to be addressed. The Forest has conducted substantive and appropriate
analysis for all affected resources. Economics has not been the primary driver for this project, as
indicated (in part) by the Forest's decision not to seek an ESD. Many factors impacted the Forest's
decision not to seek an ESD, but the level of analysis required with or without an ESD is
unchanged.

Comment: We support Alternative 6 - the No Action Alternative. We would have also supported
an alternative that removed true hazard trees from Class 3 & 4 roads open to passenger level
vehicles, and county and state roads totaling 80 miles of roads. These roads receive 95% of the
use by the public in all likelihood. The other 153 miles of road are class 2 not open to passenger
level vehicles, are rarely traveled by high clearance vehicles, and don't pose the same threat to
public safety. The DEIS states "Maintenance Level 2 roads are generally not recommended for
use by passenger vehicles, the condition and amount of use of those roads varies widely." They
don't represent a public hazard and the FS hasn't made a case that they do. The STNF developed
five action alternatives but they all proposes logging along 233 miles of roads.
Response: The Purpose and Need on page 4 of the DEIS states: "Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed
or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads." This purpose for the project defines the scope of treatments
that are necessary, and limits the opportunity to analyze alternatives that either treat more or less
than those roads that are open to the public. This project is responding to conditions that already
exist. The fires have already burned and caused hazards along roads that are open to the public.
To exclude one type of road over another because of the type of vehicle and the assumed use
seems arbitrary and capricious. Alternative 7: Treat Along High Use Roads Only was considered
but eliminated from detailed study due to it not meeting the Purpose and Need. A different
Purpose and Need or another project might allow for a different range of miles analyzed, but that
is not being considered at this time.

Comment: In addition, of the 233 miles only 27 miles have been designated as high value
wildlife conservation areas due to their value as habitat for NSO. Over half of the project is in
designated critical habitat so far more than 27 miles of roads should have been included in this
designation.
Response: The US Forest Service worked closely with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to
determine the area’s most valuable to NSO, which are designated here as High-Value Wildlife
Conservation Areas. This process is described in detail on pp. 32-34 of the BA. It incorporated
NSO habitat mapping, the US Fish and Wildlife Service Relative Habitat Suitability modeling,
and survey results identifying areas known to be used by nesting or pair-bonded NSO. This
process helped focus protection measures on the most valuable areas, while still allowing the
project's Purpose and Need to be met.
Over half of the project area is within designated NSO Critical Habitat Units (CHUs). However,
CHUs include many areas that do not meet the definition of suitable NSO habitat, and many areas
that are marginal in their capability to support NSO populations. These factors are reflected in the
US Fish and Wildlife Service's Relative Habitat Suitability modeling, which was utilized in the
process of mapping HVWCAs. Although this process did not identify all lands within NSO

Critical Habitat Units (CHUs) as High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas, resource protection
measures still require retention of coarse woody debris in these areas, albeit at lower levels than
within the HVWCAs.

Comment: A reasonable range of alternatives was not developed. The FS simply included the
number of roads it wanted to log, included them in all action alternatives, and included the no
action alternative because it is required to do so under NEPA. This all or nothing approach is not
conducive to a reasonable range of alternatives.
Response: The Purpose and Need on page 4 of the DEIS states: "Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed
or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads." This purpose for the project defines the scope of treatments
that are necessary, and limits the opportunity to analyze alternatives that either treat more or less
than those roads that are open to the public. This project is responding to conditions that already

Comment: We don't believe the DEIS should have been released for public comment until the
FWS completed its Biological Opinion. The only opportunity to comment on the BO will be
during the Objection period. This limits the options of the FS to make changes to the project
based on public input. It also doesn't give the public an entirely clear view of impacts to NSO and
their habitat, particularly if their opinion differs with that of the FS. The FWS will very likely
determine incidental take of NSOs and that will be new information requiring public input.
Response: The Forest has been working with the Yreka Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) Office in
the development of this project and the analysis of the Preferred Alternative to ensure that there
are agreed upon rationale, consistent with the Streamlining MOU (USDA and USDI, 2008).
Memorandum of Understanding between the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service and
the US Fish and Wildlife Service to promote the conservation of migratory birds. FS Agreement
#08-MU-1113-2400-264. Washington, D.C.). Consistent with the Streamlining MOU, the FWS
does not issue a BO until there is an agreed upon BA. The Forest did not submit a final BA due to
the expectation that there would be updates needed following the comment period on the DEIS.
Consistent with 36 CFR 218.8 (c) the FWS BO would be new information because it has not been
available during a comment period. You will be notified when the FEIS and draft ROD are
available.

CH Subunits are listed in Tables 11, 12 and 13:
Table 11 total potential treatments acres 3,426 but when you add each category across you get
1,870.
Table 12 total potential treatment acres 4,854. When you add each category across you get 2,870.
Table 13 total potential treatment acres 75. When you add each category across you get 41.
Total is 8,355 When you add each category across you get 4,781.
Summary of effects to subunits is found in Table 14 Summary Total is 4,781 (acres in treatment
units).
So apparently the difference is ""potential"" treatment acres vs. actual but that's not what the chart
says. What if all the ""potential"" acres are logged? That would be 57% more logging that
accounted for.
There are other discrepancies:
Table 8 is also a summary of NSO habitat and proposed treatments and it shows 1,893 acres of
NR habitat before treatment; then degrading of 1,893 acres from the project, yet post project there
remains 1,893 acres of NR habitat. Logging of 1,893 acres of NR habitat will not result in 1,893
acres post project.
Under the Determinations for PBFs it states 1,466 acres of NR habitat will be degraded; 1,452
acres of foraging will be degraded; 1,642 acres of dispersal habitat will be degraded; and 221
acres of PFF will be removed.
The STNF inability or unwillingness to produce concise information is misleading to the public.
There is a need to constantly cross reference reports, diagrams and charts and often the
information does not match. Finally, the tables named in the effects to physical and biological
features in the BA are mislabeled.
These charts need to be cleaned up and presented in the FEIS in clear, accurate information as to
what exactly is proposed for logging in Alternative 1."
Response: Tables 11, 12 and 13 include total potential treatment acres, and potential treatment
acres in each NSO habitat type. The sum of treatments in the NSO habitats does not match the
overall total because the latter includes treatments in areas unsuitable as NSO habitat. Tables 11,
12 and 13 summarize effects to NSO habitats in each Critical habitat subunit. It is unclear what is
confusing the commenter, but the titles will be expanded to add further clarity.
Table 8 does show 1,893 acres of NR habitat before treatment. These acres will potentially be
degraded, but not downgraded to another NSO habitat type or converted to non-habitat
(removed). These acres will therefore remain NR habitat. Table 14 (Summary of effects on PBF's
in each Critical Habitat subunit) is a concise summary of potential effects to each NSO habitat
type in each Critical Habitat subunit.

Comment: According to the BA, multiple aspects of suitable habitat are required for habitat to be
considered suitable or high quality. These habitat elements can't be queried from the E-veg data.
As a result, the actual quantity of suitable habitat may be overestimated. The FS also did not field
validate 75% of the habitat due to the size of the project area. The 25% that was field validated
either before or after the fire showed the NSO habitat layer is generally an accurate assessment of
NRF habitat on the ground. There are problems with this assumption. Validating habitat before
the fire should have given different results than after the fire. The project area is large and has
diverse typography. The quality of habitat components in a flatter area may be different than in a
steep area. The FS simply can't extrapolate the entire project area's suitable habitat based on field
validation of only ¼ of the project. And, since the E-veg overestimated the quality of suitable
habitat that means the level of impacts were likely underestimated.

Response: The habitat field verification that was done before the fires was used to validate prefire habitat conditions. The e-veg habitat database was also used, as well as pre-fire aerial
imagery. The pre-fire habitat conditions were then used in combination with RAVG and post-fire
field verification to map post-fire habitat conditions. E-veg was found to be generally accurate
but more likely to overestimate rather than underestimate the amount of suitable NSO habitat
present. The result of this would not be to under-represent potential effects to NSO habitat, but
instead to over-estimate these potential effects.

12. C onservation Congress - Denise Boggs

Comment: The project was determined to "likely to adversely affect NSO Critical habitat"
because snag density and CWD levels in suitable habitat will be reduced to a point that will cause
detrimental impacts to habitat and therefore harm the viability of NSO. The DEIS claims some
impacts will be alleviated by RPMs but as we document below this is untrue because the LOPs
can be lifted and no surveys were conducted for owls.
Response: The project design includes numerous resource protection measures (RPMs) that will
reduce potential effects to NSO, including coarse woody debris and snag retention requirements
(DEIS, pp. 30-31), and LOPs. As detailed in RPMs, the LOPs can only be lifted if protocol
surveys are completed and non-nesting is determined. The main effects leading to the "likely"
determination for critical habitat are effects to snags and CWD (especially snags), but there are no
set thresholds established in the analysis below which a "likely" determination is triggered. The
determination was a function of degradation of suitable NRF habitats (and removal of PFF)
across a large enough acreage that it may be above the level of insignificant or discountable (or
wholly beneficial).The viability of NSO is determined by FWS and will be documented in their
BO.

13. C onservation Congress - Denise Boggs

Comment: The DEIS did not include an Environmental Baseline as required under the ESA, so
we assume the FS is relying completely on the FWS for this analysis. That analysis is not
available for review and public comment. As we document in the NEPA cumulative effects
comments, there has been a significant amount of logging in owl habitat in the past, present and
there will be in the future when private lands logging is combined with FS logging. An analysis of
the entire CHU will not be sufficient and the EB must include the three subunits in the analysis.
Response: As required under ESA, the BA includes an analysis of effects of the Preferred
Alternative on suitable NSO habitat and Critical Habitat in the project action area (pp. 76-85).
Cumulative effects includes the effects of past activities and ongoing and future activities. The
effects of past activities are captured by the assessment of current conditions (i.e. the existing
environment). The habitat mapping used in the BA represents these current conditions. Ongoing
and future foreseeable activities, including post-fire timber salvage harvest on private lands, are
analyzed in the BA (pp. 70-76).The US Fish and Wildlife Service Biological Opinion will address
overall effects to all Critical Habitat Units that are affected by project activities. This analysis will
utilize the current habitat conditions in the project action area that are identified in the BA, as
well as other habitat mapping developed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. That document will
be available to the public with the FEIS. Under ESA, the FWS (not the Forest Service) updates
the environmental baseline and it will be included in the BO.

14. C onservation Congress - Denise Boggs

Comment: The DEIS repeatedly states there will be no removal of owl habitat, only
downgrading. Yet, the BA states there will be 221 acres of removal. (153 AC PFF1 and 68 AC
PFF2). This will also affect prey availability for NSO.
Response: There will be no removal or downgrading of the NSO nesting/roosting or foraging
habitats as they are defined by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service
2011). Proposed activities do include removal of some areas that were nesting/roosting or
foraging habitat previous to the 2015 wildfires and burned at moderate or high severity. These are

termed "post-fire foraging" areas in this analysis (249 acres total; see Table 9 in the wildlife BA).
The EIS will be updated to clarify this point. The effects of project activities on NSO prey are
disclosed and analyzed in the "Effects to NSO Habitat" section of the BA (pp. 46-52).

15. C onservation Congress - Denise Boggs
50T

Comment: An estimated 60 new landings may be needed generally not exceeding 0.25 acre each.
That potentially is loss of 15 acres of additional habitat that was not analyzed in the BA because
the BA states it is unknown where they will be placed. If placed in a core area that will have
larger impacts than if placed in dispersal habitat. These should have been identified in the DEIS
or BA.
Response: New landings are described and quantified in the BA, but are not mapped because
their locations are not known at this time. However, an opening of such a small size is not likely
to convert a patch of suitable NSO habitat to unsuitable habitat. Openings of this size are instead
considered valuable components of NSO habitat that enhance NSO foraging opportunities within
both nesting/roosting and foraging habitats. Openings of such small size are also not considered a
meaningfully measurable impediment to NSO dispersal. The project design also prohibits
mechanical or tractor-based operations in NSO nesting/roosting habitats within high-value
wildlife conservation areas (DEIS p. 30). This RPM would not allow landings to be used in these
areas.

16. C onservation Congress - Denise Boggs
50T

Comment: The BA is silent on whether snag requirements per the LRMP will be met. In fact the
BA is entirely silent on LRMP standards and guidelines in general.
Response: The purpose of the Biological Assessment (BA) is to analyze the potential effects of
the proposed action on threatened or endangered wildlife species listed under the Federal
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and on their designated critical habitat. There is no requirement
under ESA to ensure project compliance with Forest Plan standards and guidelines - that would
fall under NFMA and/or NEPA compliance which is incorporated into the EIS. The BA does
detail resource protection measures related to snags within and outside of HVWCAs, as well as
the effect of treatments on snag levels (which affects habitat quality) within roadside buffer.
Resource Protection Measures #2(a)(iii) and #2(b)(ii), which were developed collaboratively with
the FWS, identify snag retention requirements specific to this project. Under the Forest Plan
(LSR), snag retention is to be maintained at "naturally occurring levels" (Forest Plan 4-44).
Within Matrix land allocations, a minimum of 1.5 snags (greater than 15-inches in diameter) per
acre averaged over up to 40 acres (Forest Plan 4-62) is required. Hazard trees will be felled
regardless of the number of snags present. However, snags not posing a hazard that do not meet
merchantability specifications [as is the case for many of the snags killed by fire (see Economics
section of Chapter 3)], that contain blue stain (i.e. ponderosa pine), or that are inaccessible by
end-lining on steep slopes would be left standing within the buffer at levels consistent with or
exceeding Forest Plan guidelines. Considering this project only treats a narrow linear buffer along
open roads, the rest of the 90-95% (depending on alternative) of the NFS lands affected by
wildfire in 2015 but not a part of this project would retain well above 1.5 snags per acre. While
variable, snag data collected in late fall following the 2015 wildfires indicated an average of over
60 snags/acre (greater than 15-inches dbh) in areas of mature forest that burned at moderate to
high intensity. Similar conditions can be assumed for moderate and high severity areas adjacent to
the treatment buffers. See Vegetation section of Chapter 3.

Comment: The project proposes to plant the logged areas using a mixed conifer, and the BA
states NSO infrequently use ponderosa pine habitat. Yet we have seen almost every project in owl
habitat on the STNF plant a primary pine component after logging mixed conifer. The BA and
DEIS fail to provide the percentage of the seed mix that will be used for planting and we have

requested this information previously. The BA states ponderosa pine is included in the mix but
not the percentage. We request this information be disclosed in the FEIS.
Response: The specific mix is not disclosed, as it is varies depending on existing stand
conditions. The alternative descriptions indicate that a "species composition consistent with
historic conditions" will be utilized. This project crosses multiple stand types, as it follows open
roads impacted by wildfire in a linear fashion. Therefore, it is difficult and somewhat
disingenuous to identify a one-size-fits-all-stands prescription for mix of species planted.
Ponderosa and sugar pine are incorporated into the species mix in mixed conifer stands, if they
were present historically, as they are a component of mixed conifer. Generally speaking, only the
Blue Fire contains large pine-dominated stands that would be planted back to primarily pine. True
mixed conifer stands are generally planted to at least 50% Douglas-fir.

Comment: "The DEIS and BA do not have an analysis of any of the LSRs in the project area, yet
the map shows LSRs throughout the project. They should have been including documenting each
name/number, the level of current NRF habitat, how they are functioning, occupancy information,
and past, present and current impacts. This analysis is not the same as that for critical habitat even
though they may overlap. This information needs to be included in the FEIS.
For example, in one LSR that we know of the Gemmill project is planned in about ½ of the LSR.
The FS set a backfire in this LSR during the 2015 fires (even though the fire never came within 1
mile of the LSR) and the backfire burned the other half of the LSR, which is now part of this
project. An analysis of these impacts to that LSR must be done. Is LSRA direction being met in
this project?”
Response: LSRA direction is being met by this project. The LSR allocation is managed under
Forest Plan Prescription VII, Late-Successional Reserves and Threatened, Endangered, and
Selected Sensitive Species. In accordance with NWFP Standards and Guidelines (USDA and
USDI, , 1994a pp. C-11) the Forest prepared the Late-Successional Reserve Assessment (LSRA)
which was concurred with by the Regional Ecosystems Office in a 1999 memorandum. The
purpose of the LSRA was to develop management strategies for the LSRs, determine their
sustainability, and provide information to decision makers for managing LSRs to meet Forest
Plan goals and objectives. LSRs are a land allocation and therefore shape project design to ensure
consistency, but do not require an additional analysis. The project is consistent with LSRA
Activity Design Criteria #7 Fuel Reduction (primarily dead and down which applies to areas
greater than 10 acres that have received a stand-replacing event). Habitat suitability for northern
spotted owls is analyzed in the EIS and BA as it relates to designated Critical Habitat, which is a
more meaningful analysis. The Shiell Fire (a component of the Fork Complex, and one of the
more difficult to contain due to low road densities) moved through the Chanchelulla LSR
naturally. Minor backburning occurred to effectively slow down the fire and prevent it from
burning through the entirety of the LSR, but was not the source of fire within the LSR.

Comment: The LRMP S&Gs specify the protection of 100-acres of owl habitat around all known
owl activity centers within the range of the NSO. This appears to be violated in this project.
Response: The NWFP's standard of 100 acres of late-successional habitat around owl activity
centers that were known as of January 1, 1994, must be protected under the Matrix land allocation
(USDA and USDI, 1994a p 10) was adopted into the Shasta-Trinity National Forest Land and
Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) (USDA, 1995a) (under the Matrix land allocation) as
"...the protection of 100-acres of owl habitat around all known owl activity centers within the
range of the northern spotted owl. Management of stands in the Matrix surrounding these areas
will be designed to reduce risks of natural disturbance." (Forest Plan 4-63). This project design
meets this standard and guide. The project does not remove or downgrade nesting/roosting habitat
anywhere in the project, including activity centers. All project activities are consistent with

activities concurred with by REO in the LSRA as meeting the intent of the NWFP. Furthermore,
the activities are designed to reduce the risk of natural disturbance by treating excessive fuels.

Comment: The BA cites Lamberson et al., and states that reserves that could support a minimum
of 20 NSO territories were more likely to maintain NSO populations than smaller reserves. They
also found that juvenile dispersal was facilitated in areas large enough to support at least 20
territories. In addition, to area size, spacing between reserves also had a strong influence on
successful dispersal. The BA doesn't include any information on the LSRs in the project area none - so we have no idea what condition the LSRs are in and what level of NSO population they
can support. The FEIS needs to disclose whether each LSR in the project can support a minimum
of 20 NSO territories.
Response: LSR's contribute to the network of habitats supporting NSO's, but it is the Critical
Habitat Units (CHUs) that were established to provide for long-term survival of NSO
populations, and it is the analysis of effects to critical habitat that is that is the most appropriate
method to measure effects to NSO populations. The BA analyzes effects to NSO critical habitat
within the project's NSO action area, as well as effects to any suitable NSO habitats in the action
area that do not occur in CHUs. The Biological Opinion issued by the US Fish and Wildlife
Service will further assess effects to CHUs, including the portions outside this project's action
area. The EIS addresses compliance with Forest Plan requirements, including those related to
LSRs.
As disclosed in the BA, no nesting/roosting or foraging habitat will be downgraded. This means
that all NSO territories that exist currently would have the same amount of NRF habitat following
this project. Additionally, only 330 acres post-fire foraging habitat (330 acres) will be
downgraded or removed across the entire project area. In some territories however, the
cumulative effects of the proposed action plus other foreseeable actions may downgrade or
remove enough habitat to change the capability of the territory from nesting to non-nesting.

Comment: We also could not find any documents showing compliance with the NWFP. Does the
STNF need to seek approval from the REO for any part of this project?
The NWFP and LRMP also provides direction for maintaining old growth habitat in watersheds.
We know this project will violate snag standards and protection buffers for NSO standards in the
NWFP but there is no mention of it in any documents.
The NWFP matrix standards and guidelines specify retention of old growth fragments in 5th field
watersheds containing less than 15% of such stands. Is this standard being met in the project
area?"
Response: In accordance with the NWFP, the Shasta-Trinity Land and Resource Management
Plan (Forest Plan) required completion of Late Successional Reserve Assessments (LSRAs) that
would provide guidance for management in the LSRs. A Forest-level LSRA was completed in
1999 and concurred with by REO in an August 26, 1999 memorandum. The memorandum
specifies that "silvicultural and hazard reduction treatments described in Chapter 4 of the LSRA
are exempted from subsequent project-level REO review." This project is consistent with the
LSRA's Activity Design Criterion #7 Fuels Reduction (primarily dead and down) for areas greater
than 10 acres that have received a stand-replacing event, as disclosed in Chapter 1. As a result,
REO review is not required for this project.
The Forest Plan and the NWFP ROD require management for retention of at least 15% late
successional conditions in each 5th field planning watershed (Forest Plan, page 4-71; USDA and
USDI, 1994a page C-44). The relevant NWFP Standard and Guideline clarifies that it applies to
late-successional forest (second paragraph), of which the Forest recognizes old-growth to be a
significant and important subset. Implementation of this project would not downgrade or remove

any nesting and roosting or foraging habitat. Therefore all existing late successional and oldgrowth habitats would be maintained. Resource Protection Measures #2(a)(iii) and #2(b)(ii),
which were developed collaboratively with the FWS, identify snag retention requirements
specific to this project. Under the Forest Plan (LSR), snag retention is to be maintained at
"naturally recurring levels" (Forest Plan 4-44). Within Matrix land allocations, a minimum of 1.5
snags (greater than 15-inches in diameter) per acre averaged over up to 40 acres (Forest Plan 462) is required. Hazard trees will be felled regardless of the number of snags present. However,
snags not posing a hazard that do not meet merchantability specifications [as is the case for many
of the snags killed by fire (see Economics section of Chapter 3)], that contain blue stain (i.e.
ponderosa pine), or that are inaccessible by end-lining on steep slopes would be left standing
within the buffer at levels consistent with or exceeding Forest Plan guidelines. In addition,
considering this project only treats a narrow linear buffer along open roads, the rest of the 9095% (depending on alternative) of the NFS lands affected by wildfire in 2015 but not a part of
this project would retain well above 1.5 snags per acre. While variable, snag data collected in late
fall following the 2015 wildfires indicated an average of over 60 snags/acre (greater than 15inches dbh) in areas of mature forest that burned at moderate to high intensity. Similar conditions
can be assumed for moderate and high severity areas adjacent to the treatment buffers. See
Vegetation section of Chapter 3.

Comment: These areas were chosen by the FS as preferable to NSO and within critical habitat;
within a core area of a territory that has a history of nesting or a resident pair, and preferable
habitat conditions in at least 40% of the core area and 30% of the home range; or selected for
some reason in concert with the USFWS (not necessarily meeting the previous criteria).
Within the HVWCAs, in addition to NRF habitat, there is also PFF designated habitat: post fire
foraging habitat within 500 feet of currently suitable NRF habitat. Current science defines PFF
out to 1.5 km (Bond 2009) and the 500 feet figure is arbitrary and made up by the FS for this
project. It also permits more logging closer to the core area. This habitat was NRF habitat prior to
the fire and is considered important to foraging NSO. Impacts to PFF are deemed detrimental;
therefore degrading or removal of PFF is included in determinations for NSO territories. The
project will remove 221 acres of PFF. It appears the point of designating HVWCAs is somewhat
obviated by reducing the PFF to 500 feet from the core areas.
Hazard trees will be removed in these areas. Salvage logging will occur in all suitable NRF
habitat as well as PFF habitat outside of the HVWCAs."
Response: The 1.5 km figure in Bond (2009) is a recommendation to protect burned habitats
within 1.5 km of California spotted owl activity centers. The 500-foot figure in the analysis for
the proposed project is entirely different. It is an estimate of how far into burned areas a northern
spotted owl is most likely willing to fly from the edge of suitable nesting/roosting or foraging
habitats to forage in burned (post-fire foraging) areas. This distance is independent of the distance
from an NSO activity center. As a result, these habitats (PFF1 habitats) within High-Value
Wildlife Conservation Areas receive enhanced resource protection measures regardless of their
distance from an NSO activity center. This RPM is designed to reduce effects and still allow the
Purpose and Need to be met, not to eliminate any impacts in PFF or NRF habitats. The criteria for
determining High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas is in the "Methods for Designating HighValue Wildlife Conservation Areas" section of the BA (p. 32). In addition, some NSO core areas
that did not meet the definition of "high-value" were nonetheless considered as high-value at the
recommendation of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (none were removed from high-value status
as a result of these discussions).
Project activities may affect all types of NSO habitats, including PFF habitats. These effects are
described in detail in the "Effects to NSO Habitat" section of the BA (pp. 46-53). As stated by the
commenter, the determinations for effects include PFF habitat.

Comment: The FS came up with three criterion for finding a LAA determination for any
territory. No scientific literature is cited for these criterion and they appear to have come from the
Westside salvage sale on the Klamath NF that resulted in the permitted take of 103 owls. Each
criterion includes a certain percentage of habitat (NRF + PFF1) and if they fall below a certain
level, a LAA determination is made. The FS claims 7 of the 92 activity centers receive a LAA
determination. The DEIS states 8 will receive a LAA determination.
All Territories not determined to be LAA are determined to be MANLAA even those where
logging is permitted in the core areas and home ranges.
The arbitrary nature of the criteria and determinations is obvious. While an attempt has been
made to protect some owls and habitat, the DEIS concedes they were made to allow this salvage
logging project to proceed. In other words, these criterion and determinations are not based on the
best available scientific information, in violation of the ESA.
Furthermore, considering protocol surveys were not conducted anywhere in the project area
means the FS has no idea where NSO actually are, as well as where barred owls are. This brings
into question the entire effects analysis as well as the determinations for each AC."
Response: The determination criteria were developed in close coordination with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service based on the best available scientific information on NSO and NSO habitat use.
This includes the Revised NSO Recovery Plan (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2011) and other
scientific literature cited throughout the BA (including that in the "Species Status" section [pp.
20-22], and the "Spotted Owl Use of Burned Areas" section [pp. 26-29]). It also built upon the
methods developed by USFS and USFWS for a recent similar project on the Klamath National
Forest (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2016).The proposed project was designed to minimize
potential effects to NSO while allowing the project's Purpose and Need to be met. The analysis is
based on the best available scientific information, including the history of NSO activity
throughout the action area. Lack of current protocol NSO surveys in the majority of the project
area is properly disclosed and factored into the analysis of potential effects. The BA discloses that
seven territories received an LAA determination due to effects of the Proposed Action
Alternative, and one additional territory received an LAA determination due to our Proposed
Action Alternative plus the cumulative effects of other activities. Those figures have since been
revised in coordination with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the BA published with the
FEIS will include these revised figures.

Comment: Back in 2010, CC filed an NOI against the STNF for failing to keep an updated
Environmental Baseline; failing to keep track of owl take; and failure to produce monitoring
reports required in the LRMP. In response, the FS produced these reports and posted them on the
website. Since then, nothing has been posted since the 2009 report on the website to demonstrate
the STNF is keeping an updated EB; keeping track of owl take; and keeping track of owl
populations. Since the STNF refuses to conduct protocol surveys for NSO, it is impossible to
produce these reports with any level of certainly.
In this project surveys have not been conducted either although 92 NSO activity centers are
documented in the project. Simply producing a DEIS and determining likely to adverse effects to
owls and critical habitat, does not alleviate the STNF from its ESA responsibilities."
Response: The comment refers to several tasks in the analysis of project effects on ESA listed
species. Some of these tasks are the responsibility of the Forest Service, as the action agency, and
some of the tasks are the responsibility of the USFWS , as the regulatory agency. The
environmental baseline is a requirement of the jeopardy analysis and is generally maintained by
the regulatory agency, as in this case, with the help of the action agency. The USFWS maintains a
status database that provides USFWS biologists with an accounting of incidental take throughout
the range (including the Shasta-Trinity National Forest). This provides a thorough analysis of
569
50T

both owl take and known occupied and unoccupied owl activity centers, and informs the final
decision-making by the Forest Service decision-maker. Streamlined consultation allows the
USFWS to actively participate in the development of the project integrating these larger scale
concerns into the project design itself. The action agency develops a Biological Assessment (BA)
to analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the action on individual animals within
the project area and the critical habitat, and supplies this analysis to the regulatory agency. The
regulatory agency must formally accept the BA when they have determined that it provides all the
necessary information to complete consultation. The BA, in combination with the information
that the regulatory agency manages on the species, enables the regulatory agency to complete
their portion of the analysis and render a Biological Opinion.

Comment: "The FS has failed to conduct protocol surveys using the 2012 protocol. It attempts to
excuse this by claiming it is assuming occupancy in all owl activity centers and limits its analysis
of impacts to NSO to the activity centers. This approach fails for several reasons. The DEIS
concedes barred owls are in the project area and in some of the activity centers. Because of that,
there almost certainly are NSO living in suitable habitat outside activity centers. The reality is the
FS has no idea where owls are actually located. We encountered this very situation on the
neighboring Mendocino NF. NSO were found nesting outside activity centers likely due to the
presence of barred owls, as well as loss of suitable habitat in the activity center. Even the
proposed stand searches during project implementation are limited to core areas only and not
suitable NRF habitat. By not conducting protocol surveys, take of NSO will almost certainly
occur.
Table 7 shows the reproductive status of each activity center and most of the information is very
old going back to 1982. A few of the territories had surveys in 2015 but not many."
Response: There is no requirement under the ESA for protocol surveys to be conducted, and the
US Fish and Wildlife Service reiterated during the planning process for this project that a valid
effects analysis can be conducted without protocol survey results being available for the entire
action area. Because much of the project area has not been recently surveyed, the analysis in the
BA properly assumes that suitable habitats in these areas may be occupied by NSO. Potential
effects of barred owls on NSO are discussed in the BA (pp. 22, 33, 52-53 and 100). The potential
for barred owls to affect NSO responsiveness is a primary reason why protocol surveys, which
have been conducted for a portion of the project area, now consist of six site visits per year rather
than three. NSO in this area frequently move their activity centers. It is not possible to determine
why movement occurred in any given activity center, but known moves are documented in the
available survey results, and the analysis does not assume that suitable habitat outside known
activity centers is unoccupied. The potential for other activity centers to move due to barred owls,
wildfire, or other causes is information that is obviously not available where protocol surveys
have not been conducted recently. However, Table 5 in the wildlife BA summarizes effects to
suitable habitats in the entire action area, including the areas outside of known NSO territories,
and "take" of NSO across the entire action area will be determined by the US Fish and Wildlife
Service in their Biological Opinion for this project. The stand searches in cores within LOP
exemption areas will reduce the likelihood of "take" of NSO. However, the determination for
these territories in the BA is still "may affect, likely to adversely affect" to acknowledge the
potential for disturbance to NSO in these territories despite the stand searches.

Comment: "In 24% of the project area, an LOP is proposed from Feb. 1 through September 15 to
restrict activities directly impacting suitable NRF habitat, and a Feb. 1 - July 10 LOP in 38% of
the project area to restrict activities causing loud and continuous noise disturbance or smoke
within 0.25 miles of suitable NRF habitat. These LOPs can be lifted by the FS for various
reasons. In 38% of the project there are no wildlife LOPs at all (p. 29 DEIS). In addition,
50T

Final Environmental Impact Statement

fledgling owls disperse September to November so the July 10 LOP is not protective enough and
should be extended to Sept. 15 at a minimum. Considering the project is entirely in suitable owl
habitat these LOPs should be throughout the entire project, mandatory, and should not be lifted
because the FS has not conducted protocol surveys for NSO as mentioned previously.
Despite the LOPs, the DEIS admits, ""exemptions to the LOPs may not prevent disturbance to
direct effects to NSO that would affect their ability to nest and rear young successfully (3 NSO
territories)"". In 4 NSO territories the ""RPMs do not reduce effects to the point they are
insignificant or discountable."" In other words, the LOPs don't go far enough to actually protect
NSO and their habitat from harm.
In addition, the LOPs were developed to allow for prompt implementation of the project and the
""urgent"" need to improve safety. Considering the fires burned almost 2 years ago, and it will be
closer to 3 years if this project is implemented, there is no longer an urgent need and the LOPs
should be strengthened. The BA confirms LOPs will be implemented to protect NSO in the
breeding season in certain areas and ""while this method differs from more conventionally
conservative use of LOPs, it was constructed to reflect the specific needs of this project."" The
needs of the project should be secondary to the needs of a threatened species and its critical
habitat."
Response: The NSO LOP's for this project were developed in close coordination with the US
Fish and Wildlife Service to minimize potential effects to NSO while also allowing for the
project's Purpose and Need to be met. Resource protection measures were adopted to limit
potential disturbance to nesting NSO (DEIS p. 28), and only treatment areas where less than 10%
of the lands within 0.25 mi are preferable to NSO are exempted from LOP's (BA p. 10). Potential
disturbance effects to NSO are disclosed and analyzed in the BA, and the great majority of NSO
territories are not adversely affected by disturbance. In addition, High-Value Wildlife
Conservation Areas were established to give extra protection to the areas with the greatest
potential to support NSO populations. These areas receive enhanced resource protection measures
regardless of their distance from an NSO activity center. The project LOP's can only be lifted for
a given area if protocol surveys are conducted and non-nesting is determined. In the event that
protocol surveys are completed for a portion of the project area, LOP's will be imposed within
0.25 mi. of nesting sites, as per the NSO survey protocol. We do not anticipate having the
resources to conduct protocol NSO surveys throughout the project area, and LOP's will likely
only be lifted where proposed treatments overlap with ongoing NSO surveys (e.g. the Gemmill
and Burnt Ranch NSO survey areas).The need to improve safety by abating existing hazards is
still urgent, despite the delays that have occurred.

Comment: “The Environmental Baseline is defined as: ""past and present impacts of all Federal,
State, or private actions and other human activities in an action area, the anticipated impacts of all
proposed Federal projects in an action area that have already undergone formal or early section 7
consultation, and the impact of State or private actions which are contemporaneous with the
consultation in process"" (50 CFR 402.02). The key purpose of the environmental baseline is to
describe the natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the status and condition of ESA-listed
species and designated critical habitat in the action area.
The FS appears to consider the chart of each owl territory impacts with an effects determination
and what the project proposes to do in each territory as equivalent to the environmental baseline.
This is not correct. The EB is much broader than that covering past and present impacts of ALL
federal, state or private actions in the action area, not just the activity center, as defined above.

each of the 3 subunits. It should also include the take authorized in the Westside Salvage Sale on

Response: All aspects of the environmental baseline, as defined in 50 CFR 402.02, are described
and analyzed in the BA as required under the ESA. The effects of all past activities are
encompassed in the assessment of current conditions. The effects of "present impacts of all
Federal, State, or private actions and other human activities in an action area, the anticipated
impacts of all proposed Federal projects in an action area that have already undergone formal or
early section 7 consultation, and the impact of State or private actions which are

analysis when they are within the same action area (1.3 miles around the treatment areas). The
BA addresses both the effects within individual NSO territories and across the project action area

critical habitat units and determines "take" of NSO in their biological opinion (BO), which will be

Comment: "The BA states one of the purposes of the RPMs is to achieve RRP consistency, but as
the DEIS has shown this won't happen. The RMPs aren't strong enough and harm to owls and
critical habitat will occur.
The BA includes the RRP recommendation that agencies conserve NSO sites with a high
likelihood to contribute to the demographic support of NSO populations. RA 10 & RA 32
recommend conserving occupied spotted owl sites and retaining structurally complex or highquality habitat to provide demographic support and to provide refugia from competition with
barred owls. The RA 10 recommendation provides interim guidance to prioritize known and
historic sites for conservation and/or maintenance of habitat.
The DEIS claims it is following the RRP but we have clearly shown in these comments that is not
true. The FS didn't conduct protocol surveys for either NSO or Barred owls, but considers the
project area occupied. It then looked at 92 NSO activity centers and proposes to log every single
one of them, making determinations of LAA and MANLAA for each one. Some of the activity
centers that currently meet RA 10 recommendations will be downgraded to the point of a LAA
determination. This is not following the "intent" of the RRP. If RA10 was being followed, there
would be no treatment in high value habitats qualifying as RA 10 pre project. In fact, the FS is
doing the opposite and therefore is in violation of both the RRP and the STNF LRMP that
incorporates the RRP into its LRMP."
Response: This project was designed in close coordination with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service, the agency of expertise for recovery of threatened and endangered species, to minimize
potential effects to NSO while achieving the project's Purpose and Need. Special emphasis is
placed on protecting the functions of high-value habitats, consistent with the RRP, including
Recovery Actions 10 and 32. Recovery Action 32 specifically addresses the value of addressing
threats such as fire and insects through restoration management actions. Appendix 1 of the BA
documents consistency with the Recovery Plan, including Recovery Actions 10 and 32 (BA pp.
94-96). No nesting/roosting or foraging habitat will be downgraded in any part of the project area.
The restrictions recommended by the commenter are not necessary to achieve consistency with

Comment: The RRP also states core areas should be comprised of at least 50% NRF habitat
(about 250 acres) and the total acres within the core area and home range should be at least 40%
NRF habitat (or about 1,360 acres) (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). These are threshold
levels of habitat to support NSO survival and reproduction, as reported in the scientific literature.
The table that includes each of the 92 ACs shows the majority of them are already below
minimum habitat thresholds, yet this project will log even more habitat from each of them.
Response: This project was designed to minimize potential effects to NSO while allowing the
project's Purpose and Need to be met. The Shasta-Trinity National Forest worked closely with the
US Fish and Wildlife Service to design the RPMs. Potential effects to NSO are disclosed and
analyzed in the wildlife biological assessment.

Comment: “The NEPA analysis is fatally flawed because the FS didn't analyze a sufficient area
for cumulative effects. It eliminated 136,000 acres in the 144,000 fire perimeter despite the fact
the 8,000 acres being treated is spread throughout the entire 144,000 acres. Instead, it limited the
cumulative effects to the roadside corridors proposed for treatment. That is not a cumulative
effects analysis when the reality is the FS is only looking at project impacts.”
Response: Each resource area defined the appropriate cumulative effects spatial and temporal
boundary based on the direct and indirect effects from the activities proposed. The statement
about a cumulative effects boundary that is just the treatment area does not specify which
resource area is being referenced. The FEIS will clarify the cumulative effects boundaries used
for each resource area.

actions when added to projected post-fire timber harvest on private lands." Yet private lands were
not included in the CEA.

Comment: “NEPA: According to the DEIS, the cumulative effects analysis area includes any
area within 1.3 miles of a treatment area (the radius of a typical NSO territory. A time frame of 35
years is used for cumulative effects analysis. The analysis area is not large enough to actually
determine cumulative effects, and while 35 years may address life spans of owls it is not long
enough to address long term impacts to habitat.
The DEIS mentions grazing and plantation thinning as having no effect to NSO territories and
lists the names of 6 projects claiming no effect to NSO territories.
The DEIS also lists 6 additional projects and includes Table 3-29 which is supposed to be the
NEPA foreseeable cumulative effects to NSO from Alt. 1. The table includes only 19 owl
territories. Acreage is not included in all of the territories in the table.
Marijuana cultivation is not analyzed at all despite there being many grow operations on the
Trinity Forest. Rat poisoning used in grow operations has killed NSO and fisher.
In addition, the BA states outright 3,000 acres of private land burned and logged and will not be
considered in this analysis.
The public is left with the impression that there are few impacts occurring to NSO territories in
the area."

Response: The cumulative effects analysis area includes any area within 1.3 miles of a treatment
area. That is the radius of a typical NSO territory in this area, and is thus used to define the NSO
action area for potential effects of this project to NSO. This parameter was established by the
Yreka Office of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency of expertise on NSO.
Temporal bounding for this analysis is both short term and long term. The short-term bounding is
the time during project implementation because it is tied directly to the potential for noise
disturbance and immediate habitat alteration. The estimated timeline for hazard tree abatement,
fuel loading reduction, wood product removal and planting implementation is up to 5 years, and
maintenance actions may occur up to 20 years into the future.
Long-term bounding is determined by several factors. First, we looked at the habitat elements for
NSO and determined that snag density and down logs were the elements that would be affected
by the project for greatest amount of time. Then, we determined that the effects of this project on
snags and down logs would not be meaningful approximately 40 years after implementation (60
years post-fire). In current NSO nesting/roosting, foraging and dispersal habitats, the reduction in
snag numbers due to this project will be counteracted within 60 years through ongoing mortality,
including additional tree mortality from the effects of the 2015 fires. This tree mortality is also
expected to provide a high density of down logs in these habitats. This bounding is used to fully
account for any type of impacts although it exaggerates the reduction of snags and down logs due
to the narrow treatment area along open roads. Note that even in the short-term, adequate
numbers snags and down logs will be retained across the landscape.
In post-fire foraging (PFF) habitats, temporal bounding reflects effects of proposed activities to
snags compared to the natural decline in snag presence. In Idaho the half-life of snags in post-fire
areas where salvage logging did not occur was 9-10 years for ponderosa pine, and 15-16 years for
Douglas-fir (Russell et al. 2006). Using these estimates, if no action is taken, less than 10% of the
Douglas-fir snags will still be standing 60 years after the fires, and less than 2% of the ponderosa
pines will still be standing. The difference in habitat functionality of snags for NSO in PFF
habitats between the proposed activities and the no-action alternative is therefore not likely to be
meaningful at that point in time. In addition, there is considerable doubt as to the length of time
these habitats will be used by NSO into the future, and NSO use may well decline significantly or
discontinue in that time frame regardless of treatments. Down log density in these habitats is
expected to be high in either case due to significant additional tree mortality in the future from the
effects of the 2015 fires. As a result of these factors, a time scale of approximately 40 years
beyond implementation (60 years post-fire) is be used to bound the NSO cumulative effects
analysis.
The 35-year analysis period mentioned by the commenter was an error and will be corrected. The
cumulative effects bounding in the wildlife reports will be corrected to reflect this bounding.
The wildlife analysis discloses the rationale for determining which activities may cause
cumulative effects to NSO. For projects included in the cumulative effects analysis that treat
plantations, we assessed the conditions of those plantations to determine whether they include
suitable NSO habitat. Site visits were conducted to assess conditions in the oldest and most
developed plantations. These visits determined that NSO habitat was not present due to the
relatively young age of these plantations and the slow growth rate in this area. Grazing will affect
forbs and grasses, but is not expected to affect components of NSO habitats in any way that
would affect the suitability of these habitats to support NSO populations. The potential for
disturbance to NSO to result from these activities will be assessed when the cumulative effects
analysis is revised for the FEIS to incorporate new information now available.
Table 8 in the BA assesses cumulative effects from the Preferred Alternative to NSO under ESA.
Other wildlife reports assess cumulative effects under NEPA. Updated information on foreseeable
activities will be added to the wildlife analysis, and the analysis of cumulative effects in the BA
as well as other wildlife reports and the EIS will all be revised (including EIS Table 3-29) and the
FEIS will reflect this new information. These reports will also be reviewed to ensure consistency

and completeness. The BA explains the methodology used to estimate which private lands were
likely to be harvested post-fire, and which were not. Because spatial data for post-fire harvesting
is now available, this information will be used to revise the cumulative effects analysis and that
analysis will be included in the FEIS.
NSO's are likely to be affected to some extent by direct effects to habitat from illegal marijuana
growing, and bioaccumulation of rodenticides. Regarding direct effects to habitat, habitat
mapping reflects the best available scientific information regarding current conditions. However,
marijuana cultivation on NFS lands is an illegal activity and conducted in secret, so the Forest is
not able to identify the location of these activities in a way that is sufficient to quantify effects to
individual NSO territories. In Trinity County, cultivation on NFS lands is typically small in scale,
and affects the understory rather than the overstory (to avoid aerial detection). Impacts of
cultivation on NSO habitat are thus much more limited than would be the case if the overstory
was being removed. Actions on private lands related to marijuana cultivation are either included
in a THP or THP exemption that will be updated in the FEIS, or are illegal and cannot be spatially
quantified. Regarding rodenticides, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW,
2016) addressed potential effects on NSO from bioaccumulation of rodenticides. Although these
compounds have been recorded in a small number of NSO's in California, there is little data
available on their impacts on this species. Studies on other raptors indicate lethal and sublethal
impacts of anticoagulant rodenticides exposure, and raptors comprise two-thirds of the
anticoagulant-related wildlife mortalities documented by CDFW. CDFW concluded that it is
likely that rodenticides pose a "serious and widespread" threat to NSO's. "The extent of exposure
to Northern Spotted Owls and impacts on overall owl fitness (e.g., survival and fecundity)
remains unknown and is in need of further research." Impacts of rodenticides are thus potentially
serious, but impacts to individual NSO's in the analysis area for this project are impossible to
quantify. However, the proposed activities do not include use of rodenticides, and there is no
basis on which to conclude that the proposed activities would have any effect on bioaccumulation
of rodenticides in NSO's.

Comment: “The STNF never takes the ""hard look"" required by NEPA when it comes to CEA even when it has the information needed to conduct such an analysis. In this DEIS, the Economic
Analysis sheds light on cumulative impacts as well as the Environmental Baseline for the NSO.
Under Economic Consequences, the proposed action, Alternative 1 includes a cumulative effects
section. Alternative 1 projects to log approximately 11.36 MMBF of publically owned wood. The
project area is 8,000 acres. It further states that past, present and future actions add up to
approximately 42,300 acres for a total of 851 MMBF will be cut by 2020. If you remove the past
actions, the DEIS states the sum of present and future actions is roughly 19,300 acres for a total
of 388 MMBF logged and processed up to 2020.
There are roughly 2 million acres in Trinity County with 18,230 acres logged by private timber
industry and 4,765 acres logged from the STNF since 2005. Within the last 10 years there has
been 23,000 acres in past actions and approximately 462 MMBF (private & FS).
The FS has 4 thinning projects and multiple deck sales for a total of 2,372 additional acres.
Foreseeable future actions include 12,415 acres proposed on private timber lands since 2005, but
not yet logged. The STNF in addition to this project has 189 acres of hazard trees near power
lines and 2 thinning projects for 1,200 acres. The sum of both private and FS future actions is
about 14,500 acres. This equates to 292 MMBF within the next 5 years (2020).
This information was not included in the cumulative effects analysis for the NSO under either the
ESA or NEPA cumulative effects analysis."”
Response: The Forest has appropriately taken a hard look at cumulative effects. However, it is
important to note that each resource identifies a cumulative effect analysis area that is appropriate
for their resource. For economics, Trinity County was used as an appropriate bounding area, as it

incorporates the economies of the local communities. The biological assessment and wildlife
analysis for the northern spotted owl looks at a cumulative effects bounding area of the action
area (1.3 miles from all treatment units). This would incorporate different activities (some
overlap, some outside of Trinity County, some of the harvest activities elsewhere in Trinity
County would fall outside of the spotted owl action area) analyzed for cumulative effects. It is
incorrect to associate all the impacts together, as each cumulative effects analysis focuses on the
area appropriate for the resource. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, in partnership with the
Forest Service, has updated the current habitat conditions for the northern spotted owl to include
changes to habitat due to wildfire, timber harvest, road construction, etc., on both private and
federal lands. Changes to habitat are documented based on area impacted, prescription utilized,
residual stand characteristics, etc. Volume removed is not a metric that is utilized to assess
changes to habitat conditions as both stand characteristics and removal methods are highly
variable and is not the same as the area proposed for treatment in this project. The figures
supplied in the comment applying to Economics in all of Trinity County are relevant to
economics. Projects and timber sales on both private and federal lands relevant to the northern
spotted owl (i.e. within the action area) have been correctly incorporated into the analysis. In
addition, the analysis has been updated in the FEIS as appropriate to include new actions
occurring on private lands since the original analysis in the DEIS.

Comment: The latest demography study by Dugger, (Dugger et al., 2016), shows a decline of
NSO in N CA of 32-55%. It's important to note the Trinity side of the STNF in Trinity County is
almost all designated critical habitat for the NSO under the 2012 Rule.
Response: Much of the west (Trinity) side of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest is indeed
designated as NSO critical habitat, and effects to critical habitat are analyzed and disclosed in the
biological assessment. The project was designed in close coordination with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service to minimize these potential effects while still meeting the project's Purpose and
Need.

Comment: The ESA cumulative effects analysis is also incomplete. Table 8: ESA Cumulative
Effects Determinations for Individual NSO Territories only includes 39 of the 92 territories. The
BA states those territories not included have no non-federal activities projected to occur within
the territory. But there has been non-federal activities in the action area as a whole and that is why
a cumulative effects analysis is required - not simply an activity center analysis. It also assumes
60 years beyond implementation for the overstory to begin to recover. How 60 years can provide
suitable owl habitat is not explained. Sixty year old stands don't even qualify for pre-thinning of
plantations. (35 years is used under the NEPA analysis - no explanation is provided for the
different time frames).
The BA also states that information requests to timber industry representatives have not been
answered. The FS has had almost 2 years to obtain this information, but regardless that is no
excuse. The BA concedes the FS is aware of logging on private lands so it assumes level of
impacts using the RAVG model that is 40% inaccurate."
Response: The 35-year value that was reported for the cumulative effects temporal bounding was
an error. The wildlife reports will be updated to address cumulative effects outside known NSO
territories, the discrepancy in temporal bounding figures, and new information that has become
available since the analysis was completed and published. The Forest has obtained updated
information about actions being proposed and implemented on private lands and this information
will be incorporated into the analysis.
Temporal bounding for the analysis in the BA is both short term and long term. The short-term
bounding is the time during project implementation because it is tied directly to the potential for
noise disturbance and immediate habitat alteration. The estimated timeline for hazard tree

abatement, fuel loading reduction, wood product removal and planting implementation is up to 5
years, and maintenance actions may occur up to 20 years into the future. Long-term bounding is
determined by several factors. First, we looked at the habitat elements for NSO and determined
that snag density and down logs were the elements that would be affected by the project for
greatest amount of time. Then, we determined that the effects of this project on snags and down
logs would not be meaningful approximately 40 years after implementation (60 years post-fire).
In current NSO nesting/roosting, foraging and dispersal habitats, the reduction in snag numbers
due to this project will be counteracted within 60 years through ongoing mortality, including
additional tree mortality from the effects of the 2015 fires. This tree mortality is also expected to
provide a high density of down logs in these habitats. This bounding is used to fully account for
any type of impacts although it exaggerates the reduction of snags and down logs due to the
narrow treatment area along open roads. Note that even in the short-term, adequate numbers
snags and down logs will be retained across the landscape. In post-fire foraging (PFF) habitats,
temporal bounding reflects effects of proposed activities to snags compared to the natural decline
in snag presence. In Idaho the half-life of snags in post-fire areas where salvage logging did not
occur was 9-10 years for ponderosa pine, and 15-16 years for Douglas-fir (Russell et al. 2006).
Using these estimates, if no action is taken, less than 10% of the Douglas-fir snags will still be
standing 60 years after the fires, and less than 2% of the ponderosa pines will still be standing.
The difference in habitat functionality of snags for NSO in PFF habitats between the proposed
activities and the no-action alternative is therefore not likely to be meaningful at that point in
time. In addition, there is considerable doubt as to the length of time these habitats will be used
by NSO into the future, and NSO use may well decline significantly or discontinue in that time
frame regardless of treatments. Down log density in these habitats is expected to be high in either
case due to significant additional tree mortality in the future from the effects of the 2015 fires. As
a result of these factors, a time scale of approximately 40 years beyond implementation (60 years
post-fire) is be used to bound the cumulative effects analysis.

Comment: The BA includes some recent papers (published literature) by a variety of scientists
regarding NSO use in burned forest. Then it proceeds to discount each and every one of them
claiming there isn't enough information in which to make decisions; a level of uncertainty; and
disagreement. Instead, it is relying on FS "professional" opinion. To the best of our knowledge,
the STNF does not have any expert NSO scientists on its staff. The BA also mentions the Manley
declaration, of which much of the BA was taken. This is a declaration that was written for a
lawsuit - it is not a peer-reviewed scientific paper. Pat Manley is a biologist in the RO. She has a
PhD but is not an expert NSO biologist. Rather than develop a project using the best available
scientific information on NSO use in burned forest, and taking a cautionary approach, the STNF
decided to make it up as they go. The ESA requires a higher bar. The only issue the BA concedes
is that owls use burned forest for foraging and that post fire management activities may have
additional negative effects. Then the project proposes to test these negative effects by salvage
logging suitable owl habitat and removal of PFF habit.
Response: The analysis in the BA is based on a thorough review of the scientific literature on the
use of burned areas by spotted owls (California and Mexican spotted owls as well as Northern
spotted owls), and incorporates the recent synthesis of this literature prepared by the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, the agency of expertise for recovery of threatened and endangered species. It
also makes use of a similar synthesis prepared by Dr. Pat Manley, a Supervisory Biological
Scientist with the US Forest Service. These syntheses, and the analysis in the BA, do not discount
the available research. They instead compare research results and recommendations to identify
their similarities and contrasts, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Based on this
assessment of the best available science, the Forest worked closely with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service to minimize potential effects to NSO while still achieving the project's Purpose and Need.

Comment: "Other scientists agree that wildfires are becoming more and more threatening and
severe, thus requiring action. But, due to the ineffectiveness of how fire managers are reducing
fuels in such ecosystems, just how that action becomes implemented is called into question
(LaHayne 2005).
The consensus seems to orbit around the theme that prudent management objectives are essential.
However, simply just saying that fire hazards need to be reduced and prescribed fire or salvage
logging are ways to achieve these objectives is not meeting the intentions outlined in numerous
studies and through empirical data. (Fire Science Brief - attached)."
Response: Each alternative is designed to meet the Purpose and Need. The purpose of this project
is to mitigate hazards that threaten public safety along open national forest system, county, and
state roads, sustain and establish forest cover, and capture economic value and support the
economics of local communities by providing forest products (DEIS, pg. 4). This project is not
designed to address how wildfires occur across the landscape but, over time, is expected to
influence how wildfires might impact the roads being treated in this project. LaHayne 2005 "The
Spotted Owl in Southern California: Ecology and Special Concerns for Maintaining a ForestDwelling Species in a Human-Dominated Desert Landscape" is specifically talking about changes
in fire regimes and using landscape fuels treatments to mitigate stand replacement fires and the
difficulty of treatments with public concern over air quality, safety, and liability. This project is
not designed as a landscape-scale project to restore historic fire regimes. Rather it is limited in
scope to meet the Purpose and Need-- while the treatments will trend the treated area closer to
historic fuels conditions, the project alternatives are designed primarily to meet the need of
reducing hazards along public roads in the burned area. Within our project area the fire regimes
haven't changed, and the proposed treatment size and locations are limited in scope to meet the
Purpose and Need.
The Paper, Fire Science Brief: "Burned Landscapes of Southwestern Oregon: What's In It for
Northern Spotted Owls?" suggests that outside of large-scale stand-replacing events, wildfire is
not likely a major threat to the persistence of spotted owls in this forest type—even though there
are numerous negative short term impacts. Results indicate that low-severity prescribed fire may
be used to help reduce fire hazard in dry forest ecosystems occupied by spotted owls. This paper
provides the first concrete guidelines for fuels reduction in spotted owl territories in southwestern
Oregon. The project is treating approximately 5% of the fire area along system roads for safety.
Low severity prescribed fire is outside the scope of our project. Our treatments are linear
treatments to reduce hazard trees and fuel loadings along open roads. It may be possible to
incorporate the treated area from this project into a future project within the fire area to
reintroduce low severity prescribed fire for NSO benefit.

Comment: "The BA states research indicates a higher density of barred owls than previously
suspected and barred owls have been documented at numerous sites in the action area, including
observation within proposed treatment units. The FS assumes the presence of barred owls and the
impacts to NSO habitat will not cause further intrusion by barred owls. They provide nothing to
back up the statement. RA-10 in the RRP was developed to protect suitable owl habitat for NSO
use when barred owls are present. Table 8 lists whether each territory qualifies currently as high
value habitat (RA-10). Of the 40 listed 23 don't qualify yet all will be logged to some degree.
Sixteen qualify currently as RA-10 and they too will all have logging, some to the point of a LAA
determination. The BA doesn't state if the other 60 ACs are currently RA-10 compliant so we will
assume they aren't. The project is not meeting RA-10 as defined in the RRP.
The BA lists three common species that prey on NSO and then state predation is not considered a
serious threat to spotted owl populations. There is no discussion of the potential for increased
predation due to the impacts of logging."

Response: The significant threat that barred owls pose to NSOs is well documented in the BA.
The BA does not state that "the presence of barred owls and the impacts to NSO habitat will not
cause further intrusion by barred owls". It instead states that "there is no basis on which to
conclude that proposed activities will confer a significant competitive advantage to barred owls
over NSOs." This is based on the best available science on the effects of barred owls on NSO
(USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2011 and others), and on the analysis on pp. 52-53 of the BA:
The proposed project is consistent with the NSO Revised Recovery Plan (USDI Fish and Wildlife
Service 2011), as detailed in Appendix 1 of the BA (pp. 95-96). It is unclear what information the
commenter is referring to regarding RA-10 consistency. Table 8 does not address this issue. Table
7 includes this information, but all 92 territories are included, with 52 designated as high-value
(RA-10) and 40 not designated as such. The rationale for each of these determinations is included
in Table 7."NSO habitat is well-distributed in the project area, and no NSO nesting/roosting,
foraging or dispersal habitats will be downgraded as a result of project activities. Only PFF areas
will be removed. The benefits of PFF areas to NSO, especially long-term benefits, are highly
uncertain. These areas are also much more limited in extent within treatment units than are
nesting/roosting, foraging or dispersal habitats. As a result, competitive or negative interactions
between barred owls and spotted owls are unlikely to significantly increase as a result of
implementing the proposed treatments, and there is no basis on which to conclude that proposed
activities will confer a significant competitive advantage to barred owls over NSOs In the longterm, treatments will benefit NSOs in relation to barred owls because the proposed treatments are
intended to accelerate the re-establishment of late-seral forest habitats highly suitable to NSOs
(Projects Wildlife BA p.55 & 87) and reduce fuels accumulations that would put high quality
NSO habitat at risk during another high severity wildfire.
The conclusion that predation does not pose a significant threat to NSOs is supported by the
barred owl analysis in the NSO Revised Recovery Plan (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2011).
"The BA on page 22 states the following related to predation: "Known predators of spotted owls
are limited to great horned owls (Forsman et al. 1984) and possibly barred owls (Wiens 2012,
Leskiw and Gutiérrez 1998). Hybridization between spotted owls and barred owls is also known
to occur (Kelly and Forsman 2004). Other suspected predators include northern goshawks, redtailed hawks, and other raptors (Courtney et al. 2004). Other sources of spotted owl mortality
include mammalian predation, starvation, and accidents (Forsman et al. 1984; Forsman et al.
2002). Mortality of juvenile spotted owls during dispersal is a major cause of poor recruitment
and declining population trends, and is assumed to be heightened by very open areas, including
some recently logged forest areas. These forest types support great horned owls. This species, and
the northern goshawk and red-tailed hawk, are all common throughout the South Fork and Trinity
River Management Units, and all are potential predators of spotted owls. Protocol surveys for
barred owls have not been conducted in the action area, but this species has been documented in
and near treatment units. Occasional predation of spotted owls by these raptors is not considered
to be a serious threat to spotted owl populations (USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2011)."

Comment: "The DEIS states the 2001 Roadless Rule permits removal of timber from roadless
areas when at least one of two circumstances exist. The first regards cutting small diameter trees
to improve TES habitat, or to maintain or restore characteristics of ecosystem composition and
structure, such as reducing the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects, within the range of
variability expected under natural disturbance regimes of the current climatic period. The second
is cutting of timber is incidental to the implementation of a management activity not otherwise
prohibited by the subpart. One example is the removal of hazard trees adjacent to classified roads
for public health and safety reasons, fire line construction for wildland fire suppression.
Which exception is the FS relying on to enter the proposed six roadless areas? The FS isn't
cutting small diameter trees to improve TES habitat. All of the roads are class 2 that are not open
to passenger level vehicles. And part of the natural characteristic of roadless areas is wildland

fire. The FS should not be suppressing fire in roadless areas and natural processes should be
allowed to occur as in wilderness areas. While the FS may be able to remove some trees under
certain circumstances in roadless areas, we don't believe the case has been made to do so in this
project. Furthermore, the DEIS and IRA Report simply claim roadless characteristics will not be
impaired with nothing to support such an assertion. While roads should not be in roadless areas,
the project if implemented will likely result in further intrusions by off road motorized vehicles.
View sheds will be altered and species that rely on early seral habitat will be affected.
The FS has not taken the requisite ""hard look"" required under NEPA for entering the six
inventoried roadless areas. Roadless areas serve as biological strongholds and refuges for many
species. Roadless areas support a diversity of aquatic habitats and communities providing or
affecting habitat for more than 280 TES species. The LRMP also states IRAs will be used as
habitat for TES species. Considering the significant impacts to NSO and critical habitat, the
project could have at least stayed out of the IRAs, instead it proposes to log 226 acres."
Response: The Forest values roadless characteristics on federal lands and aims to protect,
maintain, and improve those characteristics. The purpose of this project is to mitigate hazards (i.e.
fire-killed or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open roads;
sustain and establish forest cover; and capture economic value and support the economies of local
communities by providing forest products. In order to achieve that goal, the Forest designed the
proposed action for this project specifically to address safety and future fuel loading issues and to
minimize impacts to roadless characteristics. Additionally, Alternative 5 was developed, in part,
to address concerns regarding logging activities within the inventoried roadless areas (IRAs). The
DEIS outlines two of the exemptions that are allowed for forest management activities within
IRAs. Both will be utilized for this project. The exemption for the removal of hazard trees and
fireline construction is described in 36 CFR 294.13(b)(2) (2001). This exemption will be applied
in all treatment areas to fell hazard trees of any size and if needed to create adequate control
features for prescribed fire activities. The exemption for the removal of ladder fuels and other
small diameter material to reduce the risk of uncharacteristic wildfire effects is described in 36
CFR 294.13(b)(1)(ii) (2001). This exemption will be applied to remove small diameter material
in order to meet fuels reduction objectives. For Alternatives 1 and 4 only dead trees would be cut
and for Alternatives 2 and 3 trees that had 60% or greater risk of mortality or were already dead
could be felled.
The commenter's statement that Maintenance Level 2 ('class 2') Roads are not open to passenger
cars is incorrect. While these roads are typically not suitable for passenger cars, passenger cars
are not prohibited from these roads and such cars often do use Maintenance Level 2 roads.
Management of IRAs is guided by the 2001 Roadless Rule which describes nine values that often
characterize IRAs. These were used as the basis for the IRA effects analysis. Each of the values
was considered for each of the IRAs independently and together to determine the impact of
proposed activities on roadless characteristics. The type and extent of activities proposed for each
Alternative within each IRA were identified. These activities were then assessed for their impact
to each roadless area individually and collectively. The comment specifically identifies the
following concerns: impacts to viewsheds, early seral habitat, and off-highway (OHV) vehicle
intrusions. Impacts to the viewsheds are assessed in the primitive, semi-primitive non-motorized
and semi-primitive motorized classes of dispersed recreation; and natural appearing landscapes
with high scenic quality sections of the IRA analysis (DEIS pgs. 330-332). A majority of the
proposed treatment areas have a visual quality objective of modification which allows for
evidence of management on the landscape.
Early seral habitat is not one of the nine characteristics of inventoried roadless areas. The IRA
effects analysis did consider threatened, endangered, and sensitive species that may be impacted
by treatments. Some of these species may be associated with early seral habitat, however it is not
anticipated that the project would have negative effects on these species (DEIS, pg. 329).
Additionally the IRA analysis considered the diversity of plant and animal communities within
50T

50T

580

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

IRAs (DEIS, pg. 328). The focus of this analysis was on the introduction of noxious weeds into
the post-fire and post-treatment environment. A general estimate of early seral habitat created
from the 2015 fires is described in the vegetation existing condition narrative (DEIS, pg. 77).
Approximately 33,920 acres burned at high to moderate severity resulting in at least 25% canopy
mortality. Only 11,000 acres of that deforested area would be planted as a result of this project
and the 2015 Fire Reforestation Project (DEIS, pg. 86). This will leave over 22,000 acres of
newly created early seral habitat on the landscape. After fires, OHV trespass is often concentrated
around dozer lines and other areas that had been cleared during fire suppression efforts. OHV
trespass through roadside forest management treatments into adjacent general forest or protected
areas has not been a significant issue on the Shasta-Trinity (E-Mail from Lisa Walker, OHV
Coordinator 5/12/2017). It is not anticipated that the proposed treatments will increase OHV
intrusions above existing background levels. Finally, note that the 226 acres of treatment
proposed in the preferred alternative represents less than 0.5% of the total area (84,934) of the
IRAs impacted by the 2015 fires and is located along areas that are already fragmented and
disturbed due to the existing road system.

Comment: The project includes LOPs for northern goshawk and bald eagles but they are also
arbitrary and can be lifted so there is no assurance these species will actually be protected. The
DEIS also states these LOPs will be for ""known sites"" and no surveys have been conducted for
either species. In fact, the DEIS is silent on when the last surveys were even conducted.
Furthermore, the DEIS states if bald eagle and peregrine falcon management plans have been
written for specific nesting sites, the provisions of the plans will be incorporated into the project
design. The FS needs to disclose this information to the public for review and comment. If there
are species specific management plans they should have been included in the Appendix of the
DEIS. The public can't know what the FS intends to do or if the management plans are being
implemented correctly without the ability to review them. The STNF has taken the position that is
does not have to survey for species if it assume occupancy. This is simply not true. The FS
Manual and NFMA both have requirements that must be met for sensitive species, as we have
repeatedly stated. The STNF has not demonstrated it has met these responsibilities.
For northern goshawks surveys have not been conducted."
Response: The intent of the language in these RPMs is to state that LOPs cannot be lifted unless
protocol surveys are completed and nesting is not detected. There is one known bald eagle
territory in the project area. The protective buffer in this plan is described on page 26 of the BE
and incorporated into the project design as a limited operating period to protect this territory.
There are no known peregrine falcon nest sites that would be affected by project activities. To
assess impacts to Forest Service Sensitive species, the Forest Plan (p. 4-5) requires "survey and
evaluation of habitat for TE&S species at the project level …" [emphasis added] and does not
require the direct survey of Sensitive species (individuals as opposed to their habitat) as a class.
Known information (including surveys where available and/or appropriate) is disclosed and
analyzed in the Botanical and Wildlife Biological Evaluations. Where suitable habitat exists for a
particular Forest Service Sensitive species, occupation was assumed, impacts from the proposed
project were analyzed, and the appropriate conservation measures were applied. Therefore the
Forest has made a concerted effort to conserve and protect Forest Service Sensitive Species so as
not to contribute to future listing.

Comment: In addition, while private lands were not considered in the analysis for NSO, they are
considered suitable habitat for goshawk. This discrepancy is not explained.”
Response: NSO habitat suitability is mapped for all private lands within the NSO action area, and
considered in the analysis of current habitat conditions and potential effects for the alternatives
(Please see the BA and Wildlife Specialist Report). Because data on habitat conditions for
northern goshawks are not available for private lands, all private lands within the goshawk
analysis area are considered potentially suitable (to err on the side of caution) (Please see the BE).

Comment: "Approximately 3.7% of this area (13,962 acres) could be directly impacted by the
project for goshawks. The BE mentions LOPs and RPMs both of which can be lifted. This is the
same management we have seen in virtually every timber sale on the STNF. Goshawk
populations are declining and we fail to see how the FS is meeting its obligations for sensitive
species by harming its habitat project by project throughout the forest.
The same language is used for Bald eagles and other species such as fisher and marten. The
language is simply a cut and paste job. LOPs and RPMs will help protect the species but their
habitat will still be harmed. Surveys have not been conducted."”
Response: Project RPMs are not subject to being "lifted." The provisions in the RPMs would
allow wildlife LOPs to be lifted only if the actions and conditions specified in the RPM are met.
As per the language incorporated into the RPMs, LOPs could only be lifted for a given area if
protocol surveys are conducted and they show no nesting occurring in that area. The Forest Plan
requires protection for known northern goshawk nest sites: "Current management direction is to
protect each known nest site during planning and implementation" (p. 3-27), and project
resources protection measures include protection of all known nest sites in the project area. The
project design and the RPMs incorporated into the project ensure that our obligations pertaining
to northern goshawks, bald eagles and all other Forest Service Sensitive species are fully met.
The action is not likely to cause a trend toward federal listing (under the ESA) for any Forest
Service Region 5 Sensitive species.

Comment: Considering the same habitat is allegedly being used by all TES species, there is no
analysis of competition for habitat use. The FS doesn't explain how these arbitrary and capricious
management practices will aid in protecting sensitive species.
Response: The project wildlife reports do not allege that all TES species use the same habitats.
They instead describe the different habitat requirements for each of these species and the potential
effects of proposed activities on these species. The primary competitor of concern to NSO is now
the barred owl, and the BA addresses his competition and the question of whether project
activities would confer a competitive advantage to barred owls over NSO (BA pp. 20, 22, 33, 5253). "There is no basis on which to conclude that proposed activities will confer a significant
competitive advantage to barred owls over NSO's. In the long-term, treatments will benefit NSO's
in relation to barred owls because the proposed treatments are intended to accelerate the reestablishment of late-seral forest habitats highly suitable to NSOs, and reduce fuels
accumulations that would put high quality NSO habitat at risk during another high severity
wildfire" (BA p. 53). Project activities will also benefit other wildlife species, including Forest
Service Sensitive species, which utilize old-forest habitats. We strongly disagree that the
proposed management practices are either arbitrary or capricious. On the contrary, numerous
project design features and resource protection measures were incorporated into the planning
process to minimize potential effects to these species while allowing for the project's Purpose and

Comment: “The BA states a circle radius of 5 miles encompasses the average territory size for
gray wolves and the project is outside the known range of the species and therefore will have no
effects on the species. This is incorrect not to mention absurd. According to the MT Dept. of Fish,
Wildlife & Parks: Some Gray Wolves are known to have dispersed up to 805 km (500 miles).
Dispersal has been documented from Canada, Idaho and Wyoming to Montana. Montana Gray
Wolves are also known to have dispersed to Canada, Idaho, and Wyoming. Average territory size
in northwestern Montana was 220 square kilometers (185 square miles) but was highly variable
(USFWS et al. 2002). Average territory size for Yellowstone Gray Wolves was larger, averaging
891 square kilometers (344 square miles) (USFWS et al. 2002).
According to International Wolf Center: Territory size is highly variable and depends on a number
of factors such as prey abundance, the nature of the terrain, climate and the presence of other
predators including other wolf packs. Gray wolf territories in the lower 48 states may be less than
100 square miles while territories in Alaska and Canada can range from about 300 to 1,000 square
miles or more. Red wolf territories in northeastern North Carolina vary in size, but most are
estimated to range between 38 to 87 square miles.
Considering an entire pack of wolves was documented living on the McCloud District of the
Shasta-Trinity NF, gray wolves could easily be on the Trinity side of the Forest and in the project
area.
Gray Wolves need to be analyzed in the BA and the STNF should consult with the FWS on this
species."
Response: As is the case with migratory bird routes spanning from one continent to another,
dispersal paths are not typically considered part of an animal's home range. Including dispersal
paths would result in home range estimates that would be inaccurate and misleading. The analysis
in the BA was developed in coordination with the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Gray wolves
inhabit a wide variety of habitats across their very large species range, and home range size
estimates are correspondingly extremely variable, typically ranging from 20-400 square miles,
varying year-to-year, and tending to be smaller in lower latitudes (Mech and Boitani 2003; Fuller
et al. 2003; USDI Fish and Wildlife Service 2013; Wiles et al. 2011; Oregon Department of Fish
and Wildlife 2010). A 400 square mile territory is equivalent to a circle with radius 11.3 miles.
The nearest known wolf site is located 70-90 miles away from the project area. Therefore this
project will have no effect on wolves or on its critical habitat. The wolf analysis will be updated
to incorporate recent information from the US Fish and Wildlife Service and other sources.

Comment: “The analysis states approximately 22 MBF of salvage will be produced from
Alternative 1 between 2016 and 2019. It will cost the STNF almost $10 million to treat surface
fuels outside salvage units. There is no mention of where the $10 million will come from and it
won't be the salvage sale.
The weighted average of wood decay rates by successive years are 19.3% (2016); 61.4% (2017),
77.8% (2018); and 85.4% in 2019) for an average DBH of all species at 25 inches. It's expected
that the project will see a surplus of $646,957 in Alt. 1 IF the investment is made in 2016. It's
expected the project will be deficit -$476,527 if the investment is made within 2017.
Since the treatment of fuels is not subject to wood deterioration, that treatment will be constant at
2015 board feet volume (14.09 MMBF) for a total cost of $1,906, 235. If delayed until 2017 or
beyond, revenue from depreciated wood will have passed the point it can pay for fuels treatments
and NPV will be less than zero. There is also a likelihood the project will be rejected because it
no longer has economic viability.

Considering this project has zero economic viability and the significant impacts to NSO, critical
habitat, soils, hydrology and other resources, we recommend the No Action Alternative as the
most reasonable alternative to support."
Response: All action alternatives were designed to achieve the Purpose and Need: to mitigate
hazards that threaten public safety along open National Forest System, County, and State roads,
sustain and establish forest cover, and capture economic value and support the economies of local
communities by providing forest products. Ultimately, the need to provide for relatively safe
travel exists whether there is a commercial product removed or not. However, sawtimber is not
the only forest product that benefits the community. Firewood, biomass, and small sales that may
or may not include sawtimber-sized trees are also products that benefit local communities when
made available. In the event that sawtimber is not removed commercially, hazard tree abatement
and fuels treatment will likely be funded utilizing a variety of methods from force account (such
as Forest Service crews) to service contracts. Funding opportunities beyond appropriated dollars
will be pursued to help implement this project. There is nothing within the Purpose and Need for
the project that requires economic viability for the project to move forward. There is an overall
intent to use the economic viability to limit the expense to taxpayers, but the need to mitigate
hazards that threaten public safety along open roads in the fire footprints will remain.

Comment: “The DEIS states post-treatment total soil cover should be between 50 and 70%
averaged across the treatment area on metamorphics with at least 50% cover as fine organic
matter. The FS didn't include an LRMP cite for this direction (as it did for many other statements
in the Soils Section). Our understanding is soil cover must be attained by unit and, not averaged
across the treatment area. In addition, in areas that burned at high intensity and have lost soil
cover, the FS proposes that soil will be retained to the extent practicable. The FS is required to
use the best available scientific information and we aren't aware of any suggesting logging in
areas with no soil cover is good for the soil or the forest. Indeed, we sent a bibliography to the
STNF including dozens of papers discouraging salvage logging because it is does far more harm
to forest resources than leaving burned forest intact. The STNF ignored all of the scientific
information we provided, so we are including it again with these comments.
Response: The Shasta-Trinity LRMP Standards and Guidelines, chapter 4 section 18 Soils and
Water subsection d, e, and j and Appendix O was used to address soil cover. "Areas of detrimental
soil disturbance that affect soil productivity, should not be of a size or extent that would result in a
significant change in production potential for the activity area." Activity Area is "that area of land
to which soil productivity soil quality standards are applied. It is that area within a management
area where soil disturbing activities take place. It is of a practical size for management, sampling
and evaluation. Activity areas include timber harvest units within a sale area, burn areas within a
prescribed burn, and grazing areas within an allotment. System roads and trails and other
dedicated areas are not considered activity areas.”
Based on your comment, we recognize that there may have been some confusion regarding the
Resource Protection Measure that you cited. In order to clarify our actions and to ensure
consistency with Appendix O of the LRMP, we will change the text of the Resource Protection
Measure (#46 in DEIS) from “treatment area” to “activity area”. See Physical Science report page
26, "Across all fires, there was an average of 28% moderate to high soil burn severity and 72%
low to very low soil burn severity. In areas where soils were burned at moderate to high intensity,
soil structure was destroyed, soil cover was removed, and water repellency was common. Since
the highly burned landscapes (where most of the salvage will occur) lack cover, returning as
much cover as possible during implementation is desirable.” This technique was used recently for
the Stafford Fire Salvage Project of 2013 (Rust, 2015). On that project, cover was maximized as
much as possible in areas that burned hot and soil cover was marginal. Techniques of lop-andscatter and mastication of dead un-merchantable material was utilized to return cover to the
ground and slow erosion. Immediate cover was needed to protect severely burned soils from

accelerated erosion and the loss of important nutrients that are held in the duff and organic matter
in the surface horizons. Additionally, salvage breaks up water repellant surface layers and
provides a surface roughness factor that reduces erosion (James, C., 2013). In short, salvage
harvest can increase soil cover and reduce water repellency, especially within areas that burned at
high intensity. These techniques were evaluated by Busse et. al. 2014, James et. al. 2014, and
MacDonald et. al. (2015).The basis for the 50-70% soil cover is from forest service research.
"Litter and duff occurs over at least 50 percent of the activity area. Determine minimum organic
layer thickness locally and base it on an amount sufficient to persist through winter season storms
and summer season oxidation" SHF LRMP Appendix O, page O1 under surface organic matter.
Appendix O goes on to say "Use the presence of living vegetation that could contribute
significant annual litter fall to compensate for conditions when immediate post disturbance litter
and duff coverage is too thin or less than 50 percent. If the soil and potential natural plant
community are not capable of producing cover over 50 percent of the area, adjust minimum
amounts to reflect potential soil and vegetation capability". Finally, the project is not expected to
result in a significant change in productivity across any of the harvest units.

Comment: “Another RPM states fuel reduction activities should retain >50% of the existing
surface duff where it currently exists. What if >50% isn't retained? And clearly there are areas
that already don't meet these criteria due to the fire. So, this RMP is unenforceable and does
nothing to alleviate impacts to soils. There are many others RMPs with the wording of "should"
rather than "will". The FS can't claim RPMs will alleviate impacts when they are unenforceable.”
Response: Thank you for reviewing the RPMs and notifying the Forest of the inconsistency.
RPM 60 from the DEIS will be modified to be consistent with the Forest Plan (USDA Forest
Service, 1995a) standard to say "will" instead of "should" as follows: "Fuel treatment activities
(machine piling using brush rakes or grapple heads) will retain greater than 50 percent of the
existing surface duff (Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards), where it exists. If the existing
condition is deficient, specialists may prescribe activities to increase surface cover." The Forest
will review the other RPMs to ensure that they are consistent with law, regulation, and policy.

Comment: “The STNF used an assessment developed in 1983 (34 years ago) for its ERA model.
It is assumed that salvage logging in moderate to high severity burned areas will be
approximately a clearcut, and salvage logging in unburned to low severity burned areas will be
approximately a thin. (We note here that none of the wildlife reports produced for this project
considers salvage logging in moderate to high severity burn as a clearcut - but we agree). Using
the 34 year old model, the DEIS states the rate of recovery is dependent upon the recovery
coefficient. For example, for mechanical piling and burning the disturbed area will recover by
22% after three years and by about 68% after 30 years. The ERA was calculated using the model,
and converted to a total in tons based on an estimated 13.6 tons/road mile calculated from the
WEPP model. It was assumed that about 30% of the total sediment produced would eventually
enter a stream. The DEIS continues that even approximately predicting the amount of sediment at
the watershed scale is difficult to determine due to numerous variables and therefore the results
should be viewed as best guess approximations of the amount of sediment that may reach the
streams, rather than accurate forecasts of what we know will happen.”
Response: The Forest used an assessment developed in 1983 (34 years ago) for its equivalent
roaded area (ERA) model. The Forest Service Region 5 FSH 2509.22 Soil and Water
Conservation Handbook, chapter 20, requires the use of the ERA model. Although development
of the ERA model used by the Forest began with Haskins (1983), the model can be refined and
modified over time. When the modeling for this project was initially done, the Forest did not have
a salvage logging activity built into the model. It was assumed that salvage logging in moderate
to high severity burned areas would be approximately a clearcut because a clearcut was the

closest available activity built into the model at the time. Since then however, the Forest has
added salvage logging activities for high and moderate burn severity areas into the model.
Salvage logging in moderate to high severity burned areas will be modeled as approximately
equivalent to removing the negative effects of the fire (due to the activities breaking up the
hydrophobicity of the soils) and doing a clearcut (highest level of impacts assumed).The term
clearcut is generally applied to "green tree" harvests, which are not proposed in this project. The
wildlife reports instead assess the effects of proposed activities on habitat quality for NSO and
other wildlife species, including the effects of hazard tree abatement and commercial salvage
(highest level of impacts assumed).

Comment: To make the ""analysis"" even more meaningless the CWE were analyzed by
estimating the ERA within each hydrologic unit (HUC 5 to 8) and the results were compared
against the TOC established for each watershed that range from 12 to 18% ERA (Appendix H of
USDA FS, 1995b). Effects of the wildfire 2015 wildfires, fire suppression, and proposed project
activities are forecast for a 5-year period - despite the fact the DEIS claims the project may take
up to 20 years to implement. The analysis lists other projects including private lands logging.
After using a 34 year old model to determine ERA and then estimating the ERA and comparing
them against the TOC established in 1995 (22 years ago), the conclusions are that baseline
disturbance of the affected watersheds is low to moderate. Imagine what they would be if a real
analysis was conducted using scientifically updated models and accurate survey information?
Again, the STNF seems to think that producing a DEIS allows it to harm any resource, and
acknowledging harm using shoddy information, as long as it says harm will occur. That is not the
way the law works. Considering some of these watersheds are listed as impaired under the EPA
the FS has a responsibility to meet EPA standards."
Response: Development of the ERA model used by the Forest began 34 years ago with Haskins
(1983), but the model can be modified or refined at any time (Forest Service Region 5 FSH
2509.22 Soil and Water Conservation Handbook chapter 20, page 3). The Forest recently updated
the model to include salvage logging (see detailed explanation in the Hydrology Report).
Additional activities can be added at any time in the future, or the coefficients of activities can be
modified at any time if new information is available. Anyone is welcome to submit accurate
scientific information to us at any time, and we will consider it and, if scientifically appropriate,
use it to further update the model. Cumulative watershed effects were analyzed by estimating the
equivalent roaded area (ERA) because the Forest Service Region 5 FSH 2509.22 Soil and Water
Conservation Handbook chapter 10 (page 41) requires that the Forest Service assess and consider
the potential for cumulative watershed effects of proposed activities, and it states that the
approach uses the ERA model. Fifth-field through eighth-field hydrologic units were analyzed
within the EIS. The Forest Plan (page 4-25) requires that watersheds identified in the final EIS
(standard and guideline 18.b) and watersheds averaging about 1,000 acres in size (standard and
guideline 18.a) are to be analyzed. Watersheds identified in the final EIS are equivalent to 5thfield and/or 6th-field watersheds. Eighth-field watersheds are approximately 1000 acres in size.
Fifth-field and seventh-field hydrologic units are needed for the environmental baseline analyses
conducted by the fisheries biologists. The ERA results are required to be compared to the
Threshold of Concern (TOC) to comply with the Forest Plan. Standard and Guideline 18a(3) on
page 4-25 states that projects on National Forest System lands should not increase the ERA above
the proportional share of the TOC unless, as part of the project, existing ERAs will be reduced or
the ERA recovery factor will be improved.
There is no schedule of implementation for how the proposed activities will take place in each
watershed, so it is assumed in the model that the activities will occur within the first year that the
Record of Decision will be signed. This assumption is a worst case scenario because the
cumulative effects will be worse if the activities are implemented simultaneously rather than
implemented gradually over time. The duration of the analysis is from 2018 to 2022. The

potential for indirect effects is reduced over time and is often not evident 5 years after project
implementation. There are no foreseeable future projects beyond 2019. Although a watershed
may take more than 5 years to recover from cumulative effects, it is expected that significant long
term, potentially chronic effects, will be present only in watersheds over TOC. The South Fork
Trinity River sub-basin is included on California's Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list as water
quality limited due to sediment and temperature, and part of the Trinity River sub-basin is 303(d)
listed as sediment impaired. The Shasta Trinity National Forest is legally required to comply with
federal and state laws concerning nonpoint source pollution that would be created by this project.
The Forest's Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements for Nonpoint Source Discharges Related to
Certain Federal Land Management Activities on NFS Lands in the North Coast Region (Waiver)
addresses nonpoint source discharges of waste to waters of the state from activities associated
with specific uses of NFS lands. The Shasta Trinity National Forest will comply with the Waiver.

Comment: “Under desired condition the DEIS states ACS objectives provide direction for
watershed management on the STNF and the objectives were developed to maintain and restore
the ecological health of the aquatic ecosystem of the forest. The compliance document found in
Appendix E describes the objectives. Appendix E states for each objective generally: project
implementation via any of the action alternatives will maintain attainment of the objective at the
watershed and project site scale (aided greatly by Project EEZs, BMPs, and RPMs.) This despite
the analysis being based on best guesses, outdated models, and the admission the BMPs and
RPMs may not work in all places. Forgive us for not believing the hydrology and ACSO
determinations.”
Response: The Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) was developed to restore and maintain
aquatic ecosystems to further the ecological health of the watersheds that contain them. A key
driver is protecting salmon and steelhead habitat on Forest Service lands. One of the tactics to
achieve the goal is maintaining the natural disturbance regime. Complying with the ACS means
that the Shasta Trinity National Forest (Forest) must manage riparian-dependent resources to
maintain the existing condition or if logical, restore conditions to fit within natural disturbance
regimes. The proposed action honors the guidelines of the ACS that specifically mention 1)
avoiding areas prone to instability, 2) minimizing increases in peak streamflows, in this case by
treating legacy roads and controlling surface runoff, and 3) protecting riparian areas along
channels to limit bank erosion while promoting shade and coarse woody debris accumulation as
accomplished through equipment exclusion zones (EEZs). Resource Protection Measures (RPMs)
include Best Management Practices (BMPs) such as EEZs. Generally, the models the Forest uses
are considered the best available science. The Equivalent Roaded Area (ERA) model that we are
required to use (R5 FSH 2509.22 Chapter 10) for assessing cumulative watershed effects has
been in use for three decades, but the data compiled for these assessments is updated frequently
with past, present and reasonably foreseeable future activities. The compilation of this data is
itself a comprehensive look at cumulative effects. We also used the Water Erosion Prediction
Project (WEPP) model to estimate rates of erosion. Although we are not required to use WEPP,
the Forest Service does consider it to be a scientifically valid model (R5 FSH 2509.22 Chapter
10). A reasonable time frame for goal achievement is also required as per the ACS language
itself: "Because (the ACS) is based on natural disturbance processes, it may take decades,
possibly more than a century, to accomplish all of its objectives. Some improvements in aquatic
ecosystems, however, can be expected in 10 to 20 years". The effect of treatments from the
various action alternatives in relation to the nine objectives of the ACS are clearly and fully
described in the table referred to in this particular comment, found in the fish biological
evaluation, specialist and management indicator species report, and Table E-1 of the DEIS.

Comment: “We don't consider a likely to adversely affect critical habitat determination as
"some" changes. What the DEIS fails to state is that the NSO may very well be extinct by the
time the habitat recovers and any NSO in the project area require that habitat NOW. The DEIS
and supporting documents also fail to state the FWS is considering uplisting the NSO to
endangered status and that determination should be forthcoming any day now. The DEIS
downplays impacts to owl habitat and states impacts will last for up to 35 years or 60 years or
some other arbitrary number. Considering nesting/roosting habitat is generally old growth habitat
which takes 180-220 years to develop, the time frames in the analyses are not accurate.”
Response: Effects to NSO were fully disclosed and analyzed in the project BA, as required by
the ESA, and a determination of "may affect, likely to adversely affect" was reached. If the listing
status of NSO under ESA changes, the need to re-initiate consultation will be assessed at that
time. Temporal bounding of effects was established by considering the specific actions proposed
and the expected time for re-establishment of habitat functions. Proposed activities in the
Preferred Alternative which was analyzed in the BA are limited to dead vegetation (cutting of
dying vegetation is included in Alternatives 2 and 3), and effects to suitable NSO habitats are
expected to be more limited in intensity and duration than green tree treatments. Actions such as
clearcutting stands of old-growth habitat are not proposed, and in fact the project does not
propose any downgrade or removal of nesting and roosting habitat, so the time frame cited in the
comment is not applicable in this case. Temporal bounding for this analysis is both short term and
long term. The short-term bounding is the time during project implementation because it is tied
directly to the potential for noise disturbance and immediate habitat alteration. The estimated
timeline for hazard tree abatement, fuel loading reduction, wood product removal and planting
implementation is up to 5 years, and maintenance actions may occur up to 20 years into the
future.
Long-term bounding is determined by several factors. First, we looked at the habitat elements for
NSO and determined that snag density and down logs were the elements that would be affected
by the project for greatest amount of time. Then, we determined that the effects of this project on
snags and down logs would not be meaningful approximately 40 years after implementation (60
years post-fire). In current NSO nesting/roosting, foraging and dispersal habitats, the reduction in
snag numbers due to this project will be counteracted within 60 years through ongoing mortality,
including additional tree mortality from the effects of the 2015 fires. This tree mortality is also
expected to provide a high density of down logs in these habitats. This bounding is used to fully
account for any type of impacts although it exaggerates the reduction of snags and down logs due
to the narrow treatment area along open roads. Note that even in the short-term, adequate
numbers snags and down logs will be retained across the landscape.

decision and the analysis of effects will be assessed in order to determine whether they are still
valid. Effects of proposed activities on wildlife habitat, plant, and fish habitats are fully disclosed

Comment: Plantations aren't even considered developed until 80 years and this project will result
in clearcuts of snag habitat.
Response: Plantations aren't considered to have achieved late successional characteristics until at
least 80 years, but they are considered developed once they are established and start contributing
canopy cover, approximately 5-20 years following planting. Often, they are developed to the
extent that thinning can be accomplished under a commercial harvest at 40 years. This project
mitigates hazards in areas impacted from the 2015 fires along roads. Areas that experienced
moderate to high fire severity have more hazards and therefore will result in a greater number of
snags treated (whether by falling, treating fuels in place, or removal). Note that the approximately
136,000 acres affected by the fire and not included in this project (90-95% of the fire affected
area, depending on Alternative) will have no impact on snag habitat.

Response: The California spotted owl data gathered by Dr. Hanson that is referred to in the
comment letter dated April 18, 2017, and his reported analysis of that data, is not available as
published or peer-reviewed scientific information. It's validity and applicability to the analysis in
the BA for this project is therefore uncertain at this time. The reported conclusions of Dr. Hanson
are similar to those included in scientific publications of the commenter (Ms. Bond) that were
considered in the analysis for this project and are included in the references section of the BA.
The Jones et al. 2016 paper referred to in the attached April 18, 2017 comment letter was
reviewed during the analysis process and it is included in references section of the BA. It is a
peer-reviewed and published scientific paper, and is one of many sources considered in the
analysis for this project. Also carefully considered are numerous publications by the commenter
(Ms. Bond) on effects of fire on California spotted owls, a subspecies related to Northern spotted
owls. The April 18, 2017 comment letter criticizes Jones et al. 2016. These criticisms support the
conclusions reached by the commenter in her original research on the effects of fire on California
spotted owls. However, the criticisms of Jones et al. 2016 in the April 18, 2017 comment letter
are not available as published or peer-reviewed scientific literature, and therefore their
applicability to the analysis for this project are, like the reported work of Dr. Hanson, uncertain at
this time. The analysis in the BA for this project is based on a thorough review of the scientific
literature on the use of burned areas by spotted owls (California and Mexican spotted owls as well
as Northern spotted owls), and incorporates the recent synthesis of this literature prepared by the
US Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency of expertise for recovery of threatened and endangered
species. It also makes use of a similar synthesis prepared by Dr. Pat Manley, a Supervisory
Biological Scientist with the US Forest Service. These syntheses, and the analysis in the BA, do
not discount the available scientific research. They instead compare research results and
recommendations to identify their similarities and contrasts, as well as their strengths and
weaknesses. Based on this assessment of the best available science, the Forest worked closely
with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to minimize potential effects to NSO while still achieving
the project's Purpose and Need.

Comment: "Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Trinity Post-Fire Hazard
Reduction and Salvage Project. I am a wildlife biologist with experience in the study of
California spotted owls in post-fire landscapes. I have published peer-reviewed scientific papers
that cover a range of issues from territory occupancy rates, home range sizes, and diets in postfire landscapes and post-fire habitat selection. I have also visited portions of the Trinity Project
area. Here I provide comments on the Wildlife Biological Assessment (hereafter ""assessment"")
with respect to the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO).
Designated NSO critical habitat makes up 55% of the 8,000 acre-area of potential logging
(although the proposed acreage may overestimate the actual acreage to be logged), with 7 NSO
territories affected. The NSO is declining throughout its range, therefore the effects of logging in
this project are not insignificant to the population. The analyses in the assessment is based on
scientifically unjustified assumptions, such as a 500-foot buffer into burned forests."
Response: The NSO's current status, population trends and primary threats are discussed in the
BA and considered in the analysis. The project has been specifically designed to minimize
potential effects to NSO while allowing for the Purpose and Need to be met. The determination
for both effects to NSO and to NSO Critical Habitat is "may affect, likely to adversely affect"

because the effects of the project may rise above the level of insignificant, discountable, and
instead have a significant effect on NSO and/or NSO Critical Habitat. This is disclosed and
analyzed in the BA. The 500-foot buffer around burned habitat is an estimate of the distance from
suitable NSO nesting/roosting or foraging habitat that NSOs are likely to go to forage in post-fire
foraging areas. The process used to arrive at this distance is detailed in the section of the BA
entitled "Assessing Post-Fire NSO Habitat Suitability." In the absence of recommendations
specific to the question of how far from the edge of surviving nesting/roosting or foraging
habitats NSO are most likely to fly into burned areas (post-fire foraging habitats), the Yreka FWS
Office and Forest discussed the questions at length and reached a consensus. The distance NSO
are assumed most likely to forage away from the protective overhead cover provided by
nesting/roosting or foraging habitats is estimated to be approximately 500 feet. This estimate was
derived from a review of recent literature on the use of edge habitat (Comfort 2013; Eyes 2014),
professional judgment based on the biology of northern spotted owls, and extensive field
observations of NSO on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Rogers et al. pers. comm.). As a
result, these habitats (PFF1 habitats) within High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas receive
enhanced resource protection measures regardless of their distance from an NSO activity center.
This does not imply that no NSO foraging will occur beyond this distance, but is simply a
determination that foraging is much less likely beyond this distance.

62. Wild Nature Institute - Monica Bond

Comment: First, I want to commend the Forest Service for designating post-fire foraging type 1
(PFF1) areas for NSOs. This is a critical first step towards acknowledging the importance of postfire forests as foraging habitat for NSOs and a host of other native species. Post-fire foraging type
1 areas are NSO nesting/roosting/foraging habitats that were affected by higher-severity fire and
within 500 feet of currently suitable NRF habitats. I appreciate that the ecological value of these
areas is being accepted. However, the best available science suggests that post-fire foraging areas
extend to within 2.2 km of spotted owl territories. Clark et al. (2013) states in Management
Implications that "we recommend restricting salvage logging after fires on public lands within 2.2
km of spotted owl territories (the median home range size in this portion of the spotted owl's
range) to limit the negative impacts of salvage logging." Foraging California spotted owls have
been observed selecting for severe fire forest patches up to 1.5 km from their nest sites (Bond et
al. 2009). Therefore, 500 feet is an insufficient buffer, and is not scientifically justified in the
literature, or in the assessment. NSO have large home ranges, and areas farther from the nest core
may be important for NSO during the non-breeding season as these raptors expand their areas of
use as they deplete their prey base during the breeding season (Carey et al. 1992). I had
previously noted this fundamental flaw in my comments to the Forest Service on the Draft
Environmental Impact Statement, Biological Assessment, and Biological Evaluation for the
Westside 'Fire Recovery' project (see my attached comments from Westside, page 4). I
recommend extending this PFF1 designation to 2.2 km for NSO, as recommended by the best
available science (Clark et al. 2013). This will provide greater certainty that harm is not inflicted
on this declining subspecies during harvesting for wood products. Detailed comments are
provided below.
Response: The analysis in the BA is based on a thorough review of the scientific literature on the
use of burned areas by spotted owls (California and Mexican spotted owls as well as northern
spotted owls). The analysis compares research results and recommendations to identify their
similarities and contrasts, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Based on the assessment of
the best available science, the Forest worked closely with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to
minimize potential effects to NSO while still achieving the project's Purpose and Need. Research
utilized in this analysis and cited extensively includes works by Clark, and by the commenter
(Ms. Bond). Based on research conducted by the commenter and others, this analysis identifies
post-fire foraging (PFF) habitats as habitats utilized by spotted owls post-fire. Resource
protection measures for the proposed project provide additional protection for PFF habitats within

HVWCAs that are within 500 feet of existing nesting/roosting or foraging habitats. Potential
effects to PFF habitats are disclosed and analyzed throughout the BA, particularly on pp. 30-31
and 47-52.The 2.2 km figure in Clark et al. (2013) is a recommendation to protect burned habitats
on public lands within 2.2 km of California spotted owl activity centers. It is unclear why this
recommendation is restricted to public lands. The 500-foot figure in the analysis for the proposed
project is entirely different. It is an estimate of how far into burned areas NSO are most likely
willing to fly from the edge of suitable nesting/roosting or foraging habitats to forage in burned
(post-fire foraging) areas. This distance is independent of the distance from an NSO activity
center. As a result, these habitats (PFF1 habitats) within High-Value Wildlife Conservation Areas
receive enhanced resource protection measures regardless of their distance from an NSO activity
center. The 500-foot figure was determined in close coordination with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service. It reflects the best available scientific information on habitat use by NSO, extensive
observations of NSO behavior on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and the best scientific
judgement of US Forest Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife Biologists (in the
absence of a consensus on this particular question in the published literature).

Comment: The purpose and need for action mentions that dead trees elevate future fire risk and
danger to firefighters, and wildfire suppression strategies would therefore be limited. However, I
question the underlying assumption that wildfire suppression in these remote forested areas is
even a necessary or laudable goal. Firefighting and management activities to reduce fire risk
should be focused on areas immediately surrounding towns and critical infrastructure such as
power lines. Limited funds would be better spent repeatedly removing vegetation within 100 feet
of homes and subsidizing homeowners to retrofit their houses to be less vulnerable to catching
fire. This is the only way to truly protect human communities from any damage from wildfire. In
the surrounding forests, fire is a natural component of ecological dynamics and indeed provides
important habitat for many native species. Finally, no amount of logging will reduce fire during
extreme weather events which burn most of the acreage. There are so many scientific references
supporting the need to focus on the area immediate surrounding homes, and that fire is
ecologically critical in western forests, and that logging does not reduce large fires, that I am
going to refer here to a recent book entitled Nature's Phoenix, edited by Della Salla and Hanson
2016, that summarizes very well these points and the hundreds of references that support them.
Contributors to the book include some of the world's foremost fire ecologists and experts.
Response: One element of the purpose of this project is to mitigate hazards (i.e. fire killed or
defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest System,
County, and State roads. This purpose stems from needs based on the Land and Resource
Management Plan for the Shasta-Trinity National Forests (USDA, 1995a) and the post-fire
assessment (See Purpose and Need, FEIS Chapter 1).The objectives and strategies for response to
future wildland fires on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest are outside the scope of this project.
However, managing fuels for public safety is a top priority for the Forest (Forest Plan 4-18).
Mitigating hazards along the roads identified in this project is expected to increase the likelihood
of safe ingress and egress both post-fire and in the event of future wildfires, of which logging
could be method for implementation. This is consistent with the management direction identified
in the need for this project. The Forest recognizes the value of making homes fire safe and
reducing fuels within 100 feet of structures; however, this project is concerned with creating safe
conditions for travel on roads through land managed by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest.
Additionally, portions of the project area are located within the wildland-urban interface, as
identified by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest and the Trinity County Community Wildfire
Protection Plan. The Forest recognizes that fire is an important ecological function. By reducing
excessive fuels to levels more consistent with a pre-fire-suppression fire regime, the project is
consistent with the Land and Resource Management Plan direction to restore and replicate fire's
role in the ecosystem (Forest Plan 4-4 & 4-16).

Comment: The purpose and need for the Trinity Project also purports a need to sustain and
establish forest cover. The best scientific data available have demonstrated that seedlings reestablish naturally in the absence of any post-fire management activities by people. Please see
Donato et al. (2006, 2009). Therefore, replanting is not necessary, and indeed logging operations
damage naturally regrowing seedlings that are locally genetically adapted for the area. The local
genetic adaptation of seedlings re-establishing after wildfire must be addressed as a significant
scientific issue in any analyses of effects of logging operations.
Response: While Donato's papers indicate natural regeneration is sufficient, it is not the only
literature related to post fire reforestation and does not follow any long term efficacy study.
Natural regeneration tends to be concentrated adjacent to unburned areas or those that retained
mature (live) trees following fire. Reforestation associated with this project will focus on larger
areas of moderate to high severity in the roadside buffer that are lacking in mature forest cover to
provide a sufficient seed source to establish conifer seedlings prior to shrub domination. Note that
additional post-fire reforestation efforts are on-going as indicated in the Cumulative Effects table,
and focus on areas of interior forest including productive natural stands greater than 10 acres and
plantations that were impacted by high to moderate severity wildfire. As disclosed in the
Vegetation section of Chapter 3, natural revegetation of the burned areas within the project area,
especially outside of treatment areas, will occur to a small degree over time, primarily with forbs
and shrubs; forested conditions in areas burned at high severity are unlikely to occur for 20-100
years. For the larger, high severity burned areas, reforestation will take a long period of time due,
in part, to the distance from seed sources as well as a potential decrease in soil
productivity/fertility. It is expected that hardwoods and shrubs will resprout vigorously
throughout the recovery area. After fire mortality has ceased, large areas in all land allocations
severely affected by the fires would be understocked or unstocked for forest development and
associated timber production for many decades (Clark 2009; Ouzts et al. 2015).While groundbased logging operations that occur after a couple seasons of seedling establishment may impact
natural regeneration, planting of a species mix consistent with historic conditions will be
implemented to ensure cover. Seeds propagated for planting under this project have been
collected within the local area (seed zone 312; Buck et al. 1970) and within an appropriate
elevational band to allow for the best chance for seedling health and survival.

Comment: “In essence, the science demonstrates that (1) wildfire created necessary and
important habitat for many western native species, (2) trees regrow naturally on their own without
human intervention, and (3) logging is not an effective means of reducing wildfire spread or
intensity during extreme weather conditions-which are the only conditions that might result in
large areas of high-severity wildfire that might reduce nesting and roosting habitats for NSO.
Therefore, the purpose and need for this project has not been scientifically justified.”
Response: This project or the analysis of this project does not dispute that wildfire creates
necessary and important habitat for many western native species or that trees regrow naturally on
their own without human intervention. The Purpose and Need was developed based on the social
and economic context of managing National Forest System lands following a fire. Infrastructure,
including roads, exists on the landscape for human use of the land and resources. This project was
designed with a narrow focus, to reduce hazards along roads open to the public that were
impacted by the 2015 wildfires on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The actions proposed under
each alternative were developed following law, regulation, and policy and use best available
science with varying approaches to meet the intent of the Purpose and Need. Under the preferred
alternative, 8,000 acres of roadside treatment is proposed out of approximately 144,000 acres of
NFS lands burned. The 95 percent of fire area outside of the proposed treatments still allow for
natural processes to occur, including providing habitat for native species. Post-fire habitat
features that remain potentially useful to some wildlife species, most notably fire-killed snags, are

abundant across the 95 percent of untreated burned areas and will remain so due to no treatment
in those areas. Timber harvest or removal of hazard trees in a narrow buffer along roads is one of
many tools utilized in this project design to reduce overall fuel levels to achieve the desired
conditions along open roads. The project is not designed to affect fire behavior across the
landscape, only directly adjacent to roads open to the public. Reforestation is proposed in high
severity areas because the seed source has been removed by the fire. Although the area could
potentially reforest naturally the timeframe that it might occur in and the potential for
revegetation by highly flammable brush species in the meantime would create a hazard to the
road. The effects that this project has on wildlife habitat, fire behavior, and vegetation under each
alternative are disclosed in the EIS.

66. Wild Nature Institute - Monica Bond

Comment: “The Project Design Features indicate that trees will be cut that pose a hazard to roads
and/or logging operations. It is rather circular reasoning to state that trees will be cut that pose a
hazard to the cutting operation. Even if trees posing a hazard to operations or haul routes will be
cut and retained, that is the loss of a standing snag that could have provided a perch site for a
foraging NSO or a nest or roost site for a woodpecker or other fire-dependent native species. The
Forest Service has therefore not demonstrated a need to cut trees that pose a hazard to the treecutting operation that itself is largely unnecessary. I propose instead that only trees that are both
dead and leaning directly over a high-traffic road will be hand-cut, and all of those cut trees will
be retained on-site as logs. No other trees will be cut. This is the type of lower-impact "hazardreduction" design feature that would minimize the adverse effects on NSO and other wildlife
within HVWCAs, suitable NSO NRF habitat, and PFF1 areas. I suggest this option be analyzed
in a new EIS.”
Response: This RPM is included as a reflection of OSHA requirements. In Alternatives 1, 2, 3,
and 4, any trees cut because they pose a hazard to logging operations are limited only to those
posing a danger to the operators cutting the trees (per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.266). Further, fallers
would have no financial incentive to cut trees that are not an imminent hazard to them because
operational hazards that are not dead at the time of implementation or are felled outside of the
treatment buffer cannot be logged (sold and removed offsite). No additional trees will be cut
under this provision beyond those necessary to address the danger posed to operators. There are
seldom cases where a hazard to operators would not also be a hazard to the road, given the
relatively narrow buffers associated with this project. Reclassifying a narrow definition of hazard
tree inconsistent with accepted regulation and policy does not meet the Purpose and Need for
mitigating hazards that threaten public safety along open roads. In response to this comment the
Forest has considered another alternative (Alternative 11). The alternative would cut dead trees
that are overhanging ML 3-5 NFS, County, and State roads and leave them in place after falling.
This action would leave hazard trees and excessive fuels along open roads in the fire footprints.
This alternative is not consistent with OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1910.266(d)(6)(ii) and 29 CFR
1910.226(h)(1)) and Forest Service policy (FSH 6709.11 Health and Safety Code Handbook).
This alternative has been eliminated from detailed study because it does not meet the Purpose
and Need to mitigate hazards on open roads in areas burned during the 2015 fires. This comment
discounts that approximately 136,000 acres (using the proposed action footprint) impacted by the
2015 fires on Shasta-Trinity National Forest are not impacted by this project and would continue
to provide NSO habitat while not threatening public safety.

high-value NSO core areas (these are areas that have supported NSO reproduction or pairs in the
past and retain sufficient habitat to do so again in future) that are at least partially within an LOP
exemption area. Why are these high-value core areas within any LOP exemption area at all? The
public will need much better justification than "disturbance is much less likely to occur" in those
areas. Also, comprehensive, protocol-level stand searches should be conducted within all areas

that are designated as 'preferred' or 'high-value' both before and after any treatments as part of an
effective management monitoring program for impacts of logging on NSO. This should always
include multiple site visits within one breeding season, as spotted owls can be occupying a site
but unresponsive during a survey (see every published peer-reviewed occupancy paper from
demographic study areas). This document fails to specify how the stand searches will be
conducted. Will they be conducted to standard protocols for occupancy surveys?”
Response: LOP exemption areas were established in close coordination with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service to minimize potential effects to NSO while still allowing prompt implementation
of the project to achieve the Purpose and Need. They were established only where less than ten
percent of the area is "selected for" or "highly selected for" by NSO (using the USFWS NSO
Relative Habitat Suitability model). Some of these areas include territories where nesting or pair
bonding was observed at some point in the past. To further reduce the potential for effects to NSO
reproduction at these sites, the high-value core areas will be subject to LOPs unless stand
searches (as per the NSO survey protocol) are conducted and non-nesting is determined. The
effects analysis incorporates all of these assumptions and discloses the assumptions. If there is
limited information then the effects are assumed to be the worst case scenario.

Comment: “This section is severely deficit in its discussion on fire effects to spotted owls, fails
to properly describe the studies on spotted owls and fire, and is riddled with not only incorrect
statements but also clear, unfounded biases against certain studies. It appeared to me that the
studies were not read carefully. For example, the assessment states "some studies have shown
owls to exhibit site fidelity, mate fidelity, and reproductive success after fires…" and then cites
Lee et al. 2012. However Lee et al. (2012) did not in any way study site fidelity, mate fidelity, or
reproductive success. None of those parameters were estimated in that study, as owls were not
banded. This is a total misrepresentation of that study.
Response: The analysis in the BA is based on a thorough review of the scientific literature on the
use of burned areas by spotted owls (California and Mexican spotted owls as well as Northern
spotted owls), and incorporates the recent synthesis of this literature prepared by the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, the agency of expertise for recovery of threatened and endangered species. It
also makes use of a similar synthesis prepared by Dr. Pat Manley, a Supervisory Biological
Scientist with the US Forest Service. These syntheses, and the analysis in the BA, do not discount
the available research. They instead compare research results and recommendations to identify
their similarities and contrasts, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Based on this
assessment of the best available science, the Forest worked closely with the US Fish and Wildlife
Service to minimize potential effects to NSO while still achieving the project's Purpose and Need.
Published research by the commenter provided an important contribution to recognizing the use
of burned areas by spotted owls. Her work is carefully considered, and cited extensively in the
analysis in the BA. Lee et al. 2012 is also cited numerous times in the BA. This citation was
inadvertently left in one sentence that does not refer to (or no longer refers to) the research results
in this particular paper. The analysis with be updated to include this correction.

Comment: Further, the assessment makes a specific point to state that sample sizes in Bond et al.
(2009) were 'small' when in fact the sample size was not too small to obtain robust results, and
included more than 300 foraging locations that were analyzed with a random owl effect. The
Forest Service would appear less biased if it would stop minimizing this 2009 study by repeatedly
obfuscating the results under the assertion of 'small sample size' without truly understanding the
statistics.
Response: The biological assessment cites Bond et al. (2009) numerous times. It also notes
concerns about this and other publications, including those discussed in the Manley Declaration
(Center for Biological Diversity et al. v. Skalki and United States Forest Service 2014) and the

US Fish and Wildlife Service research synthesis (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2016; Appendix
3). The concern about sample size is related not to the total observations recorded, but instead to
the relatively small number of owls tracked in this study (seven owls were tracked, from four
territories). The BA nonetheless cites Bond et al. (2009) as a key source in establishing the use of
burned areas as post-fire foraging habitats by California spotted owls.

70. Wild Nature Institute - Monica Bond
50T

Comment: The most egregious misrepresentation of the literature is in the assessment's
discussion about research by Clark and colleagues. In the first two paragraphs discussing Clark's
results, the Forest Service completely fails to mention that a large proportion of the high-severity
fire areas in that study were clearcut salvage logged. The assessment finally admits in the third
paragraph describing this research that the areas were "salvaged/burned." Clark et al. were unable
to separate effects of wildfire from effects of logging - this was made very clear in their
publications, and is stated on page 28 of the assessment, but it should have been stated from the
start when describing all of the results, and how those documented adverse effects of salvage
logging would be applied to the Trinity Project analysis. The description of Clark's results in this
assessment is therefore misleading to the public. Importantly, Clark et al. (2013) recommended
not salvage logging within 2.2 km of owl territories, which was not mentioned in this assessment
at all. The Forest Service's selection of a 500-foot buffer into burned forest from unburned NRF is
therefore minimal and arbitrary. The assessment states on page 31 that this was based on a review
of recent literature on the use of edge habitat by spotted owls found in Comfort (2013) and Eyes
(2014), but there are no such recommendations for a 500-foot buffer either in these two
documents or in Comfort's peer-reviewed publication in the journal Landscape Ecology (Comfort
et al. 2016). There is no justification provided in the assessment for a 500-foot buffer, and this
must be rectified as it renders all the subsequent analyses of effects of salvage logging
unsubstantiated.
Response: As the commenter notes, the findings in Clark et al. 2013 were considered in the
analysis and discussed in the biological assessment. Clark et al. 2013 is cited numerous times in
the BA, and is a key publication used to establish the occurrence of spotted owls in burned areas.
The BA also discusses concerns about findings and management recommendations in various
publications, including Clark et al. 2013, that were raised in the Manley Declaration (Center for
Biological Diversity et al. v. Susan Skalki and United States Forest Service 2014) and the US Fish
and Wildlife Service research synthesis (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2016; Appendix 3). We
disagree that the order of presentation in the BA regarding Clark's work is in any way misleading
to the public.
Bond (2009) and Clark et al. (2013) include recommendations to protect burned habitats within
1.5 km and 2.2 km of California spotted owl activity centers, respectively. The 500-foot figure in
the analysis for the proposed project is entirely different. It is an estimate of how far into burned
areas NSO are most likely willing to fly from the edge of suitable nesting/roosting or foraging
habitats to forage in burned (post-fire foraging) areas. This distance is independent of the distance
from an NSO activity center. As a result, these habitats (PFF1 habitats) within High-Value
Wildlife Conservation Areas receive enhanced resource protection measures regardless of their
distance from an NSO activity center.
In the absence of recommendations specific to the question of how far from the edge of surviving
nesting/roosting or foraging habitats NSO are most likely to fly into burned areas (post-fire
foraging habitats), the Yreka Fish and Wildlife Service Office and the Forest discussed the issue
at length and reached a consensus. We estimate the distance one can reasonably assume NSO are
most likely to forage away from the protective overhead cover provided by nesting/roosting or
foraging habitats, to be approximately 500 feet. This estimate was derived from a review of
recent literature on the use of edge habitat (Comfort 2013; Eyes 2014), professional judgment
based on the biology of northern spotted owls, and extensive field observations of NSO on the

NSO foraging will occur beyond this distance, but that foraging is much less likely beyond this

Comment: Overall this was quite a poor representation of the literature about fire and spotted
owls. I recommend the Forest Service carefully read all of the published, peer-reviewed studies
and present their results in an unbiased manner (see for example the presentation in Bond 2016).
The best available science actually indicates that wildfire is not a major factor in the decline of
spotted owl populations. Please see references described in Bond (2016). There is always a need
for additional fire research, especially in areas that have not been salvage logged, but this type of
research is difficult precisely because the Forest Service has salvage logged most severely burned
forests. The Forest Service states (as on page 28 of the assessment) that there is uncertainty about
effects of fire on spotted owls, but if this is the case in any studies it is because the Forest Service
conducted salvage logging, which confounded results (as in all studies by Clark). In studies where
salvage logging was not a confounding factor, fire had NO EFFECT on spotted owl occupancy
(see Roberts et al. 2011, and Lee and Bond's 2015 study in the Rim Fire, which was not cited in
the assessment).
Response: The analysis in the BA is based on a thorough review of the scientific literature on the
use of burned areas by spotted owls (California and Mexican spotted owls as well as Northern
spotted owls), and incorporates the recent synthesis of this literature prepared by the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, the agency of expertise for recovery of threatened and endangered species (US
Fish and Wildlife Service 2016). It also makes use of a similar synthesis prepared by Dr. Pat
Manley, a Supervisory Biological Scientist with the US Forest Service (Center for Biological
Diversity et al. v. Susan Skalki and United States Forest Service 2014). These syntheses, and the
analysis in the BA, do not discount the available research. They instead compare research results
and recommendations to identify their similarities and contrasts, as well as their strengths and
weaknesses. Based on this assessment of the best available science, the Forest worked closely
with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to minimize potential effects to NSO while still achieving
the project's Purpose and Need. Published research by the commenter provided an important
contribution to recognizing the use of burned areas by spotted owls. Her work is carefully
considered, and cited extensively in the analysis in the BA. Nevertheless, as is recognized by the
Revised Recovery Plan, high-severity fire remains a major threat to NSO. Roberts et al. 2011 was
reviewed and considered in the analysis, was included in the reference section, and was cited on
page 28 of the BA. This study detected similar rates of occupancy in burned and unburned areas,
although their study sites had predominantly low or moderate fire severity, and also had a limited
history of timber harvest or aggressive wildfire suppression (and thus are likely to have fuels
conditions and fire hazard levels that differ markedly from conditions in our project area). Lee
and Bond 2015 was reviewed and considered in the analysis, was included in the references
section, and was also cited on pages 26 and 47 of the BA.

Comment: The Rim Fire had higher levels of California Spotted Owl territory occupancy than in
any other published study of spotted owls in either burned or unburned landscapes, with a large
sample of 45 burned owl breeding sites, and the amount of high-severity fire in a 300-ha site had
no effect on pair occupancy. This was the case prior to any salvage logging. Unfortunately, the
Forest Service then conducted salvage logging in the Rim Fire which precluded any further study
of the effects of fire alone on this species.

commenter provided an important contribution to recognizing the use of burned areas by spotted
owls. This work is carefully considered, and cited extensively in the analysis in the BA. This
study started one year post fire and surveys were taken for a period of 6 months. This is a limited
amount of time to prove long term trends, as stated by the authors "Longer-term monitoring of
these sites will determine the temporal durability of our observed high occupancy rates."
Furthermore the authors stated "Our occupancy estimates for California Spotted Owls after the
Rim Fire could be higher, lower, or the same as pre-fire occupancy. Occupancy status was known
for only 9 of the 45 sites 1 year prior to the Rim Fire and for 6 sites 2 years prior to fire (USFS
personal communication)."This study was also specific to the California spotted owl, a different
subspecies of spotted owl, and was conducted in the Sierra Nevada, a different mountain range.
This project is treating only along roadsides that are open to the public for safety. Depending on
the alternative chosen 90-95% of the fire area will not have treatments from this project.

Comment: "Perhaps additional, methodically analyzed information about the adverse effects of
post-fire logging on spotted owls is warranted. I present here a recent analysis which was just
completed by Dr. Chad Hanson and submitted to the USFWS on April 18, 2017, which provides
further evidence that large fires are not a major threat to California Spotted Owls (a closely
related subspecies to NSO) and how post-fire logging is in fact a major threat. In the analysis, Dr.
Hanson first analyzed CSO territories that were occupied in the closest year with occupancy data
prior to post-fire logging. For example, the most recent CSO surveys on the San Bernardino
National Forest prior to the Lake fire of 2015 occurred in 2011, whereas in the Rim fire of 2013,
CSO surveys were sporadic prior to the fire, but were extensive beginning in the spring of 2014,
prior to post-fire logging on national forest lands. Dr. Hanson analyzed naïve occupancy of CSO
territories with 50% or more high-severity fire within a 1500-meter radius around territory
centroids at three different levels of post-fire logging-<5%; 5-25%, and >25%. This radius
distance around territory centroids has been found to be important to CSOs for foraging (Bond et
al. 2009). To determine post-fire-logged areas, Dr. Hanson used the Forest Service's FACTS
database, which contains spatially explicit GIS data of post-fire logging activity in any given fire
during any time period, as well as GIS data on fire severity
(https://www.fs.fed.us/postfirevegcondition/whatis.shtml) and land ownership, where forested
moderate- and high-severity fire areas on private lands are consistently post-fire logged (Google
Earth was used to confirm post-fire logging). Dr. Hanson excluded low-severity fire areas, with
low-severity defined consistent with the definition used by the Forest Service (Miller and Thode
2007, Remote Sensing of Environment, Vol. 109, pp. 66-80). In territories dominated by highseverity fire but less than 5% post-fire logging, 7 of 10 CSO territories were occupied (70%
occupancy), whereas only 3 of 11 (27% occupancy) and 1 of 15 (7% occupancy) CSO territories,
dominated by high-severity fire, with 5-25% and >25% post-fire logging, respectively, were
occupied. Using a Chi-square test for trends in binomial proportions, this difference was
statistically significant (c2 = 10.90, p = 0.004, df = 2, n = 36 territories). This indicates that
substantial loss of CSO occupancy following large fires is largely driven by post-fire logging of
complex early seral forest-a habitat type created by high-severity fire effects in mature conifer
forest, and which CSOs select for foraging, given the small mammal prey base in such habitat
(Bond et al. 2009).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Second, using all historical CSO territories (i.e., not limited to the ones occupied in the most
recent survey year before post-fire logging), and excluding territories with 5% or more post-fire
logging, Dr. Hanson analyzed overall post-fire naïve occupancy in these large fires, finding 71%
occupancy in the Lake fire (5 of 7), 72% occupancy in the King fire (13 of 18), 94% occupancy
in the Rim fire (33 of 35), 100% occupancy in the Chips fire (9 of 9), 36% occupancy in the Old
fire (4 of 11), and 100% occupancy in the McNally fire (6 of 6) (the Moonlight-Antelope fire was
not included in this analysis because only one territory met the criteria, given the high levels of
post-fire logging that occurred immediately post-fire on private lands in all other CSO territories
in that fire area). These occupancy levels compare very favorably to naïve occupancy levels in the
closest CSO demography study areas to each of these fires, at the times the fires occurred."
Response: The California spotted owl data gathered by Dr. Hanson that is referred to in the
comment, and his reported analysis of that data, is not available as published or peer-reviewed
scientific information. It was submitted to the US Fish and Wildlife Service in the form of a
comment letter rather than a scientific report, and it's validity and applicability to the analysis in
the BA for this project is therefore uncertain at this time. The reported conclusions of Dr. Hanson
are similar to those included in scientific publications co-authored by the commenter (Ms. Bond)
and others that were considered in the analysis for this project and included in the references
section of the BA. These findings are not discounted in the BA, but are instead considered
alongside other works that reached different conclusions. The analysis in the BA assesses the full
range of literature on this subject, and identifies the findings that are well-supported by the
available science on this topic.

Comment: NSO have been demonstrated using severely burned forests, and cutting down trees
removes potential perch sites for foraging owls or, if the snag is large, potential nest trees; this is a
clear indication that any type of salvage logging could adversely impact this imperiled subspecies
and its ability to use its habitat. The mixed-severity nature of these fires on the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest provides suitable habitat for NSO nesting, roosting, and foraging, and the Trinity
Project's proposed action is incompatible with the recovery of NSO. I posit that the Forest Service
propose and analyze an alternative that focuses only on cutting down and retaining on-site the
dead trees that pose an immediate hazard along well-traveled roads. This option would truly
reduce risks to travelers while being cautionary about protecting habitat for NSO and helping
arrest further declines of this imperiled subspecies.
Response: The potential adverse effects of cutting snags in NSO habitat are fully analyzed in the
project wildlife BA and wildlife report, which disclose that the overall determination for effects to
NSO and NSO critical habitat is "may affect, likely to adversely affect" under all of the action
alternatives. Numerous resource protection measures have been adopted to reduce effects to NSO
while still allowing the project's Purpose and Need to be met. The project only impacts 5-10% of
the area affected by wildfire (depending on alternative) and no nesting, roosting, or foraging
habitat will be downgraded or removed as a result of project implementation for any action
alternative. The project meets all requirements of the Endangered Species Act, including the
requirement for Federal agencies to "utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this
Act by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species"
(ESA Sec. 7. [16 U.S.C. 1536]). It also meets the requirements of the Forest Plan, including the
following: "Forest Service activities and programs are intended to assist in the recovery of T&E
species and to avoid actions that may cause a species to become threatened or endangered"
(Forest Plan p. 3-26); and "T&E species will continue to be managed under existing recovery
goals identified in individual species recovery plans" (Forest Plan, pg. 3-28). See a discussion of
Revised Recovery Plan consistency in Appendix 1 of the BA. The Forest considered an
alternative similar to this but eliminated it from detailed study. Alternative 7b will be developed,
but due to not meeting the Purpose and Need it will not be studied in detail.

Response: Carey et al. 1992 was considered in the analysis, as was Lee and Bond 2015. While
not a published research paper, the Bond 2016 article was also reviewed during preparation of the

proposed project, but instead one that preceded the project currently being proposed. Donato et al.
(2006) indicated post-fire logging may be counterproductive to regeneration and fuel levels;
however, the study did not include post-harvest fuel treatments or planting. In addition, scholars
have rebutted these findings, indicating the study lacks adequate context and supporting
information to be clearly interpreted by scientists, resource managers, policy-makers, and the
public (Newton et al. 2006, Baird 2006). This project is implementing secondary fuels treatments
in all salvage units to mitigate increased fuel loading following harvest, which will reduce fire
behavior and fire effects. (Donato et al. 2009.) Also see Response to Comment 64.

Comment: "The time required to produce this EIS has caused the project to be a failure because
of deterioration of the burned timber. No buyers are likely to bid. The economics of this project
show logging costs exceed the timber value even if the project had been sold while value
remained, soon after the fire. The cost of preparing this EIS is likely to exceed one million
dollars. It makes little sense to further pursue a project like this.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

Scarce dollars should not be spent on salvage in this instance, and would be better spent on the
roadside fuel breaks and plantation thinning proposed by the TCCG. This salvage is a bad
investment for the US Forest Service to make.
Assuming the project does not sell, please identify what source of funds will be used to remove
roadside hazard trees from the project area?"
Response: The Forest acknowledges the substantial loss of value due to deterioration of burned
timber, and the tenuous economic viability inherent in fire killed trees in the Vegetation and
Economic sections of Chapter 3 of the EIS. Circumstances beyond the Forest's control have
delayed the ROD, but that doesn't invalidate the Purpose and Need for action. The Purpose and
Need of the project is to mitigate hazards that threaten public safety along open roads, sustain and
establish forest cover, and capture economic value if it exists. The need to provide for public
safety is still present and the Forest is committed to addressing this concern. It is not a valid
assumption to say that there will be no economic offset for this project if the timing prevents the
material being sold as saw logs. The continued deterioration of trees impacts the ability to sell
saw log type material, but the market for biomass and other types of utilization do not have the
same thresholds for viability and there continues to be interest in material long after the more
traditional timeline of salvage. The rate that is paid for biomass and other types of utilization is
substantially less than saw log prices, which is why there is a push to try and capture this
opportunity to meet the needs of the project and not shift the burden to the taxpayers to the
greatest extent possible. Assuming timber sale revenue is not generated from the project, the
Forest will utilize appropriated dollars (including its own work force) and pursue supplemental
funding as opportunities arise. The Forest will continue to look for ways to reduce the cost of
implementation by working with biomass and other types of utilization markets. This project
achieves similar objectives to the roadside fuel treatment buffer portion of the "Pilot Project"
referenced in the comment and would neither replace nor delay its priority status within the
Forest's program of work, as designed.

Comment: "Review focused on the Economics Report.
1) The Report, first, appears to ignore the lost value in pine from blue stain and wood
borers. Blue Stain can cause at least a 50% deduct and wood borers can cause a complete
loss in value. Borers in fir could be similar. If these were ignored, the analysis is not
accurate."
Response: The Economics report takes into account the percent deterioration over time of firekilled trees (as discussed in the Deterioration section of the Economics report, and depicted in
Figure 3-24). Deterioration takes into account factors by species pertaining to weather (i.e.
checking), decay (i.e. rotting sapwood), insects (i.e. wood borers) and stain (i.e. blue) per R5
Supplement for FSH 2409.12 Chapter 20 (derived from PNW-GTR-292). A fall, buck and scale is

Comment: 2) The Economics Report was completed in July 2016 using data from February 2016

Response: While the economics report was prepared in 2016, it did take into account projected
revenue generated, jobs created and rates of deterioration over time (see Tables 3-97 and 3-99
referenced in the DEIS), through 2019. This gives an indication of trends in devaluation and
depreciation over time. Any forest products made commercially available to the public will
receive a site specific appraisal prior to advertisement.

Comment: 3) The Forest should have done, as recent as possible, a fall, buck and scale to

likely a substantial percentage of standing volume is no longer merchantable and only trees
greater than at least 18" dbh may have some value left. Hopefully the Forest has done this
recently.
Response: Fall, buck and scale is a site-specific study that samples cruised trees to determine
levels of hidden defect, such as that resulting from deterioration. The Forest does plan on
conducting a fall, buck and scale prior to, but as close as possible to advertisement of salvage
sawtimber sales. This provides the most efficient process for ensuring accurate values for forest
products.

Comment: 4) Because of deterioration, mbf/acre removal falls dramatically and drives stump to
truck costs up dramatically.
Response: As indicated in the economics section of the EIS, value falls substantially as time from

timber sale or stewardship contract utilizing site-specific information to determine the most
accurate and appropriate rate for stumpage.

Comment: 5) The Economics Report apparently does not analyze limitations to the operation
(LOPs). These could cause substantial moving of equipment from one area to another driving up
the costs. In some cases, LOPs may render entire subdivisions to be not feasible.
Response: The Economics report looks at the economics of the project in a broader context.
Specifics of the sale (or sales) will be assessed and incorporated into the timber sale offering
during the appraisal process. The presence or assumed presence of LOPs may result in a later
operational start date. However, these LOPs as well as other resource protection measures are
taken in to consideration and play into the decision-making process when packaging timber sales.

Comment: It's not clear if items #1-#5 above have been addressed. If not, the utility of the
economics information is very limited. I suggest that fall, buck and scale this spring between
Draft and Final and an LOP analysis is needed to determine if there's a viable project.
Response: The utility of the Economics report is not to replace the site-specific appraisal process,
but to evaluate and compare the general costs and benefits of implementing each alternative
analyzed in detail. This, in conjunction with timber deterioration rates following the wildfire,
helps to inform the decision maker of the scale of costs and benefits, by alternative, over time. A
fall, buck and scale is planned prior to advertisement of a salvage sale. Salvage timber sale
packages will incorporate LOPs and anticipated onset of wet weather conditions into the design
and appraisal prior to advertisement. In the event that a salvage timber sale is no longer viable,
other tools will be utilized to mitigate hazards and treat fuels, at a greater cost.

Response: All input submitted previous to this comment period has influenced how the project
was designed and analyzed. The Forest worked with the local community, including the Trinity
Collaborative's Fuelbreak Workgroup, in the identification of fire restoration project priorities
following the 2015 fires. Based on this outreach it was identified that roadside hazard mitigation
was the priority. Given that all the roads open to the public in the fire footprints have hazards the
Purpose and Need did not allow for certain areas to have treatment and others to be excluded. If
the Purpose and Need were not related to roadsides, was related to a specific type of hazard, or
other resource need there could have been an opportunity to approach the project differently,
possibly through a CE. That would not have met the priorities that the Forest identified or the
Purpose and Need developed for this project. The Proposed Action was largely based on the
Fuelbreak Workgroup's "From Fire-kill to Fuelbreaks" proposal, with some modification based on
compliance with law, regulation, and policy and minimization of significant effects. The full
proposal was considered as an Alternative Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study.

you have no reasonable expectation of ever being able to fund even a small portion of work that
needs to be done.
Response: The purpose of this project is to mitigate hazards that threaten public safety along
open roads, sustain and establish forest cover, and capture economic value. While our ability to
offset the cost of hazard reduction through the sale of salvaged timber will likely be lower than it
would have been if the project were completed in 2016, we will seek other funding to address the

Comment: The proposed action should be increased to include the 387 miles of roads affected by
the 2015 wildfires.
Response: The Purpose and Need on page 4 of the DEIS states: "Mitigate hazards (i.e. fire-killed
or defective trees and excessive fuels) that threaten public safety along open National Forest
System, County, and State roads." This purpose for the project defines the scope of treatments
that are necessary, and limits the opportunity to analyze alternatives that either treat more or less
than those roads that are open to the public. This project is responding to conditions that already
exist. The fires have already burned and caused hazards along roads that are open to the public.
To exclude one type of road over another because of the type of vehicle and the assumed use
seems arbitrary and capricious. Alternative 7: Treat Along High Use Roads Only was considered
but eliminated from detailed study due to it not meeting the Purpose and Need. A different
Purpose and Need or another project might allow for a different range of miles analyzed, but that
is not being considered at this time.

Response: Of the approximately 8,000 acres of treatment (within the footprint associated with the

Comment: According to the DEIS, the proposed project would reduce hazards to public safety
by removing or otherwise treating dead trees and vegetation on National Forest System lands
along public roads in areas that burned during the 2015 wildfire season. EPA acknowledges the
challenges presented by the fire recovery project, and the substantial work the Forest Service put
into the preparation of the DEIS. Given the high potential for erosion in severely burned areas
and the amounts of sediment that project activities would deliver to streams under all of the
evaluated alternatives, we appreciate the document's detailed discussion of soils management. We
support implementation of the Resource Protection Measures described in the document and the
best management practices listed in Appendix C. Based on our review, we have rated the
Preferred Alternative 1 as Lack of Objections (LO; see enclosed "Summary of EPA Rating

noting that, while some species may be able to adapt, populations of others are likely to be lost as
suitable habitat is diminished. We did not find a similar discussion of the effects of changing
environmental conditions on species to be planted as part of the proposed treatments; rather, the
DEIS states that planting would utilize "a species composition consistent with historic
conditions". EPA suggests that the Forest Service discuss, in the Final EIS, whether and, if so,
how changing environmental conditions would be considered in the selection of species for
restoration and replanting.
Response: A species composition consistent with historic conditions is still relevant given the
projected effects of a changing climate and the transitional nature of species distribution. When
implemented, mixed conifer species will be randomly interplanted in a proportion comparable to
historic levels, depending on the site. However, the Forest has chosen to utilize seed that was
collected from lower elevational bands than where it is planned for planting. As disclosed in the
Vegetation section, "in response to these shifting species distribution predictions, planting
associated with this project will include seed sown from generally one elevational band (500-feet)
lower, and within the same seed zone. This will allow for a more hardy transition to a warmer
climate as trees mature (Millar et al. 2007)."

meaningful consultation with tribes throughout the NEPA process, and recommend that the results
of consultations with all tribal governments and with the Tribal Historic Preservation Office/State

Response: The Forest will include the results of consultations with all tribal governments and
with the Tribal Historic Preservation Office/State Historic Preservation Office in the Final EIS.
The following summarizes consultation with tribal governments to date. Following guidelines
stipulated in the Programmatic Agreement among the U.S.D.A Forest Service, Pacific Southwest

for Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act for Management of
Historic Properties by the National Forests of the Pacific Southwest Region (PA) tribal
consultation letters were sent to the Hoopa, Karuk, Yurok, and Redding Rancheria. At this time no
responses have been received from the Karuk, Yurok, or Redding Rancheria. The Hoopa Tribal
Council requested a meeting with the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. On the July 13, 2016 the
District Rangers from the South Fork Management Unit and Trinity River Management Unit
along with the Forest Heritage Program Manager meet with the Hoopa Tribal Council to discuss
this project. Their primary concern was the River Complex portion of the project. Their primary
request was to have tribal monitors present, utilizing where possible their natural resource and
fire crews during implementation, and to have follow up engagement as the project progressed. It
is our intent to honor this request where feasible. A follow up consultation meeting with the
Hoopa Tribal Council is being planned to discuss updates to the project and process timelines.
The Forest is also sending consultation letters concerning this undertaking to the Quartz Valley

Comment: "The Chanchelulla LSR is key to some species, and its connectivity to other LSR's in
adjacent areas is very important at the landscape level."" -Upper Hayfork Creek Watershed
Analysis Chapter 1 page 4
""It's (Chanchelulla LSR RC 331) primary intent was to provide connectivity to Habitat
conservation Areas to the south along the east fringe of the NFS lands."" LSR Assessment 2-33
""Adjacent LSRs (to Corral LSR) include South Fork (RC-330) 5 miles to the southwest,
Chanchelulla (RC-331) 13 miles to the southeast…."" LSRA-53
""Connectivity (with to South Fork Mountain LSR-330) the Chanchelulla LSR is via the southern
portion of the LSR. Connectivity to the northern Corral Bottom LSR is provided via Allen Creek
and Underwood Creek Drainages. These two drainages continue to provide adequate connectivity
and late-successional habitat. In general, connectivity to the east, along most of this 26 mile LSR
is more limited due to large conflagration, which occurred in 1987. Connectivity to the west
becomes somewhat limited along the west aspects of South Fork Mountain because this area
consists of large dry mountain meadows and extensive oak-savannah."" LSRA 52
Half of the proposed treatments, 4,026 acres, are within the Corral, South Fork and Chanchelulla
LSRs. The DEIS does not discuss the current conditions of the LSRs, why they were established
into the reserve system nor does it mention or discuss the LSR's in the effects analysis. While the
project does focus on roadside hazards it is important to look at the proposed project and its effect
on connectivity and habitat fragmentation most often caused by the road system. The road density
in the LSRs and project area is heavy. Further, landing construction is not consistent with LSR
objectives and would further degrade habitat connectivity, which is best addressed in Alternative
5. Please provide LSR-specific evaluation of project effects.
The primary architect of the NWFP LSR system has written that:
""Salvage logging of large snags and down boles does not contribute to recovery of latesuccessional forest habitat; in fact, the only activity more antithetical to the recovery process
would be removal of surviving green trees from burned sites. Large snags and logs of decay
resistant species, such as Douglas-fir and cedars, are critical as early and late successional
wildlife habitat as well as for sustaining key ecological processes associated with nutrient,
hydrologic, and energy cycles.""-Dr. Jerry Franklin.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

The only detail in the DEIS concerning LSRs at page 7 reads:
The LSRA's Chapter 4 includes Activity Design Criterion #7 Fuel Reduction (primarily dead and
down) for which the objective is to remove dead and dying trees in order to protect the remaining
existing and developing late-successional habitat and to facilitate the development of reforested
areas toward late-successional conditions following a stand-replacing event. This criterion applies
to:
a. Areas greater than 10-acres that have received a stand-replacing event (such as wildfire)
resulting in a canopy closure of less than 40%, and includes the following treatment standards:
b. All standing live trees should be retained, including those injured (e.g., scorched) but likely to
survive;
c. Following stand-replacing disturbance, management should focus on retaining snags that are
likely to persist until late-successional conditions have developed and the new stand is again
producing large snags. The biomass left in snags can be credited toward the amount of coarse
woody debris biomass needed to achieve management objectives; and
d. Removal of snags and logs may be necessary to reduce hazards to humans along roads and
trails, and in or adjacent to campgrounds. Where materials must be removed from the site, as in a
campground or on a road, a salvage sale is appropriate. In other areas, such as along roads,
leaving material on site may be considered. (Emphasis added)"
Response: The NWFP describes that a management assessment should be prepared for each large
LSR (or group of smaller LSRs) before habitat manipulation activities are designed and
implemented. In 1999, the Forest prepared the Forestwide Late-Successional Reserve Assessment
(LSRA), which met this requirement. The LSRA activity design criteria identify specific
objectives and criteria to ensure consistency with LSR objectives. In their August 26, 1999 letter
that documents review of the LSRA, the REO determined that the silvicultural activities
described in the LSRA were consistent with the standards and guidelines of the NWFP and were
exempted from further project-level REO review, which met the obligation of REO/RIEC review
of thinning or other silvicultural activities. As the comment indicates, the project has been
designed to be consistent with the Forestwide LSRA, especially relevant is Activity Design
Criterion #7 which addresses actions following a stand replacing event such as a wildfire. The
LSRA also describes the existing and desired conditions for each LSR and their value as part of
the LSR network, as is generally quoted in the comment. However, the LSRA does not serve as a
commitment to analyze the LSR, a land allocation under the Forest Plan, at the project level, but
to serve as guidance document for management. The existing condition of the project area,
including LSRs, is discussed throughout the EIS. This project is consistent with the LSRA and
was designed to promote hazard mitigation, maintain and establish forest cover, and capture value
through providing forest products within the narrow roadside buffers along open roads. It is
unclear why the commenter requests the LSR land allocation be further stratified into another
analysis of existing conditions. As indicated in the comment, connectivity of late successional
habitat was an important theme in LSR designation. Therefore, fragmentation is an important
concept to consider and played a role in project design. The project will not downgrade any NSO
nesting/roosting, foraging or dispersal habitat, and connectivity between these habitats will thus
be maintained. A small amount of PFF habitat will be downgraded or removed. However, these
habitats lack the overhead canopy cover that facilitates connectivity between suitable habitats. As
a result, effects to PFF habitats are not expected to have any meaningfully measurable effect on
habitat connectivity. Also it is important to note that landing construction is not inconsistent with
LSR objectives. Landing construction is a necessary and connected action to forest management
involving any timber removal, which is also consistent with LSR goals and objectives if designed
deliberately for hazard reduction purposes and to promote long term sustainability of late
successional forests. In the case of this project, landing construction is limited to 0.25 acres each,
and will generally use the existing roadside or turnouts or areas of concentrated dead snags
already designated for hazard felling. New landings are described and quantified in the BA, but

are not mapped because their locations are not known at this time. However, an opening of such a
small size is not likely to convert a patch of suitable NSO habitat to unsuitable habitat. Openings
of this size are instead often considered to enhance NSO foraging opportunities within both
nesting/roosting and foraging habitats. They are also not considered a meaningfully measurable
impediment to NSO dispersal. Individual habitat elements may be removed for landings in small
non-contiguous patches but the degree to which this occurs is not expected to affect the
functionality of habitat. Note that any new landing construction is temporary and will be tilled
and mulched following use.

Comment: In looking at Table 3-62, "Comparison of impacts of the action alternatives that are
considered in detail," it is clear that at maximum only 1,400 acres of the 8,000 acres of treatment
burned at high to moderate severity. The footnote at page 305 states, "For this report (Economic)
"salvage acres" refers to areas of concentrated stands of dead timber. As this concentration of
mortality only occurs in pockets along the roads identified for salvage, and rarely along whole
roads (and only dead trees are identified for removal)…" Alternatives 4 and 5 would best meet
the standards and guidelines for this land allocation.
Response: An estimated 1,400 segmented acres of the 15,000 acres analyzed in Alternative 3, or
approximately 700 acres of the 8,000 acres analyzed in the proposed action, were identified as
having concentrated stands of dead merchantable-sized trees within the road segments identified
for salvage through timber sales. However, whole road segments were identified for salvage
opportunities to capture any other economic value that may occur outside of known concentrated
stands. Along road segments in the project area, there exist situations where there are pockets of
highly concentrated dead trees and areas with less concentrated dead trees that are also posing
hazards to the public in between. These isolated or discontinuous occurrences could also be
captured with salvage removal so the analysis considered the full extent of treatment acres as a
possibility for salvage impacts.

Comment: The Fuel Reduction criterion also states that the short-term impact on the LSR/MLSA
must be neutral and that treatment should not diminish habitat suitability now or in the future. All
alternatives would affect northern spotted owl critical habitat and High-Value Wildlife
Conservation Areas, however Alternative 5 has the least impact on LSR habitat.
Response: The Forest Plan provides a general guideline that projects that are neutral or beneficial
to the creation and maintenance of late successional habitat are allowed (Forest Plan 4-39).
However, it does not require that proposed actions have no effect on NSO habitat suitability
within LSRs. As designed, the project, located along a narrow roadside buffer along open roads,
does not downgrade or remove any nesting and roosting or foraging habitat. In addition, fuels
treatments followed by planting where existing conifer cover has been removed by the fire will
accelerate the development of late successional characteristics that otherwise may take decades
for seedlings to establish. The proposed action would have limited short-term effects on habitat
suitability (degrade, but not downgrade) within LSR, but would reduce fire behavior and improve
safe ingress and egress for fire suppression and the public. As a result, it would reduce the
potential for high-severity fire to remove large amounts of NSO habitat in the future, thereby
contributing toward long term habitat sustainability.

Owl populations are under severe biological stress over major portions of their range. The overall
population is declining at a rate of 3.8 percent per year. A current regional assessment of
population numbers has not been completed since the Westside Project on the Klamath National
Forest and the widespread post-fire logging on private lands throughout Northern California. Any
further degradation of habitat or harm to these species is pushing them closer to extinction.
Alternatives 4 and 5 would have the lowest impact and best address harm to NSO and Critical
Habitat."
Response: The primary intent of the Chanchelulla LSR (RC-331) was to provide connectivity to
other LSRs to the south along the eastern boundary of NFS lands (LSRA p 2-33). The Forest
recognizes the value of the LSR network to NSO and Critical Habitat. As a component of that, the
project has been designed to limit impact to NSO habitat by only treating a narrow buffer along
roads in lieu of landscape treatments (see Alternative 9 regarding landscape level treatments).
Under the proposed action, less than 475 acres of roadside treatments may incorporate salvage
removal within the Chanchelulla LSR.
Long-term NSO population trends and the effects of the 2015 fires on NSO in the project action
area are addressed in the BA, and the BO from the US Fish and Wildlife Service will also address
population trends for this species. It is unclear what the commenter is referring to by the term
"regional assessment," but a regional re-assessment between the 2015 fires and the proposed
activities is not necessary for this analysis to be complete and represent the best available
scientific information.

Comment: We are concerned that the Limited Operating Period exemption will not adequately
mitigate impacts to breeding and nesting owls. We urge the agency to use protocol spot check
surveys, which requires three visits.
Response: Limited operating periods for NSO were established for the majority of the project
area. Exemptions from these LOP's were developed in close coordination with the US Fish and
Wildlife Service (BA pp. 34-35). Their purpose is to facilitate prompt implementation of the
project to respond to the urgent need to abate the danger posed by hazard trees. These exemptions
were established only in areas where less than ten percent of the potential disturbance area is
"selected for" or "highly selected for" in the US Fish and Wildlife Service's NSO Relative Habitat
Suitability modeling. The potential effects of these exemptions on individual NSO's are disclosed
and analyzed in the "Assessing Effects to Individual NSO Territories" section of the BA (pp. 5370) and will also be addressed in the BO from USFWS. The project resource protection measures
also require protocol stand searches in all the high-value NSO core areas that are at least partially
within an LOP exemption area. Spot checks are typically used to supplement protocol NSO
surveys prior to the beginning of surveys in years 3 and 4 of the survey effort. Their coverage
extends out 0.25 mi. from project activities. Stand searches were recommend by USFWS rather
than spot checks. Stand searches use the methodology used for follow-up surveys, which
typically covers a larger radius that 0.25 mi. and are thus more likely to detect NSO farther away
from historic use sites. In the event that NSO nesting activity is observed, LOP's will be
implemented to protect these sites during the NSO breeding season. Although the high-value
NSO core areas within these exemption areas will be subject to stand searches, the determination
reached in the BA is still "may affect, likely to adversely affect" due to the possibility of
disturbance during the NSO breeding season.

Comment: We are concerned that the project will affect the Bald Eagles and Northern Goshawk
nest sites on Browns Creek should Limited Operating Periods (LOPs) be lifted without protocol
surveys. The DEIS for both species states on page 109 that, "Surveys to protocol can be used to
generate new breeding activity results. If subsequent protocol compliant surveys show no nesting
activity within 0.75/0.5 (respectively) miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation,
LOPs may be lifted." Our concern here lies with the word can and in order to meet the Standards
and Guidelines in the Forest Plan it should be replaced with the word must or will. Please provide
this clarification in the FEIS.
Response: The intent of the language in these RPMs is to state that LOPs cannot be lifted unless
protocol surveys are completed. There no requirement to conduct protocol surveys for NSO, but
any suitable habitat is considered occupied. The LOPs are RPMs that are included to reduce
impacts. The RPM states, "If subsequent protocol compliant surveys show no nesting activity
within 0.75/0.5 (respectively) miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation, LOPs
may be lifted." This statement indicates that although LOPs may be lifted in this situation,
managers might choose not to lift them. Replacing the word "may" with "must" or "will" would
require managers to lift the LOP if protocol surveys showed no nesting activity within 0.75/0.5
miles of proposed activities at the time of implementation. The LOPs in the RPMs for goshawks,
peregrine falcons, and bald eagles are from the habitat capability models in Appendix G of the

protection on federal lands under the Northwest Forest Plan. Removing protection was based on
the large number of new sites, as a result of pre-project surveys on federal lands. However, no
considerations were given to population numbers or age structure at these sites, or whether
individual sites actually represented new or distinct populations. More importantly, no
consideration was given to the available molecular and morphological data that indicate high
genetic diversity, and the probability that this taxon actually is more than a single species. We
further iterate the statement in the LSRA concerning the lack of surveys and lack of knowledge
on species presence. Alternative 5 would have the least effect on all Survey and Manage species.
Response: The 2001 Annual Species Review (ASR121) for Survey and Manage species,
considered unpublished protein electrophoresis and morphological work and genetic diversity
information in a report by Dr. Meredith Mahoney for the Del Norte salamander. As a result of this
review process, this species is no longer addressed in Survey and Manage analyses. Since the
commenter does not reference a particular manuscript or journal that references molecular and
morphological data, we cannot determine if it is the same information that was considered in the
ASR. The best available scientific information at the time of the 2001 ASR was used for
assessing the Del Norte Salamander population, including species numbers and locations.

Comment: "Portions of ten (HUC 5) watersheds on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest burned in
the 2015 fires. All of the HUC 5 watersheds are listed as sediment-impaired under section 303(d)
of the Clean Water Act except for the Canyon Creek and New River watersheds. Then at the
DEIS page 164 it states that, ""A portion of Burnt Ranch is sediment impaired, and Lower Trinity
River, Canyon Creek and Browns Creek are sediment impaired. The sediment impairment has
resulted in non-attainment of designated beneficial uses - specifically commercial and sport
fishing; cold freshwater habitat; rare, threatened, and endangered species; migration of aquatic
organisms; and spawning, reproduction, and/or early development."" Either way, the vast
majority of the project contains sediment-impaired watersheds.
Seven watersheds comprise the bulk of the fire area; these include Browns Creek, Burnt Ranch,
Lower Hayfork Creek, Lower South Fork Trinity River, Middle South Fork Trinity River, New
River, and Upper Hayfork Creek
(DEIS 161). There are four Tier 1 Key Watersheds within the Project area: Upper South Fork
Trinity River (Hayfork Creek to Headwaters); New River (Mouth to Virgin Creek); North Fork
Trinity River (Mouth to Headwaters); Canyon Creek (Mouth to Headwaters). Tier 1 Key
Watersheds contribute directly to conservation of at risk anadromous salmonids and have a high
potential of being restored as part of a watershed restoration program.
Roads and forest management are significant contributors of sediment to impaired watersheds. In
the South Fork Trinity River sub-basin roads are the most significant cause of management
related sediment production. Management related sources (timber harvest, roads, and

Middle Trinity River area (including New River, Burnt Ranch and Canyon Creek), only about
19% of the total sediment yield was caused by management related activities, with roads (17%)
yielding a much greater sediment supply than timber harvest (1%).
All project alternatives include 47 culvert replacements or upgrades (DEIS 21) and there are
1,386 acres of treatments planned in Riparian Reserves. Alternatives 4 and 5 have significantly
less acres of heavy equipment use attributed to lesser amounts of road reconstruction and use, the
least amount of landing construction and machine piling. Overall, Alternative 5 has the least
impact to soils, hydrology, Riparian Reserves and all of the 303 (d) listed 5th field watersheds and
Planning Watersheds and should be chosen in order to comply with the Clean Water Act, Basin
Plan, Northwest Forest Plan and Aquatic Conservation Strategy, Shasta-Trinity Forest Plan and
the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act."
Response: Thank you for your continued interest in the management of the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest. Your comment will be considered in the decision process of the Responsible
Official. It is not correct to say that all of the HUC 5 watersheds are listed as sediment-impaired
under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act except for the Canyon Creek and New River
watersheds. New River and a portion of Burnt Ranch were delisted in 2012 California Integrated
Report Clean Water Act Sections 303(d) and 305(b) (State Water Resources Control Board,
2015). All of the other HUC 5 watersheds (including Canyon Creek) in the project area are listed
as sediment impaired under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. It is not correct to say that
there are four Key Watersheds within the project area. There are two Key Watersheds in the
project area: Upper South Fork Trinity River and New River Key Watersheds lie within the
project area. The North Fork Trinity River Key Watershed lies outside of the project area. Canyon
Creek watershed lies within the project area, but its boundary does not match the Canyon Creek
Key Watershed. Canyon Creek Key Watershed lies outside of the project area. The DEIS (pg.
182) and Fisheries BA will be updated to reflect this distinction. Road reconstruction and type of
use would be the same for all action alternatives because the requirement to treat legacy sediment
sites is based on the project area. The Waiver requirement of treating legacy sediment sites within
the project area for Category B projects does not consider whether or not a site is in an impaired
watershed, or whether or not it is in a Key Watershed. However, treatment prioritization is
required in the Waiver Application, and the Shasta-Trinity National Forest does consider sediment
sites located in impaired watersheds and Key Watersheds to be high priorities for treatment.
However, these are not the only factors that are considered in prioritizing treatment. Other factors
include: priority watershed, poor quality aquatic habitat, critical coho habitat, highly erodible and
unstable bedrock geology, large fill volume, large diversion potential, and cost. Final
prioritization of the legacy sediment sites to be treated will be established in the Waiver
Application after the Record of Decision is signed. Treatment acres that occur in Riparian
Reserves are disclosed by alternative in Table 2-2 of the DEIS (pg. 41).

Comment: "We encourage the agency to examine the soil compaction monitoring reports from
other national forests that clearly show long-lasting and significant soil damage from tractor
piling this includes the Payette and Kootenai National Forest. Manual piling or underburning is
far preferable to tractor piling and have none of the negative impacts to soils associated with
tractor piling. Hence manual piling or underburning would better achieve the stated purpose and
need for the project.
Heavy machine use causes soil compaction and displacement. Soil compaction is an increase in
bulk density with a corresponding decrease in soil porosity. Compaction reduces soil productivity
through a reduction in tree root growth, (Graecen and Sands 1980 (1); Froehlich and McNabb
1984 (2)) and may be produced by a single pass of logging equipment across a site (Wronski
1984 (3)). Productivity losses have been documented for whole sites (West and Thomas 1981 (4))
and height, and timber volume (Greacen for individual trees (Froehlich 1979 (5), Helms and
Hipkin 1986 (6)). Decreases in important microbial populations have also been observed in
compacted soils (Amaranthus et al. 1996.) (7) Soil compaction may also increase surface runoff
because of reducing infiltration (Graecen and Sands 1980.) (8).
Soil displacement from ground-based machine use occurs when the tracked equipment turns on
its skids pushing the soil into small piles, or berms, along the skid trails. This displacement of the
topsoil removes the organic litter layer and exposes mineral soil. Removal of the loose, organic
surface materials promotes surface sealing and crusting that decreases infiltration capacity and
may increase erosion (Child et. Al. 1989.) (9) Soil displacement also results in a loss of important
soil biota, such as mycorrhizal fungi, which facilitates nutrient uptake by plants (Amaranthus et
al. 1989 and 1996.) (10)".
Response: Compaction and displacement happens during all mechanical operations (salvage,
thinning, mastication, etc.) using tractors, excavators, skidders, etc. but compaction and
displacement are only problematic when they are so extensive and severe that they are
detrimental to soil health. The Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards, found in Appendix O, focus on
the issue of extent and severity of soil impacts.
The National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA)
(http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/NFMA1976.pdf) recognized the fundamental need to
protect and, where appropriate, improve the quality of soil, water, and air resources. With respect
to soils, NFMA requires that the Forest Service manage lands so as not to impair their long-term
productivity. Further, activities must be monitored to ensure that productivity is protected. This
law led to subsequent regulation and policy to execute the law at various levels of management.
The National Soil Management Handbook (USDA Forest Service, 1991) defines soil productivity
and components of soil productivity, and establishes guidance for measuring soil productivity. "In
determining a significant change in productivity, a 15% reduction in inherent soil productivity

potential will be used as a basis for setting threshold values. Threshold values would apply to
measurable or observable soil properties or conditions that are sensitive to significant change. The
threshold values, along with areal extent limits, would serve as an early warning signal of reduced
soil productive capacity, where changes to management practices or rehabilitation measures may
be warranted. “Management activities have potential to cause various types and degrees of
disturbance. Soil disturbance is categorized into compaction, displacement, puddling, severe
burning, and erosion. Direction was established that properties, measures, and thresholds relative
to these disturbance types would be developed at the Regional and Forest levels, known as Soil
Quality Standards. The 1995 Region 5 Soil Management Handbook Supplement (superseded by
FSM 2550) helped to establish the forest objectives for the Soil Management Program and Soil
Quality Analysis Standards (SQAS).
These analysis standards are intended to help determine if ecosystem health and long-term
productivity are being maintained. SQAS provide measures and threshold values that indicate
when changes in soil properties and soil conditions may result in significant change or
impairment of key soil functions of soil productivity and hydrologic function. Soil disturbance is
considered "detrimental" if thresholds are exceeded and subsequent impairment of soil functions
is judged likely after a soil & site specific assessment. Detrimental disturbance refers to the
severity of impacts, which may be very small scale in occurrence. The extent of detrimental soil
disturbance shall not be of a size or pattern that would result in a significant change in key soil
functions for the activity area. Note that the activity area is the scale at which impacts are
ultimately assessed, defined as the area where soil disturbing activities take place, such as a
timber harvest unit in a sale area or a burn area within a prescribed burn project; system roads,
trails, and other areas not dedicated to growing vegetation (other dedicated uses) are not included
as part of an activity area.
Both severity and extent of detrimental disturbance are important considerations that must be
evaluated together to assess potential adverse impacts on soils of the activity area. As such,
detrimental disturbance can be allowed on a small portion of a unit - this does not constitute
adverse impacts; conversely, minor disturbance can be allowed in most of a unit - this likewise
does not constitute adverse impacts. Aerial extent limits for different disturbance types are not
established in the R5 handbook supplement. In 2010 the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest)
adopted the National Soil Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (NSDMP) (Page-Dumroese, et. al.
2009) level one analysis (visual soil disturbance indicators) along with developing a level two
analysis (validation sampling) using transects to measure erosion, disturbance, compaction,
displacement, and cover (Rust, 2011). Past project activities on the Forest (Rust, 2015) show
when fine-textured and coarse-textured soils are operated on with track-based mechanical
equipment when dry (less than 20% soil moisture by weight), compaction levels never exceeded
10% decrease in soil porosity. But when soils were moist (greater than 20% soil moisture by
weight) compaction levels on fine-textured soils were exceeded over the 15% Forest Plan aerial
extent.
Resource Protection Measures, particularly 44, 45, 47, and 52 i(n the DEIS) will ensure that that
soil compaction is within the soil quality standards. For machine-piling, monitoring results on the
Forest showed minimal soil impacts from machine piling and burning using small tractors fitted
with brush rakes, which is the typical type of equipment used on NFS lands in Trinity County.
Soil burning and soil displacement was minimal and soil compaction from machine-piling was
minimal only adding 2 to 4% increase in bulk density (Rust, 2013).
Machine piling earned a reputation as a harmful practice on soils in the past from the era where
machine piling almost exclusively referred to site preparation for planting after a clear-cut, often
occurring on moderately steep slopes. Impacts from tractor piling can be high if done improperly,
especially on wet soils, but research conducted on the Shasta Trinity National Forest has shown
that, on average, tractor piling added 2 percent detrimental soil disturbance as displacement and
compaction to the activity units when conducted on dry soils (Powers and Young, 2005).

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

On the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, tractor-piling operations are mostly conducted on slopes
less than 35%. For this project, machine piling will only be allowed on slopes less than 40%
(RPM #62 in the DEIS). Much smaller tractors equipped with a brush rake on the blade are
expected to be used for this project, which result in little to no topsoil displacement or
compaction that would be of any detrimental degree. Piles are to be "clean" (without soil), which
helps them burn properly. Tractor piling has been examined extensively on the Forest and when
soils are dry impacts are minimal and well below the Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards (Rust,
2013). This is ensured by the soil resource protection measures for this project (listed in the
Physical Science report pg. 118).
Heavy machine use can cause soil compaction, as evidenced by the following studies: Tree and
Sands 1980; Froehlich and McNabb 1984; Wronski 1984; West and Thomas 1981; Greacen and
Froehlich 1979; Helms and Hipkin 1986; Amaranthus et al. 1996; Graecen and Sands 1980. Soil
quality standards and soil resource protection measures will ensure soils are dry enough for
mechanical operations to support equipment without causing detrimental soil impacts of
compaction.
Soil displacement from ground-based machines has also been observed in the studies cited: Child
et. Al. 1989; Amaranthus et al. 1989 and 1996. Again all of this is known and true but the real
issue is when operations take place, are the soils wet or very moist or are the soils dry? This is
why we have the soil quality standards and soil resource protection measures to ensure soils are
dry enough for mechanical operations to support equipment without causing detrimental soil
impacts of displacement.
On steeper ground (>35% slope), manual piling and underburning will be used to reduce fuels. If
burned at low to moderate burn intensity little soil impacts occur. For machine-piling and burning
the key is soil moisture (bearing strength) when soils are dry enough so little displacement and
compaction occur. Machine-piling is fast and effective in managing excessive fuels and when
soils are dry impacts are minimal. Also tractor-piling is safer for personnel in regards to larger
fuels in the difficulty of staking those fuels. By use of the Soil Moisture Operability field Guide
(Rust, 2009) soils are tested before operations to insure soils are dry enough for heavy equipment
operations so soil quality standards are not exceeded.

Comment: "Please note how the Medford BLM recently responded to requests from the timber
industry to authorize machine piling on federal lands:
Comment 4: We asked that BLM provide some flexibility in how fuels would be treated by
focusing on the desired goals. The BLM has restricted fuels treatments to handpiling and burning.
Contractors could use light weight equipment to treat fuels without detrimentally compacting
soils.
Response: The commenter has not provided details on methodology or supporting science that
would support the claim that machine piling couldn’t be done without detrimentally compacting
soils in excess of RMP standards for percent area compacted by current activities.
Resource management plans call for limiting compaction in harvested areas in order to minimize
soil productivity losses. Therefore, no further use of mechanical equipment for fuels reduction
was proposed, as ground-based logging would compact up to 12 percent of the harvest units. This
is particularly important in the Cottonwood planning area as the majority of soils contain high
rock content. It was identified that ripping the soils in this area would bring rocks and cobbles to

the surface. The priority was given to minimizing the soil area compacted instead of trying to
mitigate the effects. Additionally, the harvest prescription resulting in relatively few trees per acre
being cut minimizes the slash, and consequently, also reduces the need for mechanical fuel
treatment. Medford BLM Cottonwood Project EA Appendix A, Response to Comments Page 3-2
(Accessed April 31,
2017), http://www.blm.gov/or/districts/medford/plans/files/Revised_EA_final.pdf"
The response from the Medford BLM for their project is noted. For this project, the effects from
machine piling on soil compaction are disclosed on pages 236 - 239 of the DEIS. The Forest
analyzed Alternative 5 in detail which does not allow machine piling. In Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and
4, machine piling is not anticipated to be needed in most cases but is needed as a treatment
method option in order to meet the scale of treatment described in each alternative. The details of
this project and that of the BLM's project are different, including the Purpose and Need. Knowing
that there are meaningful differences between the projects, the use of machine piling is only
expected in areas that have large residual material that exceed the CWD and tons per acre
requirements following the initial entry, although it has been analyzed in all treatment areas to
allow for implementation to respond to conditions at the time of treatment.

Comment: Please note that the DEIS does not differentiate between acres proposed for ground
based and those proposed for skyline yarding. This could have a negative effect on soils that was
not analyzed or disclosed. The DEIS does propose design features for machine piling, mostly
restricting it to landings, however new landing construction is proposed for all but one action
alternative and would therefore still have overarching negative impacts on soils, wildlife, Critical
Habitat, LSR characteristics and watershed health. Alternative 5 is the only alternative to
adequately address the impacts that machine piling and new landing construction would have on
soils and habitat fragmentation, especially in LSR's and Critical Habitat.
Response: The hydrology and soils analysis for this project considered all areas identified for
salvage as having ground based disturbance. While this is a conservative estimate, as slope
indicates only approximately half of the areas identified would be appropriate for ground
operations, end lining to roads and landings would most likely be utilized in lieu of skyline
yarding. In the event that skyline yarding is utilized for timber removal, the overall impacts
would be less than analyzed. Landing construction, a connected action as disclosed in Chapter 2,
and machine piling have been incorporated into resource analyses including soils, wildlife,
Critical Habitat and hydrology, for Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4.
New landings are described and quantified in the BA, however, an opening of such a small size
does not result in a meaningfully measurable impediment to NSO dispersal or fragmentation.
Openings of this size are instead considered valuable components of NSO habitat that enhance
NSO foraging opportunities within both nesting/roosting and foraging habitats. Note that given
the roadside nature of this project, new landing construction needs are minimal. The project
design prohibits mechanical or tractor-based operations in NSO nesting/roosting habitats within
high-value wildlife conservation areas (DEIS p. 30). This RPM would not allow landings to be
used in these areas.

Many of our concerns for impacts in IRAs are similar to those within the LSR (e.g. habitat
fragmentation and connectivity). Roadless areas are the last places on our national forests that
provide critical wildlife habitat connectivity which are essential for species survival and climate
adaption. There are multiple roadless area characteristics that would be affected by the project
including high quality and undisturbed soil, diversity of plant and animal communities, habitat for
all species dependent on large undisturbed areas of land, reference landscapes, natural appearing
landscapes with high scenic quality and other locally identified unique characteristics that may
not yet be determined. Alternative 5 best addresses the need to meet the Roadless Rule."
Response: Thank you for your continued interest in the management of the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest. Your comment will be considered in the decision process of the Responsible
Official. The inventoried roadless area discussion in the DEIS (pp. 320-336) discloses the effects
of each alternative to the nine roadless area characteristics. These include high quality and
undisturbed soils, diversity of plant and animal communities, habitat for all species dependent on
large undisturbed areas of land, reference landscapes and naturally occurring landscapes. At this
time none of the six roadless areas have identified unique characteristics, so effects of activities
on that element are not analyzed. The comparison between the number of roads within each IRA
and the number of roads within a quarter mile of each IRA was highlighted by the commenter.
This information was provided in the analysis to show how relatively unroaded the IRAs are
compared to adjacent lands. It was also presented to highlight the fact that many of the treatment
areas within the IRA are the result of the treatment buffer placed on roads that are adjacent to, but
not within the IRAs. Treatments proposed to mitigate hazards along open roads in the fire
footprints both adjacent to and within the IRAs are included in the effects analysis.

Comment: "Unclear if Project Meets Purpose and Need
It is unclear whether the salvage component meets the stated purpose and need of the project. A
purpose of the project is to ""[c]apture economic value and support the economies of local

project that captures economic value for both the Forest Service and any private timber
purchasers. Similarly, a stated need of the project is to ""[q]uickly recover the monetary value of

wood through salvage and sale, where feasible and appropriate, to provide economic stimulus to
local communities."" (DEIS at 5, citing Forest Plan 4-5).
To be frank, large projects take a long time. There are numerous steps that must be taken before
implementation can begin: the Shasta-Trinity will need to produce the Final Environmental
Impact Statement and the Record of Decision (ROD); and complete consultation with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service; and be enrolled by the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control
Board under a waiver. Looking to another large post-fire project on the Klamath National Forest
(KNF) helps to illustrate probable timeline. The Westside Fire Recovery Project DEIS was issued
on March 5, 2015 and the ROD was signed February 29, 2016.
Here, the project DEIS was on March 17, 2017. Based on a reasonable timeline it is likely that
logging would not begin until 2018. Even if the timeline was shortened and begin in 2017, it is
likely that logging would run into wet weather restrictions.
As is clear from the DEIS and Economic Report, ""due to deterioration, it's expected that the
Project will be deficit -$476,527 if the investment is made within the 2017 calendar year."" (DEIS
at 309; see also id. at 310). EPIC is unclear how a deficit sale fits the purpose and need for the
project. Overestimating Timber Value
EPIC is concerned that the Forest Service is basing its economic analysis off too rosy of
projections of potential revenue. The DEIS repeatedly acknowledges that ""[m]any fire-killed tree
species will lose a significant portion of their monetary value and volume for products in a very
short time."" The DEIS provides value per tree species based on data from the 2015 Western
Wood Products Summary. (DEIS at 306, Table 3-96). On average, the DEIS predicts an average
value of $377.03/mbf. The DEIS further acknowledges that price/mbf will diminish over time as
the timber deteriorates. (DEIS at 309). The Forest Service never clearly states what revenue, as
measured in $/mbf, it expects. Please provide a clear estimate of revenue, measured both in $/mbf
and in total dollar amounts in the final EIS.
EPIC is concerned that the revenue estimated by the Shasta-Trinity is too high.
The only mills that will purchase substantially deteriorated post-fire timber are veneer mills to be
used as interior layers in plywood. The DEIS acknowledges that the only mill in Trinity County is
the Trinity River Lumber Company. (DEIS at 303). The Trinity River Lumber Company produces
structural timber products not plywood veneer. In their comments, the Trinity Lumber Company
wrote, ""In order to quickly recover value this project needs to be fully executed and operated by
early summer 2016."
Response: The third component of the Project's purpose is to capture economic value and support
the economies of local communities by providing forest products. The purpose and need does not
specify a minimum threshold, as is evident with the inclusion of Alternative 5, which does not
include a commercial salvage component. However, the availability of commercial firewood
removal, small timber sales, biomass, etc., to the local communities would still meet that purpose.
Salvage timber sales are a tool for reducing hazard trees and treating fuels in a more costeffective manner by capturing the economic value of fire-killed trees. Even when the value of the
timber is less than the cost of abating the hazard, timber value can help offset some of the costs of
hazard mitigation. The economics report focused on the sawtimber value as that is a tangible
means of comparing likely salvage treatments. At some point, however, there is not enough
monetary value in wood products to support the cost of harvesting and processing that wood. The
economics report shows when that is likely to occur and how it affects jobs and wages in the local
community. The Western Woods Products Association (WWPA) feeds into the base indices for
assessing timber value ($/CCF) by species. Utilizing these base indices, individual timber sale
offerings will have a project specific appraisal calculated prior to advertisement which
incorporates cruise volume data, deterioration factors, haul distance, and other adjustments
(landing decommissioning, subsoiling main skid trails, etc.). However, the WWPA index is the
standard way to calculate the estimated value of timber at this time. See Tables 3-97 and 3-98 of

Comment: "Salvage Will Make Project More Expensive to Implement
Salvage without treating post-logging fuels would make fuel conditions worse in the immediate
future compared to no action at all. For this reason, the Trinity Salvage Project proposed postsalvage fuel reduction treatments. Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 all would require post-logging slash
treatment that could cost more than the revenue from logging.
The DEIS concludes, ""Salvage harvest alone does not significantly reduce fire behavior (Donato
et al. 2006)."" In fact, Donato et al. 2006 found that salvage made fuel conditions worse in the
immediate future. Timber harvesting, including post-fire ""salvage"" logging, is known to
increase surface fuels loads by transferring non-merchantable trees, limbs, tops and other
""slash"" to the surface (Donato et. al 2006, Donato et al. 2012; Keyser et al. 2009; McGinnis et
al. 2010). These elevated surface fuels may persist for ~20 years (McIver and Ottman 2007;
McGinnis et al. 2010).
EPIC anticipates high amounts of slash from this project. Because only large diameter snags are
likely to retain sufficient value to recoup costs in harvesting and transportation, there are likely to
be many snags that will not go to market. As is often the case, a timber company will fell all trees,
including those that they do not anticipate bringing to market, because it decreases risks to
loggers. Post-fire salvage logging is likely to result in higher than normal amounts of slash,
including jackpotted fuels that take additional time to decompose as most of the fuel is not in
contact with the ground.
However, as acknowledged by the DEIS, the cost to clean up those units after salvage logging
will be more expensive because of the necessary fuel treatments. If logging occurred in 2017,
post-logging slash treatment would cost $476,527 for Alternative 1, $625,644 for Alternative 2,
$947,054 for Alternative 3, and $130,159 for Alternative 4. While logging may provide some jobs
to the local community, it would make project completion more difficult by increasing the total
costs to the Forest Service."
Response: Alternatives 1, 2, 3, & 4 combine felling of standing dead trees with surface fuel
treatments. Surface fuel treatments without felling of standing dead trees would temporarily
reduce fuel loading, but as the standing dead trees fell, surface fuel accumulations would
increase. Treating surface fuels beneath standing dead trees could expose workers to unsafe
conditions. Salvage activities can result in further accumulations of surface fuels. Secondary fuel
treatments are intended to reduce that loading to meet the desired condition. For Alternatives 1, 2,
3, and 4, salvage units will have secondary fuels treatments. The Donato et al. paper has been
disputed by Newton et al. 2006, which stated that the paper lacks adequate context and supporting
information to be clearly interpreted by scientists, resource managers, policy-makers, and the
public. Donato found salvage without secondary fuels treatments made things worse, as breakage,
limbs and tops were left on site, increasing fire behavior and effect should another fire burn
through the area. This project implements secondary fuels treatments to achieve the desired
condition in all salvage units. In some areas, because of the severity of the wildfire, some limbs,
tops, and breakage need to be left for resource needs. Post-harvest fuels that are left on site would
not exceed the maximum of 20 tons per acre which would maintain desired fire behavior and
effects should a future fire burn through the treatment area. Secondary fuels treatments would be
funded through multiple sources, including timber receipts, retained receipts, appropriated funds,
and any others that come available. Donato et al. 2012 indicated that post-fire logging altered the
620

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

fuel profile of early-seral stands (standing material removed or transferred, short-term increase in
surface fuels, likely reduction in future large fuel accumulation), with moderate-intensity and
unlogged treatments yielding surface fuel loads consistent with commonly prescribed levels, and
high-intensity treatment resulting in greater potential need for follow-up fuel treatments. The
paper also recommends a greater potential need for follow-up fuel treatments, which has been
incorporated into this projects design. Keyser et al. 2009 examined the impacts of post-fire
salvage logging on regeneration, fuel accumulation, and understory vegetation and assessed
whether the effects of salvage logging differed between stands burned under moderate and high
fire severity following the 2000 Jasper Fire in the Black Hills. The paper found no discernible
effect of salvage logging on understory development 5 years after fire. Logging caused neither a
reduction in total plant cover nor an increase in the abundance of exotic species. They also
recognize that there is less coarse woody debris (CWD) in salvage units compared to nontreatment units. The paper did not mention secondary fuels treatments. McGinnis et al. 2010
noted that logging fire-killed trees significantly increased total available dead fuel loads in the
short term but did not affect shrub cover, grass and forb cover, alien species cover or alien species
richness. The paper did not indicate if secondary fuels treatments were implemented. McIver and
Ottmar 2007 found logging significantly reduced tree density, especially for the smallest (<22 cm
diameter) and intermediate (23-41 cm) diameter classes. Fuel reduction units also had
significantly fewer snags (dead trees >30 cm diameter—4 per hectare), compared to both
commercial (23 per hectare) units and to un-logged controls (64 per hectare) in the year following
timber harvest. Logging did not change ladder height or tree species composition (% ponderosa
pine, Douglas-fir and grand fir). Total woody fuel mass increased significantly in fuel reduction
units when compared to controls, with the greatest difference among treatments occurring in the
slash fuel (<7.6 cm diameter) component (mean of 6.2 Mg/ha for fuel reduction stands versus 1.3
Mg/ha for un-logged stands). This paper did not consider secondary fuels treatments.

Comment: Whenever project costs increase in a project, it becomes more difficult to fully
implement. All of these funds would need to come from appropriated dollars. Such funding is
competitive and not guaranteed. EPIC is concerned that heightened post-logging fuels would be
left to linger should the Shasta-Trinity run into funding issues. Please document how the ShastaTrinity would prioritize fuel reduction work under the various alternatives.
Response: Fuels treatments are often prioritized based on proximity to communities. Roads
located within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) may be prioritized over more remote, open
roads. The Forest has identified and recommended treatments to achieve the Purpose and Need.
For the most part, funding would be allocated utilizing appropriated dollars, however,
opportunities often exist to apply for supplemental funding. The Forest workforce may be utilized
to implement treatments as a component of their program. Additional fuels treatments may be
accomplished through stewardship activities utilizing retained receipts, where appropriate. The
goal is to always treat the fuels in the most economical way. Areas where salvage is implemented
may have additional brush-disposal (BD) collections to mitigate treatment of activity fuels
(branches and tops). Additionally, the overall amount of dead fuel would be substantially reduced
following salvage removal than if it was left to fall naturally. As long as the decision is valid, and
funding is available, some degree of fuels treatment will continue throughout the project area
until the desired condition is met.

Comment: Further, please document the environmental impacts should post-fire logging occur
but not post-logging fuel treatments. The DEIS only hints at the potential effects.
Response: Within the actions being proposed under Alternatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 wherever post-fire
logging is occurring there will be post-logging fuels treatments to reach the desired condition.
The amount of fuels left on site will vary based on resource protection measures, which has been

analyzed and disclosed in the fuels report and the DEIS Chapter 3 Fire and Fuels section. There is
not a need to analyze for a situation that is not being proposed.

Environmental Protection Information Center - Tom Wheeler

Comment: Furthermore, in effect, by not including the price of post-logging fuel treatments in
the sale price, the timber sale will not internalize all externalities of logging. Stated another way,
the Shasta-Trinity is effectively asking taxpayers to subsidize private logging. If the ShastaTrinity cannot require sufficient revenue to, at a minimum, cover the cost of post-logging fuel
reduction. Alternatives 4 and 5 cost the least and would still treat a significant portion of the
project area.
Response: All action alternatives are designed to mitigate hazards along roads open to the public
within the 2015 fire footprints on the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. Any salvage activities would
be addressing fire-killed trees that are hazards in the form of hazard trees and/or excessive fuels.
For salvage timber sales, if the value exists, Brush Disposal (BD) deposits may be collected to
treat the activity slash (surface debris such as tops and limbs) caused by harvest activities.
Regardless of the method of treatment, the fuel loading that exists along these roads will need to
be addressed. If logging is not the initial treatment then the per/acre cost of fuels treatments
would be greater due to the fact that more fuel would need to be removed in order to achieve the
desired condition. Therefore, salvage removal is offsetting fuels reduction treatment costs that
would otherwise be incurred by the taxpayer.

Comment: "We appreciate the Forest Service's concern over the spread annosus root rot disease.
We are concerned, however, about whether the Forest Service has taken the requisite ""hard
look"" at borax and borax alternatives. Please consider and respond to the following comments in
the FEIS.
Studies have prompted concern that borax is a human reproductive toxin (USFS 1995). A borax
feeding study, which used mice, rats and beagle dogs showed boric acid and borax not to be
carcinogenic; however, testicular effects and decreases in body weight resulted at high dose
levels. The study resulted in blood and metabolism disorders, and effects to the endocrine system,
brain weight, and size ratios among various organs and glands (US EPA 1993). The US Forest
Service (1995) reports that studies indicate chronic exposure to borax may cause reproductive
damage and infertility. In the US EPA's Toxicological Review of Boron and Compounds (2004)
the developing fetus of mammals is considered one of the most sensitive targets. The other most
sensitive target is the testes of males, and adverse effects include testicular degeneration (US EPA
2004; USFS 2003, Evaluation of Human and Ecological Risk For Borax Stump Treatments).
The US Forest Service (1995) admits that there is insufficient information available to determine
the potential for adverse health effects for humans from contacting or consuming borax treated
vegetation, water or animals. The most common borax product used in forests, Sporax, has a
signal word of danger and the label describes the hazards to humans and domestic animals as
follows: ""DANGER. Corrosive. Causes irreversible eye damage. Harmful if swallowed. Do not
get in eyes or on clothing"" (Wilbur-Ellis, Sporax label). The Sporax material safety data sheet
warns, ""Do not ingest. Wash thoroughly before eating, drinking or smoking"" (Wilbur-Ellis)."
Response: The USFS has continued to assess the potential health risks associated with Borate
salts. The Sporax® and Cellu-Treat® (Selected Borate Salts) Human Health and Ecological Risk
Assessment Final Report was completed for the USFS in October of 2016. The assessment of risk
to human health is as follows: “In both the human health and ecological risk assessments, the
quantitative expression of the risk characterization is the hazard quotient (HQ), the ratio of the
anticipated dose or exposure to the RfD (human health) or no-observed-effect level or
concentration (ecological effects) using 1 as the level of concern—i.e., an HQ of < 1 is below the
level of concern.... Exposure of workers involved in dry applications of Sporax® over a
prolonged period is the only exposure scenario in the human health risk assessment for which the
622

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

HQs exceed the level of concern. For this scenario, the HQs are 0.6 (0.1 to 6) with only the upper
bound of the HQ exceeding the level of concern. This exposure scenario involves a depositionbased exposure assessment developed by EPA which is based on inhalation exposures. A major
reservation with this exposure scenario is that the EPA applied the same exposure rates for both
indoor (confined spaces) and outdoor dust applications. The extent to which the use of the same
exposure rates for indoor and outdoor dust applications may overestimate exposures for forestry
workers involved in stump applications is unclear. While the upper bound HQ of 6 indicates that
extreme exposures would be considered generally unacceptable, it is not clear that these exposure
levels would lead to overt toxic effects ... The only other exposure scenario that approaches the
level of concern is the upper bound HQ of 0.9 for a small child who consumes Sporax® directly
from a treated stump after a dry application. The upper bound HQ of 0.9 is associated with a dose
3.1 mg B/kg bw. This dose is slightly below the level of concern (HQ=1) and below the
anticipated adverse effect level by a factor of over 6."The previous studies referenced the
potential effects from chronic over-exposure, which is not expected from the use of borax through
localized stump applications in a forested setting. Exposure estimates for workers and the public
who contact or consume borax treated vegetation, water or animals are difficult to calculate
because of the low likelihood that any non-applicator, vegetation, or animal will be dosed. Deer
and cattle are not attracted to free borax, so it is unlikely that humans would be secondarily
exposed through eating venison or beef. As stated on page 60 of Dost et al. (1996): "Measurement
of herbs and foliage at distances up to 5 m from stump and at various times after application do
not show differences from measurements prior to application…surface litter is also not altered".
Water contamination of nearby streams is not expected due to the localized stump application.
The Forest does not dispute the product information or handling instructions provided by the
manufacturer. Applicators are expected to follow all handling instructions.

129.

Environmental Protection Information Center - Tom Wheeler

Comment: "Borax is generally active in soils and it remains unchanged in the soil for one year or
more. High rainfall conditions can cause borax to leach rapidly and soil microorganisms do not
break it down (USFS 1995). Borax may be toxic to many essential soil microorganisms at high
levels (USFS 1995) and thus may adversely affect nutrient cycling functions within the
ecosystem.
Boron occurring in concentrations has shown to be toxic to plants (US EPA 1993) and high levels
of borax will kill vegetation and thus it can be used as a nonselective herbicide (USFS 1995). The
Forest Service reports that in high concentrations borax is ""lethal to plants."" It is also know to
bio-accumulate in plants (Phelps et al. undated). The Sporax label reinforces this concern as it
states, ""Borax carelessly spilled or applied to cropland or growing plants - including trees or
shrubs - may kill or seriously retard plant growth"" (Wilbur-Ellis). The Forest Service's borax fact
sheet (1995) warns ""Borax may be a hazard to endangered plant species if it is applied to areas
where they live"" when applied as a forest fungicide on stumps which could affect seed
germination, seedling emergence and vegetative vigor.
Since we have found no studies investigating the impacts of borax on amphibians, we are
concerned that this salt, which remains active for a year in soils, may be having major impacts on
amphibian populations. Amphibians are terrestrial and travel across the land. They are especially
sensitive to chemicals and are believed to be useful indicator species within forest ecosystems."
Response: The Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment Final Report (Durkin, 2016)
concludes stump applications of borates will not substantially increase concentrations of boron in
soil, with the exception of areas immediately adjacent to treated stumps. Consequently, there is no
basis for asserting that stump applications of borates would cause adverse effects in terrestrial
plants, invertebrates, or microorganisms through soil exposures.
The potential for adverse effects associated with foliar exposures also appears to be remote. The
potential for borax leaching is low, since borax is absorbed to the mineral particles in the soil,
however under high rainfall conditions leaching may occur. The Edmonds et al. (1989) study,
623

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

involved coastal northwest Oregon and Washington where the rainfall amounts and distribution
are different than in most parts of California. In Chavez et al. (1980), which established plots in
the same area, they described annual rainfall amounts as 250 cm (98 inches). Under such high
rainfall conditions, Sporax must be applied carefully, which is what is stated in Edmonds et al.
(1989). In California forest conditions, and if Sporax is applied correctly, leaching is not expected
to occur. Limited monitoring (Dost et al. 1996) indicates that levels of boron in soil were not
above background levels after treatment of nearby stumps. In addition, in the Dost et al., 1996
document states that even if a spill of borax were to occur, it is unlikely that measured amounts in
water would be above background, natural levels of boron in water. There is little data on effects
of borates on non-target fungi. It is unlikely that application of Sporax on stumps would result in
increases in boron or borates in the soil above background levels (Dost et al. 1996). Therefore
effects to soil fungi and other micro-organisms would not be expected. If spilled or misapplied,
localized effects could occur, however any effects would be restricted to a relatively small portion
of the environment.
It is recognized that boron is an essential nutrient in plants; however boron can also act as an
herbicide. The difference in doses between boron's effectiveness as a nutrient and its effect as an
herbicide are not very distinct, and vary from species to species. Agricultural use of boron as a
foliar fertilizer or fungicide generally occurs in the range of 0.9 to 9 lbs./acre (borax equivalent)
while as a soil fertilizer, borax would be applied at a rate of 9 to 18 lbs./acre (Travis et al. 2003,
US Borax 2005). Above an application rate of 20 pounds borax per acre, there are indications that
borax would act as an herbicide (27 pounds per acre is recommended as a control of creeping
Charlie (Glechoma hederacea) in turf grass in the Midwest (Lunsford 1998)). Applied at very
high rates (670 to 1,770 pounds borax per acre) it will act as a soil sterilant (WSSA 2002, US EPA
1993, Kimball et al. 1956). US EPA (1993) states that borax can be applied to treat Klamath weed
at a rate of 3-4 pounds/100 square feet (equivalent to 1,300 to 1,700 pounds/acre).The average
application of borax in Region 5 is 1 pound per acre. Admittedly there is little information on the
levels of borax that result in negative plant effects, however, these rates of application are within
the range used and recommended as foliar fertilizer applications on various agricultural crops and
a factor of 10 times lower than recommended as a selective herbicide on turf grass.
If Sporax was applied to foliage or the soil at the same rates as it is applied on the cut stump (1
pound/50 square feet), it would be applied in the range that would act as a soil sterilant (870
pounds per acre). The careful application onto the stump surface and the prompt cleanup of
spillage is necessary to avoid effects to vegetation in close proximity to stumps. Because of the
application method, it is not expected that plants would be routinely exposed to Sporax. As stated
in Dost et al., 1996 (p 11), monitoring data does not indicate treatment-related increases in boron
content of adjacent foliage, litter, or soil, after stump treatment. Dost et al. discusses toxicity of
borax and boron to fish and amphibians (pages 30-36 and Table 1); and terrestrial and aquatic
invertebrates and fungi (pages 36-39), indicating that amphibians are considerably less sensitive
than trout. USDA FS (1995) concludes that borax is practically nontoxic to fish and practically
nontoxic to aquatic invertebrates. The RPMs for application of a borate compound follow all the
requirements of the pesticide label and federal and state laws and regulations. The RPM will be
updated to reflect this language.

Comment: "While the Forest Service has been liberally applying borax throughout our public
forestlands, there is some question as to whether or not it is as effective as believed (or even
needed). In a study review of research on annosus root rot disease, US Forest Service Region 5
scientist R.S. Smith Jr. reported, ""there is continuing concern that annosus can infect stumps via
the roots rather than just through the stump surface, and that borax treatment may not be fully
successful in preventing the disease"" (Smith,1989).
An even more interesting study was done by Region 5 Forest Service scientists, which reviewed
the efficacy of borax stump treatment in protecting trees from annosus root disease. The authors
624

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Trinity Post Fire Hazard Reduction and Salvage

reported ""borax may be ineffective because it washes off stumps and that high stump densities
make it difficult to apply.
The Forest Service has not taken a hard look at alternatives to borax.
""Annosus root disease is a normal part of most forest ecosystems in the West contributing to
structural and compositional diversity"" (Schmitt et al. 2000). We are sensitive to the need to
protect trees that make up our public forestlands. However, we are concerned that in Region 5
(California) the US Forest Service is not using a true integrated pest management (IPM) strategy.
The Forest Service is ignoring the cause of annosus spread and needs to focus on controlling the
vectors that facilitate its movement. Region 5 is reliant on borax for annosus disease prevention
and has failed to develop non-toxic, non-borax treatment methods for protecting our forests. This
is of concern since other parts of the US and other countries (Canada, UK) effectively use nonborax prevention alternatives."
Response: Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using borax as a stump treatment in
California. Graham (1971) demonstrated the efficacy of borax on Jeffrey and ponderosa pine.
Smith (1970) demonstrated that borax prevented infection of white fir stumps. Kliejunas (1989)
summarized the existing literature on borax effectiveness in the eastside pine type. As stated in
Russell et al. (1973), inconsistency in efficacy shown in early tests of dry borax on western
hemlock stumps in western Washington was attributed to the characteristically dry surfaces of
freshly cut western hemlock stumps, the borax being washed off during rainy periods, and the
difficulty of retaining dry borax on sloping stump surfaces. Russell et al. (1973) and Nelson and
Li (1980) also determined that with proper care in application, borax was effective as a stump
treatment in western hemlock. The review by Smith, 1989 describes borax as not being
completely successful in keeping annosus out of true fir stands because of other avenues of
infection, notably through root contact. However, he does state that borax is effective in blocking
stump infection of true fir (Smith, 1989, p 14).The study described as showing that high stump
densities in thinning treatments make borax difficult to apply is not referenced, so cannot be
verified. Many projects in Region 5 have demonstrated the operational capability of applying
borax in harvest treatments effectively. Phlebiopsis gigantea or Streptomyces griseoloalbus, are
generally considered biological alternatives to borate based fungicide, however they lack both US
EPA and California pesticide registration and are therefore unavailable for use at this time. See
Comment and Response #133 for more information on non-borax alternative prevention of
Annosus spread.

131.

Environmental Protection Information Center - Tom Wheeler

Comment: Logging has been shown by multiple studies to increase annosus root disease
occurrence in western forests for a number of conifer species. The disease typically appears in
stands several years after logging and is associated with stumps and logging wounds in remaining
trees. Logged stands have a higher occurrence of the disease than un-entered stands, and stands
with a history of multiple entries have the greatest rate of infection.
Response: Logging in areas that are susceptible to annosus will result in increased levels of
annosus if stumps are not treated. The Forest agrees that cutting trees increases the likelihood of
the spread of annosus. Not cutting trees is analyzed under the no action alternative (Alternative
6), and would result in a reduced likelihood of spreading annosus. However, it would not meet the
Purpose and Need for the project of mitigating hazards that threaten public safety along open
roads.

Comment: This pathogen can be eradicated or reduced by other means. One is using prescribed
burns. One or more post-activity burn has been shown to destroy reproductive basidiocarps and
eliminate litter and other favorable annosus habitat and basidiocarp development environments.
Response: It appears that a study by Froelich et al., (1978) is the basis for the particular
recommendations on using prescribed fire. In this study, underburns were set in 10-24 year old
625

loblolly and slash pine plantations in the southeast US. Two pre-harvest burn prescriptions were
tested: a fall burn, about a year before thinning, followed by either a late summer/early fall burn
about a month before thinning, or a winter burn about 9 months before thinning. Post-thinning
fires were in the winter. Results showed that in most plots, there was a reduction in infected trees
as a result of burning. Many plots still showed substantial infection levels after burning, although
lower than the controls. There is no literature supporting prescribed burning as a control of
annosus in California ecosystems. In the Western US, annosus conks are most often found inside
stumps or under the bark. In the Southeast US, where the burning method was developed, conks
are formed in the duff at the base of trees and are susceptible to killing by prescribed fire.
Prescribed burning would not be feasible as a control method for annosus in California because of
the need to thoroughly scorch the stumps. In 1994, researchers conducted a field trial in
California in which they attempted to use fire to destroy infected stumps (Pronos 1994). This trial
was unsuccessful because the stumps were still too wet to burn, even three years after harvest.

133.

Environmental Protection Information Center - Tom Wheeler

Comment: "The use of Sporax in already infested stands may worsen the problem by preventing
natural annosus competitors from entering stumps.
Phlebiopsis gigantea, an aggressive, highly competitive fungus recommended as a borax
alternative, as it colonizes stumps to the exclusion of annosus. Phlebiopsis gigantea is incapable
of causing disease in standing trees and is not regarded as hazardous to human health. It has been
utilized as a biological control agent for annosum root rot for approximately 40 years in Europe
and has also been used with good results in Canada. In the southeast part of the US it has been
shown that P. gigantea is completely effective in preventing stump colonization by H. annosum,
with a cost only slightly more than that of borax.
Streptomyces griseoloalbus, an actinomycete isolated from the rhizoplane of the nitrogen-fixing
nodules of a common California native, has been identified as a strong antagonist of annosus, and
a possible biological control in the Pacific Northwest.
Further analysis on the use of Sporax throughout national Forests in California should be
conducted. The annosum fungus is naturally occurring and provides structural diversity to forest
stands. The widespread use has not been fully analyzed on soil microbes, insects such as native
pollinators or amphibians. Please refrain from using Sporax or Cellu Treat in LSRs and Riparian
Reserves, IRAs or the entire project area."
Response: The use of Phlebiopsis gigantea as a biocontrol for annosus root disease has been
known since the mid-1950's, based on experiments conducted in England on Scots pine and
Corsican pine by John Rishbeth. This particular agent is not as consistent as borax; in Rishbeth
(1963) and Rose et al. (1980), there are discussions of how P. gigantea is not as effective on some
conifer species, including western hemlock and Douglas fir. The use of P. gigantean was
discontinued when US EPA determined it needed to be registered. Therefore, at this time treating
with P. gigantea is not feasible as it is not registered as a biopesticide either with US EPA or
California, and there are no efficacy data for California forest conditions. Data suggests that P.
gigantea would not be efficacious in California because it is too dry in summer and fall (Rishbeth
1963; Blakeslee and Stambaugh, 1974).Streptomyces griseoloalbus is not currently available for
use (neither registered, nor marketed). The study by Rose et al. (1980) involved western hemlock,
and contained no quantitative data concerning the effectiveness of S. griseoloalbus as a
preventive treatment on wood substrates. A follow-up study by Nelson and Li (1980) showed that
although the S. griseoloalbus protected western hemlock stumps better than the controls (31%
infected stumps vs 75%), it wasn't as effective as borax (0% infected stumps). There is no
efficacy data from California that supports its use. Either of these materials, P. gigantea or S.
griseoloalbus, would be considered a biopesticide and would need both US EPA and California
pesticide registration. This method of control may be feasible in the future if efficacy can be
demonstrated in California and if they are registered as biopesticides by both US EPA and
California. Until such time as both efficacy and registration are met, these two biological agents
626

remain untenable options. The 2016 Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment: Final
Report indicates "Stump applications of borates will not substantially increase concentrations of
boron in soil, with the exception of areas immediately adjacent to treated stumps. Consequently,
there is no basis for asserting that stump applications of borates would cause adverse effects in
terrestrial plants, invertebrates, or microorganisms through soil exposures. The potential for
adverse effects associated with foliar exposures also appears to be remote... Forest Service
applications to stumps will limit any exposures of insects to incidental events that should not have
a substantial impact on insect populations. While the annosus fungus is naturally occurring, the
Forest is committed to mitigating its spread as a result of our management actions consistent with
Forest Service Handbook policy (FSH 3409.11, Chapter 60, R5 Supplement 3409.11-2013-1
Forest Pest Management Handbook). Borax does not kill the fungus where it currently exists in
live trees, thereby not impeding the development of "structural diversity" recommended in the
comment. However, the Forest Service Handbook for National Forest lands in Region 5 (FSH
3409.11, Chapter 60, R5 Supplement 3409.11-2013-1 Management of Specific Pests)
recommends treating freshly-cut stumps that are 14 inches or larger in diameter in general forest
land, and all stumps larger than 3 inches in diameter in developed recreation areas or areas with
high-value facilities or trees.

Comment: Again, we appreciate the focus of concentrating the post-fire logging to roadsides.
Alternative 5 best meets the purpose and need and all applicable laws and Standards and
Guidelines by minimizing the effects to LSR's, Critical Habitat, Activity Centers, impaired
watersheds, species of concern and IRA's. Given the economic situation for this project and all of
the reasons above we urge you to choose the Minimum Impact Alternative while limiting the use
of borax compounds and including the 4.7 miles of road restoration in the Hyampom and Sulpher
Glade Creek watersheds.
Response: Thank you for your continued interest in the management of the Shasta-Trinity
National Forest. Your comment will be considered in the decision process of the Responsible
Official. The use of borax compounds are limited in all action alternative to areas in close
proximity to known locations of annosus where the fungus is likely to exist. The proposed
restoration actions are connected actions designed to mitigate the hydrologic impacts of the
project. As a result, the extent of restoration is determined by the effects of the various
alternatives on Equivalent Roaded Acres (ERA) in the Hyampom and Sulphur Glade CreekWaldorf Flat watersheds that are currently over the Threshold of Concern. Based on further
review of the model, ERA values have been updated for all alternatives (hydrology analysis) and
the EIS will be updated with this information.

Response: Compaction and displacement happens during all mechanical operations (salvage,
thinning, mastication, etc.) using tractors, excavators, skidders, etc. but compaction and
displacement are only problematic when they are so extensive and severe that they are
detrimental to soil health. The Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards, found in Appendix O, focus on
the issue of extent and severity of soil impacts. The National Forest Management Act of 1976
(NFMA) (http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/NFMA1976.pdf) recognized the fundamental
need to protect and, where appropriate, improve the quality of soil, water, and air resources. With
respect to soils, NFMA requires that the Forest Service manage lands so as not to impair their
long-term productivity. Further, activities must be monitored to ensure that productivity is
protected. This law led to subsequent regulation and policy to execute the law at various levels of
management. The National Soil Management Handbook (USDA Forest Service, 2010) defines
soil productivity and components of soil productivity, and establishes guidance for measuring soil
productivity. "In determining a significant change in productivity, a 15% reduction in inherent
soil productivity potential will be used as a basis for setting threshold values. Threshold values
would apply to measurable or observable soil properties or conditions that are sensitive to
significant change. The threshold values, along with areal extent limits, would serve as an early
warning signal of reduced soil productive capacity, where changes to management practices or
rehabilitation measures may be warranted. "Management activities have potential to cause
various types and degrees of disturbance. Soil disturbance is categorized into compaction,
displacement, puddling, severe burning, and erosion. Direction was established that properties,
measures, and thresholds relative to these disturbance types would be developed at the Regional
and Forest levels, known as Soil Quality Standards. The 1995 Region 5 Soil Management
Handbook Supplement (USDA Forest Service, 1995) helped to establish the forest objectives for
the Soil Management Program and Soil Quality Analysis Standards (SQAS). These analysis
standards are intended to help determine if ecosystem health and long-term productivity are being
maintained. SQAS provide measures and threshold values that indicate when changes in soil
properties and soil conditions may result in significant change or impairment of key soil functions
of soil productivity and hydrologic function. Soil disturbance is considered "detrimental" if
thresholds are exceeded and subsequent impairment of soil functions is judged likely after a soil
& site specific assessment. Detrimental disturbance refers to the severity of impacts, which may
be very small scale in occurrence. The extent of detrimental soil disturbance shall not be of a size
or pattern that would result in a significant change in key soil functions for the activity area. Note
that the activity area is the scale at which impacts are ultimately assessed, defined as the area
where soil disturbing activities take place, such as a timber harvest unit in a sale area or a burn
area within a prescribed burn project; system roads, trails, and other areas not dedicated to
628

Final Environmental Impact Statement

growing vegetation (other dedicated uses) are not included as part of an activity area. Both
severity and extent of detrimental disturbance are important considerations that must be evaluated
together to assess potential adverse impacts on soils of the activity area. As such, detrimental
disturbance can be allowed on a small portion of a unit - this does not constitute adverse impacts;
conversely, minor disturbance can be allowed in most of a unit - this likewise does not constitute
adverse impacts. Aerial extent limits for different disturbance types are not established in the R5
handbook supplement. In 2010 the Shasta-Trinity National Forest (Forest) adopted the National
Soil Disturbance Monitoring Protocol (NSDMP) (Dumroese, et. al. 2009) level one analysis
(visual soil disturbance indicators) along with developing a level two analysis (validation
sampling) using transects to measure erosion, disturbance, compaction, displacement, and cover
(Rust 2011). Past project activities on the Forest (Rust, 2015) show when fine-textured and
coarse-textured soils are operated on with track-based mechanical equipment when dry (less than
20% soil moisture by weight), compaction levels never exceeded 10% decrease in soil porosity.
But when soils were moist (greater than 20% soil moisture by weight) compaction levels on finetextured soils were exceeded over the 15% Forest Plan aerial extent. Resource Protection
Measures, particularly 44, 45, 47, and 52 in the DEIS will ensure that that soil compaction is
within the soil quality standards. For machine-piling, monitoring results on the Forest showed
minimal soil impacts from machine piling and burning using small tractors fitted with brush
rakes, which is the typical type of equipment used on NFS lands in Trinity County. Soil burning
and soil displacement was minimal and soil compaction from machine-piling was minimal only
adding 2 to 4% increase in bulk density (Rust, 2013).
Machine piling earned a reputation as a harmful practice on soils in the past from the era where
machine piling almost exclusively referred to site preparation for planting after a clear-cut, often
occurring on moderately steep slopes. Impacts from tractor piling can be high if done improperly,
especially on wet soils, but research conducted on the Shasta Trinity National Forest showed that,
on average, tractor piling added 2 percent detrimental soil disturbance as displacement and
compaction to the activity units when conducted on dry soils (Powers and Young, 2005). On the
Shasta-Trinity National Forest, tractor-piling operations are mostly conducted on slopes less than
35%. For this project, machine piling will only be allowed on slopes less than 40% (RPM #62 in
the DEIS). Much smaller tractors equipped with a brush rake on the blade are expected to be used
for this project, which result in little to no topsoil displacement or compaction that would be of
any detrimental degree. Piles are to be "clean" (without soil), which helps them burn properly.
Tractor piling has been examined extensively on the Forest and when soils are dry impacts are
minimal and well below the Forest Plan Soil Quality Standards (Rust 2013). This is ensured by
the soil resource protection measures for this project (listed in the Physical Science report pg.
118).
Heavy machine use can cause soil compaction, as evidenced by the following studies: Tree and
Sands 1980; Froehlich and McNabb 1984; Wronski 1984; West and Thomas 1981; Greacen and
Froehlich 1979; Helms and Hipkin 1986; Amaranthus et al. 1996; Graecen and Sands 1980. All of
this is known and true but the real issue is, when operations take place, are the soils wet or very
moist or are the soils dry? This is why we have the soil quality standards and soil resource
protection measures to ensure soils are dry enough for mechanical operations to support
equipment without causing detrimental soil impacts of compaction. Soil displacement from
ground-based machines has also been observed in the studies cited: Child et. Al. 1989;
Amaranthus et al. 1989 and 1996. Again all of this is known and true but the real issue is when
operations take place, are the soils wet or very moist or are the soils dry? This is why we have the
soil quality standards and soil resource protection measures to ensure soils are dry enough for
mechanical operations to support equipment without causing detrimental soil impacts of
displacement. On steeper ground (>35% slope), manual piling and underburning will be used to
reduce fuels. If burned at low to moderate burn intensity little soil impacts occur. For machinepiling and burning the key is soil moisture (bearing strength) when soils are dry enough so little
displacement and compaction occur. Machine-piling is fast and effective in managing excessive
629

fuels and when soils are dry impacts are minimal. Also tractor-piling is safer for personnel in
regards to larger fuels in the difficulty of staking those fuels. By use of the Soil Moisture
Operability field Guide (Rust, 2009) soils are tested before operations to insure soils are dry
enough for heavy equipment operations so soil quality standards are not exceeded.

Comment: California Department of Pesticide Regulation. 2003 Annual Pesticide Use Report
Indexed by Chemical. Lassen and Sierra Counties.
Response: The Pesticide Use Report, published annually by the California Department of
Pesticide Regulation, details the amount of registered pesticides used by chemical and county in
California. While the comment references 2003 data from Lassen and Sierra counties,
contemporary data for Trinity County (which is more relevant to this project) is also available on
the California Department of Pesticide Regulation's website. It is unclear why this report is
referenced in the comment or how a 14 year old report from another part of the state should be
utilized to inform and improve our project analysis, even if it were current and spatially relevant
to the project. The assumption is that the commenter is concerned with borax use, however
considering stump applications of borates will not substantially increase concentrations of boron
in soil, with the exception of areas immediately adjacent to treated stumps, general use levels
does not inform site specific impacts (Durkin, 2016).

Response: This Project is implementing secondary fuels treatments in all salvage units to
mitigate increased fuel loading following harvest which will reduce fire behavior and fire effects.
Research cited is not in line with the treatments proposed. Donato et al. (2006) indicated post-fire
logging may be counterproductive to regeneration and fuel levels, however the study did not
include post-harvest fuel treatments or planting. In addition, scholars have rebutted these findings
indicating the study lacks adequate context and supporting information to be clearly interpreted
by scientists, resource managers, policy-makers, and the public (Newton et al. 2006, Baird 2006).
Donato et al. (2012) speculates on the value of early seral stands, as potentially having the spatial
complexities of late successional stands given fire exclusion and disturbance, weighing

unmanaged stands as more complex and valuable than managed stands. However, for this project,
the Forest chose not to do landscape salvage in favor of a narrow buffer along open roads to
mitigate hazards and establish forest vegetation following the 2015 wildfires, so it's not largely
relevant to this project's goals.
Keyser et al. (2009) did not include any type of post-harvest fuels treatments. Study found no
discernible effect of salvage logging on understory development 5 years after fire. Logging
caused neither a reduction in total plant cover nor an increase in the abundance of exotic species.
Paper also found coarse woody debris increased over time on both salvaged and unsalvaged sites,
and was significantly greater on unsalvaged sites. This is because the act of salvage removes
standing fire-killed tree biomass from the site. As a result there is less standing biomass in
salvaged sites than in unsalvaged sites. As these fire-killed trees fall they add coarse woody debris
(CWD) to the forest floor, with unsalvaged sites adding much more CWD than salvaged sites.
McGinnis et al. (2010) did not include any type of post-harvest fuels treatments. Study found
logging fire-killed trees significantly increased total available dead fuel loads in the short term but
did not affect shrub cover, grass and forb cover, alien species cover or alien species richness.
Despite the greater available dead fuel loads, fire behavior was not modeled to be different
between logged and untreated stands, due to abundant shrub fuels in both logged and untreated
stands.
McIver and Ottmar (2007) study did not discuss any type of post-harvest fuels treatments. The
paper discusses fuels reduction units but there was no removal only felling smaller diameter dead
trees.

Acid. September 1993. Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances.) The document published by
the Environmental Protection Agency describes the low risk associated with its use: "Applicators
and others in treatment areas may be exposed to boric acid and its sodium salts during or after
application. However, there is no reasonable expectation that these pesticide uses may constitute a
hazard or risk to people involved in, or near to, handling or application activities. Proper care and

EPA. Toxicological Review of Boron Compounds. CAS No. 7440-42-8. June 2004.
The study evaluates the potential effects from chronic exposure, which is not expected from the
localized use of borax in a forested situation. Information Ventures’ Borax Pesticide Facts Sheet,
prepared for the USDA in 1995 indicates it is practically nontoxic to fish, aquatic invertebrate
animals, birds or mammals, however could be to plants and soil microinvertebrates if applied at
concentrations substantially higher than those recommended for stump treatments. This
publication is superseded by the much more thorough and contemporary risk assessment
documents prepared for the USDA by Durkin (2006 and 2016).

13 pages. However, it appears based on the summaries in the comment one or both indicate a
level of toxicity to plants when applied at high concentrations (i.e. in excess of 800 pounds per
acre, compared to the average 1 pound per acre of use on stump treatments). The careful
application onto the stump surface and the prompt cleanup of spillage (as recommended on the
Wilbur-Ellis label) is necessary to avoid effects to vegetation in close proximity to stumps.
Because of the application method, it is not expected that plants would be routinely exposed to
Sporax. As stated in Dost et al., 1996 (page 11), limited monitoring data does not indicate
treatment-related increases in boron content of adjacent foliage, litter, or soil, after stump
treatment. Further efforts researching the Phelps papers found a 2005 reference from the Region 5
Pesticide-Use Specialist (David Bakke) stating "Phelps et al. (undated) demonstrated that in the
SE US, summer thinning only slightly reduced infection over controls and that borax treatment
was much more effective."
