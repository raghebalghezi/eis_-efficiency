Abstract: This Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (DSEIS) documents

the analysis of four alternatives for designation of 42 specific existing roads and trails for
public motorized use on the Eldorado National Forest. Alternative 1 proposes to
designate 42 routes for public motorized use and it includes amending the Eldorado
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan(ENF LRMP), Standard and
Guideline 100, to allow for public motorized use on sections of routes affecting the
hydrologic connectivity of meadows on 18 of the 42 routes. Alternative 2 proposes no
action. Alternative 3 proposes the same activities as Alternative 1 except it does not
include a LRMP amendment and proposes implementation of mitigation measures prior
to availability of the 18 routes for public use. Alternative 4 is the same as Alternative 1
except it does not include a LRMP amendment, proposes implementation of mitigation
measures for portions of 15 routes prior to availability for public use and proposes to
leave closed all or portions of 21 routes.
Comments:
Reviewers should provide the Forest Service with their comments during the review
period of the draft environmental impact statement. This will enable the Forest Service to
analyze and respond to the comments at one time and to use information acquired in the

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Summary
The Eldorado National Forest proposes the following designations for the portions
of the 42 routes that were closed by Court Order:
1. Designate for public motorized use 13 routes that field surveys conducted in 2011
and 2012 determined did not cross meadows, as defined in the 1989 Eldorado
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP). Route
09N54, a secondary access road to Leoni Meadows, would be designated up to
the intersection with Route 09N60.
2. Designate for public motorized use 11 routes where field surveys determined the
meadow crossings meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) No. 100.
3. Amend the ENF LRMP as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
Amendment (SNFPA) Standard and Guideline No. 100 (S&G 100) to allow
continued public motorized use on 18 routes that field surveys determined to not
currently meet S&G 100, and are needed to meet other purposes, and designate
those routes for public motorized use.
The area affected by the proposal includes 42 routes on the Eldorado National Forest in
California that were proposed for designation for public motorized use in the Eldorado
National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized Travel Management Environmental Impact
Statement (TM FEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD), March 2008.
The purpose of this supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement for the TMFEIS
and ROD, March 2008, is to reconsider in light of the applicable law that portion of the
Forest Service’s Final Environmental Impact Statement relating to the Riparian
Conservation Objective (“RCO”) Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and Guidelines #100
pertaining to the meadows on 42 specific routes that were designated for public
motorized use in the Record of Decision and subsequently closed under the final court
order on Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District Court, Eastern
District of California, filed 7/31/12).
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Eldorado National Forest Travel Management
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (TM SEIS) was published in the Federal
Register on October 12, 2012. The notice asked that comments on the proposed action be
received by November 7, 2012. In addition, as part of the public involvement process,
information on the proposed action was posted on the Eldorado National Forest web site
and mailed to 784 groups and individuals that have voiced an interest in Travel
Management on the Eldorado National Forest. The Forest Service held three public Open
House sessions, one in Markleeville on October 22, 2012; one in Placerville on October
25, 2012, and one in Jackson on October 29, 2012, to share information about the
i

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

proposal and listen to issues and concerns brought up by the public. Approximately 247
letters, emails and comment forms from the public scoping and public Open House
sessions were received providing public comments on the proposed action.
The following significant Issues were raised by the public during the scoping period:
1. Route 14N39 Richardson Lake: Richardson Lake is not the main destination for
route 14N39. Users enjoy a drive to the summit of Sourdough Hill to enjoy the views and
the sunset. The entire route should be designated for public motorized use.
This issue was addressed through a modification to the Proposed Action (Alternative #1).
The route is now proposed for designation all the way to the top of Sourdough Hill in
Alternative #1.
2. Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment: Amending the Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) to allow continued public motorized use in sensitive
meadow habitats will result in impacts to hydrology, natural vegetation and wildlife
habitat.
Alternatives #3 and #4 were developed to address this issue. Alternatives #3 and #4
would not amend the LRMP.
3. Corrective Actions: The proposed action does not include corrective actions to fix
the routes found inconsistent with Standard and Guideline #100, so impacts to meadows
will continue to persist.
Alternatives #3 and #4 both address this issue. While Alternatives #3 and #4 do not
include a description of the necessary actions required to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100, routes inconsistent with Standard and Guideline 100 would
not be available for public use until work has been completed to bring them into
compliance.
Four alternatives are analyzed in this SEIS:
Alternative #1
Described above as the Proposed Action.
Alternative # 2: No Action
The same portions of the 42 routes that were closed under the court order would remain
closed to public motorized use. There would be no amendments to the ENF LRMP.
ii

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Alternative #3: The Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 3 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The LRMP would not be amended for the routes as proposed in Alternative 1: 09N01,
09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider
Camp Road), 6.8 miles of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 10N21
(16E27; Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett
4WD trail), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. Instead, these routes would
continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use and
identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are in compliance with
Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. This alternative identifies these
routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions necessary to bring
each into compliance with Standard and Guideline 100. Corrective actions would be
proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement
corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions have been analyzed and
implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail on the
next revision of the MVUM.
Alternative #4
Alternative 4 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 1 except for the following:
The Eldorado National Forest proposes to designate the following routes or portions of
routes for public motorized use: 09N54 (open up to intersection with 09N60, closed to
public motorized use past that point), 10N06, 10N26, 11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 13N24,
09N15, 10NY05 (open from 10NY04 to a point just before drainage near 16E27) and
14N27.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until the routes are in compliance with Standard and
Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (open to a spot suitable
for camping just north of Schneider Camp meadow, closed to public motorized use
iii

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

beyond that point), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27) (open except for the section between
10NY04E and the section currently open on the west end), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32,
and 14N05 (open up to McKinstry Trailhead, closed to public motorized use beyond the
trailhead). This alternative identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does
not analyze the actions necessary to bring each route into compliance with Standard and
Guideline 100. Corrective actions would be proposed and analyzed as part of future
NEPA analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After
corrective actions have been analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as a
designated public motorized road or trail on the next revision of the MVUM.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35,
10N32, and 10NY06. The reasons mitigation is indicated for these routes are documented
in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in this document. Mitigation
would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to
implement corrective actions becomes available. After the mitigation has been analyzed
and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail
on the next revision of the MVUM. Portions of these routes that are currently open under
the court order would remain open for public motorized use.
The following portions of routes that are not currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: western 2.26 miles of 09N04
(17E79), and 10N03.
The portions of the following routes that are currently closed to public motorized use
under court order would remain closed to public motor vehicle use: 09N54 past
intersection with 09N60, 10NY04, 17E12, 14N58, 17E17, 17E21, 09N82 (southern
portion 16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01 (10N01B), 10N13 (17E73), closed
beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the section currently
open on the west end), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), a portion of 12NY06, 14N05 past
McKinstry Trailhead, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24 (west and east portions), and 17E28.
A portion of 12NY06 that is not currently closed to public motorized use by court order
would be closed in this alternative.

Summary of Effects to Hydrology and Recreation
The Hydrology Analysis indicates that there are 24 routes where there is no difference
between the alternatives with regard to Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100. This is
because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross or border
meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
#100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G #100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G #100. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in zero,
18, and seven of those 18 routes meeting S&G #100, respectively. This also means that
Alternatives 2, 3, 4 would result in 18, 0, and 13 routes not meeting S&G #100,
respectively.
It would likely take a number of years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes
meeting S&G #100.
The above results are summarized in Table 3.9 and Figure 3.9.
The Recreation Analysis shows that the alternatives differ substantially as to effects to
recreation users. Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, results in the highest number of
miles of roads and trails rated high in recreation value open to public motorized use
initially (95.8 miles). Alternative 3 results in the same number of miles of high value
recreation routes designated for public motorized use, however only 53.4 of those miles
would be open initially, with an additional 42.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS
but not designated for public motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map
(MVUM) until corrective actions are analyzed and implemented. Alternative 4 would
result in 3.7miles of high recreation value routes open to public motorized use, with an
additional 13.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS but not designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until corrective
actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 2, No Action, only the
29.97 miles of high value recreation routes that were not closed by court order would
remain open, with 65.85 miles of high value recreation routes closed to public motorized
use.
The effects on 4WD and motorcycle riding opportunities, particularly high country routes
over 6,000 feet in elevation, all rated high in recreation value, also vary substantially
between alternatives. In Alternative 1, the proposed action, 42.06 miles of 4WD routes,
all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately 18.47 miles of high
v

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in recreation value. In
Alternative 3, the same number of high country 4WD trails would be designated for
public motorized use, however only 11.22 miles would be open initially, with an
additional 30.84 miles added to the MVUM once corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
would be designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions are
analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 4, 8.96 miles of high country 4WD trails would
remain open, and an additional 7.85 miles of high country 4WD trails would be
designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions and mitigation
are analyzed and implemented. Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail
opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be
closed, and all of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado
National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed. In Alternative 2, 11.22
miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, and 30.84 miles of high country
4WD trails would be closed. This equates to the closure of 65 percent of the total 4WD
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. All of the
high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles, rated medium to high
recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This represents 90 percent of
the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in
elevation.

Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action
Introduction ____________________________________________
The purpose of this supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the
Eldorado National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized Travel Management EIS and Record
of Decision (ROD), March 2008, is to reconsider in light of the applicable law that
portion of the Forest Service’s Final Environmental Impact Statement relating to the
Riparian Conservation Objective (“RCO”) Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and
Guidelines #100 pertaining to the meadows on 42 specific routes that were designated for
public motorized use in the Record of Decision and subsequently closed under the final
court order on Court Order: Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District
Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12). All other portions of the Forest
Service’s original decision, including the parts of the 42 routes that do not intersect
meadows, remain in effect.
This Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) addresses only the additional

Background ____________________________________________
In March, 2008, the US Forest Service completed the Eldorado National Forest Public
Wheeled Motorized Travel Management EIS and ROD (ENF TMEIS). A comprehensive
background Summary of Eldorado National Forest Travel Management Direction may be
found on page 1-2 of that document.
Relevant Information from the ENF TMEIS includes the following:








The 2008 TMEIS and ROD designated roads and trails to be open for public motor
vehicle use and to prohibit cross country travel. The decision designated the class of
vehicle allowed and season of use for each route.
Each of the action alternatives except Alternative E included non-significant Forest
Plan amendments for various combinations of routes crossing meadows – they are
listed in Chapter 2 of the TMEIS in the description of each alternative.
The selected alternative, Alternative Modified B, included 20 routes through
meadows in the non-significant Land and Resource Plan (LRMP) Amendment for
that alternative. However, only 19 of those routes were designated for public wheeled
motorized travel under the Travel Management Decision. An additional 23 routes
with segments less than .05 miles through any meadow encountered along the route
were designated but have no Forest Plan amendment. Numerous other routes that
bordered or crossed meadows were not designated for public motor vehicle use.
The Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Final Supplemental Environmental
Impact Statement Record of Decision, January, 2004 (SNFPA) amended the ENF
LRMP, established Riparian Conservation Objectives (RCOs), standards and
guidelines (particularly S&G 100), and direction to complete a RCO Analysis for all
new activities that might affect Riparian Conservation Areas (RCAs). In compliance
with the Record of Decision (ROD) for the SNFPA, the Forest completed the
“Reconciliation: Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment 2004 ROD & Eldorado
Forest Plan” to clearly state that the Standards and Guidelines for Management Area
2

28 (Meadows) from the 1989 ENF LRMP were replaced by the SNFPA meadow
allocation and Standards and Guidelines. The RCO Analysis for the ENF TMEIS
included the criterion that routes that bisect or go through meadows have the potential
of not meeting RCO #2. The identification of individual routes was completed using
the Forest’s Geographic Information System (GIS) database.
In Table 7 of the RCO analysis (a part of the project record for the EIS), there is a
listing of 42 routes through meadows, which includes the 19 routes designated in
Modified Alternative B, plus another 23.
The ENF TMEIS included a monitoring strategy for meadows: “Within two years of
implementation, commence field monitoring of meadows greater than one acre in size
that have a road or trail within the meadow or that bisects the meadow. Public
wheeled motor vehicle use through meadows can impair hydrologic function. If
adverse impacts to hydrologic function are detected, appropriate measures (including
closure) will be employed to restore proper functioning condition.”

Following the ENF TMEIS:


The Eldorado National Forest issued a Motor Vehicle Use Map in April, 2009,
showing the designated routes as established through the ENF TMEIS ROD. The map
was updated in 2010 and again in 2012. The 2012 MVUM included the changes in
routes as identified in the 7/31/12 decision of the Eastern District Federal Court,
Judge Karlton.
In keeping with the final decision in the ENF TMEIS ROD, a number of routes or
portions of routes that were previously classified as National Forest System roads but
will be managed as trails were changed on the Forest Transportation System to 4WD
Trails. These routes received a new trail number The routes are tracked in this
Supplemental EIS by the original road number (contains an N in the number) with the
new trail number (contains an E in the number) in parenthesis. On the GIS map set
accompanying this document, the routes are labeled with the new trail number, and
the associated old road number in parentheses.
Following the signing of the ENF TMEIS ROD there were 26 administrative appeals.
These appeals were resolved and the decision upheld by the Regional Forester.
In 2009 a complaint was filed with the Eastern District Federal Court alleging a
number of deficiencies in the EIS.
In 2010, the Eldorado National Forest contracted some monitoring for meadows
associated with designated routes. The results of the monitoring indicated that some
meadows mapped in GIS were not actually meadows. It also indicated that some
meadows were in poor condition, although it did not specifically conclude that
designated routes were the cause of the meadows being in poor condition.
On May 26, 2011, Judge Karlton issued an opinion (Court Case No. 2:09-CV-02523LKK-JFM) that raised an issue as to whether the Forest Service had adequately

explained why ephemeral streams could not function as suitable, non-breeding
California red-legged frog habitat. On September 1, 2011, the Forest Service received
US Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence that the Forest Service’s designation of
routes in Alternative Modified B in the Travel Management Decision is not likely to
adversely affect the California red-legged frog. The Forest Service prepared a new
Biological Assessment and the plaintiffs agree this issue has been resolved. Therefore
the issue will not be addressed in this SEIS.
In its opinion dated May 26, 2011, the Court also found the Forest Service failed to
comply with the National Forest Management Act (“NFMA”) in connection with its
analysis and designation of routes encountering meadows. Specifically, the court
found that the Forest Service had designated 42 routes through meadows which were
inconsistent with certain standards and guidelines in both the Forest’s 1989 Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and standards and guidelines within the 2004
Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA), which amended the ENF LRMP.
The Court pointed out that the error in the agency’s Travel Management Decision was
limited to 42 routes designated for public wheeled motorized travel that have some
segment(s) that go through meadows.
As planned in the ENF TMEIS Monitoring Strategy, field surveys were conducted in
2011 and 2012 at the 95 meadows crossed or bordered by the 42 routes in order to
determine compliance with Standard and Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Record of Decision (SNFPA ROD, 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
Standard and Guideline #100 states: “Maintain and restore the hydrologic
connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by
identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and
subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore
connectivity.” The field surveys were completed by a Hydrologist and a Hydrologic
Technician. The results of the surveys are summarized in the Hydrology section in
Chapter 3 of this SEIS.
On February 14, 2012, the Eastern District Court judge remanded the portion of the
decision that designated 42 roads through meadows for motorized traffic for
reconsideration in light of the applicable law. The Forest Service was directed to
submit a proposed order within 30 days that sets aside only that portion of its decision
that designated the 42 roads to the degree they go through meadows, and not affecting
the sections of those same roads that do not go through meadows, unless they cannot
otherwise be reached. Seasonal closures currently in place were to be extended until
further order of the court.
A final order on Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM was issued by the Eastern
District Court judge on July 31, 2012. That order “sets aside and remands for
reconsideration in light of the applicable law that portion of the Forest Service’s Final
Environmental Impact Statement relating to the Riparian Conservation Objective
(RCO) Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and Guidelines #100 pertaining to the

meadows on the 42 routes… Until such time as the Forest Service completes
supplemental environmental analysis pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) as provided above, public wheeled motorized vehicle use of a route
listed … that intersects a meadow shall be prohibited or limited ... All other portions
of the Forest Service’s decision, including the parts of the 42 routes that do not
intersect meadows, remain in effect.” The order also directed the Forest Service to
revise the Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) to incorporate changes called for in the
order. The revised MVUM’s were prepared and made available to the public in
September, 2012. The Forest is continuing to manage the designated route system to
the present time under the 2012 MVUM.

Purpose and Need for Action______________________________
The underlying needs for this proposal include:
1. There is a need to comply with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of California Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM, Court Order filed
07/31/12 in which the Court “set aside and remanded for reconsideration in light
of the applicable law that portion of the Forest Service’s Final Environmental
Impact Statement relating to the Riparian Conservation Objective (“RCO”)
Analysis for RCO #2 Standards and Guidelines #100 pertaining to the meadows
on the 42 routes.”
2. There is a need to determine whether public wheeled motor vehicle use will be
allowed on the 42 specific routes, or some portion of these routes, designated for
such use in the 2008 TM FEIS ROD that were found by the court to be
inconsistent with the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management
Plan, 1989 (ENF LRMP) Standards and Guidelines, as amended by SNFPA.
The action must also achieve the following purposes from the ENF LRMP and the
National Travel Management Rule of 2005:




providing wheeled motorized access to existing developed and dispersed recreation
opportunities on the Forest,
providing a diversity of wheeled motorized recreation opportunities, and
protecting natural resources

as outlined in the ENF TMEIS, Purpose and Need for Action, page 1-5 through 1-6.

Proposed Action ________________________________________
The Proposed Action is similar to the proposed action that was circulated for public
scoping with a few minor corrections and a change in the proposal for route 14N39,
Richardson Lake. The proposed action circulated in October 2012 proposed this route for
designation for public motorized use up to Richardson Lake, with the portion from
Richardson Lake to the top of Sourdough Hill closed to public motorized use. Comments
were received during the scoping period that stated the main destination of that route was
not Richardson Lake but the view from the top of Sourdough Hill, requesting designation
of the entire route. In the proposed action carried forward into this SEIS, the entire route
would be designated for public motorized use.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

The Forest Service conducted field surveys in 2011 and 2012 at the meadows on National
Forest land crossed or bordered by the 42 routes to determine compliance with Standard
and Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Record of Decision
(SNFPA ROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
For the following 14 routes that USFS field surveys determined did not cross or border
meadows:
1. Designate 08N23B, 08N35, 10N06, 10N26, 10N32, 10NY04, 11N09A,
11N22, 11N70, 12NY15, and 13N24 as “NFTS Road: Open to All Highway
and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.” Designate western 2.2 miles of 09N04
(17E79) as “NFTS 4WD Trail: Open to High Clearance Vehicles.” Designate
09N54 (Leoni Meadows) up to the intersection with 09N60 as “NFTS Road:
Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.” Route 09N54 is a
secondary access road to Leoni Meadows. Designate 17E12 as “NFTS Trail:
Open to Motorcycles only.”
For the following 10 routes where the meadow crossing meets Standard and Guideline
100:
2. Designate 09N15, 10NY05, 10NY06, 12NY06, 14N05, 14N27 and 14N58 as
“NFTS Road: Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.”
Designate 10N03 as “NFTS Road: Open to Highway Legal Vehicles only.”
Designate 17E17 and 17E21 as “NFTS Trail: Open to Motorcycles only.”
For the following 18 routes (10N13 is described in two segments) that the field survey
determined to not currently meet Standard and Guideline 100, and are needed to meet
other purposes:
3. Amend the Eldorado National Forest Plan as amended by SNFPA S&G No.
100 to allow continued public motorized use on these routes and designate
09N01, 09N08, 09N95, 10N01 (B), 0.5 miles of 10N13, 10N14, 10N98, and
14N39 as “NFTS Road: Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal
Vehicles.” Designate 11NY32 as “NFTS Road: Open to Highway Legal
Vehicles only.” Designate 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 6.8 miles of
10N13 (17E73), 10N21 (16E27), 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21), and
17E24 as “NFTS 4WD Trail: Open to High Clearance Vehicles.” Designate
17E16, 17E19 and 17E28 as “NFTS Trail: Open to Motorcycles only.”
The proposed action is described in more detail in Chapter 2 under Alternative 1.

Decision Framework _____________________________________
Given the purpose and need, the deciding official reviews the proposed action, the other
alternatives, and their environmental consequences, in order to determine whether to
implement the proposed action as described, select a different alternative or take no
action at this time.

Forest Plan Direction ____________________________________
The proposed action and alternatives are guided by the Eldorado National Forest Land
and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP), as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement Record of
Decision, January, 2004 (SNFPA). The Forest is subdivided into land allocations
(Management Areas) with established desired conditions and associated management
direction (standards and guidelines). The land allocation that applies to this proposal is
Management Area 28 – Meadow Management (ENF LRMP, pp. 4-277 through 4-282).
The definition of a meadow from the 1989 Land Resource Management Plan (page 4-90)
was used: “A meadow is defined as a grassy opening, 0.1 acres or larger, dominated by
perennial sedges, rushes, and grasses (wet meadow) or perennial grasses and forbs (dry
meadow).” The Standards and Guidelines that apply to management of meadows were
amended by the SNFPA. The SNFPA provided new standards and guidelines that
replaced the standards and guidelines of the original 1989 ENF LRMP for meadows.
Standard & Guideline #100 on page 63 of the 2004 SNFPA ROD applies directly to the
purpose and need of this SEIS. Standard and Guideline #100 states: “Maintain and
restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special
aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural
surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary
to restore connectivity.”

Public Involvement ______________________________________
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Eldorado
National Forest Travel Management Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement was
published in the Federal Register on October 12, 2012. The notice asked that comments
on the proposed action be received by November 7, 2012. In addition, as part of the
public involvement process, information on the proposed action was posted on the
Eldorado National Forest web site and emailed to 784 groups and individuals that have
voiced an interest in travel management on the Eldorado National Forest. The Forest
Service held three public Open House sessions, one in Markleeville on October 22, 2012;
one in Placerville on October 25, 2012, and one in Jackson on October 29, 2012, to share
information about the proposal and listen to issues and concerns brought up by the public.
Approximately 247 letters, emails and comment forms from the public scoping and
8

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

public Open House sessions were received providing public comments on the proposed
action.

Issues _________________________________________________
Comments from the public, other agencies, and tribes were used to formulate issues
concerning the proposed action. The Forest Service separated the issues into two groups:
significant and non-significant. Significant issues were defined as those directly or
indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-significant issues were
identified as those: 1) outside the scope of the proposed action; 2) already decided by
law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; 3) irrelevant to the decision to
be made; or 4) conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The
Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations explain this delineation in
Sec. 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not
significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…”.
A Summary of Public Comments received during the scoping period and the issues that
were identified may be found in Appendix B of this document and in the project record
located at the Eldorado National Forest Supervisor’s Office, Placerville, California.
Comments were received during scoping questioning the field methodology used to
determine effects to meadows:
1. Field Survey Methodology: In particular, they indicated they felt the
methodology for assessing compliance with Standard & Guideline #100 was not
adequate for that purpose and did not follow General Technical Report WO-86a.
This issue was determined to be conjectural and, therefore not carried forward in this
SEIS. The methodology in General Technical Report WO-86a, which provides a detailed
characterization of groundwater dependent features, does not specifically evaluate
compliance with Standard & Guideline #100. As a result, a methodology was developed
for this purpose as described in Table 3.6 of this SEIS. In addition, General Technical
Report WO-86a is only intended for a few types of features that are supported by
groundwater (springs, peatlands, and other wetlands) and not intended for meadows and
wetlands that are not supported by groundwater (i.e. supported by surface runoff and
precipitation). The methodology developed for evaluating compliance with Standard &
Guideline #100 does apply to meadows and wetlands that are not supported by
groundwater, and these types of features were within the scope of features that might be
encountered during the field surveys
The Forest Service identified the following significant issues from the public comments
during scoping:

9

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

1. Route 14N39 - Richardson Lake: Richardson Lake is not the main destination for
route 14N39. Users enjoy a drive to the summit of Sourdough Hill to enjoy the views and
the sunset. The entire route should be designated for public motorized use.
This issue was addressed through a modification to the Proposed Action (Alternative #1).
The route is now proposed for designation all the way to the top of Sourdough Hill in
Alternative #1.
2. Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment: Amending the Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) to allow continued public motorized use in sensitive
meadow habitats will result in impacts to hydrology, natural vegetation and wildlife
habitat.
Alternatives #3 and #4 were developed to address this issue. Alternatives #3 and #4
would not amend the LRMP.
3. Corrective Actions: The proposed action does not include corrective actions to fix
the routes found inconsistent with Standard and Guideline #100 so impacts to meadows
will continue to persist.
Alternatives #3 and #4 both address this issue. While Alternatives #3 and #4 do not
include a description of the necessary actions required to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows, routes inconsistent with Standard
and Guideline 100 would not be available for public use until work has been completed
to bring them into compliance.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Proposed
Action
Introduction ___________________________________________
This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Eldorado
National Forest Travel Management Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. It
describes both alternatives considered in detail and those eliminated from detailed study.
The end of this chapter presents the alternatives in tabular format so that the alternatives
can be readily compared. One of the alternatives, Alternative 1, includes an amendment
to the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP).

Development of the Proposed Action ______________________
In order to address the purpose and need, the 42 routes were surveyed in 2011 and 2012
in order to: 1.) reassess the location of the meadows on National Forest land that border
or cross the 42 routes, and 2.) determine whether those routes were in compliance with
Standard and Guideline #100 of the ENF LRMP as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment Record of Decision (SNFPAROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
Standard and Guideline #100 states: “Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of
streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by identifying roads and
trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths.
Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore connectivity.”

The Proposed Action was developed based on the information summarized in the
previous table. Analysis supporting the determination as to whether routes meet Standard
and Guideline 100 is provided in Chapter 3 under Hydrology.

Alternatives Considered in Detail __________________________
Based on the issues identified through public comment on the proposed action, the Forest
Service developed three alternative proposals that achieve the purpose and need specified
in the July 31, 2012 Court Order, including the Proposed Action. In addition, the Forest
Service is required to analyze a No Action alternative. The alternatives are described in
detail below.
Alternative 1 - Proposed Action
Minor changes have been made to Alternative 1 since the circulation of the Proposed
Action during scoping in October, 2012. Route 09N54, a secondary access road to Leoni
Meadows, was moved to category of “No Meadows on National Forest Land” since the
meadow is located on private property. Routes 14N05 and 14N58 were moved into the
category of Meadows meeting Standard and Guideline 100, and routes 08N35, 09N04
(17E79), 10N32 and 11N09A were moved to the category of “No Meadows on National
Forest Land” based on review of information collected and additional field surveys.
In response to public scoping, there was also a change in the proposal for route 14N39,
Richardson Lake. The proposed action circulated in October 2012 proposed this route for
designation for public motorized use up to Richardson Lake, with the portion from
Richardson Lake to the top of Sourdough Hill closed to public motorized use. Comments
were received during the scoping period that stated the main destination of that route was
not Richardson Lake but the view from the top of Sourdough Hill, requesting designation
of the entire route. In the proposed action carried forward into this SEIS, the entire route
would be designated for public motorized use.
A Forest Plan Amendment is included in Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, to provide
an exception to Standard and Guideline #100 of the ENF LRMP Sierra Nevada Forest
Plan Amendment (SNFPA) to allow for public motorized use on sections affecting the
hydrologic connectivity of meadows until corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented at some time in the future.
The Eldorado National Forest proposes to designate the following routes for public
motorized use:

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
The following routes or route segments would require a Forest Plan amendment to be
designated open for public wheeled motor vehicle use: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26),
09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider Camp Road), 6.8 miles
of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27; Long Canyon
4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett 4WD trail), 11NY32,
14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. These routes are proposed for a Forest Plan
amendment because they provide a unique recreation opportunity (such as a high
elevation trail experience), enhance the recreation experience by connecting routes or
areas, provide access to areas of interest, or allow access for camping. They would be
designated for public motorized use with an exception to Standard and Guideline #100 of
the ENF LRMP SNFPA to allow for public motorized use on sections affecting the
hydrologic connectivity of meadows until corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented
Alternative 2 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, current management would continue to guide allowed
uses of the individual routes. The same portions of the 42 routes that were closed under
16

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

the court order would remain closed to public motorized use. No designation of route
segments currently closed would be implemented. There would be no amendments to the
LRMP.
Alternative 3 – Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the ENF LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 3 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The LRMP would not be amended for the routes as proposed in Alternative 1: 09N01,
09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider
Camp Road), 6.8 miles of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 10N21
(16E27; Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett
4WD trail), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. Instead, these routes would
continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use and
identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are in compliance with
Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. This alternative identifies these
routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions necessary to bring
each into compliance with Standard and Guideline 100. Corrective actions would be
proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement
corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions have been analyzed and
implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail on the
next revision of the MVUM.

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
There are no routes requiring LRMP amendments under this alternative.
Alternative 4
Alternative 4 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the ENF LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 1 except for the following:
The following routes or portions of routes would be designated for public motorized use:
09N54 (open up to intersection with 09N60, closed to public motorized use past that
point), 10N06, 10N26, 11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 13N24, 09N15, 10NY05 (open from
10NY04 to a point just before drainage near 16E27, and closed beyond that point) and
14N05 (open up to McKinstry Trailhead, closed to public motorized use beyond the
trailhead), and 14N27.

The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until the routes are in compliance with Standard and
Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (open to a spot suitable
for camping just north of Schneider Camp meadow, closed to public motorized use
beyond that point), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27) (open except for the section between
10NY04E and the section currently open on the west end), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32.
This alternative identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze
the actions necessary to bring each route into compliance with Standard and Guideline
100. Corrective actions would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses,
as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions
have been analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public
motorized road or trail on the next revision of the MVUM.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35,
10N32, and 10NY06. The reasons mitigation is indicated for these routes are documented
in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in this document. Mitigation
would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to
implement corrective actions becomes available. After the mitigation has been analyzed
and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motorized road or trail
on the next revision of the MVUM. Portions of these routes that are currently open under
the court order would remain open for public motorized use.
The following portions of routes that are not currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use
and identified on a MVUM until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to
Standard and Guideline 100 and meadows is implemented: western 2.26 miles of 09N04
(17E79), and 10N03.
The portions of the following routes that are currently closed to public motorized use
under court order would remain closed to public motor vehicle use: 09N54 past
intersection with 09N60, 10NY04, 17E12, 14N58, 17E17, 17E21, 09N82 (southern
portion 16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01 (10N01B), 10N13 (17E73), closed
beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the section currently
open on the west end), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), a portion of 12NY06, 14N05 past
McKinstry Trailhead, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24 (west and east portions), and 17E28.
A portion of 12NY06 that is not currently closed to public motorized use by court order
would be closed in this alternative.

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
There are no routes requiring LRMP amendments under this alternative.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study ___
Federal agencies are required to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all
reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives
that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in
response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for
achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the
scope of the need for the proposal, duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or
determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm.
Therefore, a number of alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed
consideration for reasons summarized below:
An alternative which included closure and rehabilitation of some routes was considered
but not carried forward. The purpose and need of this analysis was to reconsider whether
to allow public motorized use on 42 specific routes. An alternative addressing closure and
rehabilitation of those routes that are not designated for public motorized use is beyond
the scope of this analysis since a decision is not being made regarding other uses of the
routes including administrative use or permitted use such as access to private property.
An alternative was considered that would analyze the on the ground corrective actions for
each route that did not meet Standard and Guideline #100. This alternative was not
carried forward because substantially more time and resources would be required to
analyze in detail the appropriate corrective actions that could be taken for each route,
including additional field analysis for potential reroutes or ground disturbing activities.
The on the ground corrective actions will be analyzed on a route by route basis as
required by the alternative that is selected in the Record of Decision. This will enable the
24 routes that were found to not affect meadows to be reopened more expediently.

Comparison of Alternatives_______________________________
The table on the following pages provides a brief summary of mileages of route
designations under each of the alternatives in comparative format.

Comparison of Alternatives: Effects by Resource Area

Hydrology
The Hydrology Analysis indicates that there are 24 routes where there is no difference
between the alternatives with regard to Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100. This is
because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross or border
meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
#100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G #100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G #100. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in zero,
18, and seven of those 18 routes meeting S&G #100, respectively. This also means that
Alternatives 2, 3, 4 would result in 18, 0, and 13 routes not meeting S&G #100,
respectively.
It would likely take a number of years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes
meeting S&G #100.
The above results are summarized in Table 3.9 and Figure 3.9.

Recreation
The Recreation Analysis shows that the alternatives differ substantially as to effects to
recreation users. Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, results in the highest number of
miles of roads and trails rated high in recreation value open to public motorized use
initially (95.8 miles). Alternative 3 results in the same number of miles of high value
recreation routes designated for public motorized use, however only 53.4 of those miles
would be open initially, with an additional 42.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS
but not designated for public motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map
(MVUM) until corrective actions are analyzed and implemented. Alternative 4 would
result in 3.7miles of high recreation value routes open to public motorized use, with an
additional 13.4 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS but not designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until corrective
actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 2, No Action, only the
29.97 miles of high value recreation routes that were not closed by court order would

24

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

remain open, with 65.85 miles of high value recreation routes closed to public motorized
use.
The effects on 4WD and motorcycle riding opportunities, particularly high country routes
over 6,000 feet in elevation, all rated high in recreation value, also vary substantially
between alternatives. In Alternative 1, the proposed action, 42.06 miles of 4WD routes,
all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately 18.47 miles of high
country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in recreation value. In
Alternative 3, the same number of high country 4WD trails would be designated for
public motorized use, however only 11.22 miles would be open initially, with an
additional 30.84 miles added to the MVUM once corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
would be designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions are
analyzed and implemented. In Alternative 4, 8.96 miles of high country 4WD trails would
remain open, and an additional 7.85 miles of high country 4WD trails would be
designated open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions and mitigation
are analyzed and implemented. Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail
opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be
closed, and all of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles,
representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado
National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed. In Alternative 2, 11.22
miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, and 30.84 miles of high country
4WD trails would be closed. This equates to the closure of 65 percent of the total 4WD
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. All of the
high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.47 miles, rated medium to high
recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This represents 90 percent of
the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in
elevation.

Analysis Framework
The scope of analysis is defined by the following Court Order: Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKKJFM (United States District Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12). This Court
Order requires the Forest Service to analyze 42 specific routes for consistency with the Riparian
Conservation Objective (RCO) #2, Standard and Guideline #100. The Court Order left intact all
other portions of the Forest Service’s travel management decision, including the parts of the
routes that do not intersect meadows. As a consequence, this analysis focuses on S&G #100,
which relates to impacts to meadows. The 42 routes are listed in Table 3.4, and S&G #100 is
provided in full below. Additional hydrologic topics were analyzed in the 2008 TM EIS and
ROD. Please refer to the 2008 TM EIS for an analysis of water quality, cumulative watershed
effects, streams, and wetlands.

Standard & Guideline #100:
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other
special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural
surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary to
restore connectivity.”

Data and Analysis Methods
Meadow Survey Results
The 42 routes were surveyed in the Eldorado National Forest (ENF) in 2011 and 2012 in
order to: 1) locate the meadows that border or cross the 42 routes, and 2) determine
whether those meadows and associated routes are in compliance with Standard and
Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Record of Decision
(SNFPAROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows. Standard and Guideline #100 states:
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and
other special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or
disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions
where necessary to restore connectivity.”
A summary of the survey results is described below and in Table 3.5 and Figure 3.1.
 81 of the surveyed features in the ENF were classified as meadows and 34 of the
features were not classified as meadows (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). The features that
were not classified as meadows included alder-dominated wetlands, narrow strips
of alder adjacent to streams, forested areas with or without shrubs, and areas of
shrubs without trees.
 14 routes do not cross or border meadows. As a result, S&G #100 does not apply
to these routes with regard to meadows.
 10 routes meet S&G #100. This is because these routes cross or border meadows
that meet S&G #100.
 18 routes do not meet S&G #100. This is because these routes have affected the
hydrology of a total of 38 meadows such that S&G #100 was not being met.
A description of the field surveys, which includes the definitions and methodology used,
is in Table 3.6. A summary of the field survey results for individual routes is in Table
3.7; a summary of the meadows that do not meet S&G #100 is in Table 3.8; two
examples of field surveys are in Figures 3.4 through 3.8. All of the field survey forms are
included in the Project Record.

Table 3.6 Description of the field surveys of meadows in the Eldorado National Forest

Purpose of field
surveys
Standard and
Guideline #100

To determine if specific road or trail segments are causing adjacent meadows to not meet
Standard and Guideline #100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment of 2004.
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and
other special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or
disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions
where necessary to restore connectivity.”

Definition of a
meadow2

“A meadow is defined as a grassy opening, 0.1 acres or larger, dominated by perennial
sedges, rushes, and grasses (wet meadow) or perennial grasses and forbs (dry
meadow).”

Characteristics
of a meadow3

 “A meadow is an ecosystem type composed of one or more plant communities
dominated by herbaceous species.
 It supports plants that use surface water and/or shallow groundwater (generally at
depths of less than one meter).
 Woody vegetation, like trees or shrubs, may occur and be dense but are not
dominant.”

Definition of
hydrologic
connectivity

The hydrologic connectivity of a meadow exists when the surface and subsurface flow of
water through the meadow has not been visibly altered by the road or trail segment.
Description.
A field survey form for meadows was developed specifically to evaluate compliance
with Standard & Guideline #100. The questions on page 2 of the survey form are
specific to visible or noticeable evidence of alteration of the surface and subsurface flow
of water through the meadow. The questions are qualitative, require hydrologic
knowledge and field experience to answer, and are based on features that are visible at
the ground surface, but reflect surface and subsurface water flow characteristics as
described in the criteria below.4

Methodology4

Assumptions
 The mere presence of a road or trail through or adjacent to a meadow (on-theground) does not determine if Standard and Guideline #100 is being met. This is
because it is possible for a road or trail to occur within or adjacent to a meadow
without a visible alteration of surface or subsurface flow of water into or through
the meadow.
 A disruption of surface and/or subsurface flow in the meadow by a road or trail
would result in evidence that can be seen at the surface, such as changes in
vegetation, presence of deposited sediment, gullies, incised stream channels, etc.
Criteria for rating Standard &Guideline #100
Roads and trails were rated as not meeting Standard & Guideline #100 if field evidence
was visible that shows one or more of the following:
 The road or trail intercepts and diverts surface and/or subsurface water from the
meadow and routes the water away from the meadow such that the meadow has
decreased in size and/or wetness.
 Runoff from the road or trail has eroded sediment into the meadow such that
the size and/or wetness of the meadow has been reduced.
 Runoff from the road or trail has caused a stream channel to downcut such that
the water table next to the stream has dropped and the size and/or the wetness
of the meadow has decreased.

Environmental Consequences

Effects Common to All Alternatives

There are 14 routes where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 is not applicable with
regard to meadows. This is because field surveys in 2011 and 2012 determined that
these 14 routes do not cross or border a meadow in the Eldorado National Forest (ENF).
The definition and characteristics of a meadow is described in Table 3.6. The eleven
routes are: 08N23B, 08N35, 09N04 (17E79), 09N54, 10N06, 10N26, 10N32, 10NY04,
11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 12NY15, 13N24, and 17E12.
There are 10 routes where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 would be met. This is
because field surveys in 2011 and 2012 determined that all meadows that cross or border
these 10 routes meet S&G #100. The reason that these meadows meet S&G #100 is
because the following conditions were met at the time of the field surveys:
 The road or trail does not intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface water
from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
meadow has decreased in size and/or wetness.
 Runoff from the road or trail has not eroded sediment into the meadow such that
the size and/or wetness of the meadow has decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail has not caused a stream channel to downcut such
that the water table next to the stream has dropped and the size and/or the wetness
of the meadow has decreased.
The 10 routes where S&G #100 would be met are: 09N15, 10N03, 10NY05, 10NY06,
12NY06, 14N05, 14N27, 14N58, 17E17, and 17E21. The methodology used to evaluate
compliance with S&G #100 is described in more detail in Table 3-6.
Most of the 18 routes that do not meet Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100 will likely not
do so for a number of years. The primary reason is that a detailed plan of corrective
actions (to attain compliance with S&G #100) for most of the 18 routes does not
currently exist, and would require 2 - 10 years to both develop and implement. The 18
routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 10N13
(17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32,
14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.

Alternative 1: Proposed Action
There are 18 routes – the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where S&G #100 would no longer apply.
This is because a Forest Plan Amendment would exempt these 18 routes from S&G #100.
The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01,
10N13 (17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21),
11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to 38 meadows. The adverse impacts to
each meadow would include one or more of the following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
Ten OHV trails – all of which are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 would not meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 Water Quality Management
Handbook (WQMH) of December 2011.1,2,3 This is because Alternative 1 (Proposed
Action) contains no actions to correct or mitigate adverse impacts to meadows caused by
these OHV trails that were identified during the 2011 and 2012 field surveys. BMP
4.7.1, item # 3a-b states: “3. Identify trail segments causing adverse impacts to water
resources and prioritize mitigation measures, such as a.) Relocate existing trails or trail
segments that are in high-risk locations, including SMZs, riparian areas, and meadows,
to restore surface and subsurface hydrologic function, b.) Reconstruct trails to improve,
modify, or restore effective drainage.”
The ten OHV trails are: 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N93), 17E73 (10N13), 16E27
(10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.3
___________________________________________________________________

BMP 4.7.1, item #3a-b only applies to OHV trails and not to roads. The handbook National Best Management
Practices for Water Quality Management on National Forest System Lands (April 2012) contains similar language in
pages 91-92 to BMP 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the 2011 WQMH.

The 2008 TM EIS and ROD was under the WQMH of 2000; this SEIS is under the WQMH of 2011.

Trails that would not meet BMP #4.7.1, item #3a-b are identified by their trail number. For those routes that were
converted from a road to trail through the 2008 Travel Management ROD, the original road number is shown in
parenthesis to allow the reader to track between the 2008 EIS and this SEIS.

Alternative 2: No Action
There are 18 routes - the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100
would not be met. This is because Alternative 2 (No Action) does not require that a plan
of corrective actions for the 18 routes be developed in order to attain compliance with
S&G #100. The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95,
10N01, 10N13 (17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F
(16E21), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to 38 meadows until corrective actions
are taken. The adverse impacts to each meadow would include one or more of the
following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
There are ten OHV trails (that are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100) that
would not meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 WQMH of December 2011.
There are two reasons for this conclusion:
 Alternative 2 (No Action) does not contain actions to correct or mitigate adverse
impacts to meadows caused by those OHV trails as identified during the 2011 and
2012 field surveys.
 The closure of an OHV trail to public use, by itself, does not correct the reason(s)
that that the OHV trail is causing a meadow(s) to not meet S&G #100. For
example, a trail that intercepts surface and/or subsurface water from a meadow
and routes that water down the road and away from the meadow will continue to
do so after vehicles are not allowed on the trail. Two examples of this - meadows
17E73-3 and 17E34-5 - are described in Affected Environment, Figures 3.4
through 3-8. The reason(s) that a meadow does not meet S&G #100 have been
previously described in more detail in Effects Common to All Alternatives
(paragraph 2) and in Table 3.6.
The ten OHV trails are: 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N93), 17E73 (10N13), 16E27
(10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.

Alternative 3
The effects of Alternative 3 are similar to Alternative 1 with one important difference.
There are 18 routes - the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100
would be met after corrective measures to the routes have been implemented and the
Forest Service has determined that the routes are consistent with Standard and Guideline
(S&G) #100. The corrective measures could include one or more of the following:
 Relocation of route segments away from meadows and the subsequent removal of
unnecessary route segments near meadows.
 Reconstruction of route segments to direct runoff (and sediment) from meadows.
 Road or trail improvements in meadows that prevent the interception and
diversion of surface and subsurface water.
 Structures in route segments that enable vehicles to be suspended above
meadows.
Adverse impacts (as described under Alternative 1) would likely continue to occur to 38
meadows until the corrective actions to the 18 routes (that do not meet S&G #100) have
been implemented. The adverse impacts to each meadow would include one or more of
the following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01,
10N13 (17E73), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21),
11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
There are ten OHV trails (that are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G#100) that
would meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 WQMH of December 2011 after
corrective measures to the OHV trails have been implemented such that the routes are
consistent with Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100. The ten OHV trails are: 16E26
(09N82), 19E01 (09N93), 17E73 (10N13), 16E27 (10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21

Alternative 4
The effects of implementing Alternative 4 are similar to Alternative 1 except for a few
differences as described below.
There are 13 routes - all of which crossed or bordered at least one meadow that did not
meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100
would not be met. There are two reasons for this conclusion:
 The closure of these 13 routes to public use, by itself, does not correct the
reason(s) that that each route is causing a meadow(s) to not meet S&G #100. For
example, runoff from a road or trail that has eroded sediment into a meadow such
that the size and/or wetness of the meadow has decreased will continue to do so
after vehicles are not allowed on the road or trail. The reason(s) that a meadow
does not meet S&G #100 have been previously described in more detail in Effects
Common to All Alternatives (paragraph 2) and in Table 3.6.
 Alternative 4 does not require that a plan of corrective actions be developed for
the 13 routes in order to attain compliance with S&G #100.
The 13 routes are: 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01 (10N01B), 10N13
(17E73; closed beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the
section currently open on the west end), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 14N39, 17E16, 17E19,
17E24, and 17E28.
There are seven routes – all of which crossed or bordered by at least one meadow that did
not meet Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100 - where Standard and Guideline (S&G)
#100 would be met after corrective measures to the routes have been implemented and
the Forest Service has determined that the seven routes are consistent with Standard and
Guideline (S&G) #100. The corrective measures could include one or more of the
following:
 Relocation of route segments away from meadows and the subsequent removal of
unnecessary route segments near meadows.
 Reconstruction of route segments to direct runoff (and sediment) away from
meadows.
 Road or trail improvements in meadows that prevent the interception and
diversion of surface and subsurface water.
 Structures in route segments that enable vehicles to be suspended above
meadows.
The seven routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (segment from highway 88 to just north of
Schneider camp meadow), 10N14, a segment of 10N21 (16E27), 11N26F (16E21), and
11NY32.

Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to the meadows crossed or bordered by
the above seven routes until the corrective actions to the seven routes have been
implemented. The adverse impacts to each meadow (that does not currently meet S&G
#100) would include one or more of the following:
 The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
 Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
 Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
There are seven routes where corrective measures would be implemented that are not
related to meadows and S&G #100. The seven routes are: 08N23B, 08N35, 09N04
(17E79), 10N03, 10N32, 10NY06, and 12NY15. These routes either do not contain
meadows or contain meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are eight OHV trails (that are part of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100) that
would not meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5 WQMH of December 2011.
There are two reasons for this conclusion:
 Alternative 4 does not contain actions to correct or mitigate adverse impacts to
meadows caused by those eight OHV trails as identified during the 2011 and 2012
field surveys.
 The closure of an OHV trail to public use, by itself, does not correct the reason(s)
that that the OHV trail is causing a meadow(s) to not meet S&G #100. The
reasons for this have been previously discussed.
The eight OHV trails are: 16E26 (09N82), 16E33 (11N23F), 17E73 (10N13), 19E01
(09N83), 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
There are two OHV trails that would meet BMP # 4.7.1, item #3a-b of the Region 5
WQMH of December 2011 after corrective measures to the OHV trails have been
implemented such that the routes are consistent with Standard and Guideline (S&G)
#100. The OHV trails are: 16E27 (10N21) and 16E21 (11N26F).

Summary
There are 24 routes where there is no difference between the alternatives with regard to
Standard & Guideline (S&G) #100. This is because 14 routes do not cross or border
meadows and 10 routes cross or border meadows that meet S&G #100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
#100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G #100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G #100. Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 would result in zero,
18, and seven of those 18 routes meeting S&G #100, respectively. This also means that
Alternatives 2, 3, 4 would result in 18, 0, and 13 routes not meeting S&G #100,
respectively.
It would likely take a number of years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes
meeting S&G #100.
The above results are summarized in Table 3.9 and Figure 3.9.

Recreation _____________________________________________
Affected Environment

Background
The 42 routes being considered in this document are located on three Ranger Districts of
the Eldorado National Forest. Most of the routes are located in the higher elevations, over
6,000 feet. High elevation roads and trails offer a different recreation experience than
lower elevation trails. There are not a large number of high elevation 4WD recreation
opportunities across the Forest. High elevation trails provide access to remote areas on
the Forest, especially for older and less able individuals who might otherwise not be able
to enjoy these areas. High elevation trails have cooler temperatures during the summer
months than those in the lower elevations, and often have sweeping views and beautiful
fall colors. The setting for these routes is more desirable for camping due to greater
solitude and scenic quality. Some of the routes are also used by hikers, mountain bikers
and equestrians. Some provide vehicle access to other hiking and equestrian
opportunities, including day hikes into the Desolation and Mokelumne Wilderness areas.
The higher elevation routes also offer access for deer and quail hunting during hunting
season, and access for fishing along streams and lake shores. The routes also provide
access for photography, geocaching, bird watching and wildlife viewing, and spiritual
pursuits.
The 42 routes being considered offer a variety of levels of challenge for recreation users.
Some of the routes are fully developed Forest roads, while others are passable only with
specialized vehicles. Several of the routes, such as the Barrett 4wd Trail, Squaw Ridge
4WD Trail, Strawberry 4WD Trail, and Clover Valley 4WD Trail offer multi-day
recreation opportunities with camping. The Barrett 4WD Trail offers a level of challenge
for 4WD users that is relatively unique in the Region, allowing users to test their
technical skills in travelling over large boulders. Only a few other 4WD trails in the
Sierra Nevada offer a similar level of challenge, including the Rubicon Trail on the
Eldorado National Forest and Fordyce Creek Trail on the Tahoe National Forest.
A number of the 42 routes being considered have been in use for over a hundred years,
being remnants of early emigrant trails over the Sierra Nevada. Others have been in place
for multiple generations, and many users have established treasured family traditions of
bringing the younger and older generations along on trips. Exposing family and friends to
the Forest through OHV recreation also fosters a love of the Forest in younger
generations and provides interpretive opportunities.

RECREATION VALUES OF THE 42 ROUTES:
Placerville Ranger District
Leek Springs Valley (09N15)
Route 09N15 is a native surface road approximately 0.5 miles long that ends at the
northeast corner of private property in the Leek Spring Valley area. This road is popular
for high elevation scenic driving , for hunting, and provides access to the North Fork
Cosumnes River for fishing.
Leoni (09N54)
Route 09N54 is a native surface road that enters the SW corner of the Leoni Meadows
Private Camp. The road does not provide the main access into camp, but serves as a route
for scenic driving and hiking. This road is open to all vehicles and is used by Forest
visitors for access to the Forest, driving for pleasure, fuel wood gathering, hunting, and as
a route for horseback and mountain bike riding by camp attendees.
Pebble Ridge (10N06)
Route 10N06 is a native surface road that connects two paved roads 10N59 and 10N58 in
the Pebble Canyon area which is popular for scenic driving, dispersed camping and for
hunters. The road is approximately 2 miles long and parallels a tributary of Camp Creek
which is popular for fishing.
Strawberry 4WD Trail (portion of 10N13, now 17E73)
The northern portion of route 10N13 (17E73), also known as Strawberry 4WD trail, is
used primarily by 4WD enthusiasts seeking a lower level of difficulty 4WD recreational
experience. Forest visitors can access the Strawberry 4WD Trail from either the
Placerville Ranger District (RD) side or the Amador RD side (via 10N13 Schneider
Camp Road). The trail offers ample recreational activities such as hiking, photography,
bird watching, mountain biking and wildflower viewing. The Strawberry 4WD Trail
continues to be a destination for 4 wheel drive activities, especially in the late spring and
early summer; however, it is not as intensively used as other trails such as the Rubicon
Trail. Routes 10N13 and 17E73 combined are approximately 6.73 miles long. Except for
a limited amount of the total length of the trail, the trail does not provide “extreme” 4WD
conditions. The Gold Hill Posse (GHP) 4WD club has “adopted” the Strawberry 4WD
Trail since 2002. This volunteer group routinely provides trail maintenance including reenforcing water bars to redirect water from the trail. The GHP have contributed
approximately 500 hours of volunteer labor since 2002, and are still active participants in
the Adopt-A-Trail program.

experience. The Long Canyon 4WD Trail provides a ‘loop’ with several other routes and
continues to be a destination for 4WD activities; however, it is not as intensively used as
other trails such as the Rubicon Trail. The Long Canyon 4WD Trail is approximately 4
miles long and is also used for hiking, mountain biking and hunting. A segment of the
trail provides a panoramic view of the forest and is a popular destination for forest
recreation, both motorized and non-motorized. Except for a limited amount of the total
length of the trail, the trail does not provide “extreme” 4WD conditions. Forest visitors
can access the Long Canyon 4WD Trail from either the Silver Fork Road or the
Packsaddle Road. The NorCal FJ Cruisers “adopted” the Long Canyon 4WD Trail in
2011. This volunteer group provides trail maintenance including the removal of trash
from the trail and adjacent lands. In addition they provide peer to peer informational
services to other OHV users on the trail regarding proper use of the forest and resource
protection. They contributed approximately 100 hours of volunteer labor during the
summer of 2011 and are still active.

routes provide access to some of the higher elevations on the district with spectacular
panoramic views of the surrounding areas, including Desolation and Mokelumne
wildernesses. These roads provide additional ‘loops’ surrounding the Long Canyon 4WD
Trail.
Bryan Creek (11N09A) and Sayles Canyon Trailhead
The end of the 11N90A road is a well-developed trail head that is used for accessing
Sayles Canyon Trail and the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. Sayles Canyon trail is a
popular high elevation non-motorized trail offering many hiking, equestrian and some
mountain bike activities. The high elevation environment and meadows along the hiking
trail, also affords forest visitors many nature based recreational activities including
wildflower walks, bird watching and photography. The relative ease of the trail provides a
near wilderness experience for forest visitors who otherwise may not be able to enjoy
such areas. The Bryan Creek Road is also used as a permitted access road for Sierra-atTahoe Ski Resort’s West Bowl area to maintain and service the ski lifts in the summer. In
2011 volunteers successfully completed the ‘Sayles Canyon Trailhead Improvement
Project’ including repair and resurfacing the existing trailhead loop, cleared the roadside
of overgrown brush, delineated and graded parking areas within the existing trailhead
area. The volunteer group “Elegant Ears Equestrians” and other equestrian groups
contributed approximately 941 hours of volunteer labor and over $7,000 dollars in
donations for materials and equipment use to improve the trailhead.

Indicator Measures
Two indicator measures were used for this analysis. The first is a relative recreation value
rating that was assigned to each route based on a set of criteria explained below. The
second indicator measure used was whether the route is a high country route (traverses
ground over 6,000 feet in elevation). High country routes represent a unique recreation
opportunity in the Sierra Nevada, and many of the historic high country routes have been
closed to public motorized use in the past, so few routes of this type remain available for
public motorized recreation use.

Rating of Recreation Values Associated with the 42 Routes
For the purpose of this analysis, the following criteria have been used to provide a rating
of recreation access and opportunities for the 42 routes. The criteria are similar to those
that were used in the 2008 Travel Management FEIS, Appendix H, to rate recreation
values associated with Intermittent Service Roads (NFS Level 1 Roads).
Low





Routes which provide only a very limited recreation opportunity, such as a short
route which accesses no specific dispersed recreation opportunity; or
Routes which provide access to a recreation opportunity that is very common,
such as access for hunting in an area with many other routes of comparable
opportunity; or
Routes which have a low level of use because of the lack of public recreation
opportunities.

Medium





Routes which provide only a moderate level of recreation opportunity, such as an
access route to a moderately popular dispersed recreation opportunity; or
Routes which provide access to a recreation opportunity that is somewhat unique,
such as access to stream reaches popular for fishing in an area lacking many other
comparable opportunities; or
Routes which provide recreation opportunities along the road which are not motor
vehicle based, such as horseback riding, etc.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Direct Effects to Recreation
Effects of Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
In Alternative 1, all of the routes temporarily closed under the court order in 2012 would
be reopened for public motorized use according to the type of use established in the 2008
Eldorado National Forest Travel Management Environmental Impact Statement and
Record of Decision. For the 42 routes, approximately 95.8 miles of roads and trails rated
high in recreation value would be open to public motorized use. Approximately 42.1
miles of 4WD routes, all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately
18.5 miles of high country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in
recreation value. Users would be able to continue enjoying these traditional motorized
routes and the portions of the Forest they access. None of the 42 routes rated medium or
high recreation value would be closed to public motorized use. A summary of the miles of
routes that would be reopened is provided in Table 3.2.
Effects of Alternative 2 (No Action)
In Alternative 2, all portions of the 42 routes that are currently closed would remain
closed to public motorized use. The 30 miles of high value recreation routes that were not
closed by court order would remain open, with 65.9 miles of high value recreation routes
closed to public motorized use. Approximately 11.2 miles of high country 4WD trails
would remain open, all rated high in recreation value, and 30.8 miles of high country
4WD trails would remain closed, all rated high in recreation value. This represents 65
percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000
feet in elevation. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles,
rated medium to high recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This
represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National
Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. Routes that are closed to public motorized use may
remain open to non-motorized trail uses, resulting in an increase in the non-motorized
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest. A summary of the miles of routes that
would be open and closed is provided in Table 3.2.
Effects of Alternative 3
In Alternative 3, approximately 53.4 miles of high value recreation routes would be open
to public motorized use, with an additional 42.4 miles of high value recreation routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are
in compliance with Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. Approximately
11.2 miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, all rated high in recreation
value, and an additional 30.8 miles of high country 4WD trails routes would be continue
to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public motorized use and

identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are in compliance with
Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. All of the high country motorcycle
trails, approximately 18.5 miles, rated medium to high recreation value, would be routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until the routes are
in compliance with Standard and Guideline 100 as it pertains to meadows. None of the
medium or high value recreation routes are designated closed to public motorized use. It
is estimated that analyzing and implementing necessary mitigation measures designed to
meet Standard and Guideline #100 could take a number of years, depending upon
available funding sources. A summary of the miles of routes that would be open and
closed is provided in Table 3.2.
Effects of Alternative 4
In Alternative 4, approximately 35.7 miles of high value recreation routes would be open
to public motorized use, with an additional 13.4 miles of high value recreation routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map (MVUM) until corrective
actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented, and 46.7 miles of high value
recreation routes closed to public motorized use. Approximately 9 miles of high country
4WD trails would remain open, all rated high in recreation value, and an additional 7.9
miles of high country 4WD trails would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not
be designated for public motorized use and identified on a Motor Vehicle Use Map
(MVUM) until corrective actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented.
Approximately 25.3 miles of high country 4WD trails would be closed, all rated high in
recreation value. This includes many very popular routes such as the Strawberry 4WD
Trail, Squaw Ridge 4WD Trail, Carson Emigrant National Recreation Trail, and Clover
Valley/Deer Valley Trail. Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities
on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed. All of the
high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles rated medium to high recreation
value and representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the
Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation, would be closed to public
motorized use. This represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on
the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. Routes that are closed to public
motorized use may remain open to non-motorized trail uses, resulting in an increase in
the non-motorized trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest. It is estimated that
analyzing and implementing necessary mitigation measures designed to meet Standard
and Guideline #100 could take a number of years, depending upon available funding
sources. A summary of the miles of routes that would be open and closed is provided in
Table 3.2.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Indirect Effects to Recreation
In addition to the direct affects to recreation under each alternative, there are some
additional routes that would be indirectly affected under each alternative other than the
proposed action, resulting in a decrease in mileage available for recreation. These roads
and trails are routes that are accessed by one of the 42 routes planned to be closed or
opened after mitigation in that alternative. These routes are currently designated open to
motorized use under the 2008 Eldorado National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized
Travel Management EIS and Record of Decision, but they are not currently displayed on
the MVUM since they cannot be reached without travelling on a portion of one of the 42
routes currently closed to public motorized use pending completion of this SEIS. In
alternatives where they are not shown closed, the routes would be added back on to the
MVUM after a decision is issued on this SEIS.
In Alternative 2, No Action, 11.2 miles of additional routes would be affected. In
Alternative 3, 8.1 miles would be affected until corrective actions are completed on the
respective access routes. In Alternative 4, 9.3 miles would be affected until corrective
actions and/or mitigation is completed on the respective access routes.

Closure of the 42 routes resulted in greater impacts to
legitimate public recreation than was reflected by the route
mileage of the 42 routes alone.

I would like to volunteer time to work on maintaining and
improving these routes/Recommend partnerships with OHV
user groups to do work on the roads and trails to reduce
erosion, protect sensitive areas.

With some mitigating strategies for meadows and streams,
these traditional OHV roads can and should remain open.

Closure of these trails results in greater impacts on the
remaining few available local trails, both on the ground and
in terms of user safety as use becomes concentrated (Rubicon
specifically mentioned)

If no other mitigation is appropriate or available, willing to
accept seasonal closure of the most sensitive areas as long as
closures are based/implemented on actual
observation/measurement of conditions (such as they do at
Georgetown and Mammoth Bar after rainfall) rather than an
inflexible calendar-based schedule

Request Deer Valley trail to remain open to OHV use. Propose
a reroute at the meadow area of concern. Details provided.

26,36, 37, 116, 117,

Keep Barrett Lake accessible to the wheeled public. It is a
great trail to go hiking from as it gets you near the peaks and
lakes.

We like to ride our quads from mud lake parking area and
ride the roads to Squaw Ridge and up the Martel Flats
(17N24, 09N04, 09N82) and walk from there to little lakes.
Also ride to Pardoe Lake area and to Mud Lake.

Pasture), 17E21 (Horse Canyon), 17E19 Allen’s Camp
Motorcycle trail), 17E28 Long valley Trail (Mud lake), and
9N82 (Squaw Ridge).

210

We adamantly opposed to the closure of 9N01 and all of
9N83. 9N83 has been in place since the late 1800's and is
historic in nature. By closure of this road you are specifically
closing a Handicapped parking site that was required to be
built by FERC. By forest closures of any type you are
depriving the public in general and handicapped specifically
of use of the forest.

Keep open 09N15 Leek Springs Valley; 09N95 Cosumnes

The roads are not a hazard. Past impacts from logging and
grazing are healing.

Trails such as Barrett, Strawberry, and Deer Valley are held
dear to the OHV community. I would hope the FS could give

the user base a "heads up" so we are not surprised at the last
minute closures.
122

I think it is important to restore access to all meadow routes,
especially Jerrett Peak/McKinstry Lake area.

I want to encourage you to do everything that you can to
reopen as many miles of roads and trails as you can,
hopefully by next summer.

129, 207, 220, 227,
228, 127

Closing motorized access means only healthy people can
enjoy public land. The vast majority of Americans are not
capable of that, so if they want to get out in nature they are
dependent on motorized access.
Roads and trails as identified by Mr. Guidice 17E12, 17E16,
17E17, 17E19, 17E21, and 17E24 are important to the 4wd
community.

226

Keep the squaw ridge and horse canyon trail open. The OHV
people have a right to use this public land.

233

You closed all the best trails that I have been using for the
past 14 years. The state is taking our RV money and giving
us nothing in return. Refund our green sticker money or
open the trails.

Friends of the Rubicon is interested in including 14N39 to

proposed for closure to public vehicle use would continue to
be open for administrative purposes, which would include
SMUD vehicle use and snow cat use for operating and
maintaining the two stations. SMUD is willing to work with
the ENF to develop an acceptable solution.

our water quality and quantity, wildlife and sensitive plans.
Closing the routes will not deny public access, but only
motorized access.

Concern that ORV riders do not limit their activities to
designated routes. Designated roads become whole areas
impacted by machines that destroy habitat.
Inadequate field surveys

97, 132

Determinations by filed surveys that certain routes do not
currently meet S&G 100 seem vague and the three criteria
used insufficient, and the determination to open them seems
arbitrary and capricious.

97, 132

Scoping letter needed to state whether the TM SEIS was going
to be processed under the old planning guidelines or the new
National Forest System Land Management Planning rule.

97, 132

To insure compliance with S&G 100, an assessment of the
effect of each meadow road on groundwater movement must
be made and included in the TM SEIS or its accompanying
NEPA documents. Such assessments should be consistent
with GTR-WO-86a.

97, 132

Methodology section of Table 2 of the Hydrology and
Watershed Resources Meadow Survey Results uses the word

substantial when referring to compliance with S&G 100.
However S&G 100 has no such qualifier; under S&G 100 a
route either alters surface and subsurface water flow or it
doesn't.

97, 132

2008 RCO analysis being used was based on GIS analysis.
Site specific information related to presence/absence of
aquatic and aquatic-dependent species including yellowlegged frog was scant.

97, 132

Because S&G 100 is integrally linked to other Standards and
Guidelines in RCO #2, to insure compliance with all
Standards and Guidelines in this Objective, the TM SEIS
needs data sets from an aquatic biologist, botanist, and soil
scientist that demonstrate consistency with the Standards
and Guidelines, not just inconsistency.

97, 132

There is a lack of discussion in TM SEIS on amount of vehicle
use a road will receive when it is open to public use during
periods when the soils will be saturated, the time when
rutting or other damage to meadow roads is most likely to
occur.

97, 132

Proposed action includes no corrective actions to move the
routes found inconsistent with S&G 100 towards compliance
even though the PA would open them to public use.
Closure of all routes

In favor of keeping as many roads closed as possible.

Request for specific routes

Object to opening 17E12 Lovers Leap Trail, which crosses a
meadow and ends at a foot trail.

49

Object to opening of 11N09A past meadow complex in the
Sierra at Tahoe ski area due to illegal gunfire and access
provided by this road at intersection of Pony Express Trail. Or
consider seasonal closure after Aug 31 through hunting
season to protect recreation residents from gunfire and threat
to personal safety.

Recommend closing the Little Round Top trail as it crosses on
and near a huge seasonal wet area of meadows and springs
near the junction of the PCT.

243

Some of the routes are in close proximity to the PCT and pose
potential impact to the Trail and the experience it affords
hikers and equestrians. Impacts to the PCT should be one
criterion used in this SEIS when considering which routes to
open to motorized use. The following list of routes should be
considered: 19E01, 10N01B, 10N13, 17E16, 11N09A, and
14N39.

Unhappy with the one "car length" rule

The US District Court never considered if the LRMP blanket
meadow restriction is appropriate or not, without this
consideration the court did not condone it. The history record
93

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

reflects that the ENF has made a significant error and
omission in the LRMP by including the blanket restriction of
OHV routes in meadows. This action has denied the public
due process and has allowed the Forest Service to avoid
disclosure of a rationale, scientific basis for not allowing
routes in meadows.

Request Caples Creek, Government Meadows, trail from/to
Caples Creek /Martin Meadow CG/staging area designated

Abstract: This Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement documents the

analysis of five alternatives for designation of portions of 42 specific existing roads and
trails for public motor vehicle use on the Eldorado National Forest. Alternative 1 would
designate 42 routes for public motor vehicle use and it includes amending the Eldorado
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP), Standard and Guideline
(S&G) 100, to allow for public motor vehicle use on 18 routes affecting hydrologic
connectivity of meadows. Alternative 2 would take no action, and the portions of the 42
routes currently closed would remain closed to public motor vehicle use. Alternative 3 is
the same as Alternative 1 except it does not include a LRMP amendment and requires
implementation of mitigation measures prior to public motor vehicle use of 18 routes.
Alternative 4 would designate all or portions of 21 routes and requires mitigation
measures prior to public use of 15 of those routes. Alternative 5 is similar to Alternative 3
except that the 18 routes would be available for public motorized use before the
corrective actions are implemented, however if corrective actions are not implemented on
one of the 18 routes within five years, the route would then be closed until the corrective
actions have been implemented to bring it into compliance with S&G 100.

Summary
Proposed Action
The Eldorado National Forest (ENF) proposes the following designations for the portions
of the 42 routes that were closed by Court Order:
1. Designate for public motor vehicle use 13 routes that field surveys conducted in
2011 and 2012 determined did not cross meadows, as defined in the 1989
Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP). Route
09N54, a secondary access road to Leoni Meadows, would be designated up to
the intersection with Route 09N60.
2. Designate for public motor vehicle use 11 routes where field surveys determined
the meadow crossings meet LRMP as amended by Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
Amendment (SNFPA) S&G 100 (S&G 100).
3. Amend the LRMP to allow continued public motor vehicle use on 18 routes that
field surveys determined do not currently meet S&G 100, and are needed to meet
other purposes, and designate those routes for public motor vehicle use.
The area affected by the proposal includes 42 routes on the Eldorado National Forest in
California that were proposed for designation for public motor vehicle use in the
Eldorado National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized Travel Management Environmental
Impact Statement (TMFEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD), March 2008.
The purpose of this Supplement to the Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the
TM FEIS and ROD, March 2008, is to reconsider that portion of the ROD designating 42
specific motor vehicle routes, because the Riparian Conservation Objective (“RCO”)
Analysis for RCO #2 , S&G 100, was found by court order to be lacking for those routes
as they related to meadows ((Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District
Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12)). The court order also closed portions
of these 42 routes to public motor vehicle use pending a decision based on this TM SEIS.

A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare this TM SEIS was published in the Federal Register
on October 12, 2012, with a 45 day comment period. The notice asked that comments on
the proposed action be received by November 7, 2012In addition, as part of the public
involvement process, information on the proposed action was posted on the Eldorado
National Forest web site and mailed to 784 groups and individuals that have voiced an
interest in Travel Management on the ENF. The Forest Service held three public open
house sessions, one in Markleeville on October 22, 2012; one in Placerville on October
25, 2012, and one in Jackson on October 29, 2012, to share information about the
proposal and listen to issues and concerns brought up by the public. Approximately 247
letters, emails and comment forms were received.
The following significant Issues were raised by the public during the scoping period:
1. Road 14N39 Richardson Lake: The original proposed action included designating
only a portion of Road 14N39 up to Richardson Lake. During the Scoping period, users
expressed their concern that Richardson Lake is not the main destination for motor
vehicle users of route 14N39. Users enjoy a drive to the end of the road at the summit of
Sourdough Hill to enjoy the views and the sunset. They requested that the entire route be
designated for public motorized use.
This issue was addressed through a modification to the Proposed Action (Alternative #1).
The route is now proposed for designation all the way to the end at the top of Sourdough
Hill in Alternative #1.
2. Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment: Amending the Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) to allow continued public motor vehicle use in
sensitive meadow habitats will result in unacceptable impacts to hydrology, natural
vegetation and wildlife habitat.
Alternatives #3 and #4 were developed to address this issue. Alternatives #3 and #4
would not amend the LRMP.
3. Corrective Actions: The proposed action does not include corrective actions to fix
the routes found inconsistent with S&G100, so impacts to meadows will continue to
persist.
Alternatives #3, #4 and #5 address this issue. While Alternatives #3, #4 and #5 do not
include a description of the necessary actions required to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100, routes inconsistent with S&G 100 would not be available for
public use until work has been completed to bring them into compliance.

Five alternatives are analyzed in this SEIS:
Alternative 1
Described above as the Proposed Action.
Alternative 2: No Action
The same portions of the 42 routes that were closed under the court order would remain
closed to public motor vehicle use. There would be no amendments to the LRMP.
Alternative 3: The Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 3 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The LRMP would not be amended for the routes as proposed in Alternative 1: 09N01,
09N08, 16E26 (09N82) 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider Camp
Road), 17E73 (6.8 miles of 10N13, Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 16E27 (10N21;
Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F (; Barrett 4WD
trail), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, and 17E28. Instead, these routes would continue
to be part of the NFTS but would remain closed to public motor vehicle use until the
routes are in compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows. This alternative
identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions
necessary to bring meadow crossings into compliance with S&G 100. Corrective actions
would be proposed and analyzed as part of future National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After
corrective actions have been analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as a
designated public motor vehicle road or trail on the next revision of the Motor Vehicle
Use Map (MVUM).
The LRMP would also not be amended for routes 17E24 and 10N01B (10N01). The
portion of 17E24, Carson Emigrant Trail, from the new Mud Lake Trailhead south to the
intersection with 17E28 would be designated for public motor vehicle use. The remaining
portions of 17E24 would continue to be part of the National Forest Transportation System
(NFTS) but would remain closed to public motor vehicle use until the routes are in
compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows. The eastern portion of 10N01B
(10N01), Spur off Woods Lake Road, up to a point just east of meadow 10N01-1 would
v

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

be designated for public motor vehicle use. The west portion of 10N01B (10N01) would
continue to be part of the NFTS but would remain closed to public motor vehicle use
until the routes are in compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows. After
corrective actions have been analyzed and implemented on the remaining portions of
17E24 and 10N01B (10N01), the routes would appear as designated public motor vehicle
roads or trails on the next revision of the MVUM.
Physical closure will occur for routes that will not be repaired for some time or analysis
of corrective actions determines that repair is not practical in order to meet S&G #100.
Alternative 4
Alternative 4 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS. There would not be any amendments to the LRMP under this
alternative.
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 1 except for the following:
The following routes or portions of routes would be designated for public motor vehicle
use: 09N54 (open up to intersection with 09N60, closed to public motor vehicle use past
that point), 10N06, 10N26, 11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 13N24, 09N15, 10NY05 (open from
10NY04 to a point just before drainage near 16E27, and closed beyond that point) and
14N05 (open up to McKinstry Trailhead, closed to public motorized use beyond the
trailhead), and 14N27.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would remain closed to public motor vehicle use
until the routes are brought into compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows:
09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (open to a spot suitable for camping just north of Schneider Camp
meadow, closed to public motor vehicle use beyond that point), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27)
(open except for the section between 10NY04E and the section currently open on the
west end), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32. This alternative identifies these routes for future
corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions necessary to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100. Corrective actions would be proposed and analyzed as part of
future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available.
After corrective actions have been analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as
a designated public motor vehicle road or trail on the next revision of the MVUM.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would remain closed to public motor vehicle use
until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to S&G 100 and meadows is
implemented: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35, 10N32, and 10NY06. Reasons for mitigation of
vi

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

these routes are documented in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in
this document. Mitigation would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA
analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After the
mitigation has been analyzed and implemented, routes would appear as designated public
motor vehicle roads or trails on the next revision of the MVUM. Portions of these routes
that are currently open under the court order would remain open for public motor vehicle
use.
The following portions of routes that are not currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would be closed to public motor vehicle use and
until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to S&G 100 and meadows is
implemented: western 2.26 miles of 09N04 (17E79), and 10N03. Reasons for mitigation
of these routes are documented in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in
this document. Mitigation would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA
analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After the
mitigation has been analyzed and implemented, routes would appear as designated public
motor vehicle roads or trails on the next revision of the MVUM.
The portions of the following routes that are currently closed to public motor vehicle use
under court order would continue to be a part of the NFTS but would remain closed to
public motor vehicle use: 09N54 past intersection with 09N60, 10NY04, 17E12, 14N58,
17E17, 17E21, the southern portion of 16E26 (09N82)), 19E01 (09N83) (09N95,
10N01B (10N01), 17E73 (10N13 closed beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion
between 10NY04E and the section currently open on the west end), 10N98, 16E33
(11N23F), a portion of 12NY06, 14N05 past McKinstry Trailhead, 14N39, 17E16,
17E19, 17E24 (west and east portions), and 17E28. In addition, in a change from the
draft TM SEIS, corrective actions to bring each route into compliance with S&G 100
would still be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to
implement corrective actions becomes available. These routes would remain available for
administrative use, emergency access, and non-motorized recreation, but would not be
designated for public motor vehicle use. A portion of 12NY06 that is not currently closed
to public motor vehicle use by court order would be closed in this alternative. In addition,
based on public comment, a provision is added to Alternative 4 that physical closure will
be considered for routes that will not be repaired for some time or analysis of corrective
actions determines that repair is not practical.

vii

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS.
Alternative 5 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The 18 routes requiring corrective actions to be in compliance with S&G 100 would
remain open to public motor vehicle use until the corrective actions were analyzed and
implemented to bring them into compliance with S&G 100, however if the corrective
actions are not implemented on a specific route within five years, that route would then
be closed to public motor vehicle use until the corrective actions have been implemented
to bring it into compliance with S&G 100.
Physical closure will occur for routes that will not be repaired for some time or analysis
of corrective actions determines that repair is not practical in order to meet S&G 100.
Summary of Effects to Hydrology
There are 24 routes where there is no difference between the alternatives with regard to
S&G 100. This is because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross
or border meadows that meet S&G 100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G 100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G 100. Alternative 2 (no action) would result in zero of
those 18 routes meeting S&G 100. Alternatives 3 and 4 would result in 18 of those
routes meeting S&G 100. Under Alternative 5, the number of routes that meet S&G 100
after five years could range between zero and 18. The results with regard to S&G 100 are
summarized in Table 3.8 and Figure 3.9. In addition, adverse impacts to 38 meadows
(from the 18 routes) would be less from Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 than Alternatives 1 and
2.
Alternatives 1 and 2 would not meet the criteria of 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b with
respect to minimizing damage to meadows from trails. Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 would
meet 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from
trails. Alternatives 3 and 4 would meet 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b to a greater degree
than Alternative 5 with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from trails.

Summary of Effects to Public Motor Vehicle Use
The analysis of Public Motor Vehicle Use shows that the alternatives differ substantially
as to effects to recreation users. Alternatives 1 and 5 result in the highest number of miles
of roads and trails rated high in recreation value open to public motorized use initially
(95.8 miles). Alternative 3 results in the same number of miles of high value recreation
routes designated for public motorized use, however only 55.2 of those miles would be
open initially, with an additional 40.6 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS but not
designated for public motorized use and identified on a MVUM until corrective actions
are analyzed and implemented. Alternative 4 would result in 3.7 miles of high recreation
value routes open to public motorized use, with an additional 13.4 miles continuing to be
part of the NFTS but not designated for public motorized use and identified on a MVUM
until corrective actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented, and 46.7 miles of
high value recreation routes closed to public motor vehicle use. In Alternative 2, No
Action, only the 30 miles of high value recreation routes that were not closed by court
order would remain open, with 65.9 miles of high value recreation routes closed to public
motorized use.
Summary of Effects to Newly Proposed Threatened and Endangered Species
In Alternative 1, Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs could be directly and indirectly
affected by motor vehicle use on routes 17E24 (east) and 17E28, where they are known
to occur. Ten routes would be designated open for public motor vehicle use which could
affect proposed critical habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog; 10N01B,
10N13, 16E21, 16E26, 16E27, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28, 17E73, and 19E01. Yosemite toads
occur in habitat crossed by routes 09N01 and 19E01, both of which would be designated
open for public motor vehicle use. These routes traverse habitat where there is potential
for direct impacts to Yosemite toads and for routes to increase sediment delivery or
impact meadow hydrology in occupied habitats that have also been recently proposed as
critical habitat for the Yosemite toad.
In Alternative 2, under the no action alternative, no direct or indirect effects to Sierra
Nevada yellow-legged frogs or Yosemite toads or their proposed critical habitat would
result, although the presence of some roads or trails, even without public motor vehicle
use on these routes, may continue to impact their habitat until corrective actions are
implemented.
In Alternative 3, known occurrences of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite
toads would not be directly or indirectly affected by routes that would be immediately
opened for public motor vehicle use. Six routes have the potential to influence streams or
water bodies that may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog and two
ix

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

routes have the potential to influence habitat for the Yosemite toad, but surveys indicated
these species were absent at these sites. Routes that would be opened for public motor
vehicle use in Alternative 3 meet Standard and Guideline 100 and would not affect the
quality of SNYLF habitat within areas proposed as critical habitat. None of the routes
that would be immediately opened in Alternative 3 are within areas proposed as critical
habitat for Yosemite toad. Additional routes (or portions of routes) that occur within
Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog or Yosemite toad habitat would remain closed for
public motor vehicle use until after corrective actions have been implemented.
Biological assessment and conferencing or consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service would occur during future analysis if it is determined that corrective actions or
public motor vehicle use on these routes may affect the Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog
or the Yosemite toad or their critical habitats.
In Alternative 4, known occurrences of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite
toads would not be directly or indirectly affected by routes that would be immediately
opened for public motor vehicle use. Two routes have the potential to influence streams
or water bodies that may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog but
surveys indicated the species was absent at these sites. 14N05 is the only route
occurring in SNYLF critical habitat, and field review determined this route would not
affect habitat elements. None of the routes occur with the range of the Yosemite toad or
its critical habitat. As described for Alternative 3, biological assessment and conferencing
or consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would occur during future
analysis of additional routes, if it is determined that corrective actions or public motor
vehicle use on these routes may affect the Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog or the
Yosemite toad or their critical habitats.
Alternative 5 would initially have the same effects upon SNYLF and Yosemite toads and
their critical habitat as Alternative 1 until corrective actions are taken over a five year
period.

Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action
Introduction ____________________________________________
The purpose of this supplement to the TM FEIS & ROD, March 2008, is to reconsider
that portion of the ROD designating 42 specified motor vehicle routes, because the
Riparian Conservation Objective (‘RCO”) Analysis for RCO #2, Standard and Guideline
100 (S&G100), was found by court order to be lacking for those routes as it pertains to
meadows (Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District Court, Eastern
District of California, filed 7/31/12)). All other portions of the Forest Service’s original
decision, including the parts of the 42 routes that do not intersect meadows, remain in
effect.
This SEIS addresses only the additional information and analysis relevant to the 42
specific routes, meadows, and S&G100 in the Eldorado National Forest. For a complete
discussion of other resources and effects, including cumulative effects and monitoring
requirements, the readers should review the TMFEIS & ROD, March 2008, available on
the Eldorado National Forest website http://www.fs.usda.gov/eldorado/ or by request
from 100 Forni Road, Placerville, CA 95667.

Document Structure _____________________________________
The Forest Service has prepared this SEIS in compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant Federal and State laws and

Background ____________________________________________
In March, 2008, the US Forest Service completed the TM FEIS & ROD. A
comprehensive background Summary of Eldorado National Forest Travel Management
Direction may be found on page 1-2 of that document.
Relevant Information from the TMFEIS includes the following:
•

•

•

•

•

The 2008 TMFEIS and ROD designated roads and trails to be open for public motor
vehicle use and to prohibit cross country travel. The decision designated the class of
vehicle allowed and season of use for each route.
Each of the action alternatives except Alternative E included non-significant Forest
Plan amendments for various combinations of routes crossing meadows – they are
listed in Chapter 2 of the TMFEIS in the description of each alternative.
The selected alternative, Alternative Modified B, included a non-significant LRMP
amendment that addressed 20 routes through meadows. Only 19 of those routes were
designated for public wheeled motorized travel under the Travel Management
Decision. An additional 23 routes with segments less than .05 miles through any
meadows were designated for motor vehicle use without a Forest Plan amendment.
There were numerous other routes that bordered or crossed meadows that were not
designated for public motor vehicle use.
The January, 2004 SNFPA amended the LRMP, established Riparian Conservation
Objectives (RCOs), standards and guidelines (particularly S&G 100), and direction to
complete a RCO Analysis for all new activities that might affect Riparian
Conservation Areas (RCAs). In compliance with the ROD for the SNFPA, the Forest
completed the “Reconciliation: Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment 2004 ROD &
Eldorado Forest Plan” to clearly state that the Standards and Guidelines for
Management Area 28 (Meadows) from the 1989 LRMP were replaced by the SNFPA
meadow allocation and Standards and Guidelines. The RCO Analysis for the TMFEIS
included the criterion that routes that bisect or go through meadows have the potential
of not meeting RCO #2. The identification of individual routes was completed using
the Forest’s Geographic Information System (GIS) database.
In Table 7 of the RCO analysis (a part of the project record for the EIS), there is a
listing of 42 routes through meadows, which includes the 19 routes designated in
Modified Alternative B, plus another 23.

The TMFEIS included a monitoring strategy for meadows: “Within two years of
implementation, commence field monitoring of meadows greater than one acre in size
that have a road or trail within the meadow or that bisects the meadow. Public
wheeled motor vehicle use through meadows can impair hydrologic function. If
adverse impacts to hydrologic function are detected, appropriate measures (including
closure) will be employed to restore proper functioning condition.”

Following the TMFEIS:
•

•

•
•
•

•

The Eldorado National Forest issued a Motor Vehicle Use Map in April, 2009,
showing the designated routes as established through the TMFEIS ROD. The map
was updated in 2010 and again in 2012. The 2012 MVUM included the changes in
routes as identified in the 7/31/12 decision of the Eastern District Federal Court,
Judge Karlton.
In keeping with the final decision in the TMFEIS ROD, a number of routes or
portions of routes that were previously classified as National Forest System roads but
will be managed as trails were changed on the Forest Transportation System to 4WD
Trails. These routes received a new trail number. The routes are tracked in this Final
SEIS by the new trail number (contains an E in the number) followed by the previous
road number (contains an N in the number) in parenthesis. On the GIS map set
accompanying this document, the routes are also labeled with the new trail number,
followed by the associated old road number in parentheses.
Following the signing of the TMFEIS ROD there were 26 administrative appeals.
These appeals were resolved and the decision upheld by the Regional Forester.
In 2009 a complaint was filed with the Eastern District Federal Court alleging a
number of deficiencies in the EIS.
In 2010, the Eldorado National Forest contracted some monitoring for meadows
associated with designated routes. The results of the monitoring indicated that some
meadows mapped in GIS were not actually meadows. It also indicated that some
meadows were in poor condition, although it did not specifically conclude that
designated routes were the cause of the meadows being in poor condition.
On May 26, 2011, Judge Karlton issued an opinion (Court Case No. 2:09-CV-02523LKK-JFM) that raised an issue as to whether the Forest Service had adequately
explained why ephemeral streams could not function as suitable, non-breeding
California red-legged frog habitat. On September 1, 2011, the Forest Service received
US Fish and Wildlife Service concurrence that the Forest Service’s designation of
routes in Alternative Modified B in the Travel Management Decision was not likely
to adversely affect the California red-legged frog. Accordingly, the Forest Service
prepared a new Biological Assessment and plaintiffs agreed the issue has been
resolved. Therefore the issue will not be addressed in this SEIS.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

In its opinion dated May 26, 2011, the Court also found the Forest Service failed to
comply with the National Forest Management Act (“NFMA”) in connection with its
analysis and designation of routes encountering meadows. Specifically, the court
found that the Forest Service had designated 42 routes through meadows which were
inconsistent with certain standards and guidelines in both the Forest’s 1989 Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and standards and guidelines within the 2004
Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA), which amended the ENF LRMP.
The Court pointed out that the error in the agency’s Travel Management Decision was
limited to 42 routes designated for public wheeled motor vehicle travel that have
some segment(s) that go through meadows.
As planned in the TMFEIS Monitoring Strategy, field surveys were conducted in
2011 and 2012 at the 95 meadows crossed or bordered by the 42 routes in order to
determine compliance with S&G 100 of the 2004 SNFPA ROD as it pertains to
meadows. S&G100 states: “Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of
streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by identifying roads
and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow
paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore connectivity.” The
field surveys were completed by a Hydrologist and a Hydrologic Technician. The
results of the surveys are summarized in the Hydrology section in Chapter 3 of this
SEIS.
On February 14, 2012, the Eastern District Court judge remanded the portion of the
decision that designated 42 roads through meadows for motor vehicle traffic for
reconsideration. The Forest Service was directed to submit a proposed order within
30 days that sets aside that portion of its decision that designated the 42 roads to the
degree they go through meadows, and not affecting the sections of those same roads
that do not go through meadows, unless they cannot otherwise be reached. Seasonal
closures currently in place were to be extended until further order of the court.

• A final order on Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM was issued by the Eastern
District Court judge on July 31, 2012. That order “sets aside and remands for
reconsideration in light of the applicable law that portion of the Forest Service’s Final
Environmental Impact Statement relating to the Riparian Conservation Objective
(RCO) Analysis for RCO #2 S&G 100 pertaining to the meadows on the 42 routes…
Until such time as the Forest Service completes supplemental environmental analysis
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as provided above, public
wheeled motorized vehicle use of a route listed … that intersects a meadow shall be
prohibited or limited ... All other portions of the Forest Service’s decision, including
the parts of the 42 routes that do not intersect meadows, remain in effect.” The order
also directed the Forest Service to revise the MVUM to incorporate changes called
for in the order. The revised MVUM was prepared and made available to the public in
September, 2012. The Forest is continuing to manage the designated route system at
the present time under the 2012 MVUM.

Purpose and Need for Action ______________________________
The underlying needs for this proposal include:
1. There is a need to comply with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of California Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM, Court Order filed
07/31/12 in which the Court “set aside and remanded for reconsideration in light
of the applicable law that portion of the Forest Service’s Final Environmental
Impact Statement relating to the RCO Analysis for RCO #2 S&G 100 pertaining
to the meadows on the 42 routes.”
2. There is a need to determine whether public wheeled motor vehicle use will be
allowed on the 42 specific routes, or some portion of these routes, designated for
such use in the 2008 TM FEIS ROD that were found by the court to be
inconsistent with the LRMP Standards and Guidelines, as amended by SNFPA.
The action must also achieve the following purposes from the National Travel
Management Rule of 2005:
•
•
•

Providing wheeled motor vehicle access to existing developed and dispersed
recreation opportunities on the Forest,
Providing a diversity of wheeled motor vehicle recreation opportunities, and
Protecting natural resources

As outlined in the TMEIS, Purpose and Need for Action, page 1-5 through 1-6.

Proposed Action ________________________________________
The Proposed Action is similar to the proposed action that was circulated for public
scoping with a few minor corrections and a change in the proposal for route 14N39,
Richardson Lake. The proposed action circulated in October 2012 proposed this route for
designation for public motor vehicle use up to Richardson Lake, with the portion from
Richardson Lake to the top of Sourdough Hill closed to public motor vehicle use.
Comments were received during the scoping period that stated the main destination of
that route was not Richardson Lake but the view from the top of Sourdough Hill. The
proposed action was modified to include designation of the segment of road 14N39 from
Richardson Lake to the summit of Sourdough Hill.
The Forest Service conducted field surveys of the 42 routes in 2011 and 2012 to
determine compliance with S&G 100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment
Record of Decision (SNFPA ROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows.
The field surveys found that 14 of the routes do not cross or border meadows: For these
routes the Forest proposes to:
1. Designate 08N23B, 08N35, 10N06, 10N26, 10N32, 10NY04, 11N09A,
11N22, 11N70, 12NY15, and 13N24 as “NFTS Road: Open to All Highway
and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.” Designate the western 2.2 miles of 09N04
(17E79) as “NFTS 4WD Trail: Open to High Clearance Vehicles.” Designate
Road 09N54 (a secondary access road to Leoni Meadows) up to its
intersection with 09N60 as “NFTS Road: Open to All Highway and NonHighway Legal Vehicles.” Designate 17E12 as “NFTS Trail: Open to
Motorcycles only.”
Field surveys revealed that the following 10 routes cross or border meadows, but
crossings meet S&G 100: For these routes the Forest proposes to:
2. Designate 09N15, 10NY05, 10NY06, 12NY06, 14N05, 14N27 and 14N58 as
“NFTS Road: Open to All Highway and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.”
Designate 10N03 as “NFTS Road: Open to Highway Legal Vehicles only.”
Designate 17E17 and 17E21 as “NFTS Trail: Open to Motorcycles only.”
For the remaining 18 routes (10N13 is described in two segments), field surveys
determined they do not currently meet S&G 100. The proposed action would designate
them by amending the Eldorado National Forest Plan to exclude those routes from the
SNFPA S&G No. 100 requirement.

6

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

3. SNFPA S&G No. 100 would not apply to meadows crossed by the following
routes. Roads 09N01, 09N08, 09N95, 10N01 (B), 0.5 miles of 10N13, 10N14,
10N98, and 14N39 would be designated as “NFTS Road: Open to All
Highway and Non-Highway Legal Vehicles.” Road 11NY32 would be
designated as as “NFTS Road: Open to Highway Legal Vehicles only.” Routes
09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 6.8 miles of 10N13 (17E73), 10N21
(16E27), 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21), and 17E24 would be designated
as as “NFTS 4WD Trail: Open to High Clearance Vehicles.” Routes 17E16,
17E19 and 17E28 would be designated as as “NFTS Trail: Open to
Motorcycles only.”
The proposed action is described in more detail in Chapter 2 under Alternative 1.

Decision Framework _____________________________________
Given the purpose and need, the Forest Supervisor will need to determine whether public
wheeled motor vehicle use will be allowed on any or all of the 42 routes found by the
court to be inconsistent with the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan, 1989 (LRMP) Standards and Guidelines, as amended by SNFPA, and
whether or not to amend the Eldorado National Forest Plan in conjunction with any such
route designations.

Forest Plan Direction _____________________________________
The proposed action and alternatives are guided by the Eldorado National Forest Land
and Resource Management Plan (LRMP), as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan
Amendment Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement Record of Decision,
January, 2004 (SNFPA). The Forest is subdivided into land allocations (Management
Areas) with established desired conditions and associated management direction
(standards and guidelines). The land allocation that applies to this proposal is
Management Area 28 – Meadow Management (LRMP, pp. 4-277 through 4-282). The
definition of a meadow from the 1989 Land Resource Management Plan (page 4-90) was
used: “A meadow is defined as a grassy opening, 0.1 acres or larger, dominated by
perennial sedges, rushes, and grasses (wet meadow) or perennial grasses and forbs (dry
meadow).” The Standards and Guidelines that apply to management of meadows were
amended by the SNFPA. The SNFPA provided new standards and guidelines that
replaced the standards and guidelines of the original 1989 LRMP for meadows.
S&G 100 on page 63 of the 2004 SNFPA ROD applies directly to the purpose and need
of this SEIS. S&G 100 states: “Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of
7

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by identifying roads and
trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths.
Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore connectivity.”

Public Involvement ______________________________________
A Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare the Eldorado National Forest Travel Management
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) was published in the Federal
Register on October 12, 2012. The notice asked that comments on the proposed action be
received by November 7, 2012. In addition, as part of the public involvement process,
information on the proposed action was posted on the Eldorado National Forest web site
and emailed to 784 groups and individuals that have voiced an interest in travel
management on the Eldorado National Forest. The Forest Service held three public Open
House sessions, one in Markleeville on October 22, 2012; one in Placerville on October
25, 2012, and one in Jackson on October 29, 2012, to share information about the
proposal and listen to issues and concerns brought up by the public. Approximately 247
letters, emails and comment forms from the public scoping and public Open House
sessions were received providing public comments on the proposed action.
The Draft Travel Management Supplemental Impact Statement was released February 20,
2013. The draft SEIS, consisting of two volumes, was posted on the Eldorado National
Forest web site, with notification mailed and emailed to groups and individuals that have
voiced an interest in reviewing it. Three public Open House sessions were held, one on
February 26, 2013 in Placerville, one on March 5, 2013 in Markleeville, and one on
March 6, 2013 in Jackson, to share information about the draft SEIS and the Forest
Service preferred alternative. Approximately 232 letters, emails and comment forms were
received during the 45 day comment period on the draft SEIS. A summary of those
submitting comments is included in Appendix C of this FSEIS, and a document
containing Forest Service response to comments on the draft SEIS is included in
Appendix D of this FSEIS.

Issues _________________________________________________
Comments from the public, other agencies, and tribes were used to formulate issues
concerning the proposed action. The Forest Service separated the issues into two groups:
significant and non-significant. Significant issues were defined as those directly or
indirectly caused by implementing the proposed action. Non-significant issues were
identified as those: 1) outside the scope of the proposed action; 2) already decided by
law, regulation, Forest Plan, or other higher level decision; 3) irrelevant to the decision to
be made; or 4) conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The
8

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations explain this delineation in
Sec. 1501.7, “…identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not
significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3)…”.
A Summary of Public Comments received during the scoping period and the issues that
were identified may be found in the DSEIS and in the project record located at the
Eldorado National Forest Supervisor’s Office, Placerville, California.
Comments were received during scoping questioning the field methodology used to
determine effects to meadows:
1. Field Survey Methodology: In particular, they indicated they felt the
methodology for assessing compliance with S&G 100 was not adequate for that
purpose and did not follow General Technical Report WO-86a.
This issue was determined to be conjectural and, therefore not carried forward in this
SEIS. The methodology in General Technical Report WO-86a, which provides a detailed
characterization of groundwater dependent features, does not specifically evaluate
compliance with S&G 100. As a result, a methodology was developed for this purpose as
described in Table 3.6 of this SEIS. In addition, General Technical Report WO-86a is
only intended for a few types of features that are supported by groundwater (springs,
peatlands, and other wetlands) and not intended for meadows and wetlands that are not
supported by groundwater (i.e. supported by surface runoff and precipitation). The
methodology developed for evaluating compliance with S&G 100 does apply to meadows
and wetlands that are not supported by groundwater, and these types of features were
within the scope of features that might be encountered during the field surveys
The Forest Service identified the following significant issues from the public comments
during scoping:
1. Route 14N39 - Richardson Lake: Richardson Lake is not the main destination for
route 14N39. Users enjoy a drive to the summit of Sourdough Hill to enjoy the views and
the sunset. The entire route should be designated for public motor vehicle use.
This issue was addressed through a modification to the Proposed Action (Alternative #1).
The route is now proposed for designation all the way to the top of Sourdough Hill in
Alternative #1.
2. Land and Resource Management Plan Amendment: Amending the Land and
Resource Management Plan (LRMP) to allow continued public motor vehicle use in
sensitive meadow habitats will result in unacceptable impacts to hydrology, natural
vegetation and wildlife habitat.
Alternatives #3 and #4 were developed to address this issue. Alternatives #3 and #4
would not amend the LRMP.
9

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

3. Corrective Actions: The proposed action does not include corrective actions to fix
the routes found inconsistent with S&G 100 so impacts to meadows will continue to
persist.
Alternatives #3 and #4 both address this issue. While Alternatives #3 and #4 do not
include a description of the necessary actions required to bring each route into
compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows, routes inconsistent with S&G 100
would not be available for public use until work has been completed to bring them into
compliance.

Chapter 2. Alternatives, Including the Proposed
Action
Introduction____________________________________________
This chapter describes and compares the alternatives considered for the Eldorado
National Forest Travel Management Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. It
describes both alternatives considered in detail and those eliminated from detailed study.
The end of this chapter presents the alternatives in tabular format so that the alternatives
can be readily compared. One of the alternatives, Alternative 1, includes an amendment
to the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP).

Changes between DSEIS and FSEIS _______________________
On April 25, 2013 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a proposed rule to list the
Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog as an endangered species and the Yosemite toad as a
threatened species, and issued a proposed rule to designate critical habitat for each
species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Final rules will be issued
approximately a year from the date of the proposed rules, and changes may occur to the
proposed critical habitat boundaries or other elements of the rules. A number of the routes
being evaluated in this FSEIS occur within the range of these species and within areas
proposed as critical habitat. Therefore information about the presence of Sierra Nevada
yellow-legged frogs, Yosemite toads, or their proposed critical habitat has been added to
this FSEIS.
Alternative 3 has been modified slightly from the Draft TM SEIS based on public
comments received on the Draft SEIS requesting a review of 10N01 and other routes to
see if there were some portions of the routes that could be reopened that were not
affecting meadows. Forest staff reviewed all of the routes affecting meadows and
recommended that a portion of 17E24 and a portion of 10N01B (10N01) could be opened
for public motor vehicle use without affecting the meadows.
A provision is added to Alternative 3 that physical closure will occur for routes that will
not be repaired for some time or analysis of corrective actions determines that repair is
not practical in order to meet S&G 100.
Alternative 4 has also been modified based on public comment. In the modified version
in this FSEIS, routes that are closed to public motor vehicle use will also receive
corrective actions where needed to bring the routes into compliance with S&G 100.
A new Alternative was also developed in response to public comment received on the
Draft TM SEIS. A complete description may be found under Alternative 5 in this chapter.

Development of the Proposed Action ______________________
In order to address the purpose and need, the 42 routes were surveyed in 2011 and 2012
in order to: 1.) reassess the location of the meadows on National Forest land that border
or cross the 42 routes, and 2.) determine whether those routes were in compliance with
S&G 100 of the LRMP as amended by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment
Record of Decision (SNFPAROD 2004) as it pertains to meadows. S&G 100 states:
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and
other special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or
disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions
where necessary to restore connectivity.”

Alternatives Considered in Detail __________________________
Based on the issues identified through public comment on the proposed action, the Forest
Service developed three alternative proposals that achieve the purpose and need specified
in the July 31, 2012 Court Order, including the Proposed Action. In addition, the Forest

12

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Service is required to analyze a No Action alternative. The alternatives are described in
detail below.
Alternative 1 - Proposed Action
Minor changes have been made to Alternative 1 since the circulation of the Proposed
Action during scoping in October, 2012. Route 09N54, a secondary access road to Leoni
Meadows, was moved to the category of “No Meadows on National Forest Land” since
the meadow is located on private property. Routes 14N05 and 14N58 were moved into
the category of Meadows meeting S&G 100, and routes 08N35, 09N04 (17E79), 10N32
and 11N09A were moved to the category of “No Meadows on National Forest Land”
based on review of information collected and additional field surveys.
In response to public scoping, there was also a change in the proposal for route 14N39,
Richardson Lake. The proposed action circulated in October 2012 proposed this route for
designation for public motor vehicle use up to Richardson Lake, with the portion from
Richardson Lake to the top of Sourdough Hill closed to public motor vehicle use.
Comments were received during the scoping period that stated the main destination of
that route was not Richardson Lake but the view from the top of Sourdough Hill,
requesting designation of the entire route. In the proposed action carried forward into this
SEIS, the entire route would be designated for public motor vehicle use.
A Forest Plan Amendment is included in Alternative 1, the Proposed Action, to provide
an exception to S&G100 of the LRMP Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA)
to allow for public motorized use on sections affecting the hydrologic connectivity of
meadows until corrective actions are analyzed and implemented at some time in the
future.
The Eldorado National Forest proposes to designate the following routes for public motor
vehicle use:

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
The following routes or route segments would require a Forest Plan amendment to be
designated open for public wheeled motor vehicle use: 09N01, 09N08, 16E26 (09N82),
19E01 (09N83) 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider Camp Road), 17E73 (6.8
miles of 10N13, Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 16E27 10N21 ( Long Canyon 4WD
trail), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F) 16E21 (11N26F, Barrett 4WD trail), 11NY32, 14N39,
17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28. These routes are proposed for a Forest Plan
amendment because they provide important, high-value recreation opportunities (such as
high elevation motorized trail experiences, connecting routes or areas, access to areas of
interest, and access for dispersed camping. They would be designated for public motor
vehicle use with an exception to S&G 100 of the LRMP SNFPA to allow for public motor
vehicle use on sections affecting the hydrologic connectivity of meadows until such time
as corrective actions are analyzed and implemented
Alternative 2 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, current management would continue. The same portions
of the 42 routes that were closed under the court order would remain closed to public
motor vehicle use. No designation of route segments currently closed would be

17

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

implemented. There would be no amendments to the LRMP. There would be no
requirement for corrective actions to bring routes into compliance with S&G100.
Administrative motor vehicle use would continue on routes regardless of whether they
are open for public motor vehicle use.
Alternative 3 – Preferred Alternative
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS that were against amending the LRMP to allow continued public
motor vehicle use in sensitive meadow habitats. There would not be any amendments to
the LRMP under this alternative.
Alternative 3 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The LRMP would not be amended for the routes as proposed in Alternative 1: 09N01,
09N08, 16E26 (09N82) 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider Camp
Road), 17E73 (6.8 miles of 10N13, Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 16E27 (10N21;
Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F (; Barrett 4WD
trail), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, and 17E28. Instead, these routes would continue
to be part of the NFTS but would remain closed to public motor vehicle use until the
routes are in compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows. This alternative
identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze the actions
necessary to bring each into compliance with S&G 100. Corrective actions would be
proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement
corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions have been analyzed and
implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motor vehicle road or trail on
the next revision of the MVUM.
The LRMP would also not be amended for routes 17E24 and 10N01B (10N01). The
portion of 17E24, Carson Emigrant Trail, from the new Mud Lake Trailhead south to the
intersection with 17E28 would be designated for public motor vehicle use. The remaining
portions of 17E24 would continue to be part of the NFTS but would remain closed to
public motor vehicle use until the routes are in compliance with S&G 100 as it pertains to
meadows. The eastern portion of 10N01B (10N01), Spur off Woods Lake Road, up to a
point just east of meadow 10N01-1 would be designated for public motor vehicle use.
The west portion of 10N01B (10N01) would continue to be part of the NFTS but would
remain closed to public motor vehicle use until the routes are in compliance with S&G
100 as it pertains to meadows. After corrective actions have been analyzed and
implemented on the remaining portions of 17E24 and 10N01B (10N01), the routes would
appear as designated public motor vehicle roads or trails on the next revision of the
MVUM.

Physical closure will be considered for routes that will not be repaired for some time or
analysis of corrective actions determines that repair is not practical in order to meet S&G
100.
Administrative motor vehicle use would continue on routes regardless of they are open
for public motor vehicle use.

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
There are no routes requiring LRMP amendments under this alternative.
Alternative 4
Alternative 3 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS that were against amending the LRMP to allow continued public
motor vehicle use in sensitive meadow habitats, and, in addition, requested closure for
some routes and mitigation for other resource concerns. There would not be any
amendments to the LRMP under this alternative.
Alternative 4 is similar to Alternative 1 except for the following:
The following routes or portions of routes would be designated for public motor vehicle
use: 09N54 (open up to intersection with 09N60, closed to public motor vehicle use past
that point), 10N06, 10N26, 11N09A, 11N22, 11N70, 13N24, 09N15, 10NY05 (open from
10NY04 to a point just before drainage near 16E27, and closed beyond that point) and
14N05 (open up to McKinstry Trailhead, closed to public motorized use beyond the
trailhead), and 14N27.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
remain closed to public motor vehicle use until the routes are brought into compliance
with S&G 100 as it pertains to meadows: 09N01, 09N08, 10N13 (open to a spot suitable
for camping just north of Schneider Camp meadow, closed to public motor vehicle use
beyond that point), 10N14, 10N21 (16E27) (open except for the section between
10NY04E and the section currently open on the west end), 11N26F (16E21), 11NY32.
This alternative identifies these routes for future corrective actions, but does not analyze
the actions necessary to bring each route into compliance with S&G 100. Corrective
actions would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to
implement corrective actions becomes available. After corrective actions have been
analyzed and implemented, the route would appear as a designated public motor vehicle
road or trail on the next revision of the MVUM.
The following routes or portions of routes that are currently closed by court order would
remain closed to public motor vehicle use until mitigation for resource concerns not
directly related to S&G 100 and meadows is implemented: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35,
19

10N32, and 10NY06. Reasons for mitigation of these routes are documented in the
project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in this document. Mitigation would be
proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement
corrective actions becomes available. After the mitigation has been analyzed and
implemented, routes would appear as designated public motor vehicle roads or trails on
the next revision of the MVUM. Portions of these routes that are currently open under the
court order would remain open for public motor vehicle use.
The following portions of routes that are not currently closed by court order would
continue to be a part of the NFTS but would be closed to public motor vehicle use and
until mitigation for resource concerns not directly related to S&G 100 and meadows is
implemented: western 2.26 miles of 09N04 (17E79), and 10N03. Reasons for mitigation
of these routes are documented in the project record, but the mitigation is not analyzed in
this document. Mitigation would be proposed and analyzed as part of future NEPA
analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. After the
mitigation has been analyzed and implemented, routes would appear as designated public
motor vehicle roads or trails on the next revision of the MVUM.
The portions of the following routes that are currently closed to public motor vehicle use
under court order would remain closed to public motor vehicle use: 09N54 past
intersection with 09N60, 10NY04, 17E12, 14N58, 17E17, 17E21, the southern portion of
16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 10N01B (10N01), 17E73, 10N13 (closed
beyond Schneider Camp), 10N21 (portion between 10NY04E and the section currently
open on the west end), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), a portion of 12NY06, 14N05 past
McKinstry Trailhead, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24 (west and east portions), and 17E28.
In addition, in a change from the draft TM SEIS, corrective actions to bring each route
into compliance with S&G 100 would still be proposed and analyzed as part of future
NEPA analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions becomes available. These
routes would remain available for administrative use, emergency access, and nonmotorized recreation, but would not be designated for public motor vehicle use. A portion
of 12NY06 that is not currently closed to public motor vehicle use by court order would
be closed in this alternative. In addition, physical closure will be considered for routes
that will not be repaired for some time or analysis of corrective actions determines that
repair is not practical.
Administrative motor vehicle use would continue on routes regardless of whether they
are open for public motor vehicle use

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
There are no routes requiring LRMP amendments under this alternative.

Alternative 5
Alternative 5 was developed in response to public comments received during the scoping
period for this SEIS.
Alternative 5 is similar to Alternative 1 with the following exceptions:
The 18 routes requiring corrective actions to be in compliance with S&G 100 would
remain open to public motor vehicle use until the corrective actions were analyzed and
implemented to bring them into compliance with S&G 100, however if the corrective
actions are not implemented on a specific route within five years, that route would then
be closed to public motor vehicle use until the corrective actions have been implemented
to bring it into compliance with S&G 100.
Administrative motor vehicle use would continue on routes regardless if they are open for
public motor vehicle use.
Physical closure will be considered for routes in the event that the analysis of corrective
actions determines that repair is not practical in order to meet S&G 100.

Routes with Specific Forest Plan Amendments
The following routes or route segments would require a Forest Plan amendment to be
designated open for public wheeled motor vehicle use: 09N01, 09N08, 16E26 (09N82),
19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider Camp Road), 17E73 (6.8
miles of 10N13; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14, 16E27 10N21 ( Long Canyon 4WD
trail), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F, Barrett 4WD trail), 11NY32, 14N39,
17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28. These routes are proposed for a Forest Plan
amendment because they provide important, high-value recreation opportunities (such as
high elevation motorized trail experiences, connecting routes or areas, access to areas of
interest, and access for dispersed camping. They would be designated for public motor
vehicle use with an exception to S&G 100 of the LRMP SNFPA to allow for public motor
vehicle use on sections affecting the hydrologic connectivity of meadows until such time
as corrective actions are analyzed and implemented.

Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study ___
Federal agencies are required to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all
reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives
that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in
response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for
achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the
scope of the need for the proposal, duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail, or
determined to be components that would cause unnecessary environmental harm.
Therefore, three alternatives were considered, but dismissed from detailed consideration
for reasons summarized below:
1. An alternative which included closure and rehabilitation of some routes was
considered but not carried forward. The purpose and need of this analysis was to
reconsider whether to allow public motor vehicle use on 42 specific routes. An
alternative addressing closure and rehabilitation of those routes that are not
designated for public motor vehicle use is beyond the scope of this analysis since
a decision is not being made regarding other uses of the routes including
administrative use or permitted use such as access to private property.
2. An alternative was considered that would analyze in detail the corrective actions
needed for each route that did not meet S&G 100. This alternative was not carried
forward because substantially more time and resources would be required to
analyze in detail the appropriate corrective actions that could be taken for each
route, including additional field analysis for potential reroutes and associated
ground disturbance. Such corrective actions will be analyzed on a route by route
basis as required by the alternative that is selected in the Record of Decision. This
will allow the 24 routes that do not affect meadows to be reopened immediately.
3. An alternative similar to Alternative 5 was considered, but with one addition: a
wet route closure plan would be developed and implemented for the 18 routes that
do not meet S&G 100. This alternative was not analyzed in detail because a
number of the most popular routes (14N39, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28, 17E73, and
16E27) would not dry out during most years and therefore would not be open to
public motor vehicle use, effectively making the alternative similar to Alternative
3. This conclusion is based on the field surveys of 2011 and 2012.

Comparison of Alternatives: Effects by Resource Area

Hydrology
The Hydrology Analysis indicates
There are 24 routes where there is no difference between the alternatives with regard to
S&G 100. This is because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross
or border meadows that meet S&G 100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G 100.
Alternative 1 would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would exempt those 18 routes
from S&G #100. Alternative 2 would result in zero of those 18 routes meeting S&G 100.
Alternatives 3 and 4 would result in 18 of those routes meeting S&G 100. Under
Alternative 5, the number of routes that meet S&G 100 after five years could range
between zero and 18. The results with regard to S&G 100 are summarized in Table 3.8
and Figure 3.9. In addition, adverse impacts to 38 meadows (from the 18 routes) would
be less from Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 than Alternatives 1 and 2.
Alternatives 1 and 2 would not meet the criteria of 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b with
respect to minimizing damage to meadows from trails. Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 would
meet 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from
trails. Alternatives 3 and 4 would meet 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b to a greater degree
than Alternative 5 with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from trails.

Public Motor Vehicle Use
The analysis of Public Motor Vehicle Use shows that the alternatives differ substantially
as to effects to recreation users. Alternatives 1 and 5 result in the highest number of miles
of roads and trails rated high in recreation value open to public motorized use initially
(95.8 miles). Alternative 3 results in the same number of miles of high value recreation
routes designated for public motorized use, however only 55.2 of those miles would be
open initially, with an additional 40.6 miles continuing to be part of the NFTS but not
designated for public motorized use and identified on a MVUM until corrective actions
are analyzed and implemented. Alternative 4 would result in 3.7 miles of high recreation
value routes open to public motorized use, with an additional 13.4 miles continuing to be
part of the NFTS but not designated for public motorized use and identified on a MVUM
until corrective actions or mitigation are analyzed and implemented, and 46.7 miles of
high value recreation routes closed to public motor vehicle use. In Alternative 2, No
28

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Action, only the 30 miles of high value recreation routes that were not closed by court
order would remain open, with 65.9 miles of high value recreation routes closed to public
motorized use.
The effects on 4WD and motorcycle riding opportunities, particularly high country routes
over 6,000 feet in elevation, all rated high in recreation value, also vary substantially
between alternatives. In Alternatives 1 and 5, 42 miles of 4WD routes, all rated high in
recreation value, would be open. Approximately 18.5 miles of high country motorcycle
routes would be open, all rated medium to high in recreation value.
In Alternative 3, the same number of high country 4WD trails would be designated for
public motorized use, however only 11.2 miles would be open initially, with an additional
30.8 miles added to the MVUM once corrective actions are analyzed and implemented.
All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles, would be designated
open but not added to the MVUM until after corrective actions are analyzed and
implemented.
In Alternative 4, 9 miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, and an
additional 7.9 miles of high country 4WD trails would be designated open but not added
to the MVUM until after corrective actions and mitigation are analyzed and implemented.
Approximately 53 percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities on the Eldorado National
Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation would be closed, and all of the high country
motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles, representing 90 percent of the total
motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in
elevation would be closed.
In Alternative 2, 11.2 miles of high country 4WD trails would remain open, and 30.8
miles of high country 4WD trails would be closed. This equates to the closure of 65
percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000
feet in elevation. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles,
rated medium to high recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This
represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National
Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation.

Newly Proposed Threatened and Endangered Species
In Alternative 1, Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs could be directly and indirectly
affected by motor vehicle use on routes 17E24 (east) and 17E28, where they are known
to occur. Ten routes would be designated open for public motor vehicle use which could
affect proposed critical habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog; 10N01B,
10N13, 16E21, 16E26, 16E27, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28, 17E73, and 19E01. Yosemite toads
occur in habitat crossed by routes 09N01 and 19E01, both of which would be designated
open for public motor vehicle use. These routes traverse habitat where there is potential
for direct impacts to Yosemite toads and for routes to increase sediment delivery or
impact meadow hydrology in occupied habitats that have also been recently proposed as
critical habitat for the Yosemite toad.
In Alternative 2, under the no action alternative, no direct or indirect effects to Sierra
Nevada yellow-legged frogs or Yosemite toads or their proposed critical habitat would
result, although the presence of some roads or trails, even without public motor vehicle
use on these routes, may continue to impact their habitat until corrective actions are
implemented.
In Alternative 3, known occurrences of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite
toads would not be directly or indirectly affected by routes that would be immediately
opened for public motor vehicle use. Six routes have the potential to influence streams or
water bodies that may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog and two
routes have the potential to influence habitat for the Yosemite toad, but surveys indicated
these species were absent at these sites. Routes that would be opened for public motor
vehicle use in Alternative 3 meet Standard and Guideline 100 and would not affect the
quality of SNYLF habitat within areas proposed as critical habitat. None of the routes
that would be immediately opened in Alternative 3 are within areas proposed as critical
habitat for Yosemite toad. Additional routes (or portions of routes) that occur within
Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog or Yosemite toad habitat would remain closed for
public motor vehicle use until after corrective actions have been implemented.
Biological assessment and conferencing or consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service would occur during future analysis if it is determined that corrective actions or
public motor vehicle use on these routes may affect the Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog
or the Yosemite toad or their critical habitats.
In Alternative 4, known occurrences of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite
toads would not be directly or indirectly affected by routes that would be immediately
opened for public motor vehicle use. Two routes have the potential to influence streams
or water bodies that may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog but
surveys indicated the species was absent at these sites. 14N05 is the only route
31

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

occurring in SNYLF critical habitat, and field review determined this route would not
affect habitat elements. None of the routes occur with the range of the Yosemite toad or
its critical habitat. As described for Alternative 3, biological assessment and conferencing
or consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would occur during future
analysis of additional routes, if it is determined that corrective actions or public motor
vehicle use on these routes may affect the Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog or the
Yosemite toad or their critical habitats.
Alternative 5 would initially have the same effects upon SNYLF and Yosemite toads and
their critical habitat as Alternative 1 until corrective actions are taken over a five year
period.

Analysis Framework
The scope of analysis is defined by the following Court Order: Case No. 2:09-CV-02523LKK-JFM (United States District Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12).
This Court Order requires the Forest Service to analyze 42 specific routes for consistency
with the Riparian Conservation Objective (RCO) #2, S&G 100 with respect to meadows.
The Court Order left intact all other portions of the Forest Service’s travel management
decision, including the parts of the routes that do not intersect meadows. As a
consequence, this analysis focuses on S&G 100, which relates to impacts to meadows.
The 42 routes are listed in Table 3.4, and S&G 100 is provided in full below. Additional
hydrologic topics were analyzed in the 2008 TM EIS and ROD. Please refer to the 2008
TM EIS for an analysis of water quality, cumulative watershed effects, streams, and
wetlands.

Standard & Guideline 100:
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and other
special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural
surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions where necessary to
restore connectivity.”

Data and Analysis Methods
Meadow Survey Results
The 42 routes were surveyed in the Eldorado National Forest (ENF) in 2011 and 2012 in
order to: 1) locate the meadows that border or cross the 42 routes, and 2) determine
whether those meadows and associated routes are in compliance with S&G 100 of the
Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment Record of Decision (SNFPAROD 2004) as it
pertains to meadows.
A summary of the survey results is described below and in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.1.
• 81 of the surveyed features in the ENF were classified as meadows and 34 of the
features were not classified as meadows (Figures 3.2 and 3.3). The features that
were not classified as meadows included alder-dominated wetlands, narrow strips
of alder adjacent to streams, forested areas with or without shrubs, and areas of
shrubs without trees.
• 14 routes do not cross or border meadows. As a result, S&G 100 does not apply
to these routes with regard to meadows.
• 10 routes meet S&G 100. This is because these routes cross and/or border
meadows that meet S&G 100.
• 18 routes do not meet S&G 100. This is because these routes have affected the
hydrology of a total of 38 meadows such that S&G 100 was not being met.
A description of the field surveys, which includes the definitions and methodology used,
is in Table 3.3. A summary of the field survey results for individual routes is in Table
3.4; a summary of the meadows that do not meet S&G 100 is in Table 3.5; two examples
of field surveys are in Figures 3.4 through 3.8. All of the field survey forms are included
in the Project Record.

Table 3.3 Description of the field surveys of meadows in the Eldorado National Forest
in 2011 and 2012.1
Purpose of field
surveys
Standard and
Guideline 100

To determine if specific road or trail segments are causing adjacent meadows to not meet
Standard and Guideline 100 of the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment of 2004.
“Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of streams, meadows, wetlands, and
other special aquatic features by identifying roads and trails that intercept, divert, or
disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths. Implement corrective actions
where necessary to restore connectivity.”

Definition of a
meadow2

“A meadow is defined as a grassy opening, 0.1 acres or larger, dominated by perennial
sedges, rushes, and grasses (wet meadow) or perennial grasses and forbs (dry
meadow).”

Characteristics
of a meadow3

 “A meadow is an ecosystem type composed of one or more plant communities
dominated by herbaceous species.
 It supports plants that use surface water and/or shallow groundwater (generally at
depths of less than one meter).
 Woody vegetation, like trees or shrubs, may occur and be dense but are not
dominant.”

Definition of
hydrologic
connectivity

The hydrologic connectivity of a meadow exists when the surface and subsurface flow of
water through the meadow has not been visibly altered by the road or trail segment.
Description.
A field survey form for meadows was developed specifically to evaluate compliance
with Standard & Guideline 100. The questions on page 2 of the survey form are specific
to visible or noticeable evidence of alteration of the surface and subsurface flow of
water through the meadow. The questions are qualitative, require hydrologic knowledge
and field experience to answer, and are based on features that are visible at the ground
surface, but reflect surface and subsurface water flow characteristics as described in the
criteria below.4

Methodology4

Assumptions
• The mere presence of a road or trail through or adjacent to a meadow (on-theground) does not determine if Standard and Guideline100 is being met. This is
because it is possible for a road or trail to occur within or adjacent to a meadow
without a visible alteration of surface or subsurface flow of water into or through
the meadow.
• A disruption of surface and/or subsurface flow in the meadow by a road or trail
would result in evidence that can be seen at the surface, such as changes in
vegetation, presence of deposited sediment, gullies, incised stream channels, etc.
Criteria for rating Standard &Guideline 100
Roads and trails were rated as not meeting Standard & Guideline 100 if field evidence
was visible that shows one or more of the following:
• The road or trail intercepts and diverts surface and/or subsurface water from the
meadow and routes the water away from the meadow such that the meadow has
decreased in size and/or wetness.
• Runoff from the road or trail has eroded sediment into the meadow such that
the size and/or wetness of the meadow has been reduced.
• Runoff from the road or trail has caused a stream channel to downcut such that
the water table next to the stream has dropped and the size and/or the wetness
of the meadow has decreased.

Environmental Consequences
Effects Common to All Alternatives
There are 14 routes where S&G 100 is not applicable with regard to meadows. This is
because field surveys in 2011 and 2012 determined that these 14 routes do not cross or
border a meadow in the Eldorado National Forest (ENF). The definition and
characteristics of a meadow is described in Table 3.3. The 14 routes are: 08N23B,
08N35, 17E79 (09N04), 09N54, 10N06, 10N26, 10N32, 10NY04, 11N09A, 11N22,
11N70, 12NY15, 13N24, and 17E12.
There are 10 routes where S&G 100 would be met. This is because field surveys in 2011
and 2012 determined that all meadows that cross or border these 10 routes meet S&G
100. The reason that these meadows meet S&G 100 is because the following conditions
were met at the time of the field surveys:
• The road or trail does not intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface water
from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
meadow has decreased in size and/or wetness.
• Runoff from the road or trail has not eroded sediment into the meadow such that
the size and/or wetness of the meadow has decreased.
• Runoff from the road or trail has not caused a stream channel to downcut such
that the water table next to the stream has dropped and the size and/or the wetness
of the meadow has decreased.
The 10 routes where S&G 100 would be met are: 09N15, 10N03, 10NY05, 10NY06,
12NY06, 14N05, 14N27, 14N58, 17E17, and 17E21. The methodology used to evaluate
compliance with S&G 100 is described in more detail in Table 3-6.
Most of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G 100 will likely not do so for at least several
years. The primary reason is that a detailed plan of corrective actions (to attain
compliance with S&G 100) for most of the 18 routes does not currently exist, and would
require at least several years to both develop and implement. The 18 routes are: 09N01,
09N08, 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 10N01, 17E73 (10N13), 10N14, 16E27
(10N21), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19,
17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur for a period of time (the length of time
varies by alternative) to the 38 meadows that are crossed and/or bordered by the 18 routes
listed above. The reason is that the closure of a route to motorized public use for any
period of time, by itself, does not correct the reason(s) that the route is causing a
meadow(s) to not meet S&G 100. For example, a route that intercepts surface and/or
subsurface water from a meadow and directs that water down the route and away from
50

the meadow will continue to do so after vehicles are not allowed on the route. Two
examples of this - meadows 17E73-3 and 17E34-5 - are described in Affected
Environment, Figures 3.4 through 3-8. The adverse impacts to each meadow would
likely include one or more of the following:
• The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
• Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
• Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
Since the completion of the 2008 TM FEIS ROD, the Pacific Southwest Region of the
U.S. Forest Service developed a number of new Best Management Practices (BMPs)
applicable to roads and trails. In general, compliance with S&G 100 results in
compliance with the new BMPs that are relevant to the alternatives of this SEIS.1 The
new BMPs for roads and trails in the 2011 WQMH contain specific measures that
restore or improve hydrologic connectivity of meadows. The new relevant BMPs for
roads and trails in the 2011 WQMH are summarized below, and the reader is referred to
the 2011 WQMH for the complete text of BMPs and background information.
•

BMP 4.7.1, item #3a-b (Planning). The objective of this BMP is to use the travel
management planning process to develop measures to avoid or minimize adverse
impacts to aquatic resources from trails. The BMP describes a number of
practices to achieve this objective, including the identification of trail segments
causing adverse impacts and the prioritization of mitigation measures to
minimize those impacts. This SEIS has identified ten trails causing adverse
impacts to meadows, and has identified three alternatives (Alternatives 3, 4, and
5) to address those impacts. The mitigation measures to address those impacts,
as described in the BMP, could include the relocation of existing trails or trail
segments away from meadows, reconstruction of trails to improve effective
drainage, as well as other measures.
___________________________________________________________________

These BMPs are found in the 2011 Water Quality Management Handbook (WQMH). The 2008 TM EIS and ROD
issued under the WQMH of 2000; this SEIS is under the WQMH of 2011. The 2011 WQMH handbook contains

provides that trails should be located to minimize [effects to] hydrologic
connectivity and that drainage structures should be incorporated into trail design
to disperse concentrated runoff. None of the alternatives propose the
construction of new trails; however, several of the alternatives consider future
implementation of corrective measures to address adverse impacts to meadows
from trails. Accordingly, this BMP will be considered and applied at the time
the Eldorado National Forest proposes specific corrective measures.
BMP 2.1, item 6 (Travel Management and Planning Analysis). The objective of
this BMP is to use the road management planning process to develop measures
to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to aquatic resources from existing roads.
The BMP identifies a number of practices to achieve this objective, including the
identification of roads causing resource or watershed impacts and the
identification and prioritization of mitigation measures. This travel management
analysis has identified adverse impacts to meadows associated with existing
roads. Future analyses will focus on developing appropriate mitigation measures
to address these impacts.

Alternative 1: Proposed Action
There are 18 routes – the same 18 routes that contained at least one meadow that did not
meet S&G 100 - where S&G 100 would no longer apply. This is because a Forest Plan
Amendment would exempt these 18 routes from S&G 100. The 18 routes are: 09N01,
09N08, 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 10N01, 17E73 (10N13), 10N14, 16E27
(10N21), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19,
17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur for an indefinite period of time to 38
meadows that are crossed and/or bordered by the 18 routes listed above. This is because
Alternative 1 does not require that corrective actions be implemented on the 18 routes
within any specific time period in order to bring those routes into compliance with S&G
100 and allows public motorized vehicle use of those routes. The adverse impacts to
each meadow have been previously described in paragraph 4 of Effects Common to
Alternatives.

Adverse impacts to the 38 meadows that are crossed and/or bordered by the 18 routes
listed above would likely be greater from Alternative 1 than Alternatives 3, 4, and 5.
There are three reasons - when combined together - that support this conclusion.
• Alternative 1 does not require that corrective actions be implemented on the 18
routes in order to bring those routes into compliance with S&G 100.
• Alternative 1 allows public motorized vehicle use of those 18 routes, and there are
no restrictions on the amount or time period of use.
• The research has generally shown that an increase in the amount of vehicle use on
native surface roads and trails leads to an increase in sediment production and
changes in runoff from those roads and trails – this research was documented in
the 2008 TM FEIS.

Alternative 2: No Action
There are 18 routes - the same 18 routes that cross and/or border at least one meadow that
did not meet S&G 100 - where S&G 100 would not be met. This is because Alternative 2
(No Action) does not require that a plan of corrective actions for the 18 routes be
developed in order to attain compliance with S&G 100. The 18 routes are: 09N01,
09N08, 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 10N01, 17E73 (10N13), 10N14, 16E27
(10N21), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F), 11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19,
17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur for an indefinite period of time to the 38
meadows that are crossed and/or bordered by the 18 routes listed above. This is because
Alternative 2 does not require that corrective actions be implemented on the 18 routes in
order to bring those routes into compliance with S&G 100.The adverse impacts to each
meadow have been previously described in paragraph 4 of Effects Common to
Alternatives.
Adverse impacts to the 38 meadows that are crossed and/or bordered by the 18 routes
listed above would likely be greater from Alternative 2 than alternatives 3, 4, and 5.
There are two reasons - when combined together - that support this conclusion.
• Alternative 2 does not require that corrective actions be implemented on the 18
routes in order to bring those routes into compliance with S&G 100. Alternatives
3, 4, and 5 contain such a requirement.

53

Alternative 3
There are 18 routes - the same 18 routes that cross and/or border at least one meadow that
did not meet S&G 100 - where S&G 100 would be met after corrective actions to the
routes have been implemented and the Forest Service has determined that the routes are
consistent with S&G 100. The corrective actions could include one or more of the
following:
• Relocation of route segments away from meadows and the subsequent removal of
unnecessary route segments near meadows.
• Reconstruction of route segments to direct runoff (and sediment) away from
meadows.
• Road or trail improvements in meadows to prevent the interception and diversion
of surface and subsurface water.
• Structures in route segments that enable vehicles to be suspended above
meadows.
Adverse impacts would likely continue to occur to 38 meadows until the corrective
actions to these 18 routes have been implemented. The adverse impacts to each meadow
would include one or more of the following:
• The road or trail would continue to intercept and divert surface and/or subsurface
water from the meadow and route the water away from the meadow such that the
size and/or wetness of the meadow is decreased.
• Runoff from the road or trail would continue to erode sediment into the meadow
such that the size and/or wetness of the meadow would decrease.
• Runoff from the road or trail would cause additional stream channel downcutting
– this would cause the water table next to the stream to continue to drop and the
size and/or the wetness of the meadow would continue to decrease.
The 18 routes are: 09N01, 09N08, 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N83), 09N95, 10N01,
17E73 (10N13), 10N14, 16E27 (10N21), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 16E21 (11N26F),
11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
It is likely that the corrective actions would be implemented, however, due to public
desire to have these routes brought into compliance with S&G 100 and reopened for
public motor vehicle use.

Alternative 4
The effects of Alternative 4 are similar to those described under Alternative 3, with a few
differences as described below.
Adverse effects to 29 meadows crossed and/or bordered by 13 routes would likely be less
than Alternative 3 because corrective actions would be implemented to bring those 13
routes into compliance with S&G 100 and these routes would be closed to public
motorized vehicle use. The research has generally shown that a decrease in the amount
of vehicle use on native surface roads and trails leads to a decrease in sediment
production and changes in runoff from those roads and trails – this research was
documented in the 2008 TM FEIS. The 13 routes are: 16E26 (09N82), 19E01 (09N83),
09N95, 10N01, 17E73 (10N13), 16E27 (10N21), 10N98, 16E33 (11N23F), 14N39,
17E16, 17E19, 17E24, and 17E28.
Adverse effects to features that do not include meadows would be corrected on seven
routes. The reasons for corrective actions on these seven routes are described in the
project record. The seven routes are: 08N23B, 12NY15, 08N35, 10N32, 10NY06,
09N04, and 10N03.

Alternative 5
The effects of Alternative 5 are similar to Alternative 1 with a few differences as
described below.
Adverse effects to the 38 meadows that currently do not meet S&G 100 as a result of 18
routes should cease once corrective actions to the 18 routes are implemented. However,
adverse effects to the 38 meadows would likely continue for up to five years for two
reasons:
• The 18 routes would be opened to public motorized vehicle use before the
implementation of corrective actions to the 18 routes that would bring these routes
into compliance with S&G 100. The research has generally shown that an
increase in the amount of vehicle use on native surface roads and trails leads to an
increase in sediment production and changes in runoff from roads and trails – this
research was documented in the 2008 TM FEIS.
• Five years is the time period in which corrective actions must be implemented to
the 18 routes. Routes that have not received corrective actions in that time period
would then be closed to public motorized vehicle use.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Five years after the Record of Decision, the number of routes that meet S&G 100 (of the
18 routes that currently do not meet S&G 100) could range between zero and 18 routes.
This is because the exact number of routes that can be brought into compliance with S&G
100 with the five year time period is not known and depends on a number of factors. The
best case is that all 18 routes (of the 18 routes that do not currently meet S&G 100)
would be brought into compliance with S&G 100, and the worst case is that zero routes
would be brought into compliance with S&G 100.

Minimization of damage to meadows
36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b, states:
“In designating National Forest System trails and areas on National Forest System
lands, the responsible official shall consider effects on the following with the objective of
minimizing” (1) Damage to soil, watershed, vegetation, and other forest resources.”
There are several aspects of 36 CFR § 212.55 (b) that are important to note.
• Trails are included and roads are not included.
• Meadows are not specifically mentioned, but are included in the phrase “. . . soil,
watershed, vegetation, and other forest resources.”
• The Forest Service is not required to eliminate damage to soil, watershed,
vegetation, and other forest resources when designating trails. However, the
Forest Service is required to demonstrate that is it has minimized damage to such
resources when designating trails.
Fourteen of the 42 routes are trails. The trails are: 16E21 (11N26F), 16E26 (09N82),
16E27 (10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 17E12, 17E16, 17E17, 17E19, 17E21, 17E24, 17E28,
17E73, 17E79, (10N13), and 19E01 (09N93).
There are ten trails that cross and/or border meadows that do not meet S&G 100. Those
trails are: 16E21 (11N26F), 16E26 (09N82), 16E27 (10N21), 16E33 (11N23F), 17E16,
17E19, 17E24, 17E28, 17E73, and 19E01 (09N93). The number of meadows for each of
the ten trails that do not meet S&G 100 is shown in Table 3.7.
There are two trails (17E79 and 17E12) that do not cross meadows and two trails (17E17
and 17E21) that cross meadows that meet S&G 100. These four trails already meet 36
CFR 212.55(b) because no damage is occurring to meadows as a result of these four
trails.
Alternatives 1 and 2 would not meet the criteria of 36 CFR § 212.55 (b) with respect to
minimizing damage to meadows from the ten trails listed above that do not meet S&G
100. The reason for this conclusion is that adverse impacts would likely continue to
56

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

occur to 25 meadows that are crossed and/or bordered by the ten trails because
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) and Alternative 2 (No Action) do not require actions to
correct or mitigate adverse impacts to the 25 meadows caused by these ten trails that
were identified during the 2011 and 2012 field surveys.
Alternatives 3 and 4 would meet 36 CFR § 212.55 (b) with respect to minimizing damage
to meadows from ten trails. This is because the ten trails that do not meet S&G 100
would remain closed to public motorized vehicle use until corrective measures that will
minimize adverse effects to meadows and ensure compliance with S&G 100 are
implemented. Under Alternatives 3 and 4, the ten trails would not be designated for
public motorized vehicle use pursuant to 36 CFR 212. 51 until corrective measures
minimizing adverse impacts are implemented.
Alternative 5 would meet 36 CFR § 212.55 (b) with respect to minimizing damage to
meadows from ten trails. This is because the ten trails that do not meet S&G 100 would
be brought into compliance with S&G 100 within five years or would then be closed to
public motorized vehicle use. Alternative 5 would require implementation of corrective
actions to minimize adverse effects to meadows within five years, or the trails would be
closed to the public motorized vehicle use until corrected.
Alternatives 3 and 4 would meet 36 CFR § 212.55 (b) to a greater degree than Alternative
5 with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from the ten trails. The In Alternative
3 and 4 the ten trails that do not meet S&G 100 would remain closed to public motorized
vehicle use until corrective measures that minimize adverse effects to meadows are
implemented, while Alternative 5 allows motorized vehicle use to continue on the ten
trails for up to five years before corrective actions are implemented.
The rationale for the above determinations for each alternative with regard to meadows
and trails is compared side-by-side in Table 3.6, and individual trails are addressed in
Table 3.7.

Rationale for Determination

Relative Degree of Minimization
of Damage to Meadows

Adverse impacts would likely
continue to occur to 25 meadows that
are crossed and/or bordered by 10
trails. This is because Alternative 1
and Alternative 2 do not require
mitigation measures or other
corrective actions to minimize adverse
impacts to the 25 meadows caused by
these 10 trails that were identified
during the 2011 and 2012 field
surveys. .

Negligible difference between
Alternatives 1 and 2 because both
alternatives do not require actions
to minimize adverse impacts to the
25 meadows caused by the 10 trails
that were identified during the
2011 and 2012 field surveys.

The 10 trails that do not meet
Standard & Guideline 100 would
remain closed to public motor vehicle
use until corrective measures that will
minimize adverse effects to meadows
and ensure compliance with S&G 100
are implemented. The four remaining
trails either do not cross meadows or
do not have adverse effects to
meadows. Those four trails already
meet 36 CFR 212.55(b) because no
damage is occurring to meadows as a
result of those trails.

Alternatives 3 and 4 do more to
minimize damage to meadows than
Alternative 5 because all 10 trails
that do not meet S&G 100 would
remain closed to public motorized
vehicle use until corrective
measures that minimize adverse
effects to meadows are
implemented.

The 10 trails that do not meet
Standard & Guideline 100 would be
brought into compliance with S&G
100 within five years or would then be
closed to public motor vehicle use.
This alternative would require
implementation of corrective actions
to minimize adverse effects to
meadows within five years, or else the
trails would be closed to the public
motor vehicle use.

Alternative 5 does not minimize
damage to meadows immediately,
but permits public motorized use to
continue while the forest develops
and implements the necessary
corrective measures. If those
measures necessary to minimize
damage to meadows are not
implemented within five years, the
trails would be closed to the public.
As a consequence, adverse effects
to 25 meadows (crossed and/or
bordered by 10 trails) could
continue for up to five years.

The corrective actions could include one or more of the following: a) relocation of route segments away from
meadows and the subsequent removal of unnecessary route segments near meadows, b) reconstruction of route
segments to direct runoff (and sediment) from meadows, c) road or trail improvements in meadows that prevent the
interception and diversion of surface and subsurface water, d) structures in route segments that enable vehicles to be

Summary
There are 24 routes where there is no difference between the alternatives with regard to
S&G 100. This is because 14 routes do not cross or border meadows and 10 routes cross
or border meadows that meet S&G 100.
There are 18 routes – the routes that have caused at least one meadow to not meet S&G
100 - where there are differences between the alternatives with regard to S&G 100.
Alternative 1 (Proposed Action) would create a Forest Plan Amendment that would
exempt those 18 routes from S&G 100. Alternative 2 (no action) would result in zero of
those 18 routes meeting S&G 100. Alternatives 3 and 4 would result in 18 of those
routes meeting S&G 100. Under Alternative 5, the number of routes that meet S&G 100
after five years could range between zero and 18. The results with regard to S&G 100 are
summarized in Table 3.8 and Figure 3.9. In addition, adverse impacts to 38 meadows
(from the 18 routes) would be less from Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 than Alternatives 1 and
2.
Alternatives 1 and 2 would not meet the criteria of 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b with
respect to minimizing damage to meadows from trails. Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 would
meet 36 CFR § 212.55 subpart b with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from

than Alternative 5 with respect to minimizing damage to meadows from trails.

Affected Environment

Background
The 42 routes being considered in this document are located on three Ranger Districts of
the Eldorado National Forest. Most of the routes are located in the higher elevations, over
6,000 feet. High elevation roads and trails offer a different recreation experience than
lower elevation trails. There are not a large number of high elevation 4WD recreation
opportunities across the Forest. High elevation trails provide access to remote areas on
the Forest, especially for older and less able individuals who might otherwise not be able
to enjoy these areas. High elevation trails have cooler temperatures during the summer
months than those in the lower elevations, and often have sweeping views and beautiful
fall colors. The setting for these routes is more desirable for camping due to greater
solitude and scenic quality. Campfires may be allowed at higher elevations when they are
prohibited at lower elevations due to wildfire hazards. Some of the routes are also used
by hikers, mountain bikers and equestrians. Some provide vehicle access to other hiking
and equestrian opportunities, including day hikes into the Desolation and Mokelumne
Wilderness areas. The higher elevation routes also offer access for deer and quail hunting
during hunting season, and access for fishing along streams and lake shores. The routes
also provide access for photography, geocaching, bird watching and wildlife viewing, and
spiritual pursuits.
The 42 routes being considered offer a variety of levels of challenge for recreation users.
Some of the routes are fully developed Forest roads, while others are passable only with
specialized vehicles. Several of the routes, such as the Barrett 4WD Trail, Squaw Ridge
4WD Trail, Strawberry 4WD Trail, and Clover Valley 4WD Trail offer multi-day
recreation opportunities with camping. The Barrett 4WD Trail offers a level of challenge
for 4WD users that is relatively unique in the Region, allowing users to test their
technical skills in travelling over large boulders. Only a few other 4WD trails in the
Sierra Nevada offer a similar level of challenge, including the Rubicon Trail on the
Eldorado National Forest and Fordyce Creek Trail on the Tahoe National Forest.
A number of the 42 routes being considered have been in use for over a hundred years,
being remnants of early emigrant trails over the Sierra Nevada. Others have been in place
for multiple generations, and many users have established treasured family traditions of
bringing the younger and older generations along on trips. Exposing family and friends to
the Forest through OHV recreation also fosters a love of the Forest in younger
generations and provides interpretive opportunities.

Cosumnes River for fishing.
Leoni (09N54)
Route 09N54 is a native surface road that enters the SW corner of the Leoni Meadows
Private Camp. The road does not provide the main access into camp, but serves as a route
for scenic driving and hiking. This road is open to all vehicles and is used by Forest
visitors for access to the Forest, driving for pleasure, fuel wood gathering, hunting, and as
a route for horseback and mountain bike riding by camp attendees.
Pebble Ridge (10N06)
Route 10N06 is a native surface road that connects two paved roads 10N59 and 10N58 in
the Pebble Canyon area which is popular for scenic driving, dispersed camping and for
hunters. The road is approximately 2 miles long and parallels a tributary of Camp Creek
which is popular for fishing.
Strawberry 4WD Trail (portion of 10N13, now 17E73)
The northern portion of route 10N13 (17E73), also known as Strawberry 4WD trail, is
used primarily by 4WD enthusiasts seeking a lower level of difficulty 4WD recreational
experience. Forest visitors can access the Strawberry 4WD Trail from either the
Placerville Ranger District (RD) side or the Amador RD side (via 10N13 Schneider
Camp Road). The trail offers ample recreational activities such as hiking, photography,
bird watching, mountain biking and wildflower viewing. The Strawberry 4WD Trail
continues to be a destination for 4 wheel drive activities, especially in the late spring and
early summer; however, it is not as intensively used as other trails such as the Rubicon
Trail. Routes 10N13 and 17E73 combined are approximately 6.73 miles long. Except for
a limited amount of the total length of the trail, the trail does not provide “extreme” 4WD
conditions. The Gold Hill Posse (GHP) 4WD club has “adopted” the Strawberry 4WD
Trail since 2002. This volunteer group routinely provides trail maintenance including reenforcing water bars to redirect water from the trail. The GHP have contributed
approximately 500 hours of volunteer labor since 2002, and are still active participants in
the Adopt-A-Trail program.

Indicator Measures
Two indicator measures were used for this analysis. The first is a relative recreation value
rating that was assigned to each route based on a set of criteria explained below. The
second indicator measure used was whether the route is a high country route (traverses
ground over 6,000 feet in elevation). High country routes represent a unique recreation
opportunity in the Sierra Nevada, and many of the historic high country routes have been
closed to public motorized use in the past, so few routes of this type remain available for
public motorized recreation use.

Rating of Values Associated with the 42 Routes
For the purpose of this analysis, the following criteria have been used to provide a rating
of recreation access and opportunities for public motor vehicle use of the 42 routes. The
criteria are similar to those that were used in the 2008 Travel Management FEIS,
Appendix H, to rate recreation values associated with Intermittent Service Roads (NFS
Level 1 Roads).

•

Routes which provide only a very limited recreation opportunity, such as a short
route which accesses no specific dispersed recreation opportunity; or
Routes which provide access to a recreation opportunity that is very common,
such as access for hunting in an area with many other routes of comparable
opportunity; or
Routes which have a low level of use because of the lack of public recreation
opportunities.

Medium
•
•

•

Routes which provide only a moderate level of recreation opportunity, such as an

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Direct Effects to Public Motor Vehicle Use
Effects of Alternative 1 (Proposed Action)
In Alternative 1, all of the routes temporarily closed under the court order in 2012 would
be reopened for public motorized use according to the type of use established in the 2008
Eldorado National Forest Travel Management Environmental Impact Statement and
Record of Decision. For the 42 routes, approximately 95.8 miles of roads and trails rated
high in recreation value would be open to public motorized use. Approximately 42.1
miles of 4WD routes, all rated high in recreation value, would be open. Approximately
18.5 miles of high country motorcycle routes would be open, all rated medium to high in
recreation value. Users would be able to continue enjoying these traditional motorized
routes and the portions of the Forest they access. None of the 42 routes rated medium or
high recreation value would be closed to public motorized use. A summary of the miles of
routes that would be reopened is provided in Table 3.11.
Effects of Alternative 2 (No Action)
In Alternative 2, all portions of the 42 routes that are currently closed would remain
closed to public motorized use. The 30 miles of high value recreation routes that were not
closed by court order would remain open, with 65.9 miles of high value recreation routes
closed to public motorized use. Approximately 11.2 miles of high country 4WD trails
would remain open, all rated high in recreation value, and 30.8 miles of high country
4WD trails would remain closed, all rated high in recreation value. This represents 65
percent of the total 4WD trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000
feet in elevation. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles,
rated medium to high recreation value, would be closed to public motorized use. This
represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail opportunities on the Eldorado National
Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. Routes that are closed to public motorized use may
remain open to non-motorized trail uses, resulting in an increase in the non-motorized
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest. A summary of the miles of routes
that would be open and closed is provided in Table 3.11.
Effects of Alternative 3 (Preferred Alternative)
In Alternative 3, approximately 53.4 miles of high value recreation routes would be open
to public motorized use, with an additional 42.4 miles of high value recreation routes

would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a MVUM until the routes are in compliance with S&G

implementing necessary mitigation measures designed to meet S&G 100 could take a
number of years, depending upon available funding sources. A summary of the miles of
routes that would be open and closed is provided in Table 3.11.
Effects of Alternative 4
In Alternative 4, approximately 35.7 miles of high value recreation routes would be open
to public motorized use, with an additional 13.4 miles of high value recreation routes
would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a MVUM until corrective actions or mitigation are
analyzed and implemented, and 46.7 miles of high value recreation routes closed to
public motorized use. Approximately 9 miles of high country 4WD trails would remain
open, all rated high in recreation value, and an additional 7.9 miles of high country 4WD
trails would be continue to be part of the NFTS but would not be designated for public
motorized use and identified on a MVUM until corrective actions or mitigation are
analyzed and implemented. Approximately 25.3 miles of high country 4WD trails would
be closed, all rated high in recreation value. This includes many very popular routes such
as the Strawberry 4WD Trail, Squaw Ridge 4WD Trail, Carson Emigrant National
Recreation Trail, and Clover Valley/Deer Valley Trail. Approximately 53 percent of the
total 4WD trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation
would be closed. All of the high country motorcycle trails, approximately 18.5 miles
rated medium to high recreation value and representing 90 percent of the total motorcycle
trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation, would be
closed to public motorized use. This represents 90 percent of the total motorcycle trail
opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest over 6,000 feet in elevation. Routes that
are closed to public motorized use may remain open to non-motorized trail uses, resulting
in an increase in the non-motorized trail opportunities on the Eldorado National Forest. It
is estimated that analyzing and implementing necessary mitigation measures designed to
meet S&G 100 could take a number of years, depending upon available funding sources.
A summary of the miles of routes that would be open and closed is provided in Table
3.11.

Effects of Alternative 5
Effects to public motorized use would be similar to those described under Alternative #1

Indirect Effects to Public Motor Vehicle Use
In addition to the direct affects to recreation under each alternative, there are some
additional routes that would be indirectly affected under each alternative other than the
proposed action, resulting in a decrease in mileage available for recreation. These roads
and trails are routes that are accessed by one of the 42 routes planned to be closed or
opened after mitigation in that alternative. These routes are currently designated open to
motorized use under the 2008 Eldorado National Forest Public Wheeled Motorized
Travel Management EIS and Record of Decision, but they are not currently displayed on
the MVUM since they cannot be reached without travelling on a portion of one of the 42
routes currently closed to public motorized use pending completion of this SEIS. In
alternatives where they are not shown closed, the routes would be added back on to the
MVUM after a decision is issued on this SEIS.
In Alternative 2, No Action, 11.2 miles of additional routes would be affected. In
Alternative 3, 8.1 miles would be affected until corrective actions are completed on the
respective access routes. In Alternative 4, 9.3 miles would be affected until corrective
actions and/or mitigation is completed on the respective access routes. No miles of
additional routes would be affected in Alternative 1 or for the first five years with
Alternative 5.

Another indirect effect of some alternatives is the concentration of public wheeled motor
vehicle use on the remaining routes that remain open on the Eldorado and other Sierra
Nevada forests. This would be most pronounced in Alternative 2, No Action, with the
highest number of 4 wheel drive routes remaining closed. It would also occur to some
extent with Alternatives 3 and 4. With a limited number of challenging high elevation
four wheel drive trails available, the use would be expected to increase on other routes
not covered in this SEIS such as the Rubicon Trail, on the Eldorado National Forest and
Fordyce Trail on the Tahoe National Forest.

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Newly Proposed Threatened and Endangered Species _________
On April 25, 2013 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a proposed rule to list the
Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog as an endangered species and the Yosemite toad as a
threatened species. The Service also proposed to designate as critical habitat
approximately 1,105,400 acres for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog in Butte,
Plumas, Lassen, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Calaveras, Alpine,
Mariposa, Mono, Madera, Tuolumne, Fresno, and Inyo Counties, California; and
approximately 750,926 acres for the Yosemite toad in Alpine, Tuolumne, Mono,
Mariposa, Madera, Fresno, and Inyo Counties, California. A number of the routes being
evaluated in the FSEIS occur within the range of these species or within areas proposed
as critical habitat. Information about the presence of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs,
Yosemite toads, or their proposed critical habitat relevant to the 42 specific routes, has
therefore been added to the FSEIS.
Affected Environment
Background
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog
(Rana sierrae) is presently in danger of extinction throughout its entire range, based on
the immediacy, severity, and scope of the threats to its continued existence . These threats
include habitat degradation and fragmentation, predation and disease, climate change,
inadequate regulatory protections, and the interaction of these various stressors impacting
small remnant populations. There has been a rangewide reduction in abundance and
geographic extent of surviving populations of frogs following decades of fish stocking,
habitat fragmentation, and most recently a disease epidemic. Surviving populations are
smaller and more isolated, and recruitment in disease-infested populations is much
reduced relative to historic norms. Road and trail use by motorized vehicles and
motorcycles have been known to result in direct impacts to Sierra Nevada yellow-legged
frogs from habitat degradation and road kill at wet crossings (Spellerberg 1998). Past
impacts to streams from road runoff have resulted in sedimentation and increased runoff
causing downcutting and stream incisement. This combination of population stressors
makes persistence of the species precarious throughout the currently occupied range in
the Sierra Nevada.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that the Yosemite toad (Anaxyrus canorus)
is likely to become threatened with extinction throughout its range within the foreseeable
future, based on the immediacy, severity, and scope of the threats to its continued
existence. These include habitat loss associated with degradation of meadow hydrology,
most commonly due to historic livestock grazing but also due to roads, trails, or
85

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

recreation uses. Direct impacts have been documented where Yosemite toads have been
crushed by vehicles while crossing travel routes during their reproductive period. Other
stressors include climate change impacting small remnant populations, likely
compounded with the cumulative effect of other threat factors (such as disease).
Biological Requirements of the Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog and Yosemite Toad
The Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog is highly aquatic and is found in a variety of
habitats including lakes, ponds, tarns, wet meadows, and streams (Grinnell and Storer
1924, Zweifel 1955, Mullally and Cunningham 1956). Breeding occurs shortly after
snowmelt (Knapp and Matthews 2000, Knapp et al. 2003). Larvae take two to three years
to metamorphose and thus require permanent water to survive (Zweifel 1955, Bradford
1983). After breeding, adults may disperse into a variety of aquatic habitats for feeding,
including more ephemeral sites unsuitable for overwintering or breeding (Pope and
Matthews 2001). During the active season, total movement distances are typically less
than a few hundred meters (Vredenburg et al. 2004; Pope and Mathews 2001; Mathews
and Pope 1999), but movements of greater than 1 km between high elevation lakes
following stream courses are known to occur (Pope and Mathews 2001). In general, all
life stages are fairly easy to detect using visual encounter surveys (Bradford 1989, Knapp
and Matthews 2000).
The Yosemite toad is endemic to high elevation (>1800 m) aquatic habitats in the central
Sierra Nevada south of Carson Pass. Yosemite toads on the Eldorado NF are suspected
of being a genetic cross between Yosemite toad and western toad (Anaxyrus boreas
halophilus). Adults arrive at breeding sites and lay eggs at snowmelt commonly in
shallow, warm water areas in wet meadows, ponds, slow moving streams, and flooded,
grassy areas adjacent to lakes (Karlstrom 1962). Breeding generally takes place over a
short period of time (may be as short as ~5 days)(Kagarise Sherman 1980, Sadinski
2004). After breeding, adults often disperse into upland habitat and retreat to burrows and
other cover making them difficult to detect (Karlstrom 1962, Liang 2010). In studies at
Tioga pass, Sherman and Morton (1993, 1984) found that males tended to stay in the
nearby meadows when not breeding, while females dispersed farther, into large willow
thickets. In general, toads do not occur more than 100 yards from permanent water
(Karlstrom, 1962).
Aquatic Habitat: GIS analysis, surveys and sightings
Suitable breeding and overwintering habitat for the SNYLF is provided by perennial and
intermittent water bodies and streams above 4,500 feet in elevation. Forty routes occur
above 4,500 feet in elevation and review of these routes was performed by aquatic
biologists in 2012 and 2013, to evaluate whether routes crossed wet streams or traveled
86

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

next to wet features that could provide breeding or overwintering habitat for SNYLF.
The proximity of routes to potential habitat, the presence of wet stream crossings, and the
presence of functioning culverts at wet crossings was recorded on field forms. Wet
stream crossings (and other crossings with potential to deliver sediment to the stream or
affect the species) were surveyed 100 meters upstream and downstream from the route
for presence of any tadpoles or adult Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs. (Surveys were
not conducted where the stream crossings had culverts and did not have potential to affect
SNYLF habitat through sediment delivery or other effects to aquatic habitat). More
detailed descriptions of the surveys and survey results are provided in the Biological
Assessment prepared for this project. Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs were found to
be present on routes 17E24 (east portion) and 17E28, and absent at stream crossings
along the other surveyed routes, based on these visual encounter surveys.
Suitable habitat for the Yosemite toad on the Eldorado NF is provided by high elevation
wetland areas, meadows, ponds and slow moving streams, above 6,400 feet in elevation,
and south of Carson Pass. Seven routes occur above 6,400 feet in elevation and within the
range of the Yosemite toad. Field surveys for meadows performed by USFS hydrology
crew in 2011 and 2012, and field reviews performed by aquatic biologists in 2012 and
2013 found that all seven of these routes crossed aquatic features or traveled next to wet
features that could provide habitat for Yosemite toads. Yosemite toads are known to
occur in habitat traversed by two of these routes: 09N01 and 19E01. These two routes
also occur within proposed critical habitat for this species. Detailed descriptions of
surveys and results are provided in the Biological Assessment prepared for this project.

Effects on Newly Proposed Threatened and Endangered Species

Background
In its April 25, 2013 proposal to list the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog as endangered
and to list the Yosemite toad threatened, and its proposal to designate critical habitat for
both species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports a number of potential effects
from motorized road and trail use. The following is a summary of these findings:
Roads create the potential for direct mortality of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs
through vehicle strikes and the possible introduction of contaminants into new areas;
since most extant populations are not located near roads, collectively, direct
mortality risks to Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs are likely of sporadic significance.
Nonetheless, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds that such impacts may be important
incidentally on a site specific basis.
87

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

Use of vehicles, including off highway vehicles, may threaten all life stages of the Sierra
Nevada yellow-legged frog through degradation of aquatic and riparian habitat. Offhighway motor vehicle trail use can compact soils within riparian habitat, create
excessive road runoff, resulting in a lower the water table, loss of riparian or wet meadow
vegetation and increased sediment delivery to streams. High elevation areas, where
much of the increased recreational activity occurs, are naturally stressed ecosystems
because of intense solar exposure; extremes in temperatures, precipitation levels, and
wind; short growing seasons; and shallow, nutrient poor soil. Such habitats are typically
not resilient to disturbance. Greater public access from motorized roads and trails can
increase recreational activity in riparian areas and at fragile lakeshores, resulting in
trampled vegetation, compacted soils, and physical damage to streambanks. Studies have
not been conducted to determine the extent to which road and trail use and
recreational activities are directly contributing to the decline of the Sierra Nevada yellowlegged frog. Currently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service considers recreational
activities (including off-highway vehicle road and trail use) to be a threat of lower
significance to Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog habitat overall, when compared to other
stressors (USDI 2013b).
Road use may impact Yosemite toad habitat through soil compaction or erosion and
vegetation displacement, leading to increased rates of siltation and drying of wet
meadows, contributing to the loss of breeding habitats for the Yosemite toad. The best
available information does not indicate whether ongoing road use and maintenance are
significant threats to the Yosemite toad. Where foot traffic or vehicle activity adjacent to
occupied meadows is more prevalent, erosion and channel incision could result. The U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service found that collectively, direct mortality from land uses
within the Yosemite toad range may have a population-level impact.
Critical Habitat
Critical habitat has been proposed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USDI 2013a) to
encompass large landscape areas which include current and past occurrences of SNYLF
or Yosemite toads. Critical habitat exists at a location if the primary constituent elements
for critical habitat occur, whether or not the species is present or absent at the location
(USDI 2013a). According to USDI (2013), the following actions and uses could
adversely modify critical habitat for the SNYLF or the Yosemite toad:
(1) Actions that significantly alter water chemistry or temperature.
Water chemistry can be affected by pollution from petroleum spills at the natural
crossings: Vehicles and motorcycles have the potential to leak or spill petroleum at the
stream crossings (without bridges), particularly on perennial crossings. If oil products
were to enter the river, they could affect aquatic life downstream.
88

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

(2) Actions that would significantly increase sediment deposition within the stream
channel, lake, or other aquatic feature, or disturb riparian foraging and dispersal
habitat.
Runoff from trail surfaces can be a source of sedimentation and stream turbidity that can
affect stream habitat where SNYLF or Yosemite toads reside. Regular use of motorized
trails can degrade stream banks at raw crossings, result in loss of plant cover, or cause an
increase in bare ground, soil compaction, and erosion. Changes in substrate morphology
can influence in-stream primary production and macroinvertebrate assemblages.
Additionally, fine-grained sediment may envelop eggmasses, affecting herpetofauna
reproduction. Routes that cause erosional features at stream courses may affect all life
stages within the vicinity of that travel route.
(3) Actions that would significantly alter channel or lake morphology, geometry, or
water availability.
Ruts and gullies in trails capture runoff and sediment and deliver concentrated flow to a
streamcourse, sometimes resulting in downcutting and alteration of channel morphology,
and affecting the SNYLF or Yosemite toad. These changes can result in alteration of wet
meadow or pond morphology, geometry, or inundation period degrading or eliminating
Yosemite toad habitat.
(4) Actions that significantly reduce or limit the availability of breeding or overwintering
aquatic habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog or Yosemite toad.
SNYLFs are affected by disturbance to aquatic or riparian terrestrial habitats. They
exhibit high habitat specificity, remaining in the same location year after year (USDA
Forest Service 2001). Disturbance of riparian foraging or upland dispersal habitat can
cause an increases in sediment deposition resulting from road or trail use in wet meadow
systems used by Yosemite toads or can disturb upland foraging and dispersal habitat for
this species. The disturbance or reduction of pools and shallow wetted areas within the
meadow or stream habitat may impact Yosemite toad breeding habitat.

Direct and Indirect Effects of the Alternatives
Effects of Alternative 1- Proposed Action
Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog
Routes that occurred above 4,500 feet in elevation and traveled next to wet features
and/or had wet stream crossings without functioning culverts, were considered to have
potential to influence streams or water bodies that may provide habitat for Sierra Nevada
yellow-legged frogs. Fourteen of the routes that would be immediately opened for public
motorized use in Alternative 1, had the potential to influence streams or water bodies
which may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Table 3.1). Sierra
Nevada yellow-legged frogs have been observed at stream habitat crossed by the
following two routes: 17E24 east and 17E28, both along the Bear River drainage.
Opening these two routes to motorized use could result in effects to frogs from increased
turbidity and sediment delivery to the stream, or the possibility of Sierra Nevada yellowlegged frogs being crushed by vehicles crossing at these locations. A survey for Sierra
Nevada yellow-legged frogs has not been completed on Route 16E26 (09N82), so
presence of SNYLF along this route remains unknown. As described in the Hydrology
section and shown in Table 3.2, these routes do not meet Standard and Guidelines #100,
and are therefore likely be contributing to indirect effects from erosional features
affecting meadows and associated aquatic habitat.
Visual encounter surveys indicate that frogs are absent in proximity to crossings along
the remaining 11 routes. Increases in stream turbidity, sediment deposition, or
disturbance to riparian vegetation may occur at raw stream crossings associated with
motorized use along these routes, but would be unlikely to affect currently occupied sites.
Proposed Critical Habitat:
Ten of the routes that would be designated immediately open for public motor vehicle use
in Alternative 1 occur (wholly or partially) within proposed critical habitat and could
affect the quality of SNYLF habitat (Table 3.2). Motor vehicle use on the 10 routes
shown in Table 3.2 that have mileage in proposed critical habitat and do not meet
Standard and Guideline #100, could adversely modify elements of critical habitat by
contributing to indirect effects from erosional features affecting meadows and associated
aquatic habitat. Routes 9N01, 9N08, 14N05, 14N39, 14N58, 16E21, 17E17, and 17E24

for public motor vehicle use in Alternative 1. These routes were found unlikely to
influence SNYLF habitat because the routes were not located next to wet features and all
wet stream crossings had functioning culverts.

wet meadows and including past occurrence records.

Yosemite Toad
Yosemite toads occur in habitat crossed by routes 09N01 and 19E01, both of which
would be designated open for public motor vehicle use in Alternative 1. Motorized use
on these two routes could crush Yosemite toads as they cross the road traveling between
dispersal habitats, especially after spring snowmelt. Yosemite toads may also occur in
habitat affected by the following un-surveyed routes that would be designated open for
public motor vehicle use: 16E26 and 17E24 (east). These routes traverse meadow
91

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

habitats where there is potential for vehicles to crush Yosemite toads (if present). Since
these routes do not meet Standard and Guideline #100, it is assumed that motorized use
on these routes could adversely modify proposed critical habitat. Adverse effects to the
hydrologic function of meadow habitat is likely to impact the suitability of reproductive
habitat for Yosemite toads at these sites.
Proposed Critical Habitat: Routes 09N01 and 19E01, which occur in areas proposed as
critical habitat for the Yosemite toad, would be designated open for public motor vehicle
use through a Forest Plan Amendment. Yosemite toads are known to occur in habitat
along both routes. Since Routes 09N01 and 19E01 were determined to be affecting
hydrologic function of meadows, motorized use on these routes may adversely modify
proposed critical habitat by altering wet meadow morphology and through changes in the
hydrologic function that would degrade Yosemite toad habitat.

Effects of Alternative 2 – No Action
Under the No Action alternative, the same portions of the 42 routes that were closed
under the court order would remain closed to public motor vehicle use. No designation of
route segments currently closed would be implemented, and Alternative 2 would result in
no direct effects to Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs, Yosemite toads or their proposed
critical habitats.
Indirect effects would still occur as Alternative 2 would not ensure corrective actions to
bring routes into compliance with Standard and Guideline #100. As described in the
section on Environmental Consequences – Hydrology, the presence of some roads or
92

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

trails, even without motorized use occurring, will continue to impact meadow and aquatic
habitat (though to a lesser degree), thus affecting habitat for these species.

Effects of Alternative 3 – Preferred Alternative
Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog
Six of the routes, or portions of routes, that would be immediately open for public
motorized use in Alternative 3 have the potential to affect stream segments or water
bodies that may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. Since each of
these routes meets Standard and Guidelines #100, as described in the Hydrology section
and shown in Table 3.2, they are unlikely to be impacting meadow habitat or contributing
to erosional features at meadows.
Visual encounter surveys indicate that frogs are absent in proximity to wet crossings
along these six routes. Erosional features affecting aquatic habitat were not identified
along these routes, and any increases in stream turbidity, sediment deposition, or
disturbance to riparian vegetation associated with motorized use would likely be
localized and limited to stream crossings.
Additional routes (or portions of routes) occur within habitat for the Sierra Nevada
yellow-legged frog, but would remain closed for public motor vehicle use until corrective
measures to the routes have been implemented, and the Forest Service has determined
that the routes are consistent with Standard and Guideline (S&G) #100. Future
environmental analysis would be completed during planning of corrective actions and
prior to the route being opened for public motorized use. Biological Assessment and
conferencing or consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would occur during
future analysis if it is determined that corrective actions or public motor vehicle use on
these routes may affect the Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog or its critical habitat.
Future corrective actions would have a positive effect on SNYLF by improving
hydrologic function in meadows or by routing use outside of sensitive meadow habitats.

Proposed Critical Habitat:
There are two routes (10N01B and 17E21) that occur within areas proposed as critical
habitat for the SNYLF and which have potential to influence SNYLF habitat at
unimproved wet crossings (Table 3.2). Only the east portion of route 10N01B, prior to
crossing a meadow, would be immediately open for motor vehicle use. Similarly, only
the west portion of route 17E24, prior to crossing a meadow would be open. These
portions, and the opened portion of route 17E21, meet Guideline #100 and no erosional
features were noted during field reviews of these routes. The portions of routes 10N01B,
17E24 and 17E21 that would be opened for motorized use in Alternative 3 would not
affect the quality of SNYLF habitat. Routes 14N05, 14N58, and 17E17 also occur in

in Alternative 3. These routes were found unlikely to influence SNYLF habitat because
the routes were not located next to wet features and all wet stream crossings had

Yosemite Toad
There are two routes that would be immediately opened for public motorized use, and
which are within suitable habitat for Yosemite toads: 10N01B (10N01) and 17E21. The
portion of route 10N01B (10N01) that would be opened under Alternative 3 does not
cross a meadow, and route 17E21 has been determined to not be affecting the hydrologic
function of a meadow. These routes were surveyed for Yosemite toads and toads were
absent from meadows and stream crossings along these routes.
Routes that would remain closed pending corrective action, would be evaluated and
conferencing or consultation with the USFWS would occur, if needed, prior to opening
the route for motor vehicle use. Future corrective actions would have a positive effect on
Yosemite toad by improving hydrologic function in meadows or by routing use outside of
sensitive meadow habitats.
Critical Habitat: None of the routes occurring within proposed critical habitat for the
Yosemite toad would be immediately opened for public motor vehicle use (Table 33.2b).
Routes 09N01 and 19E01, which occur in proposed critical habitat for the Yosemite toad,
would remain closed until corrective measures to the routes have been implemented and

the Forest Service has determined that the routes are consistent with Standard and
Guideline (S&G) #100. Biological Assessment would be prepared and conferencing or

being opened, if it is determined that corrective actions or public motorized use on these
routes may affect critical habitat for the Yosemite toad.

Effects of Alternative 4
Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged frog
Two of the routes that would be immediately open for motor vehicle use under
Alternative 4 --10N26 and 14N27-- have the potential to affect stream segments or water
bodies that may provide habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. These routes
were surveyed in 2012 and Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs were found to be absent.
As noted for Alternative 3, erosional features were not identified along these routes, and
any small increases in stream turbidity, sediment deposition, or disturbance to riparian
vegetation associated with motorized use would likely be limited to stream crossings and
would not affect currently occupied habitat.
As described for Alternative 3, routes that would remain closed pending corrective action
would be evaluated and conferencing or consultation with the USFWS would occur, if
needed, prior to opening the route for motorized use. Future corrective actions would
have a positive effect on SNYLF by improving hydrologic function in meadows or by
routing use outside of sensitive meadow habitats.
Proposed Critical Habitat: Route 14N05 is the only route that would be immediately
opened for public motorized use, which occurs in critical habitat proposed for the
SNYLF. Field review determined that there are no wet crossings along this route and it
would not impact SNYLF habitat.

95

Yosemite Toad
None of the routes that would be immediately opened for public motor vehicle use under
Alternative 4 occur within the range of the Yosemite toad. Alternative 4 would not
designate open any routes that occur within proposed critical habitat for the Yosemite
toad.
As described for Alternative 3, routes that would remain closed pending corrective
actions, would be evaluated and conferencing or consultation with the USFWS would
occur, if needed, prior to opening the route for motor vehicle use. Future corrective
actions would have a positive effect on Yosemite toad by improving hydrologic function
in meadows or by routing use outside of sensitive meadow habitats.

Effects of Alternative 5
Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog and Yosemite Toad
Alternative 5 would initially have the same effects upon Sierra Nevada yellow-legged
frogs and Yosemite toads as described for Alternative 1. Impacts occurring to meadows
in proposed critical habitat would continue until corrective actions are taken. Over five
years, improvements would occur in meadow habitats used by these species as
corrections are made to make routes compliant with Standard and Guideline 100.

low pressure tires, has handle-bar steering, is less than or equal to 50 inches in width, and
has a seat designed to be straddled by the operator.
Corrective Actions: Site specific actions to ensure proper hydrologic function of
meadows. Appropriate actions for each meadow will depend upon the reason the
hydrologic function is disrupted at that meadow. Examples of possible corrective actions
include reconstructing trails to improve, modify or restore effective drainage, repair or
replacement of road or trail drainage structures (culverts, rolling dips, water bars, etc),
installation of under-drains such as geotextiles or rock filled segments to allow
groundwater to flow past roads or trails, relocation of existing trails or trail segments
away from meadows, construction of puncheons or boardwalks to raise trails above the
meadow, and repair of damaged meadows through re-vegetation or stream channel
restoration projects.
Designated road, trail or area: A National Forest System (NFS) road, NFS trail, or an
area on NFS lands that is designated for motor vehicle use pursuant to 36 CFR part
212.51 on a motor vehicle use map (36 CFR 212.1).

Comments-paeificsouthwest-eldoradoft7jfs.fed.us
Dear Forest Supervisor Hardy:

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement
(DEIS) for the Travel Management Project. Of the four alternatives, Alternative 1 is the most preferable
to Alpine County. Three of our Alpine County roads fall into the category of the 18 routes that cross or
border at least one meadow that does not meet Standard and Guideline No. 100. Alternative 1 would
Amend the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (ENF LRMP) as amended
by the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment (SNFPA) Standard and Guideline No. 100(S&G 100) to
allow continued public motorized use on the 18 routes that Held surveys determined to not currently
meet S&G 100, and designate those routes for public use. This Alternative 1 would allow motorized
vehicle use while corrective measures are being developed.

The S&G was adopted for all new activities. Driving on these roads is not a new activity. As stated in
our letter to you on July 3, 2012. two of the three roads in Alpine County, Blue Lakes (09N01J and

Clover Valley/Deer Valley Trail (09N83) are part of a historical interconnected roadway that forms a
north-south link between Highway 88 and Highway 4. This roadway has been utilized for centuries.
even before Alpine County was formed, to navigate the Sierra Nevada Mountains and is designated as
an RS 2477 roadway. This roadway is a critical avenue connecting the only two east-west state
highways in Alpine County.

The S&G requires implementation of corrective action where necessary. The key phrase is "where
necessary". The SEIS needs to conduct an analysis by meadow to determine if road closure is a
necessary corrective action. The SEIS acknowledges in each of the alternatives that closure, by itself
will not provide corrective action and that adverse impacts will continue after closure until corrective
measures are implemented. In many cases, the road, not the use, is the primary obstruction. Some of
the meadows are affected by roads or trails that intercept and divert water from the meadow.
Withholding motorized use will not correct water diversion. While motorized traffic may cause some
impacts in some meadows, the burden of the analysis is to determine "necessity". The scoping

document used the term "substantial" to define necessity. The SEIS must assess whether motorized use
contributes measurably to the adverse flow of water to specific meadows. For many roads, perhaps all
roads, motorized use has little or no impact to the meadows.

The SEIS should also suggest some appropriate temporary mitigation measures it will consider on an
individual meadow by meadow basis. For example, where use does impact water flow, consider
mitigation measures that can be implemented until corrective actions can be completed such as wet-road
restrictions. Consider listing some standard control devices that can be employed for temporary relief,
such as rip-rap, erosion matting, and water bars.

We urge the Forest Service to reconsider adjustments to these alternatives to enable compliance with
S&G 100. We call your attention to the phrase •implement corrective actions'". It does not require
completion, but implementation. It is expected that implementation will occur over a number of years.
Proceeding along a schedule of corrective action elements could be considered implementation. The
most important direction from the SEIS is to begin implementation of corrective actions, not to
withdraw public use.

The County understands that the Court has placed the Forest Service in a role that is not of its choosinc
It is the Board's desire to work with you to improve the negative impacts on our County, its citizens and
visitors who are an important part of our local economy. We look forward to meeting with you at the
April 19th meeting in Amador County to discuss this further.
Respectfully,

Terr)- Woodrow

I support the plan with the least amount of closures and restrictions. I would also
encourage the forest service to keep trails open when problems are discovered and
continue to work with 4 x 4 groups and organizations to fix the problems.
Commenter: 15
Response: Alternative 1 provides for the least amount of closures and restrictions.
The forest intends to continue working with a variety of user groups to maintain
and improve routes across the forest.
We have a growing sport that needs a growing trail system. Please consider that families
that ride together stay together.
Commenter: 22
Response: The forest acknowledges the growing sport. The FSEIS states on page
64, “many users have established treasured family traditions of bringing the older
family members along on trips ...” The analysis in this FSEIS addresses only the
42 routes closed by the court.
The multipurpose use of our forestlands appears to be dwindling. With my access to the
outdoors being tied to my OHV (because of my physical limitations) any use of the
outdoors I lose further lowers my quality of life.
Commenter: 27
Please strive to keep all the historic routes open to motorized use. Those of us with
physical disabilities still love the outdoors and love to visit scenic and historical places
with our kids and grandkids but we CAN”T HIKE. Motorized access is all we can use
and we lose more of it every year.
Commenter: 43,
Response: The forest acknowledges the importance of motorized access. The
FSEIS stated on page 64, “High elevation trails provide access to remote areas on
the forest especially for older and less able individuals who might otherwise not
be able to enjoy these areas.”
Please re-open these and other new routes for off-road use. My kids and I would love to
vacation and ride in those areas.

Please keep the Eldorado forest open to the public for off roaders.
Commenter: 32
As most everyone knows and appreciates the Sierra Nevada Mountains offer many
opportunities to those who have “access” that are not found in many parts of the country
today. All of these routes have provided these opportunities for decades and have
undergone tremendous scrutiny over the last decade or so. I believe these areas CAN and
SHOULD be open to ALL access groups and the responsibility of cooperative
maintenance and management is an absolute MUST.
Commenter: 40
The previous FMTP (Alternative 1) that exempted the 42 routes from closure had already
reduced meadow routes to a minimum, was protecting the meadow resource, and meeting
LRMP standards and guides for public access. This level of meadow roading in
Alternative 1 represents the minimum required to meet S&G 4 and 5 of the LRMP by
public consensus.
Commenter: 232
Response: Alternative 1 provides for the least amount of closures and
restrictions. The analysis in this FSEIS addresses only the 42 routes closed by the
court.
I need you to know that ANY restriction to access effects my recreation.
Commenter: 39
Response: The Forest Service acknowledges impacts to user groups and
describes them in the FSEIS in the effects to public motor vehicle use.
These historic routes are the last way to see and enjoy the pure beauty of the ENF. The
closure of these routes will only increase traffic on routes elsewhere. Please restore these
routes to the responsible public as soon as possible.
Commenter: 48
Please keep our forests accessible to us and do not remove any of our trails we have. By
closing more areas you will make more impact on the areas that are open and we all lose.
Please keep and expand the access that we have to better manage the impacts on our
National Forest route system.

RTF is particularly disappointed that 16E21, 17E73, and 19E01 are to be closed until
mitigation is completed because their use is similar to that of the Rubicon Trail. RTF is
concerned that closure until mitigation of these trails will cause additional traffic on the
Trail, and no analysis of this consequence was made. This analysis should be completed
and any effects should be mitigated.
Commenter: 196
Response: A discussion of impacts from displaced traffic has been added to the
FSEIS on page 84.
Do the right thing! Keep all the trails open. If there is an issue, build a new trail around a
meadow. Maybe you already know this and it’s your strategy, the more trails closed, puts
more OHV'ers fewer trails creating more impacts on the land.
Commenter: 51
I want the public to have access to their own lands (meadows and beyond) and I want
roads with adverse impacts in meadows to be repaired.
Commenter: 232
Response: Alternative 1 provides for the least amount of closures and
restrictions. Alternatives 3 and 4 recognize the need for corrective actions which
may include reroutes around meadows. A site specific analysis for corrective
actions will be completed at a future date. A discussion of recreation impacts from
displaced traffic has been added to the FSEIS on page 84.
I urge you to reconsider closing them off to the public. Every time my family, friends and
I go we make a point to leave our campsites cleaner than we found them. We always
bring extra garbage bags to clean up other campsites along the way and also to pick up
cans thrown on the sides of the trail. Perhaps more posting of 'no littering' signs, more
Forest Service employees on duty to enforce rules in the area, heightening the cost of
tickets for littering or providing a few more bear-proof dumpsters along the trail could
help. There are hundreds of wheeling trails in our area, and it would be terrible if they all
got closed one-by-one because of human waste.
Maybe issuing articles with the problems that are caused on the trail will make people
understand how their actions can be detrimental to the surrounding area. I know I'm not
the only one who loves these trails, so I see it making a difference. There are many
alternatives to closing them down, we just need to explore them.

Response: The forest recognizes the contribution of user groups and individuals
efforts at keeping the forest clean. The FSEIS is focused on impacts to meadows
and compliance with S&G 100. Alternative means of addressing impacts to
hydrologic connectivity are discussed in the Hydrology effects section on page
54of the FSEIS.
I was extremely dismayed last year when due to another "lawsuit" that the Deer Valley
trail was shut down denying me and my family our yearly camping trip into this area. I
am writing to urge you to reopen these trails and not let environmental extremist sue their
way to closing all of our lands.
Commenter: 61
Response: Alternative 1 reopens the 42 routes including the Deer Valley trail.
However, the Forest Supervisor must consider the effects of damage to meadows
with the objective of minimizing those effects.
Let me give you one example of one of the 42 road closures that are taking away our
opportunities to enjoy our land – Deer Valley Trail. This trail connects from Blue Lakes
area off Highway 88 to Hermit Valley area on Highway 4. My family has made Blue
Lakes an annual camping spot for over 30 years. The Deer Valley Trail looks just as
beautiful today as it did 30 years ago. I understand the concern about meadows and
streams, but “really” is there a need to close this road? Why? I know if you put it out
there and said that if you didn’t want us driving our jeeps through the streams you would
get enough volunteers to make a bridge. There are many 4 wheel drive clubs with
wonderful families who join together for recreation and who would love to join together
for projects such as this. What a great way to work with the public instead of against us.
Let’s use all the interest generated from these unnecessary road and trail closures to bring
together the public and forest service to solve the issues. Remember that government is
by and for the people and should not be a bureaucratic brick wall that reasonable people
beat their heads against. I urge you to listen to reasonable suggestions such as this and to
carry our message forward in the spirit of collaboration.
Commenter: 62
Response: Alternative 1 reopens the 42 routes including the Deer Valley trail.
The FSEIS discussed impacts to meadows from continued motorized use (pages
52-53). Under Alternative 3, corrective actions would be implemented once site
specific analysis has been completed. The forest may work with volunteers to
complete the repairs when feasible. Alternative suggestions have been included
into the FSEIS. An additional alternative, Alternative 5, was brought
forward by many commenters and analyzed in detail.

You give us little to go on with these alternatives the idea of closing any of these routes is
immoral and unethical on all points. I support Alternative 1 since I have little choice in
the matter and strongly condemn 2, 3, and 4 with an overall condemnation of Alternative
3. Doing nothing is again immoral and unethical on the part of our government. You have
many supporters that will stand and volunteer to keep these routes safe and legal please
do not lose sight on us we care about out forest and we want these routes opened.
Commenter: 65
After careful review of the SEIS document, the N4WDA urges the acceptance of
Alternative 1 for the Record of Decision. Our members, although primarily residing in
Nevada, stand by, willing to help with mitigation of the issues on these trails.
Commenter: 142
Response: Alternative 1 provides for the least amount of closures and restrictions.
The forest intends to continue working with a variety of user groups to maintain
and improve routes across the forest including the implementation of corrective
actions on these routes.
We need to allow everyone to enjoy all that this great FREE world has to offer.
Promoting responsible use of our natural resources and allowing everyone to experience
what there is to be part of, not for the taking, is vital.
Commenter: 84
Response: The forest acknowledges the importance of motorized access.
The public has already seen wheeled motorized access to the ENF limited to just a small
fraction of what it was prior to the "2008 Public Wheeled Motorized Travel Management
Decision", and the closure of these routes means the loss of 90% of the remaining
motorcycle trails open to the public in the ENF above the 6000' elevation, and 53% of the
4-Wheel Drive trails above that elevation.
Commenter: 156
Response: The public motor vehicle use section of the FSEIS, page 77,
acknowledges that in Alternative 2, there would be a loss of access to motorcycle
and 4WD trails in the high country. The effects of alternative 2 and the other
alternatives are also displayed in Table 3.11 on page 80.
Alternative number one is the only option presented, from a motorized use perspective,
which would maintain an acceptable level of historic access to the last routes in what was
already a diminutive dysfunctional motorized forest transportation system. These high

Alternative 1

I support Alternative 1 as it opens the greatest amount of trail for public use in the
shortest amount of time.
Commenter: 3,
Response: Correct, Alternative 1 does open the greatest amount of trails for
public use.
I support Alternative 1. Re-open the 42 routes to motorized travel. I am hoping that if
Alternative 1 isn’t chosen that Alternative 3 is. It seems that trails that cross meadows
could be re-routed around them to minimize the impact of wheeled travel. Re-routing
these trails make more sense than closing them or trying to build and maintain a trail that
doesn’t impact the meadow.
Commenter: 9
Alternative 1 appears to be the best solution with Alternative 3 the next best solution.
Commenter: 16
Response: We acknowledge your support for Alternative #1. Alternatives 3 and 4
recognize the need for corrective actions which may include reroutes around
meadows. A site specific analysis for corrective actions would be completed at a
future date.
I support Alternative 1 to keep routes open. Closure to motorized trail riding will only
lessen State funding from the people who pay for maintenance. Closures will cause
California people to seek family spending money in other states for vacations.
Consequently then, less tax in spending, less funds for maintaining roads.
Commenter: 13
Deer Valley, Pardoe, Strawberry, Barret Lake just to name a few should NOT be
closed! Our family goes and runs these trails every year!! The economic impact alone
will be significant to the areas around these trails! The small towns in these areas rely on
recreation in the NF.
Commenter: 203
Response: This document is tiered to the 2008 Travel Management FEIS which

I support Alternative 1.

I strongly support Alternative 1 in the DSEIS. Most of the 42 routes addressed by the
DSEIS never impacted meadows and should never have been closed. The other routes
were justified by the Forest Service originally, and additional site specific analysis
apparently reinforced that. It will be more cost effective for the Forest Service in the long
run to challenge the plaintiffs now and defend the original TMP and subsequent site
specific analysis, rather than concede defeat and have the plaintiffs exploit the precedent
with future litigation. I strongly advocate the ENF adopt Alternative 1.
I am in favor of Alternative 1. Opening these routes would allow use by recreational
motorists now and the Forest Service can still prioritize exempt routes for future analysis
and propose implementation of corrective actions where necessary to restore hydrologic
connectivity. Unreasonable delay in opening routes due to lack of funding would be
eliminated.
Commenter: 10, 14, 23, 58, 92, 192, 195
I strongly support Alternative 1 of the SEIS, the “Proposed Action” that the Forest
Service came up with as a result of the site specific analysis that was completed on the 42
routes involved in this matter.
Commenter: 156,
Please consider Alternative #1 of the SDEIS, the “Proposed Action” for the currently
closed 42 routes. The other three alternatives that were developed during the scoping
process would degrade public access and recreation opportunities that have already
become severely limited. These routes have functioned without issues for many years as
documented in the previous analysis performed.
Commenter: 163,
I support Alternative 1 as proposed in October and do not support Alternative 3 with the
closure of 18 trails for planning and corrective actions. I also believe that Alternatives 2

We urge adoption of Alternative 1 and hope for a speedy reopening of these trails. The
closure of the ENF trails has caused a noticeable impact on the adjoining forests due to
the concentration of enthusiasts having to relocate for their recreation.
Commenter: 211
The OHMVR Commission encourages the adoption of the SEIS alternative that allows
the 42 routes to be reopened to public use as quickly as possible. Any recommended route
treatments should be combined with visual inspections by USFS staff to facilitate timelier
public access to these valuable recreational resources in the dry summer months.
Commenter: 218
BRC is appreciative of the efforts that you and your staff undertook in development of
the DSEIS. BRC believes it is critically important for the agency to restore access to
ALL of the “meadow routes” included in the DEIS’s Alternative 1. Those routes are an
integral and appropriate part of the minimally functional network of motorized trails
proposed for designation in the 2008 FEIS/ROD. Preceding the 2008 decision was a
“court-ordered” 2,340 miles of system routes with some of the additional existing and
long-travelled “unauthorized” routes designated for motorized use. Instead of validating
this court- approved reduction of historical access, Modified Alt. B further reduced the
motorized route mileage to approximately 1,800 miles. While this was the most accessfriendly of the alternatives, BRC continues to believe that all of the 2008 FEIS/ROD
alternatives were closure alternatives and substantially decreased the linear mileage of
roads and trails for continuing use.
Commenter: 217
The Merced Dirt Riders (MDR) support the Proposed Action Alternative 1 of the 42
Routes DSEIS. These 42 routes are very high value recreational roads and trails. The
MDR supports the amending of the Eldorado National Forest Land and Resource

motorized use on sections of routes affecting the hydro-logic connectivity of meadows on
18 of the 42 routes.

I then urge all of you to make action plan ONE as the decision on the course of action for
the trails of the ENF. As a member of the Blue Ribbon Coalition, Cal 4WD association
and Vice President of the Battle Born Cruisers of Northern Nevada, I would like to offer
any assistance and resources that I have to help facilitate these repairs as quickly as

Commenter: 46
Response: The Forest acknowledges your support of Alternative 1. The Forest
intends to continue working with a variety of user groups to maintain and improve
routes across the Forest including the implementation of corrective actions on
these routes.
I am in favor of Alternative 1 because it would immediately open the 42 routes that were
closed for no good reason and allow them to be used by motorized access which is what
was intended with the original Forest travel plan. These trails should have never been
closed in the first place and an amendment to the LRMP is the logical course of action for
correcting the matter. Please make sure trail 14N39 to Richardson Lake is included in
Alternative 1. This is a popular trail which I would like to see reopened.
Commenter: 91, 231
Response: Amending the LRMP to include 14N39 is proposed in Alternatives
1and 5. Road 14N39 Richardson lake is included in both alternatives.
Alternative 1 is the most preferable, but with reservations. We recommend a modified
alternative within the range of Alternatives 1, 2, and 3.
Commenter: 10
Response: We have modified Alternative 1 and created Alternative 5 based on
public comments. The full descriptions of these alternatives are included in
Chapter 2 of the FSEIS.
Reviewing the original DEIS and the ongoing EIS work and proposed alternatives, I am
glad to see the scope of the discussion being reduced to the subset of routes with actual
meadow impact. That said, reviewing the alternatives, I think the approach in Alternative
1 is preferable, with the following comments:
- open the currently closed routes
- identify the priority of mitigation of the remaining impacted routes
- spell out the precise work required on each route to bring them into compliance

- propose a schedule for mitigation
- engage with the various user groups to solicit work parties and assistance to bring the

Response: The Forest acknowledges your support for Alternative 1. A Strategy
for Planning Corrective Actions has been included in Appendix B. The Forest
intends to continue working with a variety of user groups to maintain and improve

Alternative 1, the ‘proposed action’ would reopen all 42 routes. It clearly does not align
with the Forest Service’s own ecological restoration goals, the Record of Decision, and
S&G 100.
Commenter: 221
Response: The Forest acknowledges your concern with the Proposed Action.
Four other alternatives were also developed and analyzed in this FSEIS.
We explicitly oppose Alternative 1 because it involves giving exceptions to S&G 100 for
certain routes. That would mean continued degradation of the lands and waters. It would
mean a degradation of the public values of the ENF, contrary to the laws that govern our
national forests.

Alternative 2

I oppose Alternatives 2 and 4 completely as the loss of these trails will not be recovered
thereby hurting all users.
I am not in favor of Alternative 2 as it would continue to close the 42 routes to motorized
access and prevent me from using many of my favorite trails in the Forest.
Commenter: 3, 91
I oppose Alternative 2. This “No Action” alternative permanent closure of the 42 routes
is completely unreasonable and meritless.
Commenter: 195
Alternative 2 would keep closed all portions of the 42 routes closed by the court order.
Without proposed mitigation for meadow damage by public motorized users, the
alternative does not align with Forest Service’s own ecological restoration goals, the
Record of Decision, and S&G 100. Since Alternative 4 does not recommend mitigation
for damage done by public motorized users, it should not be adopted as proposed.
Commenter: 221
Closing routes to motorized use does not achieve Standard and Guideline 100, as the
Draft SEIS acknowledges in several places. Therefore Alternative 2 does not meet the
requirements of Judge Karlton’s Order, nor by extension the ENF’s stated Purpose and
Need.
Commenter: 221, 225

2 are recognized, and a discussion of this may be found on pages 53 of the FSEIS.

Alternative 3

I oppose alternative 3 since the remediation work needed to re-open the trails will take
years to complete due to budget restraints.
I oppose Alternative 3. This alternative has the potential to result in permanent closure of
the routes in question under the guise of Forest Service project prioritization and lack of
funding.
Commenter: 3, 195,
I am not in favor of Alternative 3 as it does not open 18 of the 42 routes until the routes
are brought into compliance. This would require significant funding to implement and it
appears the Forest Service will have funding shortfalls for the foreseeable future which
would result in these trails being permanently closed.
Commenter: 91
I’m very concerned about the proposed alternative that the FS is considering as a final
conclusion regarding our NF in the Eldorado. My family and I recreate and use the
Eldorado NF every year and to even consider closing any roads is a travesty! I went to
the Jackson meeting and I was told that Alt 2 was going to be preferred which means that
18 of our most treasured trails will be closed until they are “fixed”. That can take
years!! We cannot stand for that! We have the man power and means to do whatever it is
that the FS needs to “fix” whatever the issues are right now, not over a period of years!
Commenter: 219
We are concerned that Alternative 3 (DEIS - preferred alternative) was developed late in
the process because the Forest anticipates likely opposition from anti-access special
interests who will attempt to read some substantive component into the Court’s order or
otherwise suggest that the law requires closure of any of the following routes: 09N01,
09N08, 09N82 (16E26), 09N83 (19E01), 09N95, 10N01, 0.5 miles of 10N13 (Schneider
Camp Road), 6.8 miles of 10N13 (17E73; Strawberry Cr. 4WD trail), 10N14,10N21,
(16E27; Long Canyon 4WD trail), 10N98, 11N23F (16E33), 11N26F (16E21; Barrett
4WD trail),11NY32, 14N39, 17E16, 17E19, 17E24, 17E28. As noted above, this type of
anticipatory negotiating against itself has never benefitted the agency, and BRC would
respectfully suggest the agency focus on doing what is right for the resource and the
majority of the trail-using public rather than trying to appease the perpetually disgruntled
minority.

On behalf of the members of the El Dorado Chapter of Trout Unlimited, we agree with
your preferred alternative, Alternative 3. Alternative 3 appears to best comply with the
basis for the court’s decision, the existing standards, is consistent with your specialist
recommendations and with good old common sense as that may apply to protection of the
fisheries. Alternative 3 best protects these meadows until the requisite repairs are
completed. The other alternatives would further degrade these meadows, decrease their
wetness and allow sediment to fill these meadows. We agree that there needs to be a
balance between recreation and preservation of the resources. Since the primary function
of the Forest Service is to protect our natural resources, we applaud your decision to
temporarily curtail motor vehicle usage in these areas until such time as the needed
repairs have been completed. To do otherwise would be to abandon your duties to
preserve this Forest.

If Alternative 3 is chosen it is really important to me as a summer resident at Silver Lake
to see Squaw Ridge, Mud Lake, Allen Camp, Caples to Strawberry and the Clover Valley
Highway trails open. These trails provide good rides, loops and destinations that the
smaller “deadend” trails don’t.
Commenter: 58
Response: Alternative 3 does not identify the order in which corrective actions
would be taken; however, the Forest is actively seeking funding to complete the
analysis for the corrective actions on the routes you have listed. Our Strategy for
Planning Corrective Actions is displayed in Appendix B of the FSEIS.
We support your approach and recommend that the FSEIS include the following
additional information and commitments:
•

Specify the criteria that will be used to prioritize route assessments and
implementation of corrective actions to bring routes into compliance with S&G
100.
• If, upon further study, the Forest Service determines that corrective actions to
bring routes into compliance with S&G 100 are not practicable as a result of
funding or other limitations, we recommend that those routes be physically closed
to public motorized use (e.g. with locked gates) and that mitigation measures be
implemented, to the extent practicable, to minimize continued degradation of the
resources at issue.
• If routes may remain closed for several years before assessment and corrective
actions will be completed, and if closure postings on those routes have been
ineffective in excluding motorized vehicles, we recommend that the Forest
Service consider using physical barriers in the interim before the routes are
reopened.

Response: The Forest acknowledges your concern with Alternative 3. As
explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS addresses the additional
information and analysis relative to the 42 specific routes, meadows, and Standard
and Guideline 100 in the Eldorado NF.
Alternative 3, the preferred alternative, would open the 24 routes deemed not to affect
meadows. It would keep ‘closed’ portions of the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100.
However, they would remain part of the National Forest Transportation System (NFTS).
They would be re-designated for public motorized use when the meadows become
compliant with S&G #100. We recommend the following changes to Alternative 3, the
preferred alternative:
1) The 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 should remain closed to public
motorized use after appropriate corrective action.
2) Identify a strategy for corrective action on these routes which includes
appropriately weighted ecological factors noted above.
3) Schedule future hydrological assessments of the 11 routes that currently meet
S&G #100 to ensure compliance with Riparian Conservation Objective.
4) Do a ‘needs’ analysis to determine if those 11 routes through meadows are
“needed for safe and efficient travel for administration, utilization and protection
of National Forest System lands.” This analysis should include all of the other
roads and trails in the system and the Forest Service’s inability to maintain them
now.
5) Based on the expanded needs assessment, “establish priorities and a time schedule
to decommission or close unneeded roads.”
6) Close Trail 17E21 and Route 10N32 for the reasons noted above.
7) Include Alternative 4’s closure of routes that affect other important resource
concerns.
Commenter: 221,
Response: Suggestion 1 from the commenter does not provide the reason for not
allowing motor vehicle use following implementation of corrective actions. The
effects analysis displayed for Alternative 4 is similar to Suggestion 1 for at least
some of the routes that do not meet S&G 100.
Response: A Strategy for Planning Corrective Actions for the 18 routes has been
included in Appendix B. While it does not specifically incorporate a rating for
ecological values of the meadows, it is assumed that all of the meadows are
important. It is likely that work planning and available funding will play a greater
role in scheduling of the planning for the corrective actions. The routes of greatest
ecological concern have already been included in grant applications and are being
built into the Forest Service program of work at this time.

Setting a schedule for completing future hydrological assessments of the 11 routes
that currently meet S&G #100 to ensure compliance with Riparian Conservation
Objectives, as suggested in Suggestion 3, is outside of the scope of this SEIS.
Completion of a travel analysis to determine the minimum road system, as in
Suggestion 4 is not required to complete the determination of whether to allow
public motor vehicle use of the 42 routes analyzed in this SEIS. Expanding the
analysis to include all other roads and trails in the system is beyond the Purpose
and Need for the SEIS. The Federal District Court decision of May 26, 2011
recognized that “the Forest Service’s decision not to first complete the [Travel
Management Rule] Subpart A analysis [before the Subpart B designation of roads
for public use] was neither arbitrary nor in violation of the procedures required by

Alternative 4

Adopt Alternative 4 as it offers the best balance between vehicle travel in the high
country and protection of fragile alpine habitat.
Commenter: 18
I have determined that Alternative 4 is the wisest option. Alternative 4 would
immediately open certain routes that don’t impact wetlands, and open others after
mitigation. It closes a handful of routes to OHVs that would impact meadows. These
routes are located in areas that not only adversely impact streams and other wetlands, but
also potentially harm wildlife species. Closed routes would be decommissioned, which
would provide an opportunity to restore wetland hydrology.
Alternative 4 provides balance between OHV use in the high country and the protection
of fragile alpine habitat. We are asking you to comply with all BMPs in the Forest
Service Water Quality Management Plan, not just RCO #100. While the SEIS re-visits
recreation issues, it must also include serious consideration of all resources issues.
Commenter: 120
I urge you to adopt Alternative 4; as it offers the best balance between vehicle travel in
the high country and protection of fragile alpine habitat. In addition, I believe it is
important to comply with all Best Management Practices in the Forest Service Water
Quality Management Plan, not just RCO #100; and please, as you consider recreation
issues, take into account all resource aspects, including ecology.
Commenter: 153
I am support of Alternative 4. I believe with the conservation groups that Alternative 4
makes the best balance vehicle use in the high country of the ENF and the protection of

revisit and take a thorough look at all resource issues. Recreation cannot just be singled
out.

Response: The Forest acknowledges your support for Alternative 4.
I am not in favor of Alternative 4 for reasons similar to number 3. I believe postponing
the decision to reopen a number of the trails into the future will only result in the
permanent closure of these trails. Plus I am not in favor of having 21 trails permanently
closed as proposed in this alternative.
Commenter: 91,
I oppose Alternative 4. This is a land grab beyond the court order and would likely result
in permanent closure of the routes in question under the guise of Forest Service project
prioritization and lack of funding. I can’t speculate on the mitigation for resources
concerns not directly related to S&G 100.
Commenter: 195,
Alt# 2 & 4 are not acceptable. The NO action alternative (#2) is as total closure is NOT
acceptable to the public and is unreasonable, which in turn may/will cause litigation. Alt
#4 opens some routes, but access to meadows – some in use that could be construed as
“prescriptive easements” by merit of historical use including pre-motorized, is also not
acceptable as an alternative. Please review 212.9 (5) and 212.55 (d) (1) (2)
Commenter: 228,
Response: The Forest acknowledges your opposition to Alternative 4.
Alternative 4 includes closure of 2.26 miles of 9N04 and 10N03. Neither route was listed
in the court order. Furthermore Alternative 4 would close .053 miles of 9N54 even though
it was found not to cross or border meadows. There is no supporting information in the
SEIS to justify closure of these routes. Because consideration of these routes is not
consistent with the Statement of Purpose and Need these routes should be removed from
the SEIS.
Alternative 4 lists seven routes where corrective measures would be implemented that are
not related to meadows and S&G #100 (page 49). The seven routes are: 08N23B, 08N35,
09N04 (17E79), 10N03, 10N32, 10NY06, and 12NY15. These routes either do not cross
or border meadows or meet S&G #100. Although mitigation may be indicated per the
project record these routes should be removed from consideration in the SEIS because
this is inconsistent with the Statement of Purpose and Need and outside the scope of the
document. Furthermore these routes were previously determined to meet designation
criteria in the Travel Management FEIS so the basis for requiring mitigation is
questionable.

[Routes] 14N58, 14N39, 10NY04, 17E12, 17E21 and the portions of 14N05 on the ALT
4 maps seem to indicate closure for no apparent reason. The maps and SDEIS clearly
identify locations previously shown as meadows, either as “not meadows” or are in
compliance with S&G 100. Simply closing this trail for any length of time is “arbitrary
and capricious”. Further, there is a significant conflict within the document that does not
allow the reader to coincide the condition of these roads with the ALT4 maps. “An ENF
LRMP Amendment is not required for these routes” is all it says in the description in ALT
3 and only refers to these routes on the map and the meadows indicated are “not
meadows” or comply with S&G100, yet they are listed as to be closed in ALT4. Allow
these roads and trails to remain open to public use while actively pursuing funding for
any needed corrective action. Actively recruit and utilize existing AAT volunteers to
begin immediate work to correct problem areas.
Commenter: 90, 198
Parts of Alternative 4 are outside the scope of this SEIS by designating all or parts of
the 24 compliant roads closed; some permanently and others until mitigated for impacts
not related to S&G # 100. It also permanently closes many of the 18 roads that do
impact meadows without considering potential correction measures. These road
closures are outside the scope of this SEIS and must be removed from consideration in
this Alternative.
Commenter: 101
Route 17E17 is proposed for closure in Alternative 4, yet this route borders only one
meadow that actually meets S&G 100 according to the field report. In particular closure
of this trail should not be included in Alternative 4 because no justification is provided
based on resource issues. This trail should remain open to public motorized use in all
action alternatives.

Of the four Alternatives the selfish side of me would be that all of the routes remain open
but I think the more sensible plan would be to close some until the mitigation work can
be done. There are three routes that I would encourage you to keep open while the work
is being done to protect the meadows is being accomplished. I traveled on these trails
very often and think they are extremely important to many people. The routes are Long
Canyon 16E27, Strawberry 17E73, and Clover/Deer Valley 19E01.
Commenter: 177
Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate routes until corrective actions could be completed. Long
Canyon 16E27, Strawberry 17E73, and Clover/Deer Valley 19E01were included
in that alternative.
We heartily support the closure of vehicle routes that cross meadows where traffic has
degraded their habitat function and ability to hold water into the summer season.
Restoration of the watershed values and natural meadow ecosystems should be the
highest priority. Vehicles should be allowed on such routes only where the Forest Service
has determined a route to be sustainable under Standard & Guideline 100 without
deterioration of meadow habitat function. We urge the Forest Service to implement fully
S&G 100.
Commenter: 183
Response: The Forest acknowledges your support of meadow restoration. Full
implementation of S&G 100 is incorporated into Alternatives 3 and 4. Corrective
actions for routes closed but not meeting S&G100 have been added to Alternative
4.
We urge the Forest Service to reconsider adjustments to these alternatives to enable
compliance with S&G 100. Proceeding along a schedule of corrective action elements
could be considered implementation.

We urge the Forest Service to reconsider adjustments to these alternatives to enable
compliance with S&G #100. We call your attention to the phrase "implement corrective
actions". It does not require completion, but implementation. It is expected that
implementation will occur over a number of years. The Forest Service should consider
actions on all elements of corrective actions as inclusive of implementation. For example,
proceeding along a schedule of corrective action elements could be considered
implementation. The schedule could include: pursue funding, develop partnerships,
evaluate the impacts caused by motorized use, prioritize meadows, install appropriate
temporary mitigation measures, conduct a NEPA analysis and complete corrective
actions. The most important direction from this SEIS is to begin implementation of
corrective actions, not withdraw public use.
Commenter: 101
Response: The above comments were considered with development of
Alternatives 1 and 5. Alternative 1 would open all of the 42 routes to public
motorized vehicle use, and does not require corrective actions to the 18 routes that
do not meet S&G #100 within any specific period of time. Alternative 5 would
open all of the 42 routes to public motorized vehicle use and gives the Forest
Service up to five years to implement corrective actions to the 18 routes that do
not currently meet S&G #100.

We wish to express our support of a hybrid alternative between alternative #1 and
alternative #3, the preferred alternative. This hybrid would include the following
elements:
•
•

•
•

•

These routes would be managed as open for motorized recreation.
Routes that have been identified to be in noncompliance would be opened with a
seasonal closure. This seasonal closure would be lifted, using a similar criterion to
what is currently used on the Barrett Lake Trail. A uniform set of standards would
have to be outlined so the Court and the public have a clear understanding of the
standards and guidelines that would be used to govern the seasonal closures.
Creation of a working group to oversee these routes.
Before these routes could be opened, an adopt-a-trail agreement must be in place
between a club or responsible organization that agrees to take the voluntary
leadership role in trail maintenance and mitigation efforts.
Any improvement, upgrade, maintenance, or mitigation that can be done within
the current footprint of the trail is done as rapidly as possible using a categorical
exemption.

Spring and late fall monitoring and photo documentation of the meadow areas
would take place annually so that adjustments may be made proactively.
Set schedule with mandatory completion dates for mitigation on these routes. Two
to five years depending on the route and the complexity of the mitigation. This
would create a sense of urgency, not only for the agency, but the OHV Division,
and most certainly the public.

Commenter: 203
BRC believes that a modified Alternative 3 will rightfully restore connectivity of the
skeleton route network proposed in the 2008 FEIS/ROD. Failure to designate these routes
could actually harm the physical environment by creating a motorized trail network of
insufficient size, scope, and diversity to meet the Forest’s purpose and need for public
access, as well as any common sense backbone transportation network sufficient to
satisfy and properly disperse public use of the Forest.
Commenter: 217
Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while
corrective actions are completed. This Alternative incorporates a mandatory
completion date for corrective actions. In addition, a Strategy for Planning for the
corrective actions is included in Appendix B. The proposal to implement a wet
route closure was considered and is discussed in the FSEIS on page 22 under
Alternatives considered but not analyzed in detail. The Forest intends to continue
working with a variety of user groups to maintain and improve routes across the
Forest including the implementation of corrective actions on these routes.
BRC suggests the affected routes are designated as open on an interim basis until the
final mitigations are implemented. They will be managed on that interim basis using a
hybrid wet-weather closure period that starts on November 29 and ends on April 1 or
when said routes are looked at on-the-ground by a Forest specialist and found to be in a
state that can support summer motorized wheeled travel.
Commenter: 217
A better solution would be to keep the roads closed until they are dry enough to cross
without aggravating the disturbed areas in the meadows. It has also been our experience
rather than to have a major project to repair the disturbed areas, performing corrective
maintenance will usually have a better, less intrusive effect.

Establish an interim wet weather/seasonal closure plan for the 42.4 miles of trails that do
not meet S&G 100 which would allow the trails to be part of the system. Conditionally
designate the trails open once the interim wet weather closure plan is adopted.
Commenter: 38
Response: The proposal to implement a wet route closure was considered and is
discussed in the FSEIS on page 22 under Alternatives considered but not analyzed
in detail, together with the reasons why.
Routes left open under non-significant plan amendments in the FEIS ROD include:
Roads: 09N01 09N04 09N82 09N83 10N01 10N13 10N14 10N21 10NY06 11N23F

NFS Trails: 17E12 17E17 17E19 17E21 17E24 17E51
There appears to be no good reason why the routes listed cannot remain open under a
non-significant Forest Plan amendment as described in the Proposed Action and the
FEIS/ROD.
Commenter: 199,
Response: All of these routes are proposed to be designated for public motorized
use under Alternatives 1 and 5, except 17E51 which was not designated for public
motorized use in the 2008 FEIS and ROD.
Alternatives 2 and 4 are completely invalid in the context of this SDEIS, and should be
removed, or substantially revised to adhere to all actual “Relocation” and/or
“Reconstruction” as required by BMP 4.7.1.
Commenter: 200,
The release of the DSEIS presented the public with two new alternatives that indicated a
drastic change in direction from the proposed action as presented in the Notice of Intent
(NOI). Instead of listening to the myriad of comments from supporters of the proposed
action in the NOI, the ENF chose to develop two very similar alternatives (#3 &#4) that
would affect motorized users of the forest with virtually the identical end result, the
closure of the most popular, high recreational value motorized roads and trails in the
Eldorado National Forest. But other than Alternative #1, the proposed action, there is no
alternative presented to the public that takes the high recreational values of these roads
and trails into account.
The motorized public is left with virtually no choice or alternative that suits their needs,
as the Forest states early in the DSEIS that they have suddenly changed direction and will
no longer consider issuing an LRMP to cover use on the roads and trails needing
Appendix E

25

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

mitigation, giving the public a very clear message that ‘Alternative #1 will not be
considered’. Whether those words are actually in writing or not, the message comes
across very clearly; but no other option or alternative is given to retain motorized use on
these highly valued routes!
The motorized enthusiast public is presented with an all or nothing scenario, with little in
the document as pertains to alternatives to support. This violates both the spirit and tenor
of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) per section 1505.1(e); “…a reasonable
number of examples, covering the full spectrum of alternatives, must be analyzed”.
There is nothing reasonable in presenting two virtually identical alternatives to the public,
and no options left for the motorized public to support. Therefore the Forest has violated
NEPA because of the lack of reasonable alternatives.
In short, the Forest has been extremely shortsighted in the development of the alternatives
in the DSEIS and ignored many of the precepts espoused by NEPA. There is also a
disservice that has been done to the public by ignoring the very real ramification likely to
be experienced by local residents, and the harm these closures will cause. All in all, there
is a paucity of analysis in the DSEIS that is represented by a lack of reasonable
alternatives for the public to consider. The ENF must remand this document to reevaluate
reasonable alternatives that identify all potential impacts, and offer the motorized
enthusiast public an alternative worth considering.
Commenter: 220,
The document does not provide an alternative that meshes with the facts provided. Many
possible and reasonable alternatives could have been developed for consideration, but
were not, suggesting that the end result of this process was pre-decided.
Because there is no legitimate justification to close trails, Alternative #1 is the only
marginally acceptable alternative, as it is closest to a true “no action” alternative.
Commenter: 229
Response: The NEPA regulations (40 cfr 1502.13 (D)) require the “No Action”
alternative be displayed and that the agency consider a reasonable range of
alternatives based on issues brought forward during the initial public scoping
period while meeting the Purpose and Need. Alternatives 3, and 4 were developed
in response to multiple comments received during scoping. Alternative 3 was
designed to open the routes after S&G 100 is met. Alternative 5, described on
page 21, in the FSEIS was developed to address comments received on the Draft
SEIS.
The 18 routes that the Forest Service acknowledges have damaged meadows should
receive special attention and future management consistent with the Leadership

Direction. Routes through damaged meadows should be decommissioned rather than
reconstructed. The 11 routes that cross meadows but do not currently affect hydrologic
connectivity should be periodically monitored for changes in condition and placed on a
time schedule for future decommissioning.
Commenter: 221
Response: As explained on page 2 of the Draft EIS in the Background
Information the 2008 Travel Management EIS and ROD designated Roads and
Trails to be open for public motor vehicle use in accordance with leadership
direction. Future monitoring for routes that cross meadows but do not currently
affect hydrologic connectivity is planned in the 2008 ENF TM FEIS Monitoring
Strategy. Decommissioning of routes is outside the scope of this SEIS.
The Draft SEIS has a major fatal flaw: The ENF was supposed to “rigorously determine
and evaluate all plausible alternatives.” Judge Karlton’s Order very specifically applies
to only the portions of the 42 routes that intersect meadows and do not meet Standard and
Guideline 100. This totals less than 5 miles of routes, and the ENF has had ample time to
examine these problem areas and propose mitigation measures. Yet none of the
Alternatives presented in the Draft SEIS suggest ways to bring these problem areas up to
Standard and Guideline 100, as required by Judge Karlton’s Order. Instead, the ENF has
proposed a blanket approach of closures to motorized use (Alternatives 2, 3 and 4) or
exceptions (Alternative 1) that do nothing to achieve Standard and Guideline 100. The
ENF has a very simple directive: Repair and/or reroute the less than 5 miles so that they
meet Standard and Guideline 100. Closures to motorized use do not achieve this
directive, as acknowledged in the Draft SEIS. The ENF needs to create a SEIS that
identifies mitigation measures so that the portions of routes in question meet Standard
and Guideline 100.
Commenter: 225
This order given by Judge Karlton is specific as to the analysis to be performed, but it is
also noteworthy for the language it does not contain. In no place in Judge Kalrton’s Final
Order, or any previous rulings, is it implied or otherwise stated that the end result of this
analysis would or should be the closure of any of these 42 routes. In fact the word
‘closure’ is not contained in the court order, other than the reference to the continuation of
a temporary closure previously mandated by the court.
CORVA can find no instance where the Forest has similarly been ordered to forgo
analysis on mitigation measures for any road or trail found to cross a meadow. The lack
of this analysis causes the Forest to fail to meet the oft-mentioned Riparian Conservation
Objective Standard and Guideline #100 (S&G100). In fact, CORVA contends that the
entire objective of S&G100 mandates an analysis of mitigation measures needed to bring
roads and trails into compliance.
Appendix E

27

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

As stated on page 4 of the DSEIS, the definition of S&G100 used in the course of this
analysis calls for the Forest to; “Maintain and restore the hydrologic connectivity of
streams, meadows, wetlands, and other special aquatic features by identifying roads and
trails that intercept, divert, or disrupt natural surface and subsurface water flow paths.
Implement corrective actions where necessary to restore connectivity.” The entire
structure and premise behind S&G100 is action-oriented; it recognizes that action should
be taken to “maintain and restore” connectivity, two actions that cannot take place on
their own. Furthermore it should be noted that S&G100 does not mention the concept of
closing these areas to motorized (or other forms of) travel. Rather it rightly recognizes the
need for on-the-ground work to “implement corrective actions”. If closure had been a
proper course of action, those words could have been included in the definition of
S&G100 when it was written, but no words of this nature were included.
Commenter: 220, 223
As shown through the entire DSEIS, the ENF conducted an on-site analysis of each one
of these trails but fell woefully short of meeting requirements contained in S&G100, and
also failed to meet the intent behind Judge Karlton’s order. The analysis to bring any of
the roads and trails needed into compliance was not addressed, analyzed or even
considered. Therefore, this document must be remanded and an analysis performed that
brings the Forest into compliance both with the court order and S&G100.
Commenter: 220
The concerns raised along these routes via their intersection with our proximity to a
meadow will not end with any form of vehicle travel limitations. The routes will continue
to exist, the hydrological concerns will not be addressed, and no improvement in water
quality or meadow health can be expected. It is the presence of water, not vehicles, that is
the concern. To punish today’s visitors for concerns about historic placement of these
routes is simply not good public policy. It would appear that the three bars that must be
met in this planning document are 1) no irreversible damage, 2) limiting wet condition
wheeled travel, and 3) no adverse modification.
Commenter: 203
Response: As described in the background section on pages 3 and 4, the Court
order prohibited public wheeled motorized vehicle use on the 42 routes until such
time as the Forest Service completes a SEIS. Alternatives 3, 4 and 5 were
developed in response to comments and include the requirement for corrective
actions to be analyzed and implemented in a separate NEPA analysis. The analysis
for the corrective actions would require additional engineering and design work.
The Forest has developed a strategy to prioritize this work that is included in
Appendix B of this document.

I believe that the expeditious opening of all 42 trails is imperative. There are so many
responsible people who are being adversely affected by these trail closures as the
analyses are being conducted by the USFS. Please reconsider the opening of these trails
while a suitable plan can be set in place to address the issues at hand. Time is of the
essence.
Commenter: 227
Response: Alternative 5, described on page 21, was developed and added into the
FSEIS to address comments received on the Draft SEIS.
I contend this SEIS is inadequate because the Forest failed to “rigorously determine and
evaluate all plausible alternatives”. This failure occurred at two tiers in the decision
process of this supplemental EIS. First tier: The Court gave the Forest the option to
adhere to or amend “riparian conservation objectives” of the SNFPA (Order (Dkt. #76) at
58-63). In plain language, Judge Lawrence Karlton gave the Forest Service two (2)
viable alternatives to resolve the 42 Route issue: A) amend the SNFPA “no roads shall
cross or bisect meadow: rule or B) change the Forest Travel Management Plan to adhere
to the Forest “no meadow road” rule. In the eyes of the Court amending the “no meadow
road” rule was a very plausible alternative. An EIS alternative of amending the Forest “no
meadow road” rule was not presented to the public in the SEIS. The Forest chose only
to present one of the Judges alternatives to the public: to modify the former FMTP to
adhere to the “no road rule”. The Forest must provide plausible alternatives for
consideration.
Commenter: 232,
There is environmental case law that indicates the “no meadow road “rule is illegal when
applied in multiple use management areas. As applied the “no meadow road rule” closes
wheeled access to, across and beyond the meadows. A previous “no road” rule was found
to limit certain uses and development activities such as road construction and timber
management”. This component of the previous 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule
(roadless rule) was found to violate the Wilderness Act of 1964 (2003, U.S. District Court
for the District of Wyoming).
Commenter: 232,
Response: The 2004 Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment, Record of Decision
does not prohibit roads and trails through meadows, but rather requires that roads
and trails through meadows meet the Riparian Conservation Objectives (RCOs)
and associated Standards & Guidelines (S&Gs). This SEIS focuses on S&G
#100 in order to meet the requirements of the following Court Order: Case No.
2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District Court, Eastern District of

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

California, filed 7/31/12). An analysis of the Wilderness Act of 1964 and other
environmental case law is beyond the scope of analysis of this SEIS.
The “routes may not intersect or bisect meadows” consistency criteria (sometimes
referred to as the “no meadow road” rule) that was as the grounds for road closure is
entirely an Eldorado National Forest construct and is not a SNFPA RCO standard and
guide (s&g) nor is it part of the LRMP.
Commenter: 232,
The Statement in the Supplemental EIS that the judge found 42 roads in error with the
SNFPA is at best a half truth. After the Forest chose not to amend its own “no meadow
road” rule that the judge was required to find the 42 routes to be in error of the Forest
Plan. To state the Judge found the 42 Routes in error of the SNFPA is misleading and
amounts to placing side-bars on the plausible SEIS alternatives to be considered by the
public.
Commenter: 232,
Nowhere in the SNFPA or the 2004 ROD does it recommend or suggest the unilateral
closure of all roads in meadows as a response to RCO#2 or Rule #100. The
administrative flexibility built into the S&G’s under ROC#2 are not carried forward into
the Forest’s “no meadow road” consistency criteria-Why?
The change in flexibility from the draft consistency criteria that was congruent with the
other S&C’s in ROC#2 to the “no meadow road” extreme position needs to be explained.
Commenter: 232,
The RCO#2 and Rule #100 were both written in an effort to protect the meadow resource.
The Forest “no meadow road” rule was written based on” potential adverse impacts” by
keeping meadow roads open. Nowhere has there been a corresponding assessment of
adverse impacts to the meadow resulting from road closure?
Commenter: 232
Response: As described in the background section on pages 3 and 4,, the Court
order prohibited public wheeled motorized vehicle use on the 42 routes until such
time as the Forest Service Completes a SEIS. As described on page 2 of this SEIS,
the Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment replaced the ENF LRMP Standard and
Guideline that restricted routes through meadows. There is not a “no meadow
road rule”. Alternatives 1 and 5 of this FSEIS do propose a LRMP amendment as
suggested.

The SEIS deals solely with the 42 Routes, but solutions to recreation-use/ riparian
restoration conflicts may be found in adjacent Forest routes with or without meadow
occurrence.
By court order this EIS deals solely with the 42 closed roads, but it does not preclude the
Forest from looking outside the 42 routes in determining alternatives. There are
opportunities for recreation vehicle use on other previously closed meadow routes (those
without adverse road impacts) as substitutes for any of the 42 routes that are required to
be closed.
Commenter: 232
A plausible EIS alternative would be to substitute previously closed roaded meadows
routes (no meadows present or no adverse impacts) for any of the 42 routes with adverse
roading impacts. This process would allow the Forest to maintain the appropriate level of
high country recreation vehicle use as required by LRMP S&G 4 & 5. In fact the
substitution process for closed roads has been in place since the LRMP of 1989 (Page 219).
Commenter: 232
Response: In an effort to expedite the analysis and decision, this SEIS focuses on
just these 42 routes. As described in the 2008 TM FEIS, at any future time the
Forest could look at other routes for public motorized use.
You must immediately open all of the 42 routes that were closed, (subject to normal
seasonal closures). The court order has been satisfied. The 14 routes that do not cross of
border meadows need to be opened up immediately; (subject to normal seasonal
closures). These routes are listed in Table 3.9
The 10 routes that cross or border meadows AND MEET S&G 100 need to be opened up
immediately, (subject to normal seasonal closures). The 18 routes that cross or border at
least one meadow and do not meet S&G 100 need to be re-opened by including a Forest
Plan Amendment that will provide an exception to S&G 100. The DSEIS identified those
routes as being "rated high in recreational value". Too many high elevation routes were
closed with the TMFEIS. Any more closures would be detrimental to the human
environment. The DSEIS states that the action must achieve the purpose of "providing a
diversity of wheeled motorized recreation opportunities". This cannot be achieved if these
18 routes are closed. The DSEIS states, (pg 55), that closing the routes does not correct
the reason(s) that the route does not meet S&G 100. The routes should remain open while
corrective measures are being done. The DSEIS states, (pg 71) that up to 11.2 miles of
routes will be lost if these 18 routes remain closed which is un-acceptable. There has
been too much route loss already.

Response: As described in the background section on pages 3 and 4,, the Court
order prohibited public wheeled motorized vehicle use on the 42 routes until such
time as the Forest Service Completes a SEIS. Alternatives 1 and 5 would result in
all routes in this SEIS being opened.
While the Preferred Alternative (Alternative 3) is more acceptable than the Proposed
Action (Alternative 1), we believe it would still result in significant impacts on the
human environment, violate several Best Management Practices of Off Highway Vehicles
as prescribed in the Water Quality Management Handbook; and would violate the criteria
for minimization as outlined in Executive Orders 11644 and 11989 and the Travel Rule.
The Forest Service has made no attempt to minimize impacts from these route
designations, much less to even disclose the full impacts from the proposal. This must be
remedied before a final EIS and decision is produced.
Commenter: 204
Response: The discussion of effects of Alternative 3 in the Hydrology section has been
expanded in relation to Best Management Practices and minimization criteria. See pages
51 – 52.
Alternative 4 strikes a balance between immediately opening many routes to motorized
travel while requiring mitigation before others are opened, and permanently closing
routes with impacts to resources that cannot be mitigated, or that would require
unrealistically expensive mitigation, such as total relocation. We urge you to adopt
Alternative 4, including the restoration of all closed routes.
Commenter: 204
The only management action to restore meadows mentioned in the SEIS is road closure. I
would hope this is not an assumption that road closure is the optimum approach to
conserving meadow resources. Meadow restoration will occur faster through active
restoration efforts rather than passive long-term protection (Stevens and others 1991).
Commenter: 232
Response: We acknowledge your support for Alternative 4 as well as the desire to see
restoration of closed routes included in that alternative. As indicated on page 22 of the
FSEIS, an alternative which included closure and rehabilitation of some routes was
considered but eliminated from detailed study since closure is beyond the scope of this
analysis. The description of Alternative 4 has been modified in the FSEIS in response to
your comments to include corrective actions for all routes that do not meet S&G #100.

Analysis

The TM DSEIS provides extensive hydrological analysis and a re-analysis of recreation;
however, it does not provide a re-analysis of other resource areas, nor does it address
compliance with the 2012 OHV Best Management Practices.
Commenter: 147
Response: As explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS addresses only
the additional information and analysis relative to the 42 specific routes,
meadows, and Standard and Guideline #100 in the Eldorado NF. This document
is tiered to the 2008 TM FEIS and ROD. A discussion of Best Management
Practices has been added to the Hydrology section.
There is a lack of discussion in the TMDSEIS and the TM EIS (2008) on the amount of
vehicle use a road will receive when it is open to public use during periods when the soils
will be saturated, the time when rutting or other damage to meadow roads is most likely
to occur.
Commenter: 147
Response: The amount of vehicle use is one of many factors that influences
whether the Standard & Guideline #100 is met with regard to meadows. The
evaluation criteria used to determine compliance with S&G #100, described in
Table 3.5 of the FSEIS, reflects all of these factors. Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 are
intended to bring routes into compliance with S&G #100, regardless of the
amount of vehicle use.
The rationale for providing high elevation recreational opportunity to accommodate use
displaced from the Caples Creek area should remain in effect as stated in the FEIS/ROD.
This alone is sufficient justification for the non-significant Forest Plan Amendment that
would leave high country routes such as 17E24 open to public motorized use.
Commenter: 199
The SEIS provides an inadequate range of alternatives. All action alternatives, with the
exception of the Proposed Action would close over 90% of high elevation motorcycle
trails. This would provide inadequate diversity of recreational opportunity to be
consistent with the NFMA, the Travel Management Decision and the Forest Plan.
Commenter: 199
Response: The Forest acknowledges the importance of high elevation motor
vehicle recreation opportunities. This is addressed in the public use section,
Appendix E

33

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

beginning on page 64. Alternatives 1 and 5 allow use immediately on these routes.
Alternatives 3 and 4 propose corrective actions that would enable all or some of
these routes to be opened.
Some route numbers have old (“N”) and new (“E”) designation numbers. To avoid
confusion in the document, all routes with new should be listed with both the old and new
designations at every point where they appear, and with a consistent old (new) or
new(old) format.
Commenter 200,
Response: Route numbering is explained on page 3 and in Appendix A. To avoid
potential confusion, the FSEIS has been modified to list routes that have been
changed to trails with the trail number first, followed by the road number in
parentheses. This same format is used on the maps.
NEPA requires alternatives to propose, plan and schedule actual specific mitigation work.
NEPA regulation 1502.14 “Alternatives including the proposed action” states in
paragraph (f) to:
“Include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or
alternatives.”
For example, on Page iv of the Draft SEIS: “Mitigation would be proposed and analyzed
as part of future NEPA analyses, as funding to implement corrective actions become
available.” This is not acceptable. And on Page 9: “It would likely take a number of
years for Alternatives 3 or 4 to result in all routes meeting S&G #100.” Also this is not
acceptable, especially in terms of the length of time estimates.
Commenter: 200
The SEIS states that corrective measures were not analyzed, yet analysis of corrective
actions is an essential part of S&G 100. A complete analysis needs to be completed to
determine compliance with S&G 100.
Commenter: 201
Response: The analysis for the corrective actions would require additional
engineering and design work. The Forest has developed a strategy to prioritize
this work that is included in Appendix B of this document. In an effort to expedite
the analysis and decision, the analysis for corrective actions will occur in
subsequent decisions.
The EIS shall also include not only the loss of recreational values of the routes cited in
the SDEIS, but also the potential loss of local economic activity, which includes:
Appendix E

Loss of economic activity at local businesses involved with public recreation, such as
those associated with lodging, fuel, food and supplies, local and state and National Forest
campground use.
Loss of consistent and/or renewed employment of federal and state officials (local law
enforcement, Forest route planning and re-construction).
Commenter: 200
The economic and recreational values have not been analyzed in the SEIS for the El
Dorado Forest Trails. The impact to the local business owners and local economy will be
devastating if this route [Deer Valley Trail] is not reopened immediately.
Commenter: 201
The OHMVR is concerned that the OHV route closures could continue into the 2013
months. The economy of many northern California rural communities depends on the
summer recreationists that visit the high value recreational OHV routes being affected by
the closure. Many of the closed OHV routes have benefited from funding from the
OHMVR Division Grants and Cooperative Agreements Program, a program contingent
upon public motorized recreational access.

No analysis is offered as to the effects of leaving these trails closed for such an extended
period of time. Before closing such historic routes, the effect on the user community,
overflow to other recreational areas, economic effect on the local community,
deterioration of routes and drainage/erosion due to lack of maintenance must be
considered. It is clear that these standards are intended as guidance, to be used wisely and
appropriately, not arbitrarily or absolutely, without other considerations.
Commenter: 229
Response: The socioeconomic analysis in the 2008 ENF TM FEIS recognized the
importance of these routes to the local economy and did not need to be
supplemented.
The court order was to amend the forest plan to allow these routes to cross meadows or to
bring the 42 routes into compliance not just the 24 addressed in this SEIS. What
changed? In the preferred alternative they are only reopening the trails which do not have
meadows or that meet S&G 100. They have not identified with science why the 10 routes
said to meet S and G #100 will be reopened or why the 18 high recreation value routes
above 6,000 feet to not meet S and G #100. In other words the Forest has decided to skirt
the whole court order by only partially addressing the order.

Commenter: 202
Response: As described in the Background section on pages 2 - 4, the Court order
prohibited public wheeled motorized vehicle use on the 42 routes until such time
as the Forest Service Completes an SEIS. Field surveys were conducted along the
routes and a complete description of the definitions, methodology and meadow
survey results are described on pages 37-49 of the FSEIS. The FSEIS does
address all 42 routes as displayed in Tables 3.4 and 3.5, and on the four page
Table 2.2, Comparison of Alternatives found on pages 24 - 27 .
Without further scientific study than what has been done the conclusion as to whether or
not a road is adversely affecting the meadows health cannot be made.
The Forest’s S& G #100 rule is meant for all roads and trails and not just specific to OHV
routes, therefore the Forest should be considering all of the roads and trails in the Forest
motorized and non-motorized and regardless of tread surface to assess their overall effect
on meadow health. There are many paved roads within the Forest that intersect meadows
and play a much larger role in meadow health than the 4.8 miles of roads that cross or
border meadows within the 42 OHV routes in question. There are many more hiking
trails which cross or border meadows which are not considered under this guideline.
Commenter: 202
We have noted that the Forest Service has omitted an important discussion in this
analysis. There is no "scale of effects" analysis. That is, the affected land base is such
a minute portion of Management Areas 28 (meadows) that the outcome of any alternative
will be of negligible impact. However, the closures do interrupt the connectivity of the
routes and/or deny public access to various natural amenities.
The Forest Service also omits any historical data. We don't know how much these sites
change over time. The Forest service does not inform reviewers about how much or
how rapidly they have changed, or if the sites have changed at all. It could be that the
situation at many sites is completely static, that is, the effect occurred long ago and since
that initial change there has been no further change. In this case, there is cumulative
impact only because all the sites are added together. Then arises the difficulties of how
small these sites actually are, and what the scale of the effects actually are--hence we
need the scale of effects analysis. Without a scale-of-effects analysis, a Decision to
keep them closed is not legitimately well-reasoned.
Commenter: 214
The DSEIS does not consider other uses the affect the Hydrology of the Meadows. There
are other uses that can affect Hydrology of the Meadows, such as hiking, Mountain Bikes

and Cattle Grazing. If the trails a closed to motorized use the trails will still exist and the
Hydrology will still be affected, this will do nothing to improve the meadows.
Commenter: 223
Response: As explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS addresses the
additional information and analysis relative to the 42 specific routes, meadows,
and Standard and Guideline #100 in the Eldorado NF. This document is tiered to
the 2008 TM FEIS and ROD. Analysis of other routes on the Forest is beyond the
scope of this SEIS.
The closure of any of these 42 routes could displace this use into areas unsuitable or
unauthorized for such activities. The virtual elimination of a high percentage of technical
four-wheel-drive routes in the El Dorado for an unknown period of time is both
counterintuitive and counterproductive to forest wide travel management. The proposed
temporary restrictions in the preferred alternative would have negative impacts to the
economies of the gateway communities of the El Dorado.
Commenter: 203
Response: A discussion of displaced use has been added to the Public Use section
of this FSEIS. The socioeconomic analysis in the 2008 ENF TM FEIS recognized
the importance of these routes to the local economy and did not need to be
supplemented.
In many places in the DSEIS, the ENF mentions the high recreational value of the trails
proposed for closure in the preferred alternative, yet there is no analysis to determine if
the high value of those trails warrants leaving either some or all of those trails open while
analysis and mitigation work is ongoing.
Commenter: 220
Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while
corrective actions are completed.
In the Forest Service’s public meeting in Jackson, a strategy for developing a plan of
corrective action for the 18 routes that do not meet S & G #100 was displayed. The
strategy was limited to only two factors: the relative ease of corrective action and the
level of recreational value. The Forest Service should also consider additional factors,
including the potential ecological value of the meadow and its importance to habitat
connectivity. Ecologically-based factors should also be given more weight than the
factor of recreational value, as the routes are clearly not necessary to ‘protect National
Forest Service lands’ given the damage done to meadows. The final SEIS should include
Appendix E

37

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

a revised plan which not only incorporates, but gives appropriate weight to ecologicallybased factors.
Commenter: 221
Response: A modified version of the Strategy for Planning Corrective Actions for
the 18 routes has been included in Appendix B. While it does not specifically
incorporate a rating for ecological values of the meadows, it is assumed that all of
the meadows are important. It is likely that work planning and available funding
will play a greater role in scheduling of the planning for the corrective actions.
The routes of greatest ecological concern have already been included in grant
applications and are being built into the Forest Service program of work at this
time.
The end result of the analysis in regards to compliance with S&G 100, (per the Forest’s
own definition of that guideline), is that the ENF failed to comply with two out of the
four requirements of S&G100, therefore the Eldorado National Forest has failed to
comply with the Purpose and Need as defined in both the Notice of Intent and the Draft
Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. Please remand this document and
continue the analysis until compliance is achieved with all 4 actions required by S&G
100.
Commenter: 220
Response: The purpose and need for Action is stated on page 5 of this FSEIS. As
described, the purpose of this analysis is to complete a SEIS to reconsider
designation of the 42 routes and to determine whether public wheeled motor
vehicle use will be allowed on the 42 routes. A range of alternatives was
developed to address the Purpose and Need and significant issues brought forward
by the public.
The attempt to provide public input was discouraged in the summary of comments from
the scoping document for this SEIS. Forest response-- determining the legality of the “no
meadow road” rule was outside this SEIS. As the Forest’s rationale for the “no meadow
road” rule appears flawed and there is no desire for discussion perhaps the public can
appeal to the Region for clarification or their Congressional representatives.
Commenter: 232
Response: The Forest considered all public comments received during the
scoping period. The comments and consideration are documented in the project
record.

The SEIS analysis is improperly narrow in scope; it limits its hydrological analysis to a
single RCO Standard and Guideline, then narrows that S&G to a single resource,
meadows, while ignoring other known and potential impacts to wetlands and wildlife.
Commenter: 204
Response: The SEIS analysis is intentionally narrow in scope. As explained on
page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS addresses the additional information and
analysis relative to the 42 specific routes, meadows, and Standard and Guideline
#100 in the Eldorado NF. This document is tiered to the 2008 TM FEIS and ROD
which addressed impacts to wildlife and hydrologic resources.
Chapter 3 describes the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives on
Recreation and hydrology. In choosing to analyze recreation impacts, the DSEIS opens
the door to analyzing more than hydrological impacts to meadows and cannot (and
should not) attempt to close the door to analyzing impacts of these routes on other
resources. Therefore, all impacts from the designated routes must be fully evaluated and
disclosed to the public in order to comply with NEPA.
Commenter: 204
It is already documented that the trails proposed for prolonged closure in Alternative #3,
the preferred alternative, are among the most highly enjoyed and valued trails in the
Forest. To close these roads without completing the Demand Analysis sells the recreation
community short by eliminating the information that would sway the balance between
recreational and ecological needs more in their favor. Closure of these trails is arbitrary at
best.
Commenter: 220
Response: As explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS addresses only
the additional information and analysis relative to the 42 specific routes,
meadows, and Standard and Guideline #100 in the Eldorado NF. The recreation
effects section has been modified in the FSEIS to reflect that it is a discussion
only of public use of the 42 routes, not a full discussion of recreation impacts.
The DSEIS attempts to rely on an inadequate Cumulative Effects Analysis (CEA) in the
TM EIS. The DSEIS refers to the reader to the March 2008 TM EIS for Cumulative
Effects Analysis. However, it has already been demonstrated that the GIS data on which
the earlier effects analysis was based on was incomplete and inaccurate; therefore, this
SEIS cannot rely on that earlier analysis.
In addition to the mis-identification of meadows, the GIS data did not identify other
impacts to riparian resources, such as sediment at stream crossings and roads in alder
Appendix E

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

wetlands, both of which violate BMPs in the Water Quality Management Handbook.
These impacts must now be disclosed and analyzed in the SEIS.
Commenter: 204
Response: The only error the court found in relation to the 2008 EIS had to do
with meadows. Field surveys were conducted in 2011 and 2012 in support of this
SEIS. Analysis in the SEIS relies on the field surveys and not the GIS data. The
meadow analysis relies on the field surveys and not the GIS data.
As explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS addresses the additional information
and analysis relative to the 42 specific routes, meadows, and Standard and Guideline
#100 in the Eldorado NF. A complete discussion of other resources and effects, including
cumulative effects is found in the 2008 EIS.
The SEIS must explain the discrepancies between the findings in the field surveys, as
described in the draft Hydrology report (10-24-12) and the DSEIS.
Commenter: 204
Response: The draft Hydrology report referred to here was not yet complete. The
completed report is included in the SEIS. There were two reasons the numbers
changed slightly. The first is that we eliminated meadows on private land. The
second is that several routes were reevaluated in the field during the summer of
2012 and the survey forms modified to reflect new findings to the existing
conditions.
The DSEIS fails to consider impacts to meadows impacted by the roads that are not under
FS ownership. The RCO #2, S&G 100 does not exclude meadows on non-federal lands
through which Forest Service roads pass. Impact to non-Forest Service meadows should
have also been included in the effects analysis and in the cumulative effects analysis.
Commenter: 204
Response: Forest Service Land and Resource Management Plan Standards and
Guidelines apply only to National Forest System lands.
The DSEIS ignores violations of the 2012 Water Quality Management Handbook’s Best
Management Practices (BMPs) and fails to disclose, analyze or mitigate impacts to
aquatic and riparian resources found by the 2012 monitoring surveys. Although an
agency may have filed a final EIS, it is under “a continuing duty to gather and evaluate
new information relevant to the environmental impact of its action. The Forest Service
was provided extensive and detailed descriptions and photos of route conditions in
November 2011. The Declaration and photos show clear violations of many RCOs and
BMPs. The Forest Service may not ignore this evidence.
Appendix E

The protocol excluded important information about routes that were determined not to
bisect meadows, even though there are obvious other problems with some of those routes,
including violations of Best Management Practices, RCO Standards and Guidelines and
the Endangered Species Act. CSNC has several times reported finding Yellow-legged
frogs on one motorcycle route (17E28); rather than have the Forest’s Fisheries of wildlife
specialists do amphibian surveys to protocol, the Field Survey Form includes only
“incidental sightings.”
The DSEIS fails to analyze known site-specific impacts to riparian resources and
wildlife. The original 2008 TM EIS was based on what the FS now admits were seriously
flawed data. Site –specific information related to presence/absence of aquatic and
aquatic-dependent species (eg fish and herpetofauna such as the Sierra Nevada yellowlegged frog that is listed by the State of California as threatened) was scant.
Commenter: 204
There are no environmental justifications provided for closing 18 trails that do not meet
S&G 100, since the “Environmental Consequences” of each alternative is stated to be
identical regardless of continued used of the trail.
Commenter: 229,
Response: The Forest Service reviewed the information provided and visited all
of the 42 routes in the field in order to evaluate compliance with S & G #100.
The SEIS evaluates compliance with S&G#100 and relevant BMP’s for all of the
alternatives.
The analysis contained in the FSEIS has been supplemented with information
concerning the Yosemite toad and Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog. In particular,
information concerning surveys for both species and discussion of potential
impacts by alternative,
The Forest Service limited their analysis based on the following court order: Case No.2:
09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM (United States District Court, Easter District of California filed
7/31/12). The Court Order left intact all other portions of the Forest Service’s travel
management decision, including the parts of the routes that do not intersect meadows.
RCO #2, S&G 100 require the maintenance and restoration of streams, meadows and
other special aquatic features, not only meadows. The DSEIS errs in ignoring these other
aquatic features. For example, DSEIS figure 3.3 shows a water-covered road bisecting an
alder-dominated wetland, which was not rated in terms of S&G 100. The road clearly
violates the standard, yet this significant new information was completely ignored in the
DSEIS, other than to explain why this route did not violate S&G 100 as it pertains to
meadows.

Hydrology

The methodology for the hydrologic analysis conducted specifically for the TMDSEIS
only assesses non-compliance with the Standard and Guideline 100; it does not assess
compliance with that S&G. Specifically, the three criteria are based on visual
assessments of water on routes and are incapable of determining the effect of compaction
on subsurface water flow.
Commenter: 147
Response: The methodology does assess compliance with S&G 100 as described
on pages 37 – 49 and in Tables 3.4 and 3.5 of the FSEIS. A consideration of
subsurface water flow is included in the methodology as described in Table 3.5.
This issue was previously raised during the scoping period and is discussed on
page 9 of the FSEIS.
Since S&G100 does not separate hydrological connectivity in a meadow by types of
recreation, to comply with that guideline, neither can the Forest differentiate. There must
be an analysis conducted to determine why specific roads and trails were found to be out
of compliance with S&G100 before the closure to motorized travel can be accepted as a
remedy to that problem. Without that analysis, Alternative #3 can be determined to be
both arbitrary and capricious.
Commenter: 220
Response: Standard & Guideline 100 does not distinguish between the different
types of recreation that may or may not occur on roads and trails that are
designated for public motorized vehicle use. The criteria for determining
compliance with S&G #100, as described in Table 3.3 of the SEIS, does not
distinguish between the different types of recreation that may or may not occur on
roads and trails designated for public motorized vehicle use.
The SNFPA has two rules which govern the restoration of hydrologic function in
meadows. Under RCO#5-Rule #117 addresses the hydrologic function of meadows with
and without roads. Under RCO#2-Rule #100 addresses the hydrologic function of
meadows with roads. Rule #100 covers only a subset of meadows that occur in Rule
#117. The criterion of consistency for hydrologic function is written into Rule #117 as
part of the SNFPA and should be the criteria of consistency for hydrologic function in
Rule #100.

Impacts

I do not believe the study’s conclusions are accurate. The DSEIS suggests that meadows
are getting smaller is evidence of damage. I challenge that a meadow gets smaller
naturally. Lake Tahoe will someday become a marsh, then a meadow, then a field and
someday a forest. It is a naturally occurring transition. Just because a trail divides a
meadow does not mean that damage is being done. “Although the water does not have
connectedness” on the surface, it will find its way in to the same water table below
surface.
I fear that conditions and findings may have been exaggerated and I would like to ask that
an independent surveyor be used to review all the techniques and data collection
regarding the 18 trails considered for mitigation. I would like to ask that every meadow
on every trail be re-examined after a normal winter to see if they meet S&G 100.
Commenter: 17,
Response: Meadows do change over time both naturally and due to human
impacts; some decrease in size while some increase. The criteria used in this
analysis for determining consistency with S&G 100 are presented in Table 3.6.
The Forest does recognize that 2011 was a fairly wet year. Many of the routes
were re-evaluated during the summer of 2012 and the findings for a few meadows
were changed.
Impacts to the PCT should be one of the criteria used when evaluating which routes
should be open to motorized use. Unfortunately, where the DSEIS discusses issues raised
during scoping, the document fails to detail impacts to the PCT, as an issue; conversely,
closing part of route 14N39 is listed as a recreation issue in the DSEIS, even though this
route negatively impacts the PCT. PCTA would like the ENF staff to consider the
following routes further in regards to their impacts on the PCT: 14N39 and 17E16.
14N39 crosses the PCT which negatively impacts the trail. 17E16 connects directly with
the PCT. Even though the last half mile of this route is closed to motorized use, PCTA
strongly opposes this proposal.
Commenter: 68
Routes that approach anywhere near the Pacific Crest Trail should be kept closed to
ORVs, because the wild character of the PCT is a special value of National Forests in the
Sierra Nevada. This includes routes 19E01, 10N01B, 10N13, 17E16, 11N09A and
14N39.

Making 42.2 miles of “breaks” in known existing routes just is asking for lost/confused
users to choose some alternate routes that would no doubt result in unintended damage to
the rest of the area. Taking 2 to 10 years to come up with answers means that by 2015 or
2023 the area could/would be so crisscrossed with unintended routes and the damage
would be extreme. I suggest the Forest Service get to the most important areas and clearly
mark the best route or alternate through or around the sensitive areas.

Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while

My fear as a user of the Rubicon Trail over 45 years is that by continuing the closure on
18 of the 42 trails, particularly Barrett, Strawberry, and Blue Lakes/Deer Valley trails, the
FS is forcing the 4WD community and users of the ENF to use the Rubicon Trail. This
will create more usage, possibly more maintenance issues and with more people trying to
share the same trail probably more law enforcement issues.
Commenter: 10, 223,
Response: A discussion of impacts from displaced traffic has been added to the
FSEIS in the Indirect Effects to Public Motor Vehicle Use section on page 84.
Based on S&G100, there is no good legal or logical reasoning for keeping the 18 roads
and trails closed until corrective action can occur, as it will take away much needed
recreation dollars from primarily El Dorado County and also Amador County. The
benefits of closing the roads and trails are outweighed by the high value of the
recreation experiences and retail revenue associated with those roads and trails. Adopt
a Trail clubs can begin to perform needed mitigation, while the Forest pursues more
substantial funding sources. Ultimately, the public will turn to other Counties for
recreation or increase traffic on existing trails, and there has been no analysis done on
the economic loss to the Counties. The economic cost and the human recreation
experience will be a greater loss than the cost to the natural features of trails that have
been used for decades.

The cumulative effects that the road or trail may have will continue, even though the
route may be closed to public use if no corrective actions have been implemented during
the closures. In any scenario, the Forest Service must take corrective action to bring the
sites up to S&G100. Yet the affected sites are so small in proportion to the scope of the
project and the scope of 2008 TMEIS that there can be no assurance any significant
cumulative impacts will occur with or without the corrective actions. Further, there does
not appear to be any such claim in the analysis. In fact, the Q&A document released with
the SDEIS states that the reason for closing the routes is “because it reduces impacts to
meadows”. This can not be true if S&G100 can not be met with simply a closure.
S&G100 does not require closure, but rather asks that “corrective action be
implemented”. Allow these 18 roads to remain open to public use while actively pursuing
funding for corrective action. Actively recruit volunteers to begin immediate work to
correct problem areas.
Commenter: 90
Based on S&G100, there is no good rationale for keeping the 18 roads and trails closed
until corrective action can occur, because this burdens forest visitors with an “arbitrary
and capricious” indefinite closure. It also will take away much needed recreation dollars
from the Counties in and near ENF. The benefits of closing the roads and trails is
outweighed by the high value of the recreation experiences and retail revenue associated
with those roads and trails. Adopt a Trail clubs can begin to perform needed mitigation,
while the Forest pursues more substantial funding sources. The burden on the public is
also worsened because of the indirect effects of closing the roads and trails, that is, other
roads and trails not affected by the Court order cannot be accessed except by using the
closed roads and trails which could be closed by this EIS. This adds weight to the public's
side of the equation; that is, the recreational and financial gains of keeping the roads and
trails open while mitigation occurs, are greater than the cost to the natural features.
Commenter: 90, 214
No assessment has been made as to the rating of scale of work to be done on any
particular location to bring any of the 18 roads or trails in to compliance with S&G100.
Table 3.1 in the DSEIS rates the roads and trails on a scale of recreational value which I
applaud and seems to be a step towards recognition of recreational value, but the
response to the Court Order is what is at issue. These 18 roads and trails have locations
identified as “not meeting” S&G100, but no analysis of the scale of work has been stated.
Some of these locations could be remedied easier than others and could be “fast tracked”
to completion negating any need for closure. Some areas may need more extensive work
and may need further review. Some trails already have had work and planning done.
Simply closing roads and trails is “arbitrary and capricious”.

ours as it is? Please as an avid family off roader I am begging you to fully restore access

I have worked in construction for 50 years and anytime you want to maintain the integrity
of surrounding areas you raise the road and use bleeder mats under them. That alone

Response: The use of geotextiles is one technique that may be considered in the
site specific analysis of corrective actions for each route.
It is easy to forget that these routes are RS-2477 and FLPMA protested rights of way that
pre-existed the creation of the Eldorado and the Forest Service itself. Your agency has
been tasked with managing public lands for all of the public, and it is not within the
agency’s power to take these rights of way. Only Congress can do so and Congress has
already taken a 1/3 of the Eldorado away for everyone but hikers when they created
Desolation and Mokolumne Wilderness.
Commenter: 38
All 18 routes are extremely unique, high in recreation value, some of these routes have
existed over 100 years, and should be protected under the RS2477 rule.
Commenter: 216
The Draft SEIS acknowledges that many of the routes in question “have been in use for
over a hundred years, being remnants of early emigrant trails over the Sierra Nevada.”
These routes must not be closed - temporary or otherwise - until it is determined if they
are legitimate RS 2477 roads.
Commenter: 225
9N83 has been utilized for centuries, even before Alpine County was formed, to navigate
the Sierra Nevada Mountains and is designated as an RS 2477 roadway.
Commenter: 197
Response: None of the 42 routes have RS 2477 status in that the involved
counties have not asserted rights at this time
Many of these trails have been in use since the 1800's. (Pardoe is part of the Emigrant
Trail). Deer Valley has been in use since the mid 1800's (1856 "Snowshoe Thompson",
1857 & 1858 Emigrant Trail) and was used by horses and wagons for many years to
deliver mail. I find it hard to believe that these trails are now threatened and need to be
closed either permanently or for more studies. These routes have been in existence for
160+ years.
Commenter: 49
Response: Although some of these routes have been used for many years, the
Forest Service is responsible for considering the uses of NFS lands consistent
with new laws, regulations and changing environmental conditions.

EPA also recommends that NEPA documents tiered to this SEIS include the results of
comprehensive, up-to-date biological surveys of the Project area. Without such surveys,
accurate evaluation of the environmental impacts of the proposed actions would be
difficult. The tiered NEPA documents should thoroughly describe and evaluate
appropriate corrective action alternatives.
Commenter: 141,
Response: All future analysis of corrective actions or other projects tiered to this
FSEIS will comply with NEPA and other laws.
The Notice of Intent (NOI) proposed the use of a Land Resource Management Plan
(LRMP) Amendment to enable routes that did not meet Standard & Guideline #100 to
reopen, equivalent to Alternative #1 in the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact
Statement (DSEIS). However with the release of the DSEIS, a new alternative,
Alternative #3, is presented as the preferred alternative which represents a marked change
in direction. Alternative #3 precludes the use of the LRMP Amendment, and the only
rationale used to explain this change is that Alternative #3 was developed in response to
comments submitted by the public. In no place in the document are the comments that
supported the use of a LRMP Amendment recognized or given equal consideration.
The ENF must pull its support for the Preferred Alternative, and must recognize all other
public comments in an equal light, including CORVA's, which did not recommend a
change in direction, and endorsed the Forest's initial plan to issue a LRMP Amendment. It
is highly likely that a legal determination resulting from the propensity of those opposed
to continued motorized recreational access of the Forest biases the agency towards
closure-oriented alternatives. However this bias violates NEPA and harms the implied
trust between the agency and the public it serves.
Commenter: 220,
Response: Alternatives were developed after scoping to address significant
issues raised by the public. Alternative 3 was developed to address the concern
that amending the LRMP would not resolve adverse effects to meadows. Each
alternative, including Alternative 1, has been rigorously explored, objectively
evaluated, and devoted substantial treatment as required by 40 CFR 1502.14.
Alternative 3 was identified as the preferred alternative, yet a decision was not
made. Comments concerning all of the alternatives were received during the 45day comment period expressing support for each of the alternatives including
Alternative 1 which is documented in Appendix E. The Forest Supervisor will
consider the entire project record, including the response to comments, when
determining which alternative will be chosen.

Standard and Guideline 100, which is vague and unscientific in nature, has been elevated
through a quirk of process to a status of importance that trumps public access,
recreational value, and economic and social impacts. This quirk of process brings
Standard and Guideline 100 to discussion as it relates to motor vehicle use, but Standard
and Guideline 100 does not specify user groups of one type or another. If the ENF uses
temporary or permanent closures to address Standard and Guideline 100 during the 42
Routes Project, it will set the precedent to use closures in future processes, regardless of
user groups affected. In order to prevent closures to other user groups during future
processes, the ENF needs to create a SEIS that plans mitigation for specific portions of
routes that do not meet Standard and Guideline 100, and that maximizes the mileage of
routes that will remain open throughout the process.
Commenter: 225
Response: The FSEIS analyzes 5 alternatives, including Alternative 1, which
amends the LRMP to exempt the 24 routes from meeting S&G 100. The 4 action
alternatives identify different ways of complying with the ENF LRMP, none of
which are precedent setting actions for future analysis.
Consideration must be taken as the “sections” identified within the suit on specific routes,
for the intended purpose of COMPLETE closures, yet with very small section identified
to be closed, thus breaking a complete route to the next destination or road junction.
Review the Field Survey for Meadows and Roads identified in the SDEIS and listed on
the website, specifically route 16E21 series, as many surveys were listed by 16E21- (??)
and identified as N/A –Not a Meadow in July and August 2011.
Commenter: 228
Response: The field surveys were reviewed, including route 16E21, and it was
determined the appropriate portions of routes are closed as required by court
order.
The court has not presupposed, prescribed, or in any way implied expectations as to the
resulting decisions to be made in the SEIS other than to mandate “Analysis for RCO#2
Standards and Guidelines #100 pertaining to the meadows on the 42 routes listed in Table
A.” There is no order mandating conformance.
The court order closing 42 routes circumvented NEPA law as would be required if the
Agency had chosen the closures, and has been largely seen by the public as a punitive
action by the court. As clearly stated in the Order, this is a temporary closure that expires
once the required SEIS is completed. While this may have been an appropriate decision
within the context of this legal action, as an environmental action it is strictly arbitrary.

Response: We agree the court has not presupposed, prescribed, or in any way
implied expectations to the resulting decisions to be made in the SEIS. The SEIS
is required to be consistent with the LRMP, which could mean amending the
LRMP or taking a different action to provide for consistency with the LRMP. The
order will be finalized when the SEIS is completed and submitted to the court.
The SEIS is not complete until all appeals of the decision have been responded to
and the decision has been affirmed.

Meadows

14N58 is not a meadow (it ends at a stand of timber). Meadows shown on the maps could
be used as a tool to restrict access in the future. Meadows mapped on private lands
shouldn’t show on the current Forest Order. Some of the meadows identified by the
Forest Service are not meadows (McKinstry). Still have non-meadows mapped as
meadows and this could become a problem later down the road.
Commenter: 66
Response: As described on page 3 of the TM FSEIS, the Forest recognizes that
some of the features that were originally mapped in the Geographic Information
System (GIS) database as meadows are not actually meadows. As explained on
page 4 of the TM FSEIS, each of the features mapped as meadows that cross the
42 routes were examined in the field and evaluated for consistency with S&G
100. Only meadows located on National Forest System lands were included in
the analysis. Of the two features encountered along 14N58, one is considered to
be a meadow that is consistent with S&G 100 and one feature is not a meadow
(see page 7 of Volume 2 Maps for the location of the two features). Many of the
routes were re-evaluated during the summer of 2012 and the findings for a few
meadows were changed.
Meadows that are still in existence after many years of motorized and wheeled travel
(more than 100 years in some cases) are clearly capable of sustained vehicle use, and it is
unlikely that continued use will result in "impacts to hydrology, natural vegetation, and
wildlife habitat". The Forest has provided no analysis or studies to support this
conclusion, and this change of direction ignores the many comments made in support of
an LRMP amendment to allow travel without recognizing or giving equal consideration
to those comments.
Commenter: 81, 196
Response: The adverse effects of roads and trails on meadows and other aquatic
features have been well established in scientific literature as described in the 2008
TM FEIS. This FSEIS documents the effects of 42 routes on meadows with
regard to S&G #100 as described in the Hydrology section of the FSEIS.
Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the LRMP to
designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while corrective actions
are completed.
The SEIS needs to conduct an analysis by meadow to determine if road closure is a
necessary corrective action.
Appendix E

Commenter: 197
Response: This SEIS analyzes meadows to determine whether to allow public
motorized use on the 42 routes in light of S&G #100. The effects analysis by
meadow is presented in the Hydrology section.
From the description in the field survey it appears that there may be no relationship
between trail 17E28 and the drying of the upper section of the meadow. Unless there is
clear evidence of the trail affecting the meadow 17E28 should be added to the list of trails
that meet S&G 100 and RCO #2.
Commenter: 199,
Response: The field survey form for meadow 17E28-7 describes the degraded
condition of the meadow, but does not make it clear why the trail is causing the
meadow to not meet S&G #100. The reasons will be evaluated in more detail
during site specific NEPA analysis for corrective actions.
If we are to find significant adverse roading impacts to the total meadow acreage the
effects must be found in the meadow proper not the road ways themselves. This will
prove difficult because other factors than roads are the usual cause of extensive meadow
degradation.
Commenter: 232,
Response: In order to determine that a meadow is not in compliance with S&G
#100, there must be visible evidence that the road or trail is a major cause of the
meadow not meeting S&G #100. This is reflected in the field survey forms used
to evaluate compliance with S&G #100 and in Table 3.5 of the Final SEIS.
Contend that if meadow hydrology is in such dire shape Forest –wide as to require
absolutely no roads then the causal agent for meadow degradation is not roading.
The conservation of the meadow resource is much more likely to depend on what we do
with the roaded meadow access into adjacent forest lands for fuel reduction, tree density
reduction, and extensive fire prevention-control than what we do with the road in the
meadow.
Commenter: 232,
Response: There are many land disturbances that can cause or contribute to the
degradation of a meadow, and there a number of types of degradation that can
occur in a meadow. Standard & Guideline #100 focuses on roads and trails as
they affect the hydrologic connectivity of the meadow – this was the focus of the
field survey forms and the analysis in the Final SEIS in order to meet the
Appendix E

requirements of the following Court Order: Case No. 2:09-CV-02523-LKK-JFM
(United States District Court, Eastern District of California, filed 7/31/12)..
In the Forest road survey the presence of erosion, sediment transport, rill and gully
presence, stream incision and loss of channel –flood plain connectivity were used as the
basis for determining which roads would remain closed and which would be opened. I
contend these geomorphic attributes will correctly ascertain if the hydrologic connectivity
of the meadow is impacted, but that their presence on roaded meadows is not a priori
evidence of roading impacts.
“Natural erosion and sediment deposition processes are essential to maintain stable
banks, healthy substrate, quality aquatic habitat and cover, and positive and functional
hydraulic circulation” (Borgmann et al. 2011-page 10).
Without current and historical information on meadow and side slope perturbations is
unlikely to determine if these natural geomorphic processes are related to the presence of
roads or other factors.
Without paired study comparison between adjacent roaded and un-roaded meadows it
will be difficult to separate out roading impacts on hydrological connectivity.
Commenter: 232
Response: The methodology for the field surveys that determined compliance
with S&G #100 is described in detail in Table 3.6 of the FEIS. It is acknowledged
in Table 3.6 that the questions in the field survey form are qualitative, require
hydrologic knowledge and field experience to answer, and are based on features
that are visible at the ground surface.
In field application Rule #100 in the Forest road survey provides too many false positive
indications of adverse roading impacts. All roads and trails intercept surface flow
regardless if these are adverse impacts and there is a good deal of ambiguity in
determining road disruption of sub-surface flow and its hydrologic significance.
The disruption of sub-surface flow by the road surface would be fairly difficult to assess
along the length of the meadow road; in fact I don’t know of a single study that has
documented this quantitatively.
Commenter: 232
Response: Roads and trails were rated as meeting Standard & Guideline #100
unless clear field evidence indicated otherwise. As a result, many meadows were
rated as meeting S&G despite the fact that degradation of those meadows was
obvious. The criteria for rating a meadow as not meeting S&G #100 is described
in detail in Table 3.6 of the FSEIS. It is acknowledged in Table 3.6 that roads
Appendix E

57

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

and trails intercept surface and subsurface water, and that hydrologic knowledge
and field experience is necessary in order to answer the questions on the field
survey form and determine compliance with S&G#100. The field survey form
was developed because there was no existing survey form that specifically
determined compliance with S&G #100.
The SEIS criteria used to determine meadow failure of S&G (Rule) #100 (Table 3.8 page
36) are scientifically appropriate, but quantitatively and qualitatively difficult to
determine under field conditions.
The threshold criteria for each reason number to determine sufficient adverse effects to
declared road failure to Rule #100 was decrease in meadow size or wetness”; neither
factor was measured quantitatively in the field and qualitative estimates of changes in
size and wetness cannot be separated from drought, grazing or climate induced reduced
meadow inflows. As a result the reported failure of the Route segment or portions of
Route segments is invalid.
Commenter: 232
Response: The methodology for the field surveys that determined compliance
with S&G #100 is described in detail in Table 3.6 of the FEIS. It is acknowledged
in Table 3.6 that the questions are qualitative, require hydrologic knowledge and
field experience to answer, and are based on features that are visible at the ground
surface. In order to determine that a meadow is not in compliance with S&G
#100, there must be visible evidence that the road or trail is a major cause of the
meadow not meeting S&G #100. This is reflected in the field survey forms used
to evaluate compliance with S&G #100 and in Table 3.6 of the Final SEIS.

Commenter: 21,
Response: The 2008 TM FEIS discussed the socioeconomic effects of recreation
on the Eldorado NF. As explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS, this SEIS
addresses the additional information and analysis relative to the 42 specific routes,
meadows, and Standard and Guideline #100 in the Eldorado NF
Our parents started visiting the area in about 1920. We have continued this enjoyment up
till now. As far as we can see, very little has changed from people using the area. Damage
has been minimal. Mother Nature has changed things in her own way-----fire, slides and
erosion. Because of this observation over the years, we see no reasons to restrict the use
of the roads in the area. This is especially true in the Strawberry (hi way 50) area. This is
our backyard from our cabin in Strawberry Meadows. We would like people to enjoy the
area as our family has for the last 60 years.
Commenter: 42,
Response: Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the
routes are closed until this analysis is completed.
Many, if not ALL, of these trails have been in existence in excess of a hundred years and
the meadows have clearly done well over that time. It would be nothing less than
excessive to keep the trails "CLOSED" for years while the "necessary repairs" are
completed. Perhaps, the specific locations on the trail that are "sensitive" could be clearly
MARKED so users could tread with even greater caution in these areas.
Commenter: 46,
Response: This appears to be a proposal to open routes while marking meadows
as sensitive areas. However, the existing physical condition of some routes and
their location within meadows leads to the finding of not complying with S&G
100. Marking the meadows as sensitive will not result in the meadow meeting
S&G 100.
Some of these alternatives significantly modify a court order of extreme environmental
ideology. However, I am not satisfied with any of them. No routes, except for rare
exceptions, should have been closed. Given our population growth and the growing need
of outdoor experience for urban people, the Forest Service should be expanding, not
reducing, use of the National Forests. None of what I’ve said, however, is meant to
preclude improvements or changes in a probably small number of very destructive road

situations. I would prefer the Forest Service to devote itself to fixing those very few
situations and expanding, not restricting, forest use.
Commenter: 47
Response: Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the
routes are closed until this analysis is completed. Alternative 1 allows public use
of all 42 routes. Alternatives 3 and 4 recognize the need for corrective actions.
Site specific analyses for corrective actions will be completed at a future date.
If cohesive and accurate studies are conducted and a responsible plan of action is put in
place I personally will give my time and money to make improvements to keep these
historic and beautiful trails open. What I cannot understand is using inaccurate and
misleading information to close them completely.
Commenter: 49
Response: Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the
routes are closed until this analysis is completed. The Forest intends to continue
working with a variety of user groups to maintain and improve routes across the
forest including the implementation of corrective actions on these routes.
I am writing with hopes that you will reconsider open the closed routes and not close
other routes. As an avid 4 wheeler these trails are beautiful, historic and scenic and to see
them close is sad. The people that vandalize these trails and ruin the history are not
people like me or my friends that enjoy the outdoors. They are people that don't belong in
these areas and have no consideration and respect for previous generations.
Commenter: 50
Response: Pages 11-21 of the TM FSEIS describe each of the alternatives
considered in this analysis. Alternative 1 allows public use of all 42 routes.
Alternatives 3 and 4 will open routes following corrective actions. No
alternatives propose to close any additional routes.
One concern we have is the lack of enforcement of the current 42 road closures. We
understand that not one of these closed roads has been assigned to your law enforcement
personnel to patrol. If the road closures are not enforced, you might as well open these
roads to everyone. The very act of ignoring enforcement of the closed roads makes this
entire DSEIS somewhat farcical. We highly recommend that you instruct your law
enforcement personnel to patrol these closed roads on the days when most off-road action
takes place. If you combine enforcement, as the court certainly implied to comply with its
order, then Alternative 3 should sustain these meadows until the requisite repairs have
been completed.

Commenter: 64
Response: The Forest has a responsibility for patrols and enforcement in all
areas across the Forest and has been actively patrolling the 42 routes involved in
this analysis, along with other routes. As explained on page 1 of the TM FSEIS,
this SEIS addresses only the additional information and analysis relative to the 42
specific routes, meadows, and Standard and Guideline #100 in the Eldorado NF.
I realize funding for all types of repairs and mitigation is always an issue – especially
with the upcoming impact of the budget sequester. However, I believe the Forest Service
will find a willing partner in the off road community.
Commenter: 67
Response: The Forest recognizes the contribution of user groups and individuals
and intends to continue working with a variety of user groups to maintain and
improve routes across the Forest including the implementation of corrective
actions on these routes.
The court order does not require the FS to close any trails once the SEIS is complete.
Commenter: 10
Response: You are correct.
When the DSEIS was released, a new alternative was introduced and identified as the
preferred alternative which represents a marked change from the NOI proposal. The only
rationale presented by the Forest for this extreme change was in response to comments
made by the public that states that, "Amending the LRMP to allow continued public
motorized use in sensitive meadow habitats will result in impacts to hydrology, natural
vegetation, and wildlife habitat". I believe that this statement is in error because the
SDEIS also clearly states that many of the routes slated for closure are public roads that
have been in place for many years, some since before the existence of the Forest.
Commenter: 81
Response: As explained on pages 8-10 of the FSEIS, alternatives are developed
from public comments received during scoping. Alternative 3 was developed to
address issue statement #2 (page 10 of the FSEIS).
Judge Karlton's order to the ENF was to perform a NEPA analysis and that is what the
Forest should do. The Forest must pull its support for route closures and recognize the
comments of RTF and others made to the NOI (based on the proposed action, not on an
unanticipated direction) and issue the LRMP amendment.

Response: The process the Forest is following conforms to regulations
implementing NEPA. All public comments are considered during the analysis and
decision process. Two alternatives include amending the LRMP.
The S&G was adopted for all new activities. Driving on these roads is not a new
activity. In most cases it is a very, very old activity. Some roads date back to the stage
coach days. One is a section of the old Highway 88. Another is part of the main
immigrant trail to California blazed by Kit Carson, constructed by Mormon pioneers in
1848 and used by thousands during the gold rush. Another is the wagon road to
Calaveras Big Trees. We question the need for an amendment to the LRMP given the
historic nature and use of these roads.
Commenter: 101
The S&G was adopted for all new activities. Driving on these roads is not a new activity.
Commenter: 197
Response: Page 4 of the FSEIS gives the background on rationale for application
of S&G #100 when designating routes for public motorized use. Designation of
routes in the 2008 TM FEIS was considered a new activity.
If remediation is deemed the only way to maintain access allowed by the 2008
FEIS/ROD then grant funding should be pursued in a creative manner from traditional
and non-traditional sources as should labor resources.
Commenter: 167
Response: The Forest will continue to work with partners and volunteers, and
continue to seek funding opportunities through grants and other sources.
The highest recreation value was placed on almost all the trails proposed for closure. The
Forest Service is supposed to balance the recreation experience, as well with other needs,
including ecological. Does closing all the high recreational value trails balance the needs
of the of road community with the ecological needs? Could the Forest Service have come
up with an alternative that allowed for necessary mitigation plans using volunteer labor
on some of the high recreational value trails? Hence keeping all trails open while
mitigation is completed.
Commenter: 186
Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while
corrective actions are completed.

Mitigation

Let’s take the time to fix the issues at hand so we can keep these areas open for good. I
for one, as many others, would love to help in any way the Forest Service needs it, labor
material, etc.
Commenter: 74
Response: The Forest intends to continue working with a variety of user groups
to maintain and improve routes across the Forest including the implementation of
corrective actions on these routes.
This lack of proposed timeline for performing mitigation, and lack of specific details as
to the order in which the trails might be mitigated and re-opened makes it difficult to
discern exactly what the long term plan is. The Forest should include an analysis of long
and short term planning and mitigation efforts.
Commenter: 81
The Forest Service needs to outline detailed projects and timetables to allow resumption
of access on these routes. NOT just as funds become available. Without detailed budgets
the money will allocated to other project and law enforcement. The routes will then have
no hope of opening again.
Commenter: 230
I feel it is the Forest Service responsibility to provide reasonable and accountable
timelines for implementation and completion as well as prioritization of projects leading
to the reopening of these affected routes.
Commenter: 40
What I would like to have brought to discussion is what can be done to get the roads into
use in a timelier manner. If certain areas had priority (09N82, 09N28, 09N82 and the
areas 17E24-3, 3, and 5) over the other fixes this would open up the road from Mud Lake
staging area to the ridge first to open the most and then do the rest. I am handicapped and
can’t walk long distances, but I can ride a quad to Martel Flats on Squaw Ridge and walk
to a nearby alpine lake.
Commenter: 29
I stress the importance that the Forest service prioritize its programs so the high-value
"alpine" routes are first to receive mitigation measure will a goal to reopen them.

Response: The Forest is already actively seeking funding to complete the
analysis for the corrective actions on the affected routes; however, the alternatives
in the TM SEIS do not identify the order or timeline in which corrective actions
would be taken. Appendix B has been added to the FSEIS to display the Strategy
for Planning for routes requiring corrective actions. The timing and
implementation of corrective actions will depend on the availability of resources.
The SEIS should also suggest some appropriate temporary mitigation measures it
will consider on an individual meadow by meadow basis. For example, where use
does impact water flow, consider mitigation measures that can be implemented until
corrective actions can be completed such as wet-road restrictions. As two commenters to
the scoping document requested, there should be some discussion about how much
vehicular use a road will receive when soils are saturated; the time when rutting or other
damage to meadow roads is most likely to occur. Thirty-three of the thirty-eight meadows
are affected by run-off from the roads. Consider listing some standard control devices
that can be employed for temporary relief, such as rip-rap, erosion matting, and water
bars.
Commenter: 101, 197
Response: The discussion in the hydrology section under Alternative 3 (page 54

Monitoring

There is no discussion in the TMDSEIS regarding future monitoring of the 42 routes
through meadows. Similarly, there is no discussion in the TM DSEIS regarding adaptive
management.
Commenter: 147
Response: As explained on page 1 of the TMFSEIS, this document is tiered to
the 2008 TM FEIS and ROD. All discussion of monitoring of meadows is
included in the 2008 FEIS on page 2-19 and 2008 ROD (page xx) which state that
meadow monitoring will commence within 2 years of implementation of the
decision. The meadow monitoring was initiated in 2009 and the field surveys
conducted for this analysis are a continuation of the monitoring. This TM SEIS
does not propose adaptive management, but rather identifies locations where
corrective actions are needed. Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 provide for further sitespecific analysis before routes are open for public motor vehicle use.

New Information

The DSEIS also fails to adequately analyze compliance with the 2012 [Dec 5, 2011]
Water Quality handbook Best Management Practices. The Forest Service updated its
Water Quality Management Handbook in 2012, including the addition of BMP’s for offroad vehicles. The 2008 TM EIS was not subject to those, but this supplemental EIS must
review these 42 routes for compliance with applicable BMP’s, including: BMP 2.1
(Travel Planning), BMP 4.7.1 (Planning) and BMP 4.7.2 (Location and Design).
Commenter: 204
Response: BMP 4.7.1 has been addressed in the Effects section for Hydrology in
the DSEIS and in the FSEIS (page 51.) A discussion of BMP 2.1 and BMP 4.7.2
has been added to the FSEIS on page 52.
The DSEIS narrowly addresses BMP 4.7.1, item #3 a-b, and only with regard to
meadows, despite the BMP’s clear intent to also include Streamside Management Zones

Proposed Alternatives

Keep trails open: add the mitigation issues and proposed actions and maybe add a
deadline date for completion.
Commenter: 10,
The meadow routes should remain open in a “modified preferred alternative” because
those routes are an integral part of the minimally functional network of motorized trails
proposed for designation in the 2008 FEIS/ROD. Additionally, public access to our
mountain trail should remain open for all to enjoy.
Commenter: 38, 41,
I would strongly urge you to keep the 42 subject trails in Eldorado open to public travel.
These back country trails offer families a chance to get off the beaten path and have a
sense of the great outdoors that cannot be found on the main roads. If there are areas of
concern please consider a plan that will keep the trails open until such time as the trails
can be altered to eliminate any negative environmental impact. Many of these trails have
been in use for generations, surely a few more seasons won't cause any substantial further
impact.
Commenter: 59,
I am really disappointed in Alternative 3. I believe a better plan would be to open the
trails then work on the mitigation through the year with volunteers doing the work. Most
of these trails have been open and used for up to 50 to 100 years. The environmental
problems will not get worse in a year or two while we all work to mitigate the problems.
Commenter: 10,
Meadow routes should remain open in a “Modified Preferred Alternative” because the
routes were originally designated by the original Travel Management decision approved
in 2008.
Commenters: 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74,

Meadow routes should remain open in a “Modified Preferred Alternative”. Conditionally
designate the trails open once a new interim wet weather/seasonal closure plan is
adopted.

It makes sense to study any impact to these routes but keep them open while conducting
the studies.
Commenter: 49
The forests have not been destroyed, species have not gone extinct and the damage is
over stated. Please allow the trails to remain open while the meadows are being repaired.
This would allow easier access to the meadows for survey, planning and repair. If the
routes are closed for years it would lead to overgrowth and other issues and become more
problematic. Continued use will allow users to maintain the routes.
Commenter: 17
Allow these roads and trails to remain open to public use while actively pursuing funding
for any needed corrective action. Actively recruit and utilize existing volunteers to begin
immediate work to correct problem areas. Volunteers have been used with great success
on the Rubicon for years all you have to do is ask. Its seems like the Forrest Service is
always trying to protect themselves from lawsuits you have to realize that no matter what
you do someone will sue, please think of the thousands of people who in a since own that
land that you are managing who recreate out there vs the few that want it closed down to
everyone.
Commenter: 81
While Alternative 1 proposes keeping all the trails open, the ENF has failed to provide an
alternative that provides for keeping all the 42 trails open while undertaking the planning
and mitigation process to comply with S&G 100. Such an alternative would be a
compromise that might satisfy the traveling public and reasonable environmental
concerns. No analysis of cumulative environmental damage has been undertaken by the
ENF, and there is no science to support that continuing travel during planning and
mitigation would cause such damage.
Commenter: 196
According to the analysis of the 42 routes there were 18 routes “found by USFS does not
meet Standard & Guideline #100.” These 18 routes should be reopened and continued
for motorized access under Forest Plan Amendment, or Categorical Exemptions. Routes
must remain in NFTS system for tracking and future issues of Motor Vehicle Use Map.
Routes could be “conditional designated” with corrective measures to be worked on in
the future, while allowing routes to be reopened to motorized access. The Court order
does not require these routes remain closed to motorized. Routes have been analyzed.
All 18 routes should be reopened as soon as this process allows.
Commenter: 216
Appendix E

The SEIS states that mitigation needs to be completed; there is no detailed outline for
how the mitigation will be completed. The routes need to remain open while mitigation is
completed. Volunteers from the OHV community have spent thousands of hours annually
mitigating this trail annually.
Commenter: 201
Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while
corrective actions are completed. The Forest recognizes the contribution of user
groups and individuals and intends to continue working with a variety of user
groups to maintain and improve routes across the Forest including the
implementation of corrective actions on these routes.
The condition and proximity of several routes relative to aquatic features indicate that it
will take considerable effort to bring the routes into compliance with S&G 100 and that
for all practical purposes, the routes should be removed from the National Forest
Transportation System if further study indicates that bringing them into compliance with
S&Gs is not feasible. Mitigative actions should be taken to minimize the present
degraded condition.
Commenter: 147
Response: The proposal to remove the routes completely from the NFTS is
beyond the scope of this project. The Purpose and Need for Action, as stated on
page 5 of the FSEIS is to determine whether public wheeled motor vehicle use
will be allowed. Permanent closure and removal of the routes is beyond the scope
of this analysis. As suggested by the commenter, future analyses will address
corrective actions needed.
We urge you to refine an alternative that falls within Alternatives I, 2 and 3. Such an
alternative would release the 24 roads that either do not affect meadows or are found in
compliance with S&G #100. For the 18 roads not found in compliance, provide a
preliminary assessment for the necessity of corrective actions, and where necessary,
establish a plan for the development of corrective actions, the implementation
of which will provide compliance with S&G #100. Include an evaluation of the necessity
for temporary mitigation measures.
Commenter: 101
Response: We have modified Alternative 3 and created Alternative 5 based on
public comments. The full descriptions of these alternatives are included in
Chapter 2 of the FSEIS.

We would like to see a modified preferred alternative presented allowing continued
unfettered access to all of the routes in question while also possibly incorporating plans
and provisions for corrective actions to be taken where necessary to restore hydrologic
connectivity. The nineteen meadow routes found inconsistent with Standard and
Guideline 100 should remain open in their entirety while the more extensive process of
evaluating each individual route and identifying specific remediation solutions is
undertaken. Specific areas on the ground not meeting S&G 100 should be signed as such
and a temporary solution arrived upon to minimize further damage while leaving the
entire route open for motorized use until such time as permanent remediation efforts can
be undertaken if deemed practical. If a specific area of a meadow not meeting S&G 100
would benefit from a wet weather or seasonal closure, while leaving the rest of the route
open in its entirety, that may be an acceptable temporary solution, depending upon
implementation.
Commenter: 167
Response: Alternative 5 was developed based on public comments to amend the
LRMP to designate the 18 routes that do not meet S&G #100 open while
corrective actions are completed. We considered an additional alternative that
would incorporate a wet weather closure on some routes. The alternative was
eliminated from detailed study because many of the high elevation and high
recreation value routes with impacted meadows would remain closed since the
meadows remain wet the entire season.
To maintain consistency with the FEIS/ROD the SEIS should include a modified
alternative that would allow the original non-significant Forest Plan amendments to stand
and the related 20 routes to remain open to public motorized use.
Commenter 199,
Response: A short history of the original decision and court order is included in
the Background Section of the SEIS on pages 2 -4. This section explains why the
original decision needed to be reconsidered by preparing a Supplemental EIS.
Alternatives 1 and 5 of this SEIS include Forest Plan amendments for all of the
routes not meeting Standard and Guideline #100.

Public Use

ENF is public land for public multiple use, and as such, every road and trail that has been
open for travel. Any roads closed to travel, should be re-opened to travel. If there are
areas of concern, they should be handled by the rangers and tickets issued instead of
simply eliminating public use to make it easier for you.
Commenter: 1,
Response: Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the
routes are closed until this analysis is completed. The reasons that some of the
routes do not meet S&G 100 are described in Table 3.6 of the TM FSEIS. For
some of the routes that do not meet S&G 100, corrective actions to the routes
themselves are necessary in order to comply with that S&G. This would not be
accomplished by simply issuing tickets.
I think off road vehicle travel and roads should be concentrated in particular areas where
they already are, and not spread into areas where they are not. Mechanized use of public
lands is disruptive and annoying to other classes of users, to wildlife and to plants.
Mechanized use is one major aspect that makes multiple use lands decidedly less
attractive to hikers than wilderness or Park Service land. I would try to concentrate
mechanized use, i.e. roads, and all types of off road vehicle use, to keep this use from
spreading and degrading other public lands. Mechanized use, in my opinion, degrades
public lands to the lowest common denominator. My advice and opinion: keep this kind
of use minimized and concentrated. Once this type of use gains access to nicer, more
pristine areas, those areas will no longer be nice in terms of at least having some degree
of wilderness, preservation value.
Commenter: 4,
Response: The 2008 Travel Management decision included restricting motor
vehicle travel to a system of designated routes and prohibited “cross country”
travel. The 42 routes under consideration in this SEIS were already in existence
prior to the 2008 decision and were only closed recently by Federal Court Order.
All of the routes are located within areas identified in the ENF LRMP as managed
for motor vehicle use.
As an active outdoor enthusiast I want to see all of our lands protected for the future
generations and to maintain a clean and healthy habitat. However, I do not want all access
limited and not allow for the persons who do drive 4 wheel drive vehicles properly to lose
their ability to enjoy the sport and access areas. I understand that damage has been done
to many areas around the popular 4 wheel drive trails, but the damage is usually caused
by a small number of people who do not adhere to the rules.

In lieu of closing trails, I would rather propose a stewardship and/or permitting
requirements for those clubs who are willing to work and help maintain specific OHV
trails. Persons identified ‘off trail’ or ‘damaging land’ should have photos or have
identifying information submitted to the El Dorado County Sheriff for referral and have
their specific access to these areas revoked. Therefore, if someone who has had access
revoked is found to be on any one of the trail systems their vehicle is subject to
impounding fees. This is an undertaking, however requiring permitting would also cover
some of the fees required. Additionally, once a vehicle is impounded then all fees would
go to that enforcement office. This would happen a few times a year, and eventually less
of it will happen because of the high fees associated with the consequences.
Commenter: 5,
Response: Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the
routes are closed until this analysis is completed. The reasons that some of the
routes do not meet S&G 100 are described in Table 3.6 of the TM FSEIS. For
some of the routes that do not meet S&G 100, corrective actions to the routes
themselves are necessary in order to comply with that S&G. Revising the process
of enforcing forest rules or fines would not address the inconsistencies with S&G
100. The Forest intends to continue working with a variety of user groups to
maintain and improve routes across the Forest.
I support and request that all available and existing roads be open and useable for vehicle
travel in the El Dorado National Forest. Any roads that were previously closed by
litigation and/or political agendas must remain open and useable for citizen vehicle use.
Commenter: 25
Response: Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the

Response: We agree that all of the 42 routes under consideration in this SEIS are
highly valued for recreation and public motor vehicle use, which is why they were
proposed for designation in the 2008 TM EIS and ROD. They are also all
proposed for designation in Alternatives 1, 3, and 5 of this SEIS.
These meadow routes are an integral part of the minimally functional network of
motorized trails proposed for designation in the 2008 decision. These routes represent the
bare minimum thread of access to important destinations or system road/trail
components, which through even the interim closure imposed by the Court resulted in
greater impacts to legitimate public recreation than was reflected by the route mileage of
the 42 routes alone.

Specific Routes

I am in strong favor of keeping routes open for public use. In particular, 16E26, 17E28,
17E24, 17E19, and 17E21. In my observations I am not seeing the “destruction”
purported by some that would warrant these mass closures. If it turns out that there is no
other choice than to stop travel through meadows, can we at least reroute these short
sections of road and trail around them?
Commenter: 2,
Response: The Forest acknowledges your desire to keep all of the 42 routes
open. Pages 3 through 5 of the TM FSEIS explain the reasons that the routes are
closed until this analysis is completed. Alternatives 1 and 5 reopen nearly all of
the 42 routes considered in this analysis. In Alternatives 3 and 5, reroutes are one
of the possible corrective actions that will be considered.
[I] Would like to see road to Sayles Canyon Trailhead open to public to access the
trailhead (11N09A).
Commenter: 8
Response: Table 3.7 of the FSEIS shows that road 11N09A does not cross or
border a meadow. Alternatives 1, 3, 4, and 5 would open this road to motor
vehicle use.
17E21 Horse Canyon Trail is unsuitable for multiple use and should be limited to hikers
and equestrians. 17E24 and beyond would be okay for motorized vehicles.
Commenter: 8
Response: Table 3.7 in the TM FSEIS shows that trail 17E21 crosses a meadow
that meets S&G 100. This trail is proposed to be closed to motor vehicle use in
Alternatives 2 and 4, as shown in Table 2.2 of the TM FSEIS. The Forest
acknowledges your support for keeping 17E24 open to motor vehicle travel.
The specific route I use the most is 10N14. On this route alone it would be denying
myself and many others with disabilities access to over 12 full sections of the ENF.
Multiply that by 42 routes and there is a considerable amount of the ENF that would not
be accessible to people with disabilities. If Alternative 3 is chosen I would be more than
happy to volunteer my time to do whatever I can to help correct the issues on route
10N14 and make it useable.

Many of the closed OHV routes offer a unique high-sierra backcountry experience that is
otherwise not available to individuals with disabilities that prevent them from accessing
the backcountry by foot.
Commenter: 218
Response: A discussion of recreation impacts from route closures is presented on
pages 77 to 84 in the TM FSEIS. Table 3.12 shows that restricting motor vehicle
use on road 10N14 does affect access to other routes in Alternatives 2, 3 and 4.
The Forest acknowledges the importance of motorized access. The FSEIS stated
on page 64 “High elevation trails provide access to remote areas on the Forest
especially for older and less able individuals who might otherwise not be able to
enjoy these areas.” The Forest intends to continue working with a variety of user
groups to maintain and improve routes across the Forest including the
implementation of corrective actions on these routes.
Please prioritize route 14N39 for repair and re-opening since the road needs to remain

Commenter: 17
Route or Road # 14N39, Richardson Lake to Sourdough Hill, entire route should be
designated for public motorized access.
Commenter: 216
Response: The Forest acknowledges your support for keeping 14N39 open to
motor vehicle travel. The route would be open under Alternatives 1 and 5, and
open after corrective actions in Alternative 3. Corrective actions for the routes are
also included in Alternative 5. The Forest will continue to work with partners and
user groups to maintain and improve routes across the Forest.
Please allow access to portions of the routes that are not affected by meadows. For
example, 10N01 appears to have a meadow issue on only one end but the entire trail is
marked as closed. Please double check all trails to ensure the maximum access.
Commenter: 17
Response: The portions of routes where motor vehicle use would be restricted
under Alternatives 2 and 3 are based on the locations of meadows not meeting
S&G 100 as well as practical management and use considerations, including the
location of desired destinations, use patterns, route intersections and control
points (gates), etc. In some instance where meadows are located along routes, the
closure point is based on the location of logical turn-around points. In other
Appendix E

instances, the recreational opportunity is through travel, rather than an
intermediate destination. The Forest Service has reviewed all of the routes to
evaluate whether additional portions could reasonably be opened without
impacting the meadows. As a result of this review, Alternative 3 has been
modified slightly in the FSEIS to include designation of the eastern portion of
10N01B and the western portion of 17E24.
Please don’t close lovers leap trail and surrounding strawberry trails as a lifetime El

Commenter: 26
Response: The Lover’s Leap trail is designated as open for public motorized use
in all alternatives except Alternatives 2 and 4. Strawberry 4WD will be
designated in Alternatives 1 and 5 andAlternative 3 will designate this route once
corrective actions are implemented.
Please re-open the Blue Lakes/Dear Valley OHV access trail. My once in a year trip and

I am really concerned with the closure of the Blue Lakes/Deer Valley trail (19E01). This
is my clubs adopt-a-trail. We were instrumental in working with our members of
Congress in the creation of the corridor between the Mokelumne Wilderness and the
Mokelumne Wilderness Addition, assuring that the north/south passage between
Highways 4 and 88 would remain open for 4WD enthusiasts. In 1984 we entered into an
Adopt-a-trail agreement with the ENF and Stanislaus NF to maintain, clean up and
provide other stewardship to the Deer Valley Jeep Trail.
Commenter: 10
Response: The forest acknowledges your support for keeping 19E01 open to
motor vehicle travel. Alternatives1 and 5 propose amending the LRMP and
designating the route. Alternative 3 proposes designating the route after corrective
actions are completed.
The Forest Service has screwed the OHV community by closing sections of forest roads.

The Strawberry, Deer Valley, and Barrett Lake trails are of particular importance to me.
Over the decades, we have watched as historical trails on the summit and all across the
Eldorado have been closed by the Forest Service against the wishes of the locals, and
general public. For all intents and purposes these three trails are the only ones left that are

I am particularly concerned and disappointed about 17E73 and 19E01. Adopt-a-Trail

sources.
Commenter: 81,
RTF is particularly disappointed that 16E21, 17E73, and 19E01 are to be closed until
mitigation is completed because their use is similar to that of the Rubicon Trail. RTF is
concerned that closure until mitigation of these trails will cause additional traffic on the
Trail, and no analysis of this consequence was made. This analysis should be completed
and any effects should be mitigated.
Commenter: 196,
Response: The Forest acknowledges your support for keeping 16E21, 17E73,
and 19E01 open to motor vehicle travel. Alternatives 1 and 5 propose amending

Commenter: 60, 63
Trail 17E28 is listed as not meeting S&G 100; however this is due to single meadow #
17E28-7. All other features in question along this trail either meet S&G 100 or are not
meadows. Due to the importance of the trail it should be included in a non-significant
plan amendment that would allow the route to be kept open.

implementation of corrective actions. It was based on the complexity of
corrective actions needed and factors described on pages 73 and 74 of the FSEIS.
I would vote to make the Bucks Pasture trail open for motorcycles as it once was

and remain relatively intact for a long time.

Commenter: 75
Response: Buck Pasture Trail meets S&G #100 (see Table 2.1), and will be
designated for public motorcycle use.
The Barrett Lake trail already is in compliance with S&G100. This document references
the trail in its description as "The entrance is through a gate, which is designed to limit
the maximum width of vehicles entering the trail. The gate is opened seasonally when the
Hi-Landers (a volunteer group that has adopted the trail) complete spring maintenance
and the District Ranger determines that the trail is in a condition to prevent resource
damage, usually in mid-July. The trail has high use daily while it is open. The gate is
closed in the fall when heavy rain or snow creates conditions that could lead to resource
damage". This in itself is complying with S&G100 and Executive Order 11644 by
"minimizing" impacts to the area.
Commenter: 81
No analysis has been done on Barrett Lake 4WD trail to consider the planning process
currently under way. This bridge will bring the trail in to compliance with S&G100 in
this location, opening several miles to use. No recognition has been made of past efforts
to relocate the trail at one of the meadow locations identified as “not meeting” S&G100.
No mention has been made of barriers placed to keep vehicles out of the meadow while
on the trail. No mention has been made of the impacts to other “unique” trails in the area
when closure will force recreation to trails such as Rubicon, which is in close proximity
and according to this SDEIS. Simply closing the trail for any length of time other than
seasonally, is “arbitrary and capricious”.
The benefits of closing this trail is outweighed by the high value of the recreation
experiences and county revenue stream associated with this trail. Rubicon Trail is also in
ENF and has been identified as a significant source of revenue for El Dorado County in
sales taxes by recreation enthusiasts that spend money while here in the Forest and
County. Because of the close similarities of the recreational values for this trail, the same
could be held true for Barrett Lake 4WD trail. The trail brings in significant revenue for
El Dorado County and the impacts to the County have not been analyzed.
Allow Barrett Lake 4WD trail to remain open to public use while actively pursuing
funding for continued corrective action. Actively recruit and utilize existing AAT
volunteers to begin immediate work to correct problem areas. Acknowledge work done to
date and current planning efforts by analyzing the effects of corrective action done so far.
Commenter: 90, 197
Response: Barrett Lake Trail is not in compliance with S&G #100, as described
in Table 3.8. The Forest recognizes that a number of measures have been taken to
Appendix E

Eldorado National Forest Travel Management

minimize resource impacts, including limiting width of vehicles and reduced
season of use.
It serves no environmental purpose, nor makes any sense to any reasonable person to
close 14N39 to OHV use, when heavy machinery regularly travels on the road. It would
make much more environmental sense to keep the trail open for both maintenance and
OHV use, while utilizing volunteers to correct any issues to S&G100 standards for
BOTH maintenance and OHV access to be closed until mitigation is completed because
of its use is similar to that of the Rubicon Trail. I'm concerned that closure until
mitigation of these trails will cause additional traffic on the Rubicon, and no analysis of
this consequence was made. This analysis should be completed and any effects should be
mitigated.
Furthermore, this trail (14N39) in particular will still require regular travel for
maintenance for the Cell tower and shed at the end of the trail.
Commenter: 81
Response: Alternative 5 was added and it will amend the LRMP to designate this
route while additional corrective actions are being implemented.
Two routes not meeting S&G 100, Clover/Deer Valley and Schneider Camp/Strawberry
connect highways 4, 88 and 50. We would like to see these near the top of the priority
list of routes to receive corrective actions if that course of action is required since they
form an important connection to highways where services are available and provide a
quality high altitude forest travel experience. This is especially pertinent for street
licensed OHVs that can utilize these highways for continued travel to other recreation
destinations.
It appears there are ten of the nineteen routes listed as not meeting S&G 100 that only
have one issue affecting their compliance. Perhaps these routes should be prioritized
among some of the first to be brought into compliance if a determination is made to
perform remediation.
Commenter: 167
We understand that immediate opening may be difficult due to litigation etc. so we would
like to see the following roads focused on first.
Squaw ridge trail near Silver Lake has been in use for over 150 years. I have personally
used these roads for 40 years. I have seen no significant change to any areas on or near
these roads. This road leads from Hwy 88 some 8 plus miles to a place we can park and
access favorite lakes. It is not difficult to traverse via a normal 4x4 vehicle. Even a partial
closure of this road will cut us off from accessing areas we have used for 40 plus years.
Next would be Deer valley trail near blue lakes that leads to Hwy 4. This is yet another
Appendix E

road that if closed will cut of access to areas that have been used for years. We have used
Deer Valley as a connector route many times. Next would be Strawberry road that leads
from Hwy 88 near Caples Lake to Hwy 50. This is yet another connector road that is
used by MANY people for recreation. These are only 3 routs but we feel important to be
focused on first. You need to look at each route and the ones that provide a connection
need and consider opening them.

Response: Appendix B has been added to the FSEIS. The table included in
Appendix B reflects the Forest’s strategy for initiating planning and
implementation of corrective actions. It was based on the complexity of
corrective actions needed and factors described on pages 73 and 74 of the FSEIS.
We take exception, in the DSEIS to the classification of the Deer Valley Jeep Trail being
rated as Medium in the recreational value. The traffic on this trail far exceeds that of the
Barrett Lake Trail due to its being open earlier in the year and allowing passage between
Highway 4 and Highway 88. On any weekend there are many recreationalists camping at
the Deer Creek crossing and at Clover Valley.
Commenter: 192,
Response: Table 3.1 in the FSEIS reflects that the Deer Valley trail has high
value.
Trail 17E28 is listed as not meeting S&G 100; however this is due to single meadow #
17E28-7. All other features in question along this trail either meet S&G 100 or are not
meadows. This is a 3.81 mile “motorcycle” trail that provides unique opportunity on the
Forest. Closure of this trail due to a single issue as is proposed in Alt 4 is not a balanced
approach to providing recreational opportunity while protecting natural resources. This
trail was originally proposed to be kept open under a non-significant plan amendment in
the FEIS/ROS. Due to the importance of the trail it should be included in a nonsignificant plan amendment that would allow the route to be kept open.

Route 17E19 is a unique route that was proposed to be open under a non-significant
Forest Plan Amendment in the FEIS/ROD. The SEIS should include a non-significant
plan amendment to exempt this route from S&G 100 and RCO#2 to allow it to be left
open. This route should be left open to public motorized use.

Since Barrett Lake 4WD is highly rated for recreational value and has been adopted by a
4WD club, and is monitored and closed seasonally by the District Manager, this trail

should be reopened seasonally immediately for all use, including rock crawling in our
Jeep, hiking, biking, ATV, and motorcycle use.
Commenter: 201,
Richardson Lake/ Sourdough Hill is a road not a trail and should be managed as such by
the Forest. It is highly important to keep this route open and it would be far better
maintained via a strong adopt-a-trail presence than to let it be closed for an undetermined
length of time allowing the erosion conditions to accelerate.
Commenter: 203,
We are interested in keeping open Mud Lake road from Tragedy Springs to Mud Lake
and from Allen Camp to Squaw Ridge. We would also like to keep the roads open along
Squaw Ridge.
Commenter: 210,
Response: Alternative 1 proposes to amend the LRMP to designate these routes.
Alternative 5 has been added and proposes to amend the LRMP to designate these
routes prior to completing corrective actions. Alternative 3 designates these
routes after corrective actions are implemented. Alternative 4 designates the
Barrett Lake 4WD trail after corrective actions are implemented.
Route 17E21 is proposed for closure pending mitigation, yet this route borders only one
meadow that actually meets S&G 100 according to the field survey. This route is a
challenging single track that creates a loop with 17E19, 17E28, and 16E26 and is one of
the few trails of its kind. This would greatly diminish availability of this unique
recreational opportunity. This closure does not appear justified because the trail meets
S&G 100. Furthermore there is no other justification for closure of this trail provided in
the SEIS. This trail should remain open to motorized use.
Commenter: 199,
Response: This route would be designated for motorcycle use in Alternatives 1, 3
and 5. It meets Standard and Guideline #100.
Those routes that do not intersect (as defined above), and simply “border” as defined in S
& G 100 shall not be prohibited from public wheeled motorized vehicles until the
Supplemental EIS is completed, nor at any other future time. These routes are: 9N95, all
sections; 16E21 at -1, -2, -3, -4, & -5; and 17E28, all sections.
Commenter: 200,
The phrase “routes may not intersect or bisect meadows” has “no home” in the LRMP or
in the SNFPA. This phrase does not appear in any of the LRMP Meadow Management
Appendix E

Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

Standards and Guides and is not listed under General Direction for any management
practice. The Phrase does not occur in any of the SNFPA ROD Standard and Guides for
Meadows or for Roads.
Response: As described in the background section on pages 3 and 4, the Court
order prohibited public wheeled motorized vehicle use on the 42 routes until such
time as the Forest Service completes a SEIS The decision for this FSEIS will
determine which routes will be designated for public motor vehicle use. The
analysis in this document addresses consistency with Standard and Guideline
#100 (page 36 of this FSEIS) which refers to roads and trails that intercept, divert
or disrupt natural surface and subsurface water paths, regardless of whether the
route intersects or borders a meadow.
The meadows in Indian Valley, Little Indian Valley and Clover Valley have been
extensively damaged by OHV misuse, resulting in head cuts at stream crossings, large
mud holes dug down to the level of the undercut streams, etc. These meadows need to be
protected and restored, especially in light of the predictions for global warming in the
future. Proper functioning meadows that store water later into the season will become
more and more important as a source of clean water —one of the primary purposes of the
National Forest. The Blue Lakes Road area has been heavily damaged by off-road OHV
use in the last 10 years. We support proposals to close user-made trails in that area.
Trail 17E21 is in a largely roadless area east of Silver Lake. While it provides a potential
loop to persons who have come along route 17E24 to the south and west, in this case
motorized use is inappropriate. Our members extensively hike and mountain bike on the
ridge between Silver Lake and Kirkwood, which includes the superb Thunder Mountain
and Horse Canyon trails. There should be some area above Silver Lake that is free from
motorized use.
Route 10N32 (Headwaters, Beanville Creek) should be closed to motorized use because
it is in a sensitive watershed.
Commenter: 221
Response: Alternative 4 was developed to address concerns with these routes and
would result in eliminating them from public motorized use. The routes would
also remain closed in Alternative 2, no action.

Commenter: 6
Response: Following the decision, the Forest will consider a variety of options to
use volunteers in completing corrective actions.
It is imperative that the Forest Service stand their ground and utilize the resources you
have within the 4x4, mountain bike, and motorcycle communities. Clubs are standing
ready, begging for any and all opportunities to work with you to address any trail projects
to ensure our public lands remain open for everyone.

I feel the OHV group as a whole has proven again and again when asked to partner up on
any multi use access program we have given freely of our time and funding through work
programs, donations, and green sticker registration fees. If I could only trace the tail of
the infamous “green sticker OHV” fund I am sure it would cast a very broad net, not the
least of which being projects like those outlined in the SEIS.
Commenter: 40
The off road community has shown their willingness to come together and
improve/maintain routes when a plan is in place. I am sure other users of these trails
would be willing to help also.

mitigation items that need manpower to accomplish.
Commenter: 192,
The Forest Service can get help on doing the work on these 18 routes. There already is a
good history of the OHV community coming to the aid of the Forest Service. The
Rubicon Trail is a perfect example of how work can be done while still leaving the trail
open. You already have some of these routes "adopted". A request from the Forest Service
would get the OHV users out in force to keep their few routes open
Commenter: 222
Response: The Forest will continue to work with partners and user groups to
maintain and improve routes across the Forest and seek funding opportunities
through grants and other sources. Before further corrective actions can begin,
environmental analysis will need to be completed and documented.
