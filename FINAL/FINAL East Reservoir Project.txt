East Reservoir Final Environmental Impact Statement
Chapter 4
Introduction
The East Reservoir Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was released to the public for
comment on June 14, 2013. The DEIS disclosed the analysis of effects related to the environmental
impacts of three alternatives: no action (Alternative 1), the proposed action (Alternative 2), and an
alternative that addressed concerns identified during the scoping of the proposed action (Alternative 3).
This Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) displays the status of the analysis since the release of
the DEIS. Chapter 4 discusses changes made to Alternative 2, the agency preferred alternative since
receipt of public comments on the DEIS, and errata to the DEIS. Chapter 5 provides an update on public
involvement activities, displays public comments on the DEIS and the agency responses, and finally a list
of the recipients of this FEIS.
Changes between Draft and Final EIS
This chapter highlights and discusses several changes that have been made to Alternative 2 as a result of
public comments (see Chapter 5) and further refinement by the East Reservoir Interdisciplinary Team
(IDT). Factual corrections to the DEIS are included in this FEIS to reflect errors (see Errata Table 1 pages
4 through 26).
Between the draft EIS and FEIS for East Reservoir Project, the federal status of the wolverine changed
from a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act to proposed for threatened status under
ESA. On February 4, 2013 the USFWS published in the Federal Register a proposed rule to list the
distinct population segment of the North American wolverine occurring in the contiguous United States,
as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. On February 5, 2014 this ruling was extended
for six months. The February 2013 proposed 4(d) rule listed several activities that were not considered
significant threats to the species and would not result in incidental take and a violation of section 9 of the
ESA. The USFWS identified no Forest Service management activities that threaten wolverines. The
change in status did not affect the analysis conducted for the species under the East Reservoir Project
therefore no additional consultation is necessary. The new determination, based solely on the change in
status, for the wolverine, is that the East Reservoir project will not jeopardize the continued existence of
the species.
Alternative 2 with Modifications
Alternative 2 with Modifications consists of the original Alternative 2 with some activities analyzed under
Alternative 3 in order to respond to public concerns regarding loss of access by motorized vehicles and
snowmobiles. The changes to Alternative 2 are minor, and it is sufficient and appropriate to file the DEIS
(June 2013) with the FEIS (September 2013) as the final documentation for this project (40 CFR
1503.4(c)).
The activities incorporated from Alternative 3 discussed in the Draft EIS are as follows:
• Unit F19 which is adjacent to state land on the Koocanusa Reservoir near the mouth of Cripple Horse
Creek was added during additional field reconnaissance and includes slashing and burning to address
excess fuels. Analysis can be found in the DEIS, Chapter 3, page 177.
• Road #4904, in the Boundary Mountain area, will be changed from restricted yearlong to restricted
seasonally (10/15 – 06/30) to give additional access to the trailhead for Trail #425. Open road density
analysis regarding this change can be found in the DEIS, Chapter 3, page 224.
• The five motorized trails (279, 280, 420, 426, 500) will change from motorized to non-motorized for a
total of about 27 miles to improve big game security. Trails 281 and 420 will remain as motorized trials
creating a loop which incorporates open NFS roads. This has been analyzed in Alternative 3. The
reason for changing the motorized routes to non-motorized was to increase big game security. The
existing security is 28% which is below the recommendation of 30%. Security increases from 28% to
33.4% even while leaving the loop as motorized. Thus a balance of uses are achieved with big game
security increased while leaving some opportunity for motorized recreation. Refer to the DEIS, Chapter

3, table 3.86 for more information.
• Two undetermined roads in the Canyon Bay area will be decommissioned to protect resource values at
risk (Table 2.22). These are roads #5298 and 2598A (0.24 miles).
• A new non-motorized trail within the East Reservoir analysis area will be created as described in
Alternative 3.This trail will increase an established recreation area along the Koocanusa Reservoir.
The changes made to Alternative 2 are within the scope and context of the environmental effects disclosed
in the DEIS, Biological Assessments, Biological Evaluation, and supporting documentation located in the
project file (PF).
ERRATA
The following are errors that were discovered after copies of the DEIS were printed. The changes
were determined by the interdisciplinary team to be minor and will not change the conclusions
presented in the DEIS. These corrections were reviewed by the deciding official prior to the decision
documented in the Record of Decision.

Table 1 – DEIS Errata
LOCATION in DEIS

CORRECTION

S-3

In Table S.1, under Provide Amenities, Jobs and Products to the Communities; Timber Harvest
Volume. CCF; Alternative 3 should be 67,987 rather than 7.782 that appear in the DEIS.
Under “Watershed Rehabilitation”, add “Miles of Existing Road to be Decommissioned” in
Alternative 2 would equal 5.93 miles which is missing in the DEIS.
Under “Watershed Rehabilitation”, Miles of Road Put in to Long-term Storage should be 17.62 miles
which is missing in the DEIS.
Alternative 2 proposes multiple regeneration harvests that exceed 40 acres in size. These units were
proposed to try to implement treatments that would have been more commensurate to historical patch
sizes while also favoring more fire resilient species. They are proposed on more moist sites that would
have typically experienced mixed to stand replacing fire severity at a scale of hundreds to thousands of
acres in size. Additionally, Units 147, 148, 149 and 150 in Upper Fivemile Creek and Unit 170 in
Warland Creek were designed to tie in with past regeneration harvests to simulate a fire that would
have burned from the creek bottom to the ridge top due to continuous fuels and favorable topography.
This would have been more typical of historic patch size and burn pattern when strategically located
directly adjacent to existing regeneration harvests that are still an effective barrier to high fire spread
rates. Treatments of this scale are also more likely to disrupt large fire growth and spread and assist in
the efficacy of suppression efforts when a fire occurs in these areas. Fire modeling indicates these areas
are at risk of experiencing stand-replacing crown fire behavior if left untreated and both areas are
within 1 ¼ miles of private property. In addition to the benefits described previously, Unit 362 near
Hornet Ridge (Dunn Creek) was partially designed to provide a fuel break immediately adjacent to a
major power transmission line. The other regeneration harvest units exceeding 40 acres (units 40, 62,
363, 73T, 75, 80, and 188) were not specifically designed with fire and fuels as the primary purpose
because they are not strategically located to mimic a fire burning to the top of a ridge from the lower
1/3rd of a slope nor do they reduce the potential threat of a wildfire to private property. These
treatments would still be effective at reducing hazardous fuels, reducing crown fire potential, and
improving fire suppression efficacy. The proposed regeneration harvests under Alternative 2 would
accomplish an additional 507 acres of hazardous fuel reduction than the same units identified under
Alternative 3.
Paragraph 2: After the sentence, “This strategy may result in openings…greater number of openings of
lesser acreage.” Add the following: Therefore, with the implementation of an action alternative,
Alternative 2 which promotes large patch size, would better address the issues of edge effect,
fragmentation, and interior forests than Alternative 3 which limits regeneration harvest units to 40
acres or less.
Paragraph 7: “…would result in a MA 12 habitat effectiveness of xx% as compared to the existing
level of 70%.” The xx % should read as 74%.

After the sentences, “This could result in openings that may not be fully utilized by lynx and snowshoe
hare as foraging areas. Creating these openings reduces overall edge effect and fragmentation that
would occur with greater number of openings of lesser acreage.” Therefore, Alternative 2 which
promotes large patch size, would better address the issues of edge effect, fragmentation, and interior
forests than Alternative 3 which limits regeneration harvest units to 40 acres or less.

Chapter 5 - Public Involvement
Public Involvement Summary
The following section summarizes public involvement since the inception of the project. More detailed
information is available in the project file.
Proposed Action Development
During the spring of 2010, the District conducted a broad scale assessment of the East Reservoir Project
area to identify management needs. This assessment characterized trends in the human, terrestrial, and
aquatic features, as well as the vegetative conditions and ecological processes. Project area needs
identified as important to implement within the next 10 years formulated the proposed action for the East
Reservoir Project.
Proposed Action Scoping
Site-specific public comments on the East Reservoir Project proposed action were requested in December
2010 through a public scoping notice (Notice of Intent) in the Daily Inter Lake, Western News and the
Kootenai Valley Record. Also a letter requesting comments was mailed to all interested individuals,
groups, and officials. Comments received during scoping were used to help develop alternatives to the
proposed action.
Public Comments on the DEIS
In June 2013, the District issued a Notice of Availability of the East Reservoir Draft EIS in the Federal
Register (June 14, 2013) and a letter was mailed to interested parties reporting on the updated project
status and requesting comments. A total of eleven comment letters were received during this scoping
period.
Each comment letter was carefully considered by the interdisciplinary team, District Ranger and District
Staff. Letters were analyzed and categorized to capture the full range of public viewpoints and concerns
about the DEIS (Project File, Vol. D).
The analysis of comments is not a vote-counting process but rather is designed to discover concerns and
develop alternatives to the proposed action where appropriate. Table 2 lists the DEIS commenter and the
letter number as it appears in the Response to Comments.
Kootenai Forest Stakeholders Coalition and the Yaak Valley Forest Council
The East Reservoir Interdisciplinary Team (IDT) worked closely with the project team from the Kootenai
Forest Stakeholders Coalition including the Yaak Valley Forest Council. The Kootenai Forest
Stakeholders are a group of individuals and organizations representing diverse interests, to develop the
project proposal and alternatives and help facilitate public involvement.
Tribal Involvement
The concerns of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes were solicited through project scoping. In
addition, Loretta Stevens, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes/Kootenai NF Tribal liaison
participated as an IDT member.
Other Agency Involvement
The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) was consulted regarding fish and wildlife habitat.

Final Environmental Impact Statement

The FWS concurred on August 8, 2013, that the project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the
Canada lynx or Canada lynx critical habitat and that the project may affect but is not likely to adversely
affect the grizzly bear. The FWS stated the project is consistent with the Access Amendment and would
not adversely affect the threatened grizzly bear in ways other than those analyzed in the 2011 biological
opinion for the Access Amendment. Biological assessments document that the project will have no effect
on Spalding’s catchfly, bull trout or white sturgeon.
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency submitted
scoping and DEIS comments on the project.

Response to Comments on the DEIS
The following section provides a summary of substantive comments, as allowed in 40 CFR 1503.4, and
responds in detail to those comments. Where similar comments were received, representative comments
were chosen for response.
Letter 1:

Montana Department of Environmental Quality

Comment 1: Water Protection Bureau: This construction is routine and may only require a construction storm water
permit if the permitting threshold is reached. I am enclosing the Water Protection Bureau Fact Sheet that will allow
you to plan permit needs according to your site conditions. If after looking at the fact sheet, you determine that your
project may require further consultation with Water Protection Bureau staff please contact them.
Response: On March 20, 2013, in Decker v. NEDC, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s decision in
NEDC v. Brown and held that the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations do not require the NPDES
permits for stormwater discharges from logging roads into the navigable waters of the United States. Note that,
while NPDES permits for logging roads are not necessary, our proposals may require other permits prior to
implementation. NEPA's DEIS requirements for declaring what Federal permits may be necessary still stand (40
CFR 1502.25(b)) as does the requirement to invite comments from the agencies which regulate those permits (40
CFR 1503.1).
==================================================================================
Comment 2: Water Quality Planning Bureau: Proposed actions near streams could increase siltation. Cripple Horse
Creek is currently impaired for aquatic life support and cold-water fisheries due to siltation from agriculture, natural
sources, and silviculture. Other waterbodies in the project area have not been assesses and may also be near
thresholds for impairment.
We encourage you to regularly evaluate whether project best management practices (BMP) are
sufficient to address the sediment increases that are likely to incur due to logging operations, road construction, and
increased availability of sediment to transport to river systems. These BMPs must be sufficient to protect existing
water quality and should be moving the watershed towards meeting water quality standards.
Response: The Forest Service has worked closely with the State of Montana with regard to BMP design,
implementation and monitoring. A list of BMPs was included in the DEIS Appendix C. Additional design criteria
can be found in Appendix 2 of this draft ROD. Both the State of Montana and Forest Service have conducted
implementation and effectiveness monitoring (FEIS, Appendix I). It is expected that the activities proposed with this
project, combined with the listed BMPs and design criteria, will at a minimum maintain current conditions and in
some cases improve conditions within the watershed.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Final Environmental Impact Statement

“All action alternatives include specific BMPs which are designed to disconnect the road system from the stream
(e.g. prevent sediment from going down ditches directly into the stream). The implementation of BMPs may also
diffuse the effects of roads intercepting and rerouting water. In addition, upgrading undersized culverts would enable
the streams to accommodate higher flows more readily without resulting in aggradation or degradation at the inlets
and outlets of culverts.” (DEIS, Ch. 3, Water Resources, Environmental Consequences, pg. 153).

Letter 2:

United States Department of the Interior

Comment 1: The U.S. Department of the Interior has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the
east Reservoir Project, Libby District, Kootenai National Forest, Lincoln County, MT. and has no comments on the
document. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service advises that any Endangered Species Act issues will be addressed
through the Section 7 consultation process.
Response: Thank you for your interest in this project. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been consulted on this
project with concurrence received on August 8, 2013. Their response is located in the project file – Section U;
Document U1.

Letter 3:

Alliance for the Wild Rockies

Comment: Table 2.13 indicates that Alt. 2 would result in 1,118 acres of even-aged/regeneration logging (ST, SW,
CC, etc.) units that would be > 40 acres, which violates NFMA and therefore requires Regional Forester approval.
Response: That is correct, the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 [16 USC 1604 (g) (3) (F) (IV)],
establishes opening size limits according to geographic areas, forest types, or other suitable classifications.
Regulations establish the size limit for our geographic area at 40 acres, with exceptions for larger openings when
they will produce a more desirable combination of net public benefits.
==================================================================================
Comment: Table 2.15 indicates that Alt. 3 would limit the size of even-aged/ regeneration logging units to 40 acres.
However, there are many IMP and San-Salvage units that are well over 40 acres included in Alt. 3.
Response: Improvement and sanitation harvests are intermediate harvests that remove only a portion of the trees,
retaining a manageable stand. These treatments do not create an opening therefore they can be over 40 acres and do
not need Regional Forester approval.
=================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS’s action alternatives propose road storage and obliteration, which will close some roads and
make others hydrologically neutral and closed to all travel. AWR is in favor of those actions and believes that they
should be a high priority.
Response: Thank you for your support in this area.
==================================================================================
Comment: There is hardly any feature on forest landscapes that is more damaging to forest resources than roads.
Roads are often not adequately maintained to prevent damage – such as sediment delivery to streams - due to
inadequate Forest Service funding. For the same reason, AWR is also opposed to any new road construction,
especially in areas where road density is already extremely high such as the East Reservoir PA.
Response: Your comments will be taken into consideration.
==================================================================================
Comment: We urge the Forest Service to identify the “right-sized” minimum road system for the project area
required by the Travel Management Rule (36 CFR 212.5); identify the details of a plan in the FEIS that will achieve
that, and then make a decision that, while it may conflict with some short-term interests such as commercial logging,
will lead to long-term ecological improvement in targeted watersheds.
Response: The Travel Management Rule (Nov. 9, 2005) directs the Forest Service to conduct travel analysis to inform
decisions related to travel management. The East Reservoir travel analysis has identified the minimum road system needed
for safe and efficient travel and for administration, utilization and protection of National Forest System (NFS) lands (36
CFR 212.5(b) (1)). The analysis was used to inform decisions for the designation of roads for motor vehicle use in the
project area, as shown on pages 3-394 through 3-403 of the FEIS.
==================================================================================
Comment: Please disclose in the FEIS the miles of road proposed for storage that fall in to the category of those that
may be stored by taking no action because they are currently hydrologically inert. This is important because
reconstruction of some revegetated roads would have the same adverse impacts as new road construction.
Response: Your comment will be taken into consideration.
==================================================================================
SOIL
Comment: Perhaps the most important ecological feature for forest ecosystems is the functioning and integrity of
the soil. “Soil is a critical component to nearly every ecosystem in the world, sustaining life in a variety of ways—
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 27

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

from production of biomass to filtering, buffering and transformation of water and nutrients. …Because soils are
critically important building blocks for nearly every ecosystem on earth, an holistic approach to natural resources
protection requires that soils be protected…” (Lacy, 2001) A holistic restoration proposal would reduce the legacy
effects from past timber harvest, and other human-caused disturbances which may affect watershed health and the
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
The Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (SQS) are quantitative (<15% detrimental soil disturbance), demonstrating
consistency and compliance involves disclosing the amount of detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) that now exists in
Activity Areas, and what the cumulative totals would be following disturbance by trails, roads, fire lines, and other
causes of DSD. Moreover, the Forest Service should recognize and acknowledge the fact that the 15% threshold is
not based upon scientifically developed limitations on damage to soils and take the necessary steps to remedy that
situation.
Response: The 15% threshold is based on research by Powers (1990). In order to meet NFMA direction and manage
National Forest System lands without permanent impairment, the policy of the Northern Region is to “…not create
detrimental soil disturbance on more than 15 percent of an activity area” (FSM, 2554.03). In areas where more than
15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior harvest activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from project
implementation and restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and should move
towards a net soil improvement.
R1 Supplement 2500-99-1 (effective 11/12/1999) definition – Restoration - Treatments that restore vital soil
functions to their inherent range of variability. It is recognized that treatments may not occur over a period of years
and may need to be maintained. Restoration treatments could include, but are not limited to, tilling, ripping, seeding,
mulching, recontouring if temporary roads and water barring.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS provides a very vague explanation of the methods used to use measured soil survey data from
assessment in the field to estimate total DSD for each proposed treatment unit. The accuracy of estimates given for
previously impacted units is doubtful.
Response: As discussed on page 62 (DEIS, Chapter 3)…”All units containing evidence of existing soil disturbance
related to past management activities received a full qualitative field survey using R1 Soil Survey Procedures. Field
soil surveys consisted of random stratified transect/sample point methods with confidence intervals at or above 80%
± 5% with the majority of surveys being 95% ± 5%. Completed soil surveys can be found in the Soil Project File
and/or District Files. Existing detrimental soil disturbance numbers are a result of all currently measureable effects of
past actions in each activity area, including but not limited to timber harvest (trails and landings), temporary road
construction, management related burns, cattle grazing, off highway vehicles, natural disturbances, firewood
gathering, etc. These methods provide data that is used in the analysis to determine if Forest Plan and Regional Soil
Quality Standards would be met...”
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS states that there has been a lot of logging in the project area in the past, in the era when soil
impacts were of much lesser concern and therefore soil integrity was less protected. The fact that the DEIS does not
even estimate the amount of DSD over the vast majority of those acres ignores cumulative effects on soil
productivity and watershed health, which the Forest Service is required by NFMA to maintain. The soil quality
standards the DEIS relies upon mostly limit damage to soils while carrying out the next set of management actions,
without providing any scientifically justified metrics for maintaining soil productivity.
Response: The spatial scale or geographic bounds for considering the cumulative effects consist of the same activity
areas analyzed for the direct and indirect effects. This is appropriate because soil productivity is spatially static and
productivity in one location does not affect productivity in another location. The activity areas are delineated as
directed by Forest Service Manual R-1 Supplement No. 2500-99-1.
As stated on page 97 (DEIS, Chapter 3)…”The temporal scale dependent on the issue being addressed with no one
scale being appropriate for all issues…..Furthermore, there is often a lag between some options and the observed
effect. This is particularly true for soils…”
=================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS also fails to adequately explain how measurements of conditions relating to measured soil
damage equate with effects on short- and long-term soil productivity. The DEIS also ignores much science when it
claims that soil erosion, displacement, and compaction do not affect soil productivity.
Response: Regarding soil productivity: As stated on page 96 (DEIS, Chapter 3)…”This project was designed to
provide for a continuous supply of woody material based on recommendations by Graham et al. (1994) and brown et
al. (2003)….It should be noted that currently under the KNFP, the required CWD tons per acre to be retained only
applies to regeneration harvest activities. In stand improvement units such as commercial thins, future CWD is
expected to result from natural events such as blow-over, root rot and beetle kill…”
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 28

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Regarding soil erosion, displacement, and compaction: As stated on page 63 (DEIS, Chapter 3), the KNF does
consider soil erosion, displacement and compaction equally as follows…”The soils in an activity area are considered
detrimentally disturbed at a given sample point when one or a combination of any of the following attributes listed
below is present due to past forest management activities:
a. Compaction: A 15% increase in natural bulk density. Soil compaction reduces the supply of air, water and
nutrients to plants. Roading, ground based yarding, dozer and grapple piling activities are the major contributors
to compaction.
b. Soil Ruts: Machine-generated soil displacement having smeared the soil surface in a rut. Wheel ruts at least 2
inches deep in wet soils.
c. Displacement: Removal of one inch or more surface soil continuous area greater than 100 sq. feet which often
consists of the O and A soil horizons. Displacement removes the most productive part of the soil resource.
Temporary roads, skid trails, ground-based yarding, dozer piling and cable corridors are the major contributors to
displacement.
d. Surface Erosion: Indicated by rills, gullies, pedestals and localized soil displacement.
e. Severely burned Soils: Physical and biological changes to the soil resulting from high-intensity burns of long
duration in the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation Handbook (FSH 2509.13).
f. Soil Mass Movement: Any soil mass movement caused by management activity.
==================================================================================
Comment: The March 2009 “Region 1 Approach to Soils NEPA Analysis Regarding Detrimental Soil Disturbance
in Forested Areas: A Technical Guide” states, “When these indicators (compaction, rutting, burn severity,
displacement, surface erosion and mass movement) are found, the soil is considered disturbed. When management
activities cause the indicators to exceed the threshold established in the soil quality standards, the disturbance is
considered detrimental (potentially impairing productivity).” The DEIS fails to demonstrate that the disturbances
noted in soil surveys for the ER PA meet objectively and reasonably established thresholds.
Response: The adequacy of the Soils Technical Guide is beyond the scope of this project. The above summarizes
only what may be present on a single location within a proposed unit. Total DSD calculations are a quantification
summary for the entire unit along with temporary roads and landings. As a result, the total detrimental values to
determine if soil disturbance exceeds 15% are a quantitative summary value.
==================================================================================
Comment: The March 2009 Region 1 Technical Guide indicates that the Forest Service allows those doing soil
surveys to lack basic scientific training or other proper qualifications. Potentially untrained personnel are the one
ones collecting the field data, therefore solely making the determination of what is or what is not DSD. It is not clear
if the KNF surveys for this project were collected by properly trained and qualified individuals.
Response: All data for the East Reservoir Project were either collected by the KNF Forest Soil Scientist or someone
who has been trained in soil survey procedures.
==================================================================================
Comment: Also, the March 2009 Region 1 Technical Guide does not specify or define the various levels of soil
survey intensity, which would allow the public to understand how soil surveys themselves can provide accurate
information. Legacy soil damage such as compaction may not be evident from simple visual surveys or shovel tests.
Furthermore, the accuracy of soil compaction estimates using the survey methodology the KNF utilized cannot be
determined, because the DEIS did not disclose the accuracy and reliability of those techniques.
Response: The adequacy of the Soil Technical Guide is beyond the scope of this project.
The soil surveys completed by the KNF Soil Scientist or KNF Soil Assistant are completed with equal intensity thus
resulting in a confidence interval at or above 80% ± 5% with the majority of surveys being 95% ± 5%. As a result,
the KNF reviews provide a very accurate quantitative value of what the existing physical conditions are within the
proposed management units. All data points are consistently sampled by reviewing the existing soil at every other
pace. Each pace is considered to be a sample location and soil review is completed with a tile spade shovel to
determine the resistance to penetrating the soil. Physical resistance to penetration was found to correlate well with
altered soil conditions related to management activities. In areas displaying the strongest properties of legacy soil
compaction, the shovel blade is only capable of penetrating a short distance into the soil and with great effort.
The accuracy in soil disturbance values has been solidified through a very intensive post-harvest soil monitoring
program of units previously harvested and had fuel treatments completed. This soil monitoring program originated
in 1988 and is continuing into the future. As of 2012, a sum of 254 timber sales (538 timber sale units) involving
6,625 acres have been monitored following harvest and fuel abatement activities to determine the impacts of timber
removal activities on soils within the KNF. This information has been used to solidify the amount of disturbance
expected to occur based on differing harvest practices using different pieces of machinery.
==================================================================================
Comment: The KNF apparently has no regulatory mechanism, based on NFMA, which addresses the permanent
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 29

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

loss of soil and land productivity due to influx of noxious weeds caused by active management. The DEIS cites no
monitoring results that demonstrate affirmative control of noxious weed outbreaks, nor is any monitoring of the
efficacy of noxious weed treatments cited in the ER PA.
Response: The East Reservoir DEIS (DEIS pg. 329) has incorporated by reference the Kootenai National Forest
Invasive Plant Management FEIS/ROD (2007) (KNFIPM FEIS/ROD) which addresses the environmental effects of
invasive plant treatments and authorizes control including chemical and biological control. The EIS also states, “field
studies of the effects of herbicides on soil microorganisms are limited. The risk assessments conducted by SERA
conclude that the plausibility of adverse effects on soil productivity from any of the proposed herbicides is minimal.
Results from studies on 2,4- D, aminopyralid, chlorsulfuron, clopyrali, and metsulfuron methyl indicate that the
maximum concentrations projected in the soil following herbicide application would be below the toxic effect level.
Laboratory and/or field studies on the other eight herbicides (dicamba, glyphosate, hexazinone, imazapic, imazapyr,
picloram, sulfometuron methyl, triclopyr) indicate some level of inhibition in soil microbial activity but substantial
impacts on soil – i.e. gross changes in capacity of soil to support vegetation – do not seem plausible. Field
experience in the use of these herbicides in cropland situations indicates no change in soil productivity that would
inhibit plant growth (KNFIPM FEIS pg. 3-100).”
=================================================================================
HABITAT– Large Woody Debris
Comment: As recognized by the Forest Service in documentation for other projects: “[l]arge woody debris is
essential for maintenance of sufficient microorganism populations and long-term site productivity.” (IPNF’s Bussel
484 DEIS at 161.) In order for to adequately analyze and disclose cumulative effects, in the context of such
“essential” factors, field surveys of representative past logged areas must be performed in the project area. The DEIS
fails to disclose data from project area surveys for coarse woody debris in old logging units, which is necessary in
order to accomplish an adequate cumulative effects analysis.
Response: Under the snag analysis, starting on page 210, the DEIS (Chapter 3) discloses that harvest units
implemented prior to the 1987 Forest Plan lack sufficient snags and subsequent down woody debris. Likewise, it
discloses that areas cut between 1987 and 1992 contain modest amounts of down wood. Similarly, the snag analysis
gave areas within 100 feet of any road a zero value for providing snags and down wood. These conservative values
are considered worse-case estimates, which more than account for the lack of down wood and snags within some
areas of the analysis area and allow for a realistic analysis for this resource.
=================================================================================
Comment: Applying the concept of Historic Range of Variability (HRV) for sustaining forest ecosystems, as the
DEIS does, may be appropriate as long as the uncertainties pertaining to reference conditions of the project area are
addressed, and all important resource conditions are adequately considered within the HRV framework. The DEIS,
unfortunately, represents an imbalanced use of the HRV concept. For example, given the paucity of historical data of
timber stands and landscape patterns in the project area, and given that existing data is obsolete, the DEIS’s analysis
does cannot adequately support the proposed manipulation of timber stands. It is extremely important to utilize
recently gathered data in order to make accurate determinations of the reference conditions and to be able to
therefore correctly identify departures from the reference conditions (Churchill, 2011; Noss, 2001).
Response: Churchill (2011) was written to provide a science summary for mesic forests for the Colville National
Forest restoration strategy. Churchill (2011) explains how HRV needs to use a variety of tools, it is not as simple as
just having current data.
“………Use multiple tools to derive site specific targets: Pre-settlement conditions offer a baseline from which to
evaluate current conditions and obtain a general direction for restoration. They are especially useful in identifying
conditions that are clearly outside of historical precedent. They can often tell us clearly what not to do. Deriving
specific targets from HRV is much more difficult, as the range of historical conditions is so wide. HRV should be
combined with functional information and tools such as habitat requirements for focal species, fire modeling (e.g.
flammap), aquatic restoration needs, and other objectives….”
In addition, Noss (2011) states:
“…the variable nature of ecosystems suggests that conservationists have a moving target. …One of the most useful
new ideas is the concept of “natural” or “historic” range of variability. This concept recognizes that natural
ecosystems are always changing, but that variation over time falls within certain bounds. …Many ecologists
consider the historic range of variability before European settlement (in North America) to be the appropriate set of
“reference conditions” for comparison with human-altered conditions and a guide to enlightened management.…The
logic behind the use of historic variability to guide ecosystem conservation and management is compelling. …The
challenge for conservationists is not to prevent change. A sustainable relationship with a dynamic earth requires that
we allow ecosystems to respond to environmental change with minimal losses of biodiversity. That means assuring
that the changes we impose on ecosystems are within the range of variability that native species have experienced
over their evolutionary histories.”
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Final Environmental Impact Statement

In order to understand the variations ecosystems have experienced over time, a variety of data sources are needed.
For instance, Noss makes reference to data from fire scars on trees and pollen and charcoal laid down in lake
sediments that helped assess and understand fire-return intervals and proportions of old growth in the Oregon Coast
Range over the last 3,000 years. Such data could have been gathered several decades ago and still be relevant when
it comes to understanding the historic range of variability in a forested environment.
Managing the forest for multiple resources while attempting to emulate natural processes is not an exact science
where there is one correct solution. The reference conditions that are used in this project analysis were derived from
a variety of sources. The ranges of conditions are estimates based on a synthesis of information from research of
historic vegetation (Lesica 1996, Losensky 1994, Fisher and Bradley 1987) as well as other documents and analysis
such as the Interior Columbia River basin Ecosystem Management Project (USDA, USDI 1997). Historic and prehistoric information (back to 351 A.D.) from research (Chatters and Leavell 1995) of bog cores (analyzed to identify
the species composition from pollen found in the cores) were also used to develop the reference ranges. The
reference conditions used in this analysis are documented in the Vegetation Response Unit Characterizations and
Target Landscape Prescriptions (USDA Forest Service 1999).
District vegetation databases (FACTS, FSVeg), a R1 Summary Database and field reconnaissance were utilized to
generate information on forest vegetation attributes such as forest cover type, stand density and successional stage,
the vegetation response unit (VRU) classification, incidents of insect and disease, as well as information on past
activities. Annual aerial observations of insect and disease activities were also evaluated to facilitate understanding
of longer term fluctuations in insect and disease dynamics across the landscape. Aerial photographs, both historic
and contemporary were used at various stages of the analysis. Scientific literature, field reviews and subsequent
silvicultural assessment were also used in the analysis. These analysis tools were used to identify site-specific
treatment needs that address the purpose and need for the project.
The inherent limitations to the database and models are recognized. Not all surveys and subsequent data come from
the same time period, with some surveys over 20 years old. A portion of the areas with older data were field
reviewed and determined it was still valid for analysis. The data is used primarily for broad generalizations,
arithmetic sums and means, and to supplement current, site-specific information gathered at each proposed unit and
area of interest. R1 FSVeg has adequate resolution and accuracy for applications required in this effects analysis
discussion.
We are not attempting to recreate past conditions, and do acknowledge that the modern human imprint cannot be
eliminated. Our proposal to restore ecosystems within a broad historical range is an attempt to keep all the parts, and
to maintain a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, based on coarse filter management theories.
Proposed management activities are designed to fit within acceptable and manageable historic ranges (reference
conditions) we have identified, and are designed to foster the processes and patterns that make up the ecosystem.
Knowledge of historic conditions and natural disturbance processes, as described in the VRUs later in this analysis,
can help clarify the types, extent and causes of ecosystem changes, and can help identify management objectives and
restoration priorities (Brown 2004). It is hypothesized where community composition and structure occur within a
historic range of conditions, the function of the landscape community will also be maintained within its historic
range. It is important to note that function cannot be maintained by restoring the vegetation structure, composition
and patch size without restoring fire on the landscape. No mechanical means alone can duplicate the unique
ecological effects of wildland fire, such as soil heating, nutrient recycling, and the resulting effects to the community
composition and structure (Kauffman 2004, pg. 880).
Reference conditions provide insights to important questions such as natural frequency, intensity and scale of
disturbances, abundance and rareness of plant and animal species, and the age-class, size classes, and tree species
composition (Kaufman et al. 1994). They also provide a valuable tool when combined with other information
gathered from a variety of sources, such as site-specific investigation, old timber type data, old photos, fen (bog)
sediment analysis, fire scar analysis, historical and research references, and inferences from VRU classifications
designed for the Kootenai National Forest.
==================================================================================
OLD GROWTH
Comment: Whereas the project, according to the DEIS, would retain the largest trees in treated units, the DEIS also
discloses that logging of some large-diameter trees may occur. This is inconsistent with the best science on the
relative scarcity of large, old trees on the landscape—even outside old growth. (E.g., Hessburg, et al. 2007.) The
action alternatives would be more in sync with the latest science if a diameter limit on tree removal was adopted that
would leave standing the vast majority of large, old trees in treated units.
Response: Silvicultural prescriptions will generally focus on retention of the largest trees in the stand, which are

usually the most fire-resistant (Agee and Skinner 2005). Generally, the largest trees are left in every stand but it
depends on logging systems and on the tree condition and species. Large diameter trees will be cut if they will not
be expected to remain standing after dying for a reasonable period of time, or will not survive a fire. Some species
have structural characteristics (moderately rot resistant wood, deep root system) that allow them to stand for years
after dying, making good long-lasting snags (e.g. western larch and ponderosa pine). These species are left for
multiple purposes including providing for future snags. The DEIS displays the number of trees per acre (or square
feet of basal area) that will be retained by prescription as well as the replacement snags per vegetation type. All
snags 10” in diameter and great will be left on all treatment areas where they exist.
=================================================================================
Comment: Due to the fact that the KNF apparently lacks an accurate, reliable forestwide old-growth inventory, it
appears that the Forest Service is unwilling to take the most basic, necessary steps to assure viability of old growth
dependent wildlife.
Response: The amount and distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest
Plan Monitoring Report. These reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website and in the Project File
for East Reservoir. The KNF is currently meeting old growth standards set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: According to the ER DEIS, the majority of the unmanaged stands in the watershed are mature forest.
There is definitely a need to manage timber so that an adequate amount of this habitat exists and will continue to
exist on the KNF.
Response: The existing condition of the vegetation was compared to the desired condition and treatment was
proposed on stands were the existing condition did not resemble the desired conditions. In some cases, due to the
management area designation like old growth, a stand was not proposed for treatment due to other resource
objectives.
==================================================================================
Comment: Regarding the maintenance of potential future old growth: the lack of a desired condition statement for
this important wildlife habitat compromises the scientific credibility of the DEIS. Whereas the DEIS includes active
management prescribed to meet some desired conditions related to vegetation, a high priority should be to identify
areas that would be specifically preserved as old growth - in order to maintain long term habitat for old-growth MIS
and other key wildlife. The areas selected to be preserved should be based on the HRV of old growth and the latest
ecological science 1 are necessary to meet forest plan and legal requirements for insuring viable populations of
wildlife.
Response: Recognition of the need and desire for a variety of habitats for wildlife, including old growth, is
demonstrated by the first two statements under the purpose and need for the proposed action. The amount and
distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest Plan Monitoring Report.
These reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently meeting old growth
standards set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: The EIS conflates “replacement old growth” with old growth that meets Green et al. criteria in various
analyses. This is not in accord with the best science, NFMA, or NEPA, since the DEIS admits that “replacement” old
growth is not required to meet the criteria.
Largely because of past logging, the project area falls well below the HRV for old-growth habitat conditions—even
well below the 10% forest plan distribution standard. We appreciate that the DEIS documents the FS designating
“replacement” old growth to meet and even exceed the 10% distribution standard, however the result, as indicated on
Old Growth Map 10, is still highly fragmented habitat with no dedicated habitat areas for connectivity. This is not
consistent with the best available science.
Response: While areas designated as old growth are not currently optimal, these areas are very well connected as
demonstrated by the amount of cover disclosed under the analysis for large ungulates (i.e. elk, deer, etc.). Current
cover levels on National Forest and US Army Corp. of Engineer lands exceeds 80% of the analysis area
==================================================================================
Comment: Information from the KNF’s Gautreaux (1999) indicates that about 22% old forest or old growth is at the
lower limit for “reference conditions” on the KNF. The KNF’s Dueker and Sullivan, 2001 state: “We recognize that
historical conditions probably provided a higher level of old forest habitat through time than what is provided by the
Forest Plan direction (a mean of 27.7% as opposed to 10%).” So utilization of the Forest Plan’s 10% old-growth
Standard itself is not consistent with the KNF’s own best available science on “reference conditions.” Lesica (1996)
1

See for example, Camp et al. 1997 regarding “old-growth refugia”, or the areas on the landscape where old growth would likely
persist in the face of natural disturbances, based upon such factors as slope, aspect, juxtaposition with streams, and forest types.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

stated that use of 10% as minimum old-growth standard may result in extirpation of some species. This is based on
his estimate that 20-50% of low and many mid-elevation forests were in old growth condition prior to European
settlement. The KNF has never completed an analysis, based upon the best scientific information available, that
adequately analyzes the wildlife viability implications of managing the KNF well below the HRV.
Response: Recognition of the need and desire for a variety of habitats for wildlife, including old growth, is
demonstrated by the first two statements under the purpose and need for the proposed action. The amount and
distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest Plan Monitoring Report.
These reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently meeting old growth
standards set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: The EIS does not disclose how much old growth, or how much habitat for old-growth associated wildlife
species, has been destroyed or degraded by all the past logging in the project area. These past cumulative impacts,
especially regarding their effects on old growth dependent species in the ER PA are not included in the old growth
analysis, which is a violation of NEPA.
Response: The DEIS provides a list of past management activities in the Cripple PSU, on page 3 of Chapter 3,
dating back to 1976. Prior to 1976 records are few. Likely several of these treated areas contained large diameter
trees, but whether or not all elements of old growth were present is speculative. Since 1987 the KNF has been
managing old growth at 10 percent in all major drainages and will do so until new standards are in place. The
amount and distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest Plan Monitoring
Report. These reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently meeting old
growth standards set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: The FS acknowledges that a substantial percentage of the old-growth blocks counted as “effective” oldgrowth in the KNF are less than 50 acres, however Forest Plan states that this designation of such small blocks as
effective was to be the “exception rather than the rule.” Since the Forest Plan indicates that blocks of old-growth
timber less than 50 acres in size do not “provide habitat for those wildlife species dependent on old-growth timber
for their needs”, it cannot be “best science” for any of the blocks less than 50 acres to be considered “effective” old
growth for inventory and viability analysis purposes.
Response: Designated old growth acres within the Cripple PSU are 50 acres or greater. There may be some areas of
undesignated old growth that are less than 50 acres which is the rationale for why they are undesignated.
==================================================================================
Comment: Since there is no scientific support for the premise that the present amount and distribution of designated
effective old growth and replacement old growth (ROG) in the ER PA supports viable populations, it is unfortunate
that the project activities will deplete even more habitat for the wildlife that are associated with old growth. This runs
counter to the forest plan and NFMA mandates to assure viable populations.
The DEIS’s analysis methodology allows the Forest Service to continually log mature forest whenever and wherever,
without considering the potential of those areas to achieve the HRV of old growth, connectivity, patch size, edge
effects, etc.
Response: The East Reservoir project does not propose harvest in any areas designated as old growth. In other
mature stands, vegetation treatments were specifically designed to promote the growth of large trees and help protect
existing desired large trees, such as remnant larch and ponderosa pine from insect and disease. Sixty eight percent of
the commercial timber harvests in both alternatives 2 and 3 are intermediate harvest treatments that focus on leaving
the largest healthiest trees. These harvest treatments would retain the best Douglas-fir and most of the ponderosa
pine and western latch. In most cases, these largest trees are also the oldest trees in the treatment areas. Stand density
reduction would also occur with these intermediate harvest treatments which will promote the growth of large
diameter trees as well as increase the resistance to insect and disease. The residual stand structure would vary in size
and arrangement as the leave trees would not be evenly spaced. All of these objectives would promote long-term
mature forest with a variety of wildlife habitat. Please refer to the vegetation section, pages 48 and 49, of the DEIS
for additional information.
==================================================================================
Comment: The KNF and project area are not being managed compliance with the MA 13 Facilities Standard #1,
which requires that “Local roads will be restricted to prevent premature cutting of the snag component” (Forest Plan
at III-56). We note that both of the action alternatives would exacerbate this negative situation by fragmenting old
growth and increasing edge effect by new roads and logging adjacent to old growth, worsening the viability situation
for old-growth associated wildlife.
Response: Where old growth areas are thought to be susceptible to firewood cutters, they are signed as “no
firewood cutting” allowed and enforced through the issuance of form FS-2400-001 (Forest Products Removal
Permit and Cash Receipt). These permits are issued under certain conditions which clearly state where firewood
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 33

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

cutting is permissible. Granted some snags in old growth are likely lost due to individuals not adhering to these
permit conditions are those caught are prosecuted to the extent that the governing laws allow.
The East Reservoir project does propose new temporary roads (666 feet). Construction of these roads will likely
remove some snags and this effect is disclosed in the DEIS beginning on page 204. Following the use of temporary
roads, the temporary prism will be decommissioned and not passable by firewood cutters so a continued effect on
snags is not anticipated. Any portions of new permanent roads through old growth will be restricted by a barrier
(gate, rocks, berms etc.) following treatment activities and again, snags will not be susceptible to firewood cutters
unless illegal trespass occurs.
==================================================================================
Comment: PILEATED WOODPECKER OG MIS
The DEIS states that pileated woodpeckers have been sighted in the ER PA, though apparently there has been no
pileated woodpecker nesting documented in the project area. This may be attributable to KNF forest plan direction
that does not recognize that the average snag diameter preferred for nesting habitat is almost 30” dbh for this MIS.
The need for large diameter snags for nesting trees for the pileated woodpecker is downplayed in the DEIS.
McClelland and McClelland (1999) found, in their study in northwest Montana, that the average nest tree was 73 cm.
(almost 29”) dbh. The DEIS does not consider that such large snags are absolutely necessary for keystone wildlife
species such as the pileated woodpecker, therefore absolutely necessary for the many species that rely upon cavities
excavated by the pileated for their nesting and other life stage habitat.
The DEIS does not present survey data on pileated woodpecker population abundance or nesting success in the
project area. Since there is no scientific basis for assuming that 10% old growth is enough for species viability, and
since there is no scientific basis to support the KNF’s use of its MIS as adequately “indicating” for other old growth
dependent species including the fisher, flammulated owl, northern goshawk, etc., the proof would be in the
monitoring. The Forest Service has not completed monitoring that would validate the assumption inherent in the
Forest Plan’s old-growth habitat standards—that they are adequate for assuring old-growth species’ viability.
Response: The DEIS discloses potential effects on old growth, snags, down wood, and pileated woodpecker
beginning on page 200.; the fisher on page 265, flammulated owl on page 270, and the northern goshawk on page
235. The DEIS, on more than one occasion discusses the importance of large diameter trees and subsequent snags
for these species.
==================================================================================
Comment: NORTHERN GOSHAWK
The DEIS (at 235, 236) indicates that goshawk habitat modeling, which relies on vegetation information previously
collected by the Forest Service, indicates that there are 57,000 acres of primary goshawk nesting habitat in the
Cripple PSU. The average goshawk pair territory is 5400 acres according to the Potential Population Index (PPI).
Surveys in 2011 confirmed the presence of one active goshawk nest in the Cripple PSU. Apparently this confirms
the Forest Service’s conclusion that the area is capable of supporting – and will continue to be capable of supporting
a viable population of goshawks. If that is the case then why is there, as far as the Forest Service knows, only one
active goshawk nest in the Cripple PSU? Given the large amount of “primary” goshawk nesting habitat that
supposedly exists there it should capable of supporting at least 10 nesting pairs, which is the PPI for the Cripple
PSU.
Response: Northern goshawks, especially during the breeding season, can be difficult to find. Likewise, individuals
respond differently to solicit calling. The fact that only one goshawk pair responded to surveys does not rule out the
existence of other breeding pairs in the PSU. It is likely additional pairs of nesting goshawks will be found during
implementation and, if so, nesting territories will also be established for these goshawks.
==================================================================================
Comment: It seems clear that the Forest Service habitat modeling protocol fails to provide an accurate accounting of
suitable habitat (nesting and/or other life stages) or there are other factors not being considered by the Forest Service
which cause the habitat to not be utilized by the target species, in this case the northern goshawk. Clearly more
diligent surveys need to be conducted to verify the presence, or non-existence of goshawks and other old growth
dependent species in areas that are targeted for the extensive habitat changes such as those proposed in Alternatives 2
and 3 of the ER Project. Those other species include the pileated woodpecker, fisher and flammulated owl.
Lacking valid scientific support for its habitat management strategy, and without adequate historical and current
population data based on actual surveys in the ER PA, the Forest Service has failed to establish that viable
populations of MIS and old growth dependent species, as well as sensitive and threatened and endangered species,
exist and will continue to exist in the ER PA and on the KNF in general.
Response: Northern goshawks, especially during the breeding season, can be difficult to find. Likewise, individuals
respond differently to solicit calling. The fact that only one goshawk pair responded to surveys does not rule out the
existence of other breeding pairs in the PSU. It is likely additional pairs of nesting goshawks will be found during

implementation and, if so, nesting territories will also be established for these goshawks.
There are numerous snags in the Cripple PSU with sign of pileated woodpecker activity and individuals are often
seen or heard by forest personnel during field visits to the area. The presence and signs of pileated woodpeckers
remain largely undocumented because of their common occurrence.
There is no recent information on fisher in the Cripple PSU to suggest nothing other than transient use of any habitat
that may be available and suitable. Additionally, the fisher spends much of its time within thick, riparian habitats
where human access and use is limited due to ruggedness. For this reason, fisher go largely undetected from humans
by avoidance. Therefore, potential habitat was modeled assuming fisher may be present as a transient species and
each alternative was analyzed for its impact on potential habitat.
The population size for flammulated owls on the KNF is unknown (Ibid), however Libby District records indicate at
least 11 past sightings/vocalizations of flammulated owls within the Cripple PSU (NRIS Wildlife) dating from 1992
to present. The latest flammulated owl documented to occur in the Cripple PSU was during recent surveys (2011)
which solicited responses using taped owl calls.
Unsuccessful surveys for this species can often be attributed to the presence and response from other owl species,
especially great horned owls, which are known to prey on the flammulated. Once other owl species respond, the
flammulated owl, out of self-preservation, typically do not answer solicited calls. Surveyors are trained to stop
calling for flammulated owls when other (large predators) owls respond at a given survey point(s). Due to the
abundance of great horned owls and the risk of predation, the flammulated owl can be difficult to find.
==================================================================================
Comment: The Committee of Scientists (1999) makes this point about species viability:
(P)erhaps the single best metric of sustainable use of land is the persistence of species over time. The public
needs to understand that the productivity of an ecosystem can be sustained over the long term only if species
persist.
Population dynamics include assessing population size, population growth rate, and linkages to other populations and
must be included in a scientifically sound population viability analysis. Ruggiero, et al. (1994a) point out that a
sound population viability analysis must utilize measures of population dynamics. Mills (1994) explains the range of
parameters that must be used to make a scientifically sound assessment of the viability of wildlife species.
Population dynamics refers to persistence of a population over time—key to making predictions about population
viability.
Response: Documentation for presence or absence of all suspected species and what is known about their
populations for the analysis area is disclosed in the respective sections of the DEIS. This DEIS does not attempt to
conduct a true population viability analysis because the scale of the project would not be appropriate. It does,
however, disclose what is known about local populations of wildlife species as well as the habitat conditions for
each of the species addressed or brought forward in comments.
==================================================================================
Comment: The key factors that affect population dynamics of those MIS and Sensitive species are not adequately
considered in the cumulative effects analyses, therefore viability is not assured, as NFMA requires. The DEIS does
not disclose and utilize the best scientific information available on those species, as NEPA requires.
Response: The project complies with NFMA direction (16 USC 1604 (G)(3)(b) to “provide for diversity of plant and
animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multipleuse objectives, and within the multiple-use objectives of a land management plan adopted pursuant to this section,
provide, where appropriate, to the degree practicable, for steps to be taken to preserve the diversity of tree species
similar to that existing in the region controlled by the plan.”
Field surveys for various species were conducted during the planning of this project with results disclosed under the
discussion for individual species. Potential effects of this project on these species or their habitats are also disclosed
as required under each respective resource section.
=================================================================================
THE CLIMATE CHANGE FACTOR
Comment: The science on climate change supports the idea that national forest management emphasis should shift
away from logging to carbon storage. All old-growth forest areas and previously unlogged forest areas should be
preserved indefinitely for their carbon storage value. Forests that have been logged should be restored and allowed to
convert to eventual old-growth condition. This type of management has the potential to double the current level of
carbon storage in some regions.
Response: The comment suggests the Forest Service's emphasis should shift to carbon storage and all old growth
forest areas and previously unlogged forest areas should be preserved indefinitely for their carbon storage value. The
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

scientific literature cited by the commenter does not support the policy prescriptions they suggest, particularly
within the disturbance driven ecosystems of the inland west, including the East Reservoir area (see literature
discussions in Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage Report (PF, Vol. S, Doc. 29). In addition, inferred carbon
inventory maintenance or gains from deferred harvest can be an illusory claim, particularly applied at stand level
practices such as in the East Reservoir Project. These implied gains only hold true if harvest does not occur
elsewhere in the world to supply the same world demand for timber (Gan and McCarl 2007; Murray 2008; Wear and
Murray 2004). The result can be a net carbon impact if the timber is replaced in the marketplace with higher carbon
source products such as steel or concrete or is harvested in a manner that does not result in prompt reforestation
(Ryan et al. 201 0; Harmon 2009). However, the “no-action” alternative (Alternative 1) in the DEIS effectively
represents the comment’s intent, and the effects of the various alternatives on carbon storage and flux were
examined (East Reservoir FEIS, Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage Report (Vol. S, Doc 29) in the project record).
The scientific and other literature provided in the comment has limited direct relevancy to the issue at hand: whether
or not the relationship of the East Reservoir Project to "climate change" warranted more detailed analysis in this
DEIS. All represent valid studies or treatises on their particular subject matter (arguably with the exception of
Hanson 2010), however their scope is either at the global scale or else study or focus on ecosystems quite different
than those being considered here.
For example, the various Harmon papers (1990, 2001, 2002), Keith et al. (2009), and Homann (2005) deal largely
with the relatively warm, wet forests of the Pacific NW where disturbance and succession dynamic, and thus carbon
dynamics, differ substantially from those of the Kootenai National Forest.
Turner et al. (1995) and Woodbury et al. (2007) report estimates of existing carbon stocks and flux in U.S. forests.
Neither paper recommends conversion of all forests to old growth conditions, or suggests a land management policy
similar to that proposed in the comment. Similarly, Turner et al. (1997) is a brief letter to the editor commenting that
another paper overestimates the potential benefits of carbon storage in harvested wood products and aforestation.
Kutsch et al. (2010) presents a standardized protocol for the assessment of soil CO2 fluxes, with particular focus
relative to monitoring national carbon budgets under global climate treaties and VanderWerf et al. (2009) is a
scientific commentary recognizing that deforestation (which is not part of this proposal) is the second largest
anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Solomon et al. (2007) is the IPCC Summary for
Policymakers on the physical science basis for climate change. All, within their global perspective, speak to human
actions quite unlike those contemplated here.
Harmon 2009 is Dr. Harmon's testimony to Congress concerning "The Role of Federal Lands in Combating Climate
Change." His seven key points are: "1) Forests are leaky carbon buckets; 2) Forests can play an important, but
limited roles in sequestering carbon; 3) All carbon pools need to be examined when thinking through the merits of
carbon policy; 4) To increase the sequestration of forest carbon, we need to either increase carbon inputs, decrease
carbon outputs, or put forest carbon somewhere else; 5) Forests are best seen as a bridging strategy in carbon
mitigation; 6) Seemingly "good" forest carbon ideas when examined at the stand level at a point in time dissipate
when looked at the forest level over time; and 7) With accelerating climate change, forests may shift from being part
of the carbon solution to being part of the carbon problem." The testimony is insightful and readable, but is aimed at
national policy and does not support the comment’s conclusions.
=================================================================================
Comment: The fuel reduction proposed actions have forest health implications—including adverse effects. Since the
fuel reduction regime represented by the proposal was not a planning scenario dealt with in sufficient detail (if at all)
during 1987 Forest Plan development, both the project-level and programmatic ecological and economic costs and
impacts remain unexplained and undisclosed. The Forest Service has not disclosed just how much of the KNF needs
to be treated for fuel reduction in a manner that emphasizes maintaining fuel conditions that are not necessarily
consistent with native ecological processes. The agency must address the cumulative impacts of fire and fire
management under the current KNF fire policy.
Response: From a fire and fuels management standpoint, fuel treatments in the WUI are the priority and the main
objective is to provide for firefighter and public safety. When it does not conflict with this objective WUI fuels
treatments are also intended to be consistent with native ecological process. Fuel treatments outside the WUI are
intended to meet the purpose and need of the East Reservoir project.
Cumulative impacts from fire suppression are addressed in Chapter 3 (Pages 176-177) under the No Action
Alternative of the Fire and Fuels Management section.
Analysis of the Kootenai National Forest’s fire suppression policy and how much of the Kootenai National Forest
needs to be treated for fuel reduction is beyond the scope of the analysis for this project.

WATER QUALITY/HYDROLOGY
Comment: The large amounts of proposed canopy reduction via logging and burning concerns us also because of
the presently unstable condition of creeks and tributaries. Bedload sediment effects go largely ignored. Therefore the
impacts of rain-on-snow and other peak flow events are not adequately analyzed. The DEIS is not consistent with the
best science on forest hydrology.
The DEIS relies upon BMPs for showing consistency with the Clean Water Act, yet doesn’t disclose effectiveness of
BMPs for that very purpose. The condition of most of the managed watersheds on the District argues against the
validity of BMPs for protecting water quality and fisheries.
Response: Using the Rosgen methodology for assessing stream conditions, all the streams in the analysis area were
determined to be in a Fair to Good condition. The proposed canopy reduction as well as proposed peak flow
increases is within the range for streams in Fair and Good condition and as recommended in the Forest Plan.
BMP effectiveness and tracking for the KNF are located in the Water Resources Project File Appendix D and E.
==================================================================================
Comment:
The DEIS discloses that bull trout and redband trout have likely been extirpated from the project area due to
management actions. It also does not give any indication of population trends of the Sensitive westslope cutthroat
trout—if surveys are showing maintaining, improving, or declining stocks.
Response: Surveys show that fish are utilizing available habitat. Electrofishing surveys found multiple year classes
in fish bearing streams throughout the project area. INFS default RHCAs will continue to protect aquatic habitat and
will avoid retarding RMOs. Streams in the project area were treated to remove native fish and allow stocked
westslopes and advantage for spawning and rearing. The drainages have not been stocked are now repopulated with
hybrid fish along the reservoir. Dunn Creek was not treated, however past stocking of the Kootenai River and its
tributaries created an extensive hybrid swarm of fish. These fish have invaded Dunn Creek creating hybrid
rainbows/cutthroat trout. The upper segment of the stream has a nearly pure population of westslopes that are
isolated from lower Dunn Creek. This population is regulated by flow conditions. There is only one perennial
tributary in upper Dunn Creek. The beaver flats below this tributary have been trapped out and no longer maintain
water from year to year.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS does not discuss the fish viability issues related to stream segments not meeting
INFISH/Forest Plan Riparian Management Objectives (RMOs). The DEIS does not provide clear analysis as to how
RMOs would not be adversely affected, or achieved over any time frame.
Response: Refer to Tables 3.47 to 3.51 in the Fisheries and Aquatic Species Resources section of the DEISs. These
tables set the stage for RMOs in the project area. Fish viability was shown through electrofishing surveys which
proved the existence of multiple year class fish. We know fish are using available habitat and maintaining
populations that the local ecosystem can support. The data shows that, in general, most RMOs are being met or
exceeded. Large wood debris numbers fully meet or exceed Forest Plan standards in drainages across the project
area. Bank stability also meets or exceeds standards. Width to depth rations and pool frequency is mostly not being
met. As stated in the EIS, width to depth ratios most always do not fit into local numbers on the Kootenai. These
stream dimensions were calculated for streams on the Oregon and Washington coast. The numbers are therefore an
indicator of the dimensions of streams in the area. Pool frequency was an RMO that was not met in most cases in the
project area. Streams are still recovering from past activities and natural events. Large fires have influenced Cripple
Horse Creek and Canyon Creek. Past grazing on Cripple Horse, Canyon, Warland and Five Mile have caused
riparian problems. Past Forest Service fisheries habitat enhancement where wood was removed from stream
channels has been wide spread across the area. Implementation of INFS into the Kootenai National Forest Plan in
1995 created a set of RHCAs to protect the riparian area and improve or protect key fisheries habitat elements.
These elements were based on best scientific data that showed intact riparian areas led to healthier aquatic
ecosystems. RHCAs have been monitored since implementation of INFS and have showed through protection
streams have maintained or trended towards more natural states. This project will require all streams and wetlands
buffered by RHCAs. Therefore, the existing condition will maintain or improve conditions. Since this is the
language set in the Forest Plan this project will be consistent with INFS and will not retard the attainment of RMOs.
==================================================================================
Comment: In its overly narrow analyses of cumulative effects of past management activities, the DEIS does not
provide adequate summaries of the purpose and need statements from past NEPA documents, the level of
achievement of their desired conditions and/or project goals, results of required monitoring, nor the consistency of
past project with resource conditions as expressed in the desired condition and purpose and need statements.
Response: The proposed project utilized past information from the turn of the century through dam construction to
present conditions. Past management was consistent with direction and laws of that time. Recent management since

1995 has been consistent with INFS and is therefore consistent with the KNF Forest Plan. The project will also be
constant will all other State and Federal laws.
==================================================================================
GRIZZLY BEARS
Comment: The DEIS indicates that a portion of the ER PA lies within the Tobacco BORZ (occupied grizzly bear
habitat outside the Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Recovery Zone). The analysis of the impacts of the action alternatives on
grizzly bears that may be present in the BORZ utilizes the language and rationale that have become standard for
assessing the impacts of road construction, reconstruction and the use of roads within the BORZ for hauling timber
as well as other activities associated with the implementation of logging and other actions proposed in the action
alternatives for the ER Project. While acknowledging that these activities have the potential to disturb and displace
bears from preferred (or at least currently usable) habitat in the PA, the Forest Service relies on stipulations in the
latest (2011) revision of the Grizzly Bear Motorized Access Management Amendment to the KNF, IPNF and Lolo
Forest Plans.
Response: The East Reservoir Project is consistent with the biological opinion for the 2011 Forest Plan
Amendments for Motorized Access Management within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery
Zones, and associated BORZ.
==================================================================================
Comment: In regard to BORZ the 2011 Access Management documents basically require only that open and total
road densities not be permanently increased as a result of a project. Thus they can be increased, which they will be
as a result of either Alt. 2 or 3 in this case, during the multi-year implementation of the project, as long as they are
returned to pre-project levels by the time the project is completed.
Response: This statement is correct concerning temporary increases in linear open and total roads during project
activities. However, these roads must remain closed to the general public.
==================================================================================
Comment: The fact remains that any bears that may be present in the ER PA will be adversely impacted by new
road construction, the use of new and existing roads for log hauling, the presence of humans and machinery needed
to accomplish the proposed extensive logging and the use of helicopters for wildlife and fuels reduction burns which
will affect thousands of acres in the ER PA, including in the BORZ. These impacts have not been adequately
disclosed, analyzed or addressed in the DEIS.
Response: These potential impacts were disclosed in the DEIS, biological assessment, as well as clarifying emails,
and subsequently concurred with by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their letter of concurrence dated, August 8,
2013. The potential exists to displace grizzly bears to areas not affected by the activities, but these projects are not
expected to contribute cumulatively to bear mortalities given that no new permanent open roads would be
constructed within the PSU and the project’s compliance with the 2011 BO on Forest Plan Amendments for
Motorized Access Management within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Recovery Zones on the Kootenai, Idaho
Panhandle and Lolo National Forests. Additionally, the action alternatives, in combination with the baseline
conditions and reasonably foreseeable projects would improve the overall ungulate security habitat, as defined by
Hillis et al. 1991, from 28% to 35 or 33%. This increase in ungulate security can easily be translated to an increase
security for any grizzly bears moving through or utilizing, at least intermittently, the PSU. Additionally, helicopter
use associated with the this project is consistent with the management strategies found in the Guide to Effects
Analysis of Helicopter Use in Grizzly Bear Habitat (2009) that are not likely to adversely affect grizzly bears;
helicopter activities would not prohibit bears from using the area during any period of biological importance such as
breeding, late fall foraging (hyperphagia), or denning.

Letter 4:

United States Environmental Protection Agency

Comment: The Draft EIS states that under Alternative 2 (proposed action) and Alternative 3, there would be timber
harvest, skid trail construction, temporary road construction, new road construction, upgrades to stream crossings,
prescribed fire, and fuels and wildlife treatments. We appreciate the map depicting wetlands and the incorporation of
design criteria, BMPs and RHCA guidelines are anticipated to minimize potential risks to water quality from the
aforementioned activities.
The Draft EIS describes monitoring measures and includes a monitoring plan as an appendix. The latter indicates the
monitoring during implementation of activities will occur. The Draft EIS also states that a number of the actions in
the project will have short term impacts on streams. It would be helpful if the Final EIS linked how the monitoring
during activity implementation will be used to minimize the impacts to streams. For instance, if an issue is found
through the monitoring while an activity is being implemented, there are actions that will be taken to change the
activity and minimize the impact. Including the list of actions in the Final EIS would provide a link between the
monitoring and minimizing the impact.
Response: Short-term impacts to water resources will be minimized because the PFIs are within the allowable
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Final Environmental Impact Statement

range, basin-wide ECAs are less than 30%, project implementation will occur over a 10 year time-frame, and design
criteria will be implemented to ensure water quality standards are being met.
During implementation, design criteria and BMPs become part of the contract (See Appendix C). At that point it is
the responsibility of the timber sale administrator, harvest inspector, engineering representative, or contracting
officer representative to ensure operations comply with the contract and thus law, regulation, and policy. If resource
concerns are identified, actions are modified or stopped until they are corrected. Monitoring by both the Forest
Service and the State of Montana has shown that the Kootenai has had a very good record of BMP implementation
and effectiveness (Appendix D).
==================================================================================
Comment: We are appreciate that all prescribed burning would be carried out under the oversight of Montana/Idaho
State Airshed group and will comply with the current Federal and state management plans including the State
Implementation Plan and Smoke Management Plan. It is known that smoke from fire contains air pollutants,
including particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) which can cause health problems, especially for people suffering from
respiratory illness such as asthma, emphysema, or heart problems. The Draft EIS indicates that at the beginning of
each burn season an advertisement informing the public of potential prescribed burns will be placed in a local paper.
The Draft EIS further states that residents near a prescribed burn may be contacted prior to the burn. We recommend
the Final EIS include a commitment to notify the public closer to pending burns. This is especially important for the
residents downwind of the burn area.
Table 3.115 provides a range of particulate emissions factors (PM10 and PM2.5) by burn type and alternative. The
text provides an example of the range of PM10 and PM2.5 from a 40 acre underburn. The text also indicates that there
is expected to be 300-2,000 acres of prescribed burn each year. In order for the maximum impact of these burns to
be understood, we recommend the Final EIS include: (I) the total estimated project emissions over the life for the
project, and (2) the potential estimated yearly highest PM10 and PM2.5 for the three alternatives using the “underburn
timber harvest units” which has the highest PM10 and PM2.5; emissions per acre. For instance, using the information
provided in text and tables, the maximum yearly PM10 under alternative 2 is:
2774 pounds PM10/acres x 2,000 acres = 2774 tons per year.
We recognize that this assumes all 2,000 acres would be this burn type which may not be likely; however, it also
informs the public of the worst case anticipated emissions. It would also be useful to disclose the largest likely area
to be burned during a single event and how long such an event may last so the decision maker and public can
understand short term (24-hour) impacts.
The Draft EIS includes a general discussion of cumulative air quality effects. Regional air quality data is available
through Montana Department of Environmental Quality. In order to understand the cumulative impacts of the
activities under the proposed alternative, the EPA recommends the Final EIS include the data on the current regional
air quality and a more detailed analysis on cumulative air quality impacts.
Response: If smoke from prescribed burning has the potential to impact members of the public that are near the
project, they will be contacted by prescribed fire managers prior to implementation of the prescribed burn.
In regards to question related to Table 3.115:
1) Table 3.115 provides all the necessary information needed to simply calculate the total project emissions over
the life of the project or any other desired combination of potential burning.
2) The range of acres to be prescribed burned each year reflects the variability in burn windows and treatments
units readily available. Under the worst case scenario in regards to emissions the highest year of burning will
include about 300 acres of underburning timber harvest units, 1500 acres of underburning fuels and wildlife
units, and 200 acres of grapple pile burning. This will not vary between Alternative 2 and Alternative 3 and
Alternative 1 only has 765 acres of burning proposed. As requested, the worst case calculations are below and
apply to both alternatives.
1500 acres of fuels and wildlife burning could generate 625 tons of PM10 and 530 tons of PM2.5 emissions; 300
acres of timber harvest underburning could generate 416 tons of PM10 and 353 tons of PM2.5 emissions; 200 acres of
pile burning could generate 161 tons of PM10 and 137 tons of PM2.5 emissions. Under the worst case scenario there
could be a total of 1202 tons of PM10 and 1020 tons of PM2.5 emissions generated in a year. These will be spread out
over the course of the prescribed burning season which occurs mostly in March-June and September-November.
The 1,500 acres of fuels and wildlife burning is the single largest prescribed burning event that will ever occur
under this project. Due to the nature of the fuels in wildlife units and the time of year that these types of burns
occur, the smoke impacts will be greatest for the first few days following a burn and residual smoldering and
creeping could last for a few weeks.

A more detailed analysis of cumulative impacts to air quality is not possible due to the inability to determine the
exact time and place of all local, zone, and regional prescribed burning. The entire purpose of the Montana/Idaho
Airshed Group is to coordinate prescribed burning activities with the Montana Department of Environmental
Quality to ensure their will not be short-term or cumulative impacts that exceed any NAAQS. In addition, the
project will comply with the State Implementation Plan as is required by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: Information on current and project climate change impacts are included in the Vegetation Resource
section of Chapter 3 includes as well as mentioned in several other Chapter 3 sections. We recognize that inclusion
of climate change as related to forest health and the proposed project is important. We recommend the discussion is
expanded to include how the USFS can reduce the impacts of project activities on climate change, monitor for
effects of climate change on forest resources, and include a project specific analysis and disclosure of greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions. To achieve this, the EPA suggests a four-step approach:
1. Quantify and disclose estimated annual and total project lifetime cumulative GHG emissions in CO2 equivalent
terms and translate the emissions into equivalencies that are easily understood from the public standpoint (e.g.,
annual GHO emissions from x numbers of project equipment; see, https:1/www.eoa.gov/RDEE/energyresourcescalculator.html).
2. Qualitatively discuss the link between GHGs and climate change, in addition to the potential impacts of climate
change.
3. Include a summary of ongoing and projected regional climate change impacts relevant to the project area based
on U.S. Global Change Research Program assessments.
4. Identify and analyze reasonable alternatives and/or way to mitigate project-related GHG emissions.
Response: The importance of carbon storage capacity of the world’s forests is tied to their role globally in removing
atmospheric carbon that is contributing to ongoing global warming. As discussed in Forest Carbon Cycling and
Storage Report (PF, Vol. S, Doc. 29), meaningful and relevant conclusions on the effects of a relatively minor land
management action such as this on global greenhouse gas emissions or global climate change is neither possible nor
warranted in this case. Nevertheless, we recognize that global research indicates the world’s climate is warming and
that most of the observed 20th century increase in global average temperatures is very likely due to increased
human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.
Forests cycle carbon. They are in a continual flux, both emitting carbon into the atmosphere and removing it
(sequestration) through photosynthesis. The proposed actions being considered here may alter the rates and timing
of that flux within the individually affected forest stands. These changes would be localized and infinitesimal in
relation to the role the world’s forests play in ameliorating climate change and indistinguishable from the affects of
not taking the action.
================================================================================
Comment: The East Reservoir Project lies within 20 miles of the WR Grace Vermiculite mine. Based on current
data from the Libby Superfund Site, there is the potential for asbestos related impacts in the project area. Although
the risk from asbestos in the area is not yet quantified, we suggest that the Final EIS include: (1) a discussion of
possible asbestos in the project area contamination; and (2) the potential impacts of such contamination, especially
as they relate to workers’ health for the cutting and burning projects included in the preferred alternative.
Additionally, it is important that the Final EIS include mitigation measures that would be employed to avoid
identified potential impacts.
Response: Based on EPA sampling of tree bark and duff, asbestos has been detected near the western boundary of
the East Reservoir project area which is outside of any EPA Operable Unit (OU - The EPA has divided the entire
Libby Superfund into 8 Operable Units that include specific areas and task associated with the cleanup) within the
Libby Superfund Site. Due to the very limited amount of sampling conducted by the EPA, the nature and extent of
asbestos contamination in the project area is not known at this time.
EPA is the lead agency on determining the toxicity of Libby Amphibole asbestos and developing a risk assessment.
As such, the Forest Service has requested additional guidance and risk information from the EPA. Current EPA
timelines estimates indicate that a final risk assessment for the Libby Superfund will be available in 2014. Once that
information becomes available the Forest Service will 1) evaluate the information, 2) determine whether there will
be potential impacts to workers implementing the project, and 3) implement mitigation measures that may be
necessary to address potential impacts.
To date, all personal air monitoring from activity based sampling conducted by the EPA and sampling conducted by
national Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has indicated that all results were well below the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) asbestos standard of 0.1 fibers per cubic centimeter of air
as an 8-hr time-weighted average. This is currently the only regulation regarding worker permissible exposure limits
to asbestos. In October of 2013, NIOSH will present their findings from personal air monitoring that occurred during

forest management activities in OU3 (Superfund Operational Unit) and OU4 during the 2012 field season. The
Forest Service has also received results from personal air monitoring that occurred during a wildland fire event in
July of 2013 near the Souse Gulch area of OU3. If additional findings from ongoing data collection and findings
from the EPA final risk assessment indicate the need for mitigation during forest management activities in the East
Reservoir project area the Forest Service will implement the appropriate environmental or engineering controls to
protect worker health. In the interim, the Forest Service will continue to coordinate with the EPA to do additional
activity based sampling. For more info: http://www.latag.org/index.php/superfund-site/operable-units

Letter 5:

Bettge and Pittsley – Warland Creek Land Owners

Comment: We very much support what seems to be the best alternative: alternative 2. It provides good forest
management practices and facilitates some economic return to the local area through selected logging. It also
provides employment through hiring to selectively thin the forest. It does not overemphasize clear-cutting and not
only respects viewsheds, but from our reading of the plan, actually enhances some views along Hwy 37 to better
enjoy the scenery and reservoir.
We are especially pleased to see improvements (with shelter wood) to areas near Warland creek to reduce fire risk.
This is a major concern for all who live in the area. Besides decreasing fire risk, wildlife habitat will be improved.
The plan respects fragile soils through scheduling work in appropriate times of the year. Concern for noxious weed
spread is a concern; logging trucks have contaminated the Warland area with knapweed over the years, and we are
struggling to contain it through the use of knapweed beetles. Reading that containing noxious weeds is a part of the
plan is gratifying.
Response: Thank you for your comments and interest in the east Reservoir Project.
==================================================================================
Comment: We do wish to comment that we do not favor clearcuts, per se, unless they are structured to allow
wildlife use (ie. not > 600' across, and 300' widths preferred). Clearcuts generally mar the landscape, increase soil
temperatures and allow erosion to occur. In Alternative 2, several clearcuts/regeneration units are planned. As best
we can read the plan, some of these cuts include tree reserves. If the reserve trees are positioned to allow for a
mosaic appearance of the clearcut, we have no objection to the clearcuts. A mosaic approach would still allow
wildlife use and maintain a better visual aspect. If the cuts are of the rectangular, hard-edged, complete clearcuts, we
object. This approach may be easier to accomplish, but is detrimental to too many other factors in the plan. On pages
S-2, p.3, chapter 2 and page 20 of the plan, several nonconformities are discussed. We think they could be mitigated
through more thoughtful layouts. Shaping a clearcut to be long and narrow, and including reserve or shelter trees is
what we would favor. Hard edges create a more highly detectable clear cut; "shading" the edges and including
stands of shelterwood could make the clearcuts less objectionable. We do not believe the reasons and necessity to
establish clearcuts and regeneration units have been clearly articulated within the plan.
Response: The DEIS explains regeneration harvests, specifically clearcuts in Chapter 2 on page 9 and 10. The
following information is explained:
Regeneration harvest treatment is intended to replace a forest stand when modification treatments (i.e. intermediate
harvest) are not feasible due to poor quality trees for retention; stand is under stocked due past insect and disease
mortality; or incorrect overstory species that will not meet management objectives. In this analysis area,
regeneration is proposed in some stands to promote regeneration of seral, fire-tolerant species. Specifically,
regeneration harvest is needed to restore western larch, ponderosa pine and western white pine. Within proposed
harvest units, there will be both live and dead trees that are designated for reserve. The number of trees left and the
associated stand structure is described by the varying regeneration harvest methods proposed. A description of these
methods follows.
Clearcut with reserves also initiates establishment of a new stand. An average of 4 to 8 trees per acre will remain on
site post-treatment and their function will be as snags, cavity habitat, or replacement snags. Clearcuts are typically
planted by hand, or may be reseeded by adjacent mature stands if desirable trees are present.
Each of the treatment units have been reviewed by a wildlife biologist and a visuals specialist. All of the acres
prescribed for clearcuts are clearcuts with reserve trees. All of these clearcut will have reserve trees ranging from a
minimum of 6 trees per acre to 12 or more for replacement snags and structural diversity. In addition, all snags that
meet minimum snag criteria will be left in clearcut reserve treatment with areas. Units that have additional concerns
from the wildlife and visual specialists have been addressed and have specific objectives to address them. For
example, some clearcuts have more snag replacements required for leave due to the habitat or more reserve trees for
visuals.
Specific marking guides for each treatment unit will be developed during project implementation.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Clearcut shape is often determined by a number of the following variables such as SMZ boundaries; potential timber
stand concerns such as plant pathogens and entomological concerns; fire concerns where high fuel loads may exist;
steep slopes; and harvest procedures.
Regarding Soil Damage: Application of appropriate management precautions (BMPs) such as avoiding timber
harvest in wet seasons, maintaining buffer zones below open slopes, and skidding over snow or frozen grounds will
decrease potential negative impacts to soil productivity regardless of timber harvest activities.
Regarding Soil Temperatures: The potential for soil temperatures is minimized by maintaining a duff layer on the
surface. Furthermore, the burn prescriptions for this project were designed for low to moderate fire intensity and will
be implemented when soil moisture levels are high. Typically, burning prescription is scheduled when the moisture
in the lower duff layer is high enough so that the fire does not consume those layers which insulate the soil surface
from surface heating (DeBano 2000).
=================================================================================
Comment: Highway 37 is a very popular highway for the public, especially during the summer months. Doing
everything possible to not only maintain, but enhance views along this highway is critical. As the economy of the
area continues to struggle, encouraging recreational tourism by presenting the tremendously scenic views available
along the highway would benefit the area greatly. Thinning trees along the highway and preserving wooded
mountain views should be a very important aspect of the plan.
Response: The Forest Service is in full agreement with your assessment. Forest Plan visual quality objectives
(VQO) are established for views from sensitive travel corridors (MSH 37, trails, etc.) and use areas (Lake
Koocanusa, campgrounds, etc.). A Forest Service paraprofessional landscape architect assesses each proposed
activity as to whether the assigned VQO will be met. If a VQO will not be met, then mitigation measures are
designed to bring that proposed activity into Forest Plan compliance. Additionally, the Forest Service creates and
maintains scenic turnouts along MSH 37 through the project area.

Letter 6:

The Lands Council

The Lands Council is part of the Kootenai Forest Stakeholder Coalition and I attended on field trip to the area last
year with members of the coalition.
Comment: The stated Purpose and Need is to:
Re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease
infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change;
Create a heterogeneous landscape that provides a variety of habitats to sustain populations of terrestrial and
aquatic species;
Provide amenities, jobs and products to the communities;
Reduce hazardous fuels adjacent to private property and across the landscape while re-introducing fire to the
ecosystem;
Enhance recreation settings and facilities with the goal of providing high quality experiences.
We generally support these goals, particularly in the suitable timber base and appreciate all the work that has gone
into the project. One of our big concerns is the protection and recruitment of old growth. From looking at the ERP
Map 2, there is an extensive road system and past harvest history. What is not apparent on that map is where the old
growth stands and wildlife corridors are located - the old growth is on a separate map and hard to overlay. Is it
possible to identify where the recruitment of old growth will be located that will allow an increase to a historic
range?
Response: While areas designated as old growth are not currently optimal, these areas are very well connected as
demonstrated by the amount of cover disclosed under the analysis for large ungulates (i.e. elk, deer, etc.) as well as
grizzly bear. Current cover levels on National Forest and US Army Corp. of Engineer lands exceeds 80% of the
analysis area.
Recognition of the need and desire for a variety of habitats for wildlife, including old growth, is demonstrated by the
first two statements under the purpose and need for the proposed action. The amount and distribution of old growth
is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest Plan Monitoring Report. These reports are available on
the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently meeting old growth standards set by the 1987 Forest
Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: Early on in the project Deena Shotzberger from the District had created an overlay of wildlife corridors
and future treatments in this area, which was a real positive move on the part of District, but this does not seem to be
present anymore? One of our goals is to provide adequate wildlife habitat and connectors and another goal is to
know what the plans for this area are over time. We would like to see this discussion and mapping in the Final EIS,
as it will allow us to better understand the current and future impacts on wildlife.

Response: While areas designated as old growth are not currently optimal, these areas are very well connected as
demonstrated by the amount of cover disclosed under the analysis for large ungulates (i.e. elk, deer, etc.) as well as
grizzly bear. Current cover levels on National Forest and US Army Corp. of Engineer lands exceeds 80% of the
analysis area. The District’s position on the working map created by Shotzberger is that it served as a catalyst for
long-term thinking or planning for managing forest connectivity using forest layers currently available (e.g. INFISH,
designated lynx habitat, as well as existing old growth stands) to visually display connecting habitats. Shotzberger’s
map was only a draft working copy and had not received additional input from other resources specialist during its
creation. For these reasons, this working corridor map will not be included in the FEIS for the East Reservoir
Project.
==================================================================================
Comment: We also have a concern about the size of the units, and their prescriptions. It could be taken that there
are very large clearcuts, adjacent to older large clearcuts. But if this is not the case, a detailed description of how the
units will be harvested would be beneficial. As the USFS moves toward treating larger areas to restore historic patch
size for the long term, will they be incorporating leave islands for short-term habitat security needs.
Comment: A more detailed discussion of the methodology that led to the large patch sizes would also be
useful. Our understanding of the science is that patch sizes ranged from less than an acre to tens of thousands of
acres, depending on intensity of disturbances such as fires, windthrow and insects. A discussion of how logging
would not only accomplish the same objectives as natural disturbance, but also vary from those objectives would
also be useful - and a discussion of how fire suppression will impact the stands now and into the future.
Response: The proposed action for the East Reservoir Project would create forest openings larger than 40
acres in size through the use of even-aged regeneration methods. Specifically, these larger openings are
needed in order to:
• Trend the landscape towards a more desirable pattern of patch sizes that mimics natural processes
and restores historical patterns of patch size (DEIS, pp.23-25; Vegetation Report, Desired Condition,
VRU 4,5 and 7).
• Create a pattern of fuel treatments at a landscape scale that is likely to disrupt large fire growth and
spread and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts. Design fuel treatments to provide a fuel break
immediately adjacent to a major power transmission line (DEIS, Fire and Fuels Report, p.182).
• Create openings that reduce edge effect and reduce fragmentation, which can result from more
numerous treatment areas and still achieve the same objectives (DEIS, Wildlife Report, p. 224, 301
and 308).
With past harvest activities, forage patches have become more uniform in size (30-40 acres) and
shape. The existing condition, for the most part, is not representative of reference conditions. Past
timber harvests have noticeably influenced the juxtaposition of wildlife cover and forage. Harvests
have unnaturally affected "edge" habitats as well as interior habitats, the greatest impacts likely being
on those species associated with large expanses of interior habitats (DEIS, Chapter1, p. 4).
This disturbance regime (30-40 acre) provides suitable habitat for species that are adapted to the edges
between forested and non-forested areas. However, species that require larger blocks of habitat are at a
disadvantage under such a disturbance regime (DEIS, p.S-2). The majority of the past harvest within this
area on NFS lands has fragmented the landscape due to the 40 acre opening limitation (DEIS, Chapter 3, p.
24).
Four of the regeneration harvests (Units 62, 40, 150 and 362) are proposed as over 40 acre regeneration, but
do not mimic the large historic patch size of 5,000 to 100,000 acres. However, Units 62, 40 and 150 are
placed adjacent to past harvest that are recovered, but are within the early-successional stage. By these units
being blocked up with other early-successional stages, this larger block mimics historic conditions and would
move into the future as a connected patch of interior forest (DEIS, Vegetation Report, p. 45, 46, 47).
Additionally, Units 147, 148, 149 and 150 in Upper Fivemile Creek and Unit 170 in Warland Creek were
designed to tie in with past regeneration harvests to simulate a fire that would have burned from the creek
bottom to the ridge top due to continuous fuels and favorable topography. This would have been more typical
of historic patch size and bum pattern when strategically located directly adjacent to existing regeneration
harvests that are still an effective barrier to high fire spread rates. Treatments of this scale are also more likely
to disrupt large fire growth and spread, and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts when a fire occurs in
these areas. Fire modeling indicates these areas are at risk of experiencing stand-replacing crown fire behavior
if left untreated and both areas are within 1 ¼ miles of private property. In addition to the benefits described
previously, Unit 362 near Hornet Ridge (Dunn Creek) was partially designed to provide a fuel break
immediately adjacent to a major power transmission line.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 43

Final Environmental Impact Statement

For wildlife, creating openings over 40 acres better approximates the patch size and pattern of habitat that
would have been available under natural disturbance processes and reduces edge effect and fragmentation that
would occur with a greater number of openings of lesser acreage. Additionally, stringers and groups of trees
would be left within the units to provide screening and minimize the effect of the openings when possible.
There may be short-term disturbances within identified big game travel corridors due to project related
activities (DEIS, pp. 224, 301, 308). Therefore, with the implementation of an action alternative, Alternative
2, which promotes large patch size, would benefit wildlife by addressing the issues of edge effect,
fragmentation, and interior forests better than Alternative 3 which limits regeneration harvest units to 40 acres
or less.
==================================================================================
Comment: As always we are concerned about past and future impacts on soil productivity and how the project will
comply with regional soil standards.
Response: The 15% threshold is based on research by Powers (1990). In order to meet NFMA direction and manage
National Forest System lands without permanent impairment, the policy of the Northern Region is to “…not create
detrimental soil disturbance on more than 15 percent of an activity area” (FSM, 2554.03). In areas where more than
15% detrimental soil conditions exist from prior harvest activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from project
implementation and restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and should move
towards a net soil improvement.
Units found to cumulatively exceed the 15% DSD value on one or more of the proposed activities will undergo
restoration activities as defined in R1 Supplement 2500-99-1 (effective 11/12/1999) – Restoration - Treatments that
restore vital soil functions to their inherent range of variability. It is recognized that treatments may not occur over a
period of years and may need to be maintained. Restoration treatments could include, but are not limited to, tilling,
ripping, seeding, mulching, recontouring of temporary roads and water barring. Such activities will help to offset the
harvest activities to soil productivity by allowing previously disturbed soils to re-establish as a productive area
capable of producing future natural vegetative cover.
Finally, application of appropriate management precautions (BMP’s) such as: 1) excluding RHCAs from equipment
entry; 2) use existing skid trails and landings where feasible; 3) avoid skidding on unstable slopes; 4) space skid
trails 75 to 125 feet apart; 5) avoiding timber harvest in wet seasons, maintaining buffer zones below open slopes,
and limit logging to dry conditions (less than 18% soil moisture) or during winter months when the ground is frozen;
and 6) controlling erosion during and after harvest activities to protect water quality and soil productivity will
decrease potential negative impacts regardless of timber harvest activities.

Letter 7:

Alliance for the Wild Rockies

Comment: Does the Forest Service have a take permit for having low level helicopter flights over grizzly bear
habitat?
Response: A take permit is not necessary due to a finding of “not likely to adversely affect,” for the grizzly bear.
These potential impacts were disclosed in the DEIS, biological assessment, as well as clarifying emails, and
subsequently concurred with by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in their letter of concurrence dated, August 8, 2013.
Helicopter use for prescribed burning will be limited to one, eight hour day for implementing one burn unit per year
or as burning windows (weather) allows. In this situation, it may be several years between burns. This approach is
consistent with the Guide to Effects Analysis of Helicopter Use in Grizzly Bear Habitat (2009).
==================================================================================
Comment: The Access Amendments facially and as applied by this project violate NFMA, NEPA, and the
ESA. They fail to apply the best available science, fail to ensure no jeopardy to the already failing grizzly population,
fail to ensure recovery, fail to ensure viability of the CY grizzly, fail to consider whether the Recovery Zone should
be expanded to do these things, and fail to consider applying the same standards to the BORZ as those applied in the
Recovery Zone to do these things, and fail to consider the probable potential and effect of likely noncompliance with
even the minimal inadequate standards in the Access Amendments, as illustrated in this project. This project likewise
fails to do all of the above and thus violates NFMA, NEPA, and the ESA.
Response: These potential impacts and finding of “not likely to adversely affect,” the grizzly bear were disclosed in
the DEIS, biological assessment, as well as clarifying emails, and subsequently concurred with by U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in their letter of concurrence dated, August 8, 2013. The application of recovery zone standards for
BORZ is outside the scope of this site-specific project.

Response: The revision of the Kootenai Forest Plan is outside of the scope of the East Reservoir project analysis.
Please refer to information on the revision at: http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/kootenai/landmanagement/planning
=================================================================================
3. How effective have BMPs been at stopping (i.e. preventing) new weed infestations from starting during logging
and related road operations?
Response: (ER DEIS pgs. 344-346) The BMPs identified for noxious weed management are found on the cited
pages. The KNF Invasive Plant Management FEIS states: “reduction in weed dispersal as a result of BMPs is also
not quantifiable. It is highly like that BMP measures such as equipment washing and seeding of disturbed sites have
reduced the rate of spread of noxious weeds (KNFIPMFEIS pgs. 3-13, 3-15-18). The Kootenai National Forest Plan
Monitoring and Evaluation Report from 2007 (pgs. 53-62) also documents monitoring of weed management efforts.
The Libby District also maintains specific monitoring records that demonstrate the effectiveness of the measures
used to control the establishment and spread of noxious weeds. These records include: Herbicide Treatment Data
Records, photo records and roadside surveys.
==================================================================================
4. Is it true that new roads are the number one cause of new noxious weed infestations?
Response: “The Chief of the USDA Forest Service has identified invasive species as one of the four critical threats
to our Nation’s ecosystems. In response to this national threat, we have evaluated the role of the Forest Service as a
leading forest research, forest health, and Federal resource management agency. We are aware of our significant role
in addressing invasive species threats at the local, state, and national levels, as well as internationally. We have
found the best opportunity for success comes from working strategically, using all our scientific, management, and
partnership resources in unison” ( http://www.fs.fed.us/invasivespecies/ index.shtml). (ER DEIS pgs. 324-325)
==================================================================================
5. Why isn’t the Forest Service considering a Forest Plan amendment in this Project to amend the Forest Plan to
include binding legal standards that address noxious weeds?
Response: (ER DEIS pgs. 324-325 and 346-347) Direction for noxious weed management comes from the KNF
Plan, the 2007 KNF Invasive Plant Management FEIS and ROD, Forest Service Manual 2080 Noxious Weed
Management and FSM 2900 Invasive Species Management. These documents provide the direction and measures
used for reducing the effects of noxious weeds within the project area. In addition, the management measures
identified within DEIS will be compliant with the Lincoln County Weed Control Act (MCA 7-22-2116) and a
Memorandum of Understanding between the KNF and Lincoln County.
Only site-specific Forest Plan amendments can be made within project specific NEPA. A Forest Plan amendment
applicable across the Forest cannot be implemented within project specific NEPA as that would require analysis at
the Forest scale, rather than the project scale. Therefore, it would not be appropriate or feasible to analyze a Forest
Plan amendment for noxious weeds in this project.
==================================================================================
6. Is it true that noxious weeds are one of the top threats to biodiversity on our National Forests?
Response: “The Chief of the USDA Forest Service has identified invasive species as one of the four critical threats
to our Nation’s ecosystems. In response to this national threat, we have evaluated the role of the Forest Service as a
leading forest research, forest health, and Federal resource management agency. We are aware of our significant role
in addressing invasive species threats at the local, state, and national levels, as well as internationally. We have
found the best opportunity for success comes from working strategically, using all our scientific, management, and
partnership resources in unison” ( http://www.fs.fed.us/invasivespecies/index.shtml) (ER DEIS pgs. 324-325).
=================================================================================
7. How can the Forest Service be complying with NFMA’s requirement to maintain biodiversity if it has no legal
standards that address noxious weeds?
Response: (ERDEIS pgs. 324-325, 346-347) The ER DEIS discloses direction for noxious weed management as
described under the response to Question 4. The KNFIPMFEIS (pgs. 1-13, 14) also describes policy in regards to
noxious weed management and its relationship to NFMA. Efforts to prevent or limit introduction and spread of
weeds are intended to maintain the biodiversity of native species.

8.

Will this Project address all Project area BMP needs, i.e. will the BMP road maintenance backlog and needs
from this Project all be met by this Project?
Response: The DEIS discloses the miles of road BMPs in Table 3.121 on page 3-402 that could be addressed with
this project. BMPs are proven practices that reduce the effects roads have on watersheds, but they are not permanent
remedies. BMPs need to be monitored and maintained as conditions change. BMP effectiveness monitoring has been
conducted and is referenced in the DEIS on Pages 3-168 to 3-169. Monitoring data has shown that the current levels
of BMP improvements and maintenance are protecting the streams within the project area (DEIS pgs. 3-166 to 3168).
“KNF monitoring has shown that BMPs have been properly implemented 97% of the time and have been 95%
effective in reducing and/or eliminating sedimentation (Appendix D). A list of BMPs, specific to this project, can be
found in Appendix C.” (DEIS Pages 3-167).
=================================================================================
9. What MIS did you find, how many and how did you look for these MIS?
Response: The potential MIS species for the analysis area are disclosed in the DEIS on page 221. MIS species
known to be present are the bald eagle, elk, white-tailed deer, and pileated woodpecker. Eagles are surveyed for on
an annual basis. One nesting territory or two individuals are known to the analysis area. Elk and white-tailed deer
are seen routinely during field visits with number estimates generated by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Pileated
woodpecker observations were documented during general field visits for various species habitats. At least one
individual was documented with much feeding /cavity sign was observed in the analysis area.
=================================================================================
10. How will the decreased elk security and thermal cover affect wolverines? Please formally consult with the US
FWS on the impact of this project on wolverines.
Response: The potential effects on wolverine due to decreases in canopy cover are disclosed in the DEIS beginning
on page 315. Consultation for wolverine is being conducted at the Regional level at this time and not on site-specific
projects due to the range of the species, generalized habitat associations, and the potential impacts of climate change
on the species due to its affiliation with persistent snowfields.
==================================================================================
11. What evidence do you have that this logging and prescribed burning will make the forest healthier for fish and
wildlife?
Response: The continued existence of native species populations as documented by local, state, and federal agencies
associated with the analysis area. Associated science used to analyzed the potential effects of vegetation treatments
are documented by individual species in the DEIS and available as part of the project file.
=================================================================================
12. What about the role of mixed severity and high severity fire – what are the benefits of those natural processes?
13. How have these processes (mixed and high severity fire) created the ecosystems we have today?
14. Over how many millennia have mixed and high severity fire have been occurring without human intervention?
Response: A detailed discussion of fire history and the role mixed severity and high fire severity fire regimes can be
found in the Vegetation Resource section and the Fire and Fuels Management section of chapter 3 of the DEIS.
As discussed in chapter 3, the East Reservoir analysis area exhibited low, mixed, and high fire severities across the
landscape. Historically, the influence of fire created a mosaic of stands with a variety of vegetation species, sizes,
ages and structures, as well as variable patch sizes. Prior to European settlement of the western states, the landscapes
of western Montana were largely characterized by the natural and Native American induced fire regime; influenced
by varying moisture, temperature and vegetation composition. Mixed and high severity fire regimes were typically
found in the following Vegetative Response Units (table 3.6 page 3-10): VRU 3 (22% of the planning area), VRU 4
(10%), VRU 5 (1%), VRU 7 (29%), and VRU 9 (13% of the area). These mixed to high severity fire regimes
account for about 75% of the planning area. The role mixed and high fire severity regimes would have played in
shaping the vegetation of the planning area is discussed in detail on pages 3-11 and 12, 3-18 to 3-27.
Proposed management activities are designed to fit within acceptable and manageable historic ranges (reference
conditions) we have identified, and are designed to foster the processes and patterns that make up the ecosystem.
Knowledge of historic conditions and natural disturbance processes, as described in the VRUs discussion can help
clarify the types, extent and causes of ecosystem changes, and can help identify management objectives and
restoration priorities (Brown 2004). It is hypothesized where community composition and structure occur within a
historic range of conditions, the function of the landscape community will also be maintained within its historic
range. It is important to note that function cannot be maintained by restoring the vegetation structure, composition
and patch size without restoring fire on the landscape. No mechanical means alone can duplicate the unique
ecological effects of wildland fire, such as soil heating, nutrient recycling, and the resulting effects to the community
composition and structure (Kauffman 2004, pg. 880).

15. What beneficial ecological roles do beetles play?
Response: Please refer to page 14 – 16 of the DEIS for the beneficial ecological role of insects and disease or see
below:
Most insects and diseases (pathogens) have integral functions in the forest ecosystem. They play a role in the fire
ecology of northwestern Montana by creating areas of dead conifers that fuel large, stand replacing fires. In general,
where fire is removed from the natural processes, stand density will increase, composition moves towards shade
tolerant species, and the probability of insect and disease outbreaks increase as populations increase and stress
increases (Waring and Schlensinger 1985).
Historically, the most conspicuous insects and diseases in the forest were bark beetles, defoliators, stem decays and
root disease. Root disease commonly thinned the Douglas-fir and grand fir from early seral stands of white pine,
ponderosa pine and western larch. The early seral species have a high level of resistance and were able to capitalize
on this reduced competition. The fires of the 1890s, selective harvest, fire suppression and the introduction of white
pine blister rust has removed much of the intolerant species and reduced the opportunity for early seral species to
become naturally established in some root disease areas. Root disease can predispose trees to attack by insects such
as bark beetles.
Mountain pine beetle (MPB) was a large mortality factor in the LPP forest, with periodic infestations on PP and
white pines. Douglas-fir beetle periodically caused significant mortality in late seral stands with a large diameter
Douglas-fir component. Stem decays were common in Douglas-fir, grand fir and subalpine fir.
The major insects and diseases found within the analysis area affecting forest composition, stand structure, and fuel
loads are described later in this analysis. There are other active insects and diseases within the analysis area, but
levels are generally low and not considered as threatening to forest composition or stand structure. Many of these
agents found affect species composition, but are considered within the "normal range" of a natural process. A
consideration of forest health emphasizes prevention as opposed to suppression as a management strategy for
insects, pathogens and natural disturbances that are considered detrimental to resource production. This emphasis is
made with recognition of their beneficial role with regard to resources and ecosystem functions.
=================================================================================
16. Can the forest survive without beetles?
Response: Insects and diseases (pathogens) have integral functions in the forest ecosystem. They play a role in the
fire ecology of northwestern Montana by creating areas of dead conifers that fuel large, stand replacing fires. In
general, where fire is removed from the natural processes, stand density would increase, composition moves towards
shade tolerant species, and the probability of insect and disease outbreaks increase as populations increase and stress
increases (Waring and Schlensinger 1985). Please refer to the DEIS (Ch. 3, pp. 14 – 16) for the beneficial ecological
role of insects and disease.
==================================================================================
17. Will all WQLS streams in the project area have completed TMDLs before a decision is signed?
Response: As per verbal communication with Lisa Kusnierz, US EPA, a TMDL is not being developed for Cripple
Horse Creek (WQLS) because it is not listed for sedimentation impairment but is listed for low flow alteration and
substrate habitat alteration (pollution impairments) which do not require the development of a TMDL. However, the
environmental causes of the low flow alteration and substrate habitat alternation will be addressed in a document.
=================================================================================
18. Why is logging that removes all/almost all trees considered regeneration (and not loss of existing forest), when
a stand-replacing fire is considered loss of the forest (and not regeneration)?
Response: It is not clear if you are referring to language in the East Reservoir project or more general use of
language by humans in casual situations. How language is used by humans and interpreted by humans is an
interesting topic to ponder but it is likely highly dependent on their culture. For the East Reservoir Project, we are
responsible to clearly disclose the prescription of the treatment areas so the public clearly understands what we are
proposing. One of the types of treatments in East Reservoir is regeneration harvests.
=================================================================================
19. How will the project improve watershed health?
Response: The implementation of BMPs and road improvements; culvert upgrades, increased ditch relief culverts,
surface water deflectors, drainage dips, etc. will benefit watershed health. Appropriately sized culverts will improve
stream connectivity, stream function, hydraulic function, bedload transport, large woody debris transport, and
aquatic organism migration. Improved and increased ditch relief culverts limit water flow concentration and can
minimize erosion. Improved and increased road surface features can limit water flow concentration and minimize
erosion. Appropriately sized culverts can enable aquatic organisms to migrate upstream and downstream.

20. Will this project leave enough snags to follow the Forest Plan requirements and the requirements of sensitive
old growth species such as flammulated owls and goshawks?
Response: Yes, the impact on snags is disclosed beginning on page 210 of the DEIS. Briefly, all proposed units in
Alternatives 1, 2, 3 maintain at least 40% snag level. No alternative causes the Cripple PSU overall potential
population level (PPL) to drop below the general forest 40% or riparian 60% primary cavity excavator PPL. This is
consistent with Forest Plan standards.
Kootenai Forest Plan cavity habitat standard (40% PPL) in MAs 15 and 16 is met by maintaining at snag capability
of at least 64.5% under all alternatives.
Kootenai Forest Plan cavity habitat standard in MA 10 is met by maintaining a snag capability of at least 93% under
all alternatives. Alternatives 2 and 3 would not require a project-specific amendment to suspend the requirement to
retain all existing cavity habitat in MA 10. All treatment units would be managed to meet the 40% minimum snag
level.
==================================================================================
21. After snags are cut down for safety for OSHA requirements will there still be enough snags left for old growth
sensitive species?
Response: Yes, the impact on snags is disclosed beginning in Chapter 3 on page 210 of the DEIS. Briefly, all
proposed units in Alternatives 1, 2, 3 maintain at least 40% snag level. No alternative causes the Cripple PSU
overall potential population level (PPL) to drop below the general forest 40% or riparian 60% primary cavity
excavator PPL. This is consistent with Forest Plan standards.
Kootenai Forest Plan cavity habitat standard (40% PPL) in MAs 15 and 16 is met by maintaining at snag capability
of at least 64.5% under all alternatives.
Kootenai Forest Plan cavity habitat standard in MA 10 is met by maintaining a snag capability of at least 93% under
all alternatives. Alternatives 2and 3 would not require a project-specific amendment to suspend the requirement to
retain all existing cavity habitat in MA 10. All treatment units would be managed to meet the 40% minimum snag
level.
==================================================================================
22. Will this Project exacerbate existing noxious weed infestations and start new infestations?
Response: The effects of the proposal on noxious weeds are addressed within the DEIS (pgs. 324-347). Specific
design criteria (management measures) are incorporated into the project to “reduce the spread of weeds in the East
Reservoir analysis area and minimize the chance of introducing new species.” (ER DEIS pgs. 344-345 and 31-33).
These management practices are implemented to reduce the likelihood of starting new infestations and exacerbating
existing infestations. Some of the measures, such as treating existing infestations on roads to be reconstructed, will
not exacerbate but will reduce these populations.
==================================================================================
23. Do unlogged old growth forests store more carbon than the wood products that would be removed from the
same forest in a logging operation?
24. What is the cumulative effect of National Forest logging on U.S. carbon stores? How many acres of National
Forest lands are logged every year? How much carbon is lost by that logging?
Response: U.S. forests are a strong net carbon sink, absorbing more carbon than they emit (Houghton 2003; US
EPA 2010, pg. 7-14). Private forestlands and NFS lands each sequester a net 101 Teragrams per year CO2/year, with
an additional 92 Teragrams CO2 per year stored in products from private harvests compared to only about 3
Teragrams CO2/year from harvest on NFS lands. Emissions from other disturbances such as fires, as well as
corresponding area estimates of disturbance are also important, but the needed datasets are not yet available (Heath
et al. 2011).
As described in Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage Report prepared for the East Reservoir Project (PF, Vol. S, Doc.
29), for at least the short-term, onsite carbon stocks will be lower under the action alternatives than under the noaction alternative. A portion of the carbon removed will remain stored for a period of time in wood products
(USEPA 2010; Depro et al. 2008). Actions such as those proposed here may, in some cases, increase long-term
carbon storage (Finkral and Evans 2008; North et al. 2009; Mitchell et al. 2009), but current research in this field
shows highly variable and situational results (Mitchell et al. 2009; Reinhardt and Holsinger 2010; Ryan et al. 2010).
==================================================================================
25. Is this Project consistent with “research recommendations (Krankina and Harmon 2006) for protecting carbon
gains against the potential impacts of future climate change? That study recommends “[i]ncreasing or
maintaining the forest area by avoiding deforestation,” and states that “protecting forest from logging or
clearing offer immediate benefits via prevented emissions.”
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Response: The referenced literature, Forest Management Strategies for Carbon Storage (Krankina and Harmon
2006), was reviewed, particularly the section on “Protecting Carbon Gains against the Impacts of Future Climate
Change”. It was noted that the authors suggest several general measures they believe can increase the stability of
forest in the changing environment, which align with the purpose and need to develop resilient forest conditions in
the East Reservoir project area (DEIS, Chapter 1, pp. 4 to 6). These are:
“Choice of species. In selecting species for planting at a given site it is important to consider their potential
growth and resilience in a warmer climate, with possibly more frequent droughts and weather extremes. Drought
resistance is probably the most important trait, as few trees die of excess temperature alone. Long-term resistance
to fire, pests, and pathogens is also important as all may become more active. In addition to local pest and
pathogen species, those likely to migrate from the south need to be considered as well.
Stand and landscape architecture can be designed to increase resistance and resilience of forests. For example,
avoiding extensive coverage by a single species and maintaining mixed species within stands and landscapes or
creating fire breaks with reduced fuel loads tend to increase the stability of forests. Thinning treatments can
improve stand stability as well.
Plans for coping with large-scale disturbance events are needed to ensure optimal timing for salvage,
regeneration, and other important decisions with long-lasting consequences (Lindenmayer et al., 2004).” (p. 87)
As stated in the Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage Report prepared for the East Reservoir Project (PF, Vol. S, Doc.
29, p. 5):
“As discussed elsewhere, the risk of some high mortality disturbance events is greater under the no action
alternative. To the extent the proposed actions reduce the risk or delay the event of future stand replacing
disturbance events, potential emissions from those events are equally reduced or forestalled.
Sustaining forest productivity and other multiple-use goods and services requires that land managers balance
multiple objectives. The long-term ability of forests to sequester carbon depends in part on their resilience to
multiple stresses, including increasing probability of drought stress, high severity fires, and large scale insect
outbreaks associated with projected climate change. Management actions, such as those proposed with this
project, that maintain the vigor and long-term productivity of forests and reduce the likelihood of high severity
fires and insect outbreaks can maintain the capacity of the forest to sequester carbon in the long-term. Thus, even
though some management actions may in the near-term reduce total carbon stored below current levels, in the
long-term they maintain the overall capacity of these stands to sequester carbon, while also contributing other
multiple-use goods and services (Reinhardt and Holsinger 2010).”
The statement “protecting forest from logging or clearing offer immediate benefits via prevented omissions” is
presented out of context. This is, in fact, just one of three general categories (listed below) the authors list as options
available to mitigate carbon accumulation in the atmosphere by measures within the forest sector (p. 84). The
activities proposed for the East Reservoir Project align with category two (in bold):
“(1) Increasing or maintaining the forest area by avoiding deforestation. (2) Increasing carbon density (ton of
carbon per hectare), either at the forest-stand level, using silvicultural techniques that accelerate forest
regeneration and growth, or slow decomposition (Figure. 2), or at the landscape level, using longer rotations,
conservation, and protection against fire and insects (Figure 4). (3) Increasing product substitution using forestderived materials to replace materials with high fossil fuel requirements, and increasing the use of biomassderived energy to substitute fossil fuels (Figure 3; see also Chapter 7).” (p. 84) (Emphasis added)
The role of the proposed project activities on carbon storage was considered using best available science.
==================================================================================
26. Please list each visual quality standard that applies to each unit and disclose whether each unit meets its
respective visual quality standard. A failure to comply with visual quality Forest Plan standards violates NFMA.
Response: A Forest Service paraprofessional landscape architect has performed an assessment for each activity
proposed in the East Reservoir EIS. Each activity assessment includes the Forest Plan visual quality objective
(VQO), the VQO attained if the activity proceeds, and the rationale for the attained VQO. There are activities
proposed in the East Reservoir DEIS where Forest Plan VQOs will not be attained. In these instances, the decision
maker has decided that other resources will be compromised in order to meet the VQO. See Chapter 3 of the DEIS,
page 365, Table 3.117 for the properties of each unit including visual quality objectives.
==================================================================================
27. For the visual quality standard analysis please define “ground vegetation,” i.e. what age are the trees,
“restablishes,” “short-term,” “longer term,” and “revegetate.”
Response: Here are the definitions requested for “visual quality standard analysis”:
“ground vegetation” ie. What is the age of trees – Trees on these soils/habitats/climates are usually 15-20 years
of age when they become visually significant.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 49

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

“reestablishes” – Grasses and forbs important in foreground views develop in 3-5 years after activities. Shrubs
and tree regeneration important in middle ground views develop in 5-15 years. However, the ability of tree
regeneration to soften lines or shapes does not occur until 15-20 years after activities.
“short-term” – This is the time frame for usually minor impacts to be mitigated, either naturally or through
management activities. Short term impacts commonly exist for 0-5 years after activities.
‘long-term” – This is the time frame for usually major impacts to be mitigated, mostly through natural processes.
Long term impacts commonly exist for 5-15 years after activities.
“revegetate” – see discussion above on “reestablishes”.
==================================================================================
28. Please disclose whether you have conducted surveys in the Project area for this Project for whitebark pine,
wolverines, pine martins, northern goshawk and lynx, grizzly bears as required by the Forest Plan.
29. Please disclose the last time the Project area was surveyed for whitebark pine, wolverines, pine martins,
northern goshawk, grizzly bears and lynx.
30. Please disclose how often the Project area has been surveyed for whitebark pine, wolverines, pine martins,
northern goshawks, grizzly bears and lynx. Is it impossible for a wolverines, pine martins, northern goshawks,
grizzly bears and lynx to inhabit the Project area?
31. Would the habitat be better for whitebark pine, wolverines, pine martins, northern goshawks, grizzly bears and
lynx if roads were removed in the Project area?
Response: Surveys for northern goshawks were conducted in 2011 with a follow-up visit in 2012. Specific surveys
for wolverines, lynx, and grizzly bears are not conducted by district personnel. These surveys occur out of the
Northern Rocky Mountain Research Station, Montana, Fish, Wildlife and Parks, or by U.S. Fish and Wildlife
personnel. Their findings are passed to the Libby District as needed. However, district personnel conducting routine
field visits do document the presence of these species on occasion and the information is passed along to the District
wildlife biologist.
The grizzly bear, lynx, and wolverine are suspected to be present in at least portions of the analysis area. The
northern goshawk is known to be present.
For species with large home ranges such as grizzly bear, Canada lynx, and wolverine, areas with few or no roads are
known to be beneficial as there would be fewer instances of human-species interactions.
Please see vegetation for discussion of impacts to whitebark pine. There is no Forest Plan direction for pine marten.
==================================================================================
32. What is the U.S. FWS position on the impacts of this Project on whitebark pine, wolverines, pine martins,
northern goshawks, grizzly bears and lynx? Have you conducted ESA consultation?
Response: ESA consultation is only required on federally listed species. The pine marten and northern goshawk are
not listed species and consultation for wolverine is conducted at the Regional level due to the species association
with persistent snow cover. Consultation for grizzly bear and Canada lynx was conducted with a letter of
concurrence for effects received on August 8, 2013 for this project. The finding for grizzly bears is that Alternatives
2 and 3 may affect, are not likely to adversely affect the grizzly bear. This determination is based on: 1) although the
existing condition of the Tobacco BORZ is considered to have adverse effects on grizzly bears, the East Reservoir
Project activities fall within the range-of-effects analyzed in the programmatic BO for the 2011 Forest Plan
Amendments for Motorized Access Management within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones
and therefore, in itself, is not likely to contribute to the loss of grizzly bears from the Tobacco BORZ; 2) helicopter
use associated with the this project is consistent with the management strategies found in the Guide to Effects
Analysis of Helicopter Use in Grizzly Bear Habitat (2009) that are not likely to adversely affect grizzly bears;
helicopter activities would not prohibit bears from using the area during any period of biological importance such as
breeding, late fall foraging (hyperphagia), or denning; 3) the East Reservoir Project does not change the livestock
management of the Tobacco BORZ; 4) project activities would not result in an increase in food attractants and
would comply with the 2011 KNF Food Storage Order; 5) the project would not result in measurable increases in
recreation use of the Tobacco BORZ based on limited improvements; and 6) the project does not involve changes to
any type of mining activities within the Tobacco BORZ and would not result in habitat fragmentation between
grizzly bear ecosystems, SCYE and NCDE.
The determination for the Canada lynx found the action alternatives may affect, are not likely to adversely affect the
lynx and may affect, are not likely to adversely affect designated critical lynx habitat. This determination is based on
the facts that: 1) these alternatives of the East Reservoir DEIS comply with all standards, guidelines, and objectives
of the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Record of Decision and its activities fall within the scope of
those analyzed in the subsequent Biological Opinion (2007), more specifically, the project would not result in
habitat conditions that would cumulatively contribute to the low level of species loss estimated by the 2007 BO; 2)
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

these projects do not involve any activities that may result in increased areas of snow compaction, nor permanent
loss of lynx habitat; and 3) although this project would temporarily affect the primary constituent sub-element,
‘matrix’ habitat and stem-exclusion stands, it meets ALL S1 standards, therefore maintaining habitat connectivity
within and between associated LAUs. Additionally, the project would not remove or significantly alter any of the
other primary constituent sub-elements including: space; nutritional or physiological requirements; cover or shelter;
breeding or rearing sites; or habitats protected from disturbance that represent historic, geographical, and ecological
distribution of the species. Please see vegetation for discussion of impacts to whitebark pine.
Consultation for wolverine is being conducted at the Regional level at this time and not on site-specific projects due
to the range of the species, generalized habitat associations, and the potential impacts of climate change on the
species due to its affiliation with persistent snowfields.
==================================================================================
33. Please provide us with the full BA for the whitebark pine, wolverines, pine martins, northern goshawks, grizzly
bears and lynx and lynx critical habitat.
Response: ESA consultation and a biological assessment is only required on federally listed species. The pine
marten and northern goshawk on not listed species and consultation for wolverine is conducted at the Regional level
due to the species association with persistent snow cover. The BA for grizzly bear and Canada lynx and lynx critical
habitat is available as part of the official Project File. In summary, the finding for grizzly bears is that Alternatives 2
and 3 may affect, are not likely to adversely affect the grizzly bear. This determination is based on: 1) although the
existing condition of the Tobacco BORZ is considered to have adverse effects on grizzly bears, the East Reservoir
Project activities fall within the range-of-effects analyzed in the programmatic BO for the 2011 Forest Plan
Amendments for Motorized Access Management within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones
and therefore, in itself, is not likely to contribute to the loss of grizzly bears from the Tobacco BORZ; 2) helicopter

recreation use of the Tobacco BORZ based on limited improvements; and 6) the project does not involve changes to
any type of mining activities within the Tobacco BORZ and would not result in habitat fragmentation between
grizzly bear ecosystems, SCYE and NCDE.
The determination for the Canada lynx found the action alternatives may affect, are not likely to adversely affect the
lynx and may affect, are not likely to adversely affect designated critical lynx habitat. This determination is based on
the facts that: 1) these alternatives of the East Reservoir DEIS comply with all standards, guidelines, and objectives
of the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Record of Decision and its activities fall within the scope of
those analyzed in the subsequent Biological Opinion (2007), more specifically, the project would not result in
habitat conditions that would cumulatively contribute to the low level of species loss estimated by the 2007 BO; 2)
these projects do not involve any activities that may result in increased areas of snow compaction, nor permanent
loss of lynx habitat; and 3) although this project would temporarily affect the primary constituent sub-element,
‘matrix’ habitat and stem-exclusion stands, it meets ALL S1 standards, therefore maintaining habitat connectivity
within and between associated LAUs. Additionally, the project would not remove or significantly alter any of the
other primary constituent sub-elements including: space; nutritional or physiological requirements; cover or shelter;
breeding or rearing sites; or habitats protected from disturbance that represent historic, geographical, and ecological
distribution of the species. Please see vegetation for discussion of impacts to whitebark pine.

Comment: The U.S. District Court just ruled that the Forest Service has to formally consult with the U.S. FWS on
the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction effect on lynx and lynx critical habitat. Have you done this? If
not please do so.
Response: Consultation for grizzly bear, Canada lynx, and lynx critical habitat was conducted with a letter of
concurrence for effects received on August 8, 2013 for this project.
==================================================================================
Comment: In December 1999, the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management completed their “Biological
Assessment Of The Effects Of National Forest Land And Resource Management Plans And Bureau Of Land
Management Land Use Plans On Canada Lynx” (“Programmatic BA”). The Programmatic BA concluded that the
current programmatic land management plans “may affect, and are likely to adversely affect, the subject population
of Canada lynx.” The BA team recommended amending or revising Forest Plans to incorporate conservation
measures that would reduce or eliminate the identified adverse effects to lynx. The Programmatic BA’s
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 51

Final Environmental Impact Statement

determination means that Beaverhead Forest Plan implementation is a “taking” of lynx.
The fact that continued implementation of the Forest Plans constitutes a “taking” of the lynx is not disclosed in the
DEIS. Such taking can only be authorized with an incidental take statement, issued as part of a Biological Opinion
(B.O.) during a Section 7 consultation. The FS must incorporate terms and conditions from a programmatic B.O. into
a Forest Plan amendment or revision before projects affecting lynx habitat, such as the East Reservoir Project, can be
authorized.
The Programmatic BA’s “likely to adversely affect” conclusion was based upon the following rationale (p. 4), all of
which apply here. Forest Plans within the Northern Rockies:
• generally direct an aggressive fire suppression strategy within developmental land allocations. …this strategy
may be contributing to a risk of adversely affecting the Lynx by limiting the availability of foraging habitat
within these areas.
• allow levels of human access via forest roads that may present a risk of incidental trapping or shooting of Lynx
or access by other competing carnivores. The risk of road-related adverse effects is primarily a winter season
issue.
• are weak in providing guidance for new or existing recreation developments. Therefore, these activities may
contribute to a risk of adverse effects to lynx.
• allow both mechanized and non-mechanized recreation that may contribute to a risk of adverse effects to lynx.
The potential effects occur by allowing compacted snow trails and plowed roads which may facilitate the
movements of lynx competitors and predators.
• provide weak direction for maintaining habitat connectivity within naturally or artificially fragmented
landscapes. Plans within all geographic areas lack direction for coordinating construction of highways and other
movement barriers with other responsible agencies. These factors may be contributing to a risk of adverse
effects to lynx.
• fail to provide direction for monitoring of lynx, snowshoe hares, and their habitats. While failure to monitor
does not directly result in adverse effects, it makes the detection and assessment of adverse effects from other
management activities difficult or impossible to attain.
• forest management has resulted in a reduction of the area in which natural ecological processes were historically
allowed to operate, thereby increasing the area potentially affected by known risk factors to lynx. The Plans
have continued this trend. The Plans have also continued the process of fragmenting habitat and reducing its
quality and quantity. Consequently, plans may risk adversely affecting lynx by potentially contributing to a
reduction in the geographic range of the species.
• The BA team recommends amending or revising the Plans to incorporate conservation measures that would
reduce or eliminate the identified adverse effects to lynx. The programmatic conservation measures listed in the
Canada Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy (LCAS) should be considered in this regard, once
finalized.
The BA notes that the LCAS identifies the following risk factors to lynx in this geographic area:
• Timber harvest and precommercial thinning that reduce denning or foraging habitat or converts habitat to less
desirable tree species;
• Fire exclusion that changes the vegetation mosaic maintained by natural disturbance processes;
• Grazing by domestic livestock that reduces forage for lynx prey;
• Roads and winter recreation trails that facilitate access to historical lynx habitat by competitors;
• Legal and incidental trapping and shooting;
• Being hit by vehicles;
• Obstructions to lynx movements such as highways and private land development;
It is clear, then, that the FS must do more than follow its Forest Plans to protect lynx.
The DEIS fails to fully demonstrate Project consistency with all LCAS Standards and guidelines. For example, the
LCAS sets mandatory Standards that would modify or amend the Forest Plans—steps the BNF has thus far not
accomplished. Important Programmatic Standards include:
Identify key linkage areas that may be important in providing landscape connectivity within and between
geographic areas, across all ownerships. (p. 87)
Develop and implement a plan to protect key linkage areas on federal lands from activities that would create
barriers to movement. Barriers could result from an accumulation of incremental projects, as opposed to any
one project. (Id.)
Map and monitor the location and intensity of snow compacting activities that coincide with Lynx habitat, to

facilitate future evaluation of effects on Lynx as information becomes available. (p. 82)
On federal lands in Lynx habitat, allow no net increase in groomed or designated over-the-snow routes and
snowmobile play areas by LAU.
Response: East Reservoir DEIS was developed under the Kootenai Forest Plan and not the Beaverhead Forest Plan.
It complies with all standards, guidelines, and objectives of the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction
Record of Decision and its activities fall within the scope of those analyzed in the subsequent Biological Opinion
(2007), more specifically, the project will not result in habitat conditions that will cumulatively contribute to the low
level of species loss estimated by the 2007 BO. The project does not involve any activities that may result in
increased areas of snow compaction, nor permanent loss of lynx habitat. Although this project will temporarily
affect the primary constituent sub-element, ‘matrix’ habitat and stem-exclusion stands, it meets ALL S1 standards,
therefore maintaining habitat connectivity within and between associated LAUs. Additionally, the project will not
remove or significantly alter any of the other primary constituent sub-elements including: space; nutritional or
physiological requirements; cover or shelter; breeding or rearing sites; or habitats protected from disturbance that
represent historic, geographical, and ecological distribution of the species.
Consultation for Canada lynx, and lynx critical habitat was conducted. A letter of concurrence for the determination,
“not likely to adversely affect,” for both lynx and lynx critical habitat was received on August 8, 2013 for this
project.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS discloses use by motorized recreationalists in the Project area. But the DEIS provides an
incomplete analysis of the impacts of the current level of use of the Project area for motorized recreationalists. The
DEIS and BA fail to disclose the expected level of cumulative impacts on Lynx from the new roads and skid
trails/logging access routes to be constructed—access that could be used by snowmobilers, snowshoers, and cross
country skiers long after the logging activities have stopped. These roads can also impact lynx habitat during other
seasons because of increased access for humans.
The increased access that will result from this project contradicts LCAS requirements because the new roads will
create an increase in over-the-snow routes. The DEIS and BA fail to provide adequate maps of LAUs and habitat
components along with areas of human activity as the LCAS requires, making it impossible for the public and
decision maker to understand the impacts of motorized travel, as well as to understand impacts on habitat and
connectivity of habitat. The BA lacks a genuine analysis of the full range of cumulative impacts of other activities.
The DEIS and BA also fail to disclose the cumulative effects of livestock grazing on the grazing allotments in the
project area.
The Programmatic BA’s analysis of the ability of the Forest Plans, as ‘amended’ by the LCAS, to prevent a “taking”
of the lynx is based upon the Forests’ meeting management standards. As the Beaverhead NF has not adequately
shown that it is in compliance with its old growth standards, or that it even has valid old growth standards, as
detailed elsewhere in this appeal, the project BA and EA are not in compliance with the LCAS.
We also have to question the validity of the percentage habitat standards set by the LCAS itself. The Forest Service
would be hard-pressed to find many Lynx Analysis Unit in the Northern Region—heavily logged or otherwise—that
already don’t meet these percentages. Basically, what these Standards accomplish is to validate the management
status quo—the very situation that led to the listing of the lynx under the ESA.
Response: The lynx analysis for the East Reservoir Project begins on page 306 of the DEIS and discloses all
required potential effects. The validity of the LCAS standards is outside the scope of this project. Consultation for
Canada lynx, and lynx critical habitat was conducted. A letter of concurrence for the determination, “not likely to
adversely affect,” for both lynx and lynx critical habitat was received on August 8, 2013 for this project.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS’s action alternatives propose road storage, which will result in segments of roads being made
hydrologically neutral and closed to all travel. We believe that those activities are of the highest priority of all
proposed actions.
Response: Thank you for your support in this area.
=================================================================================
Comment: There is hardly any feature on forest landscapes that is less sustainable than a road network for which the
Forest Service (FS) chronically receives inadequate funding for maintenance. For the same reasons, we are also
firmly opposed to any new road construction.
Response: Your comments will be taken into consideration.
==================================================================================
Comment: We urge you to identify the “right-sized” minimum road system for the project area required by the
Travel Management Rule (36 CFR 212.5), identify the details of a plan in the FEIS that will achieve that, and then
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 53

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

make the hard decisions that may conflict with other short-term interests yet will serve long-term ecological and
economic sustainability.
Response: The Travel Management Rule (Nov. 9, 2005) directs the Forest Service to conduct travel analysis to inform
decisions related to travel management. The East Reservoir travel analysis has identified the minimum road system needed
for safe and efficient travel and for administration, utilization and protection of National Forest System (NFS) lands {36
CFR 212.5(b) (1)}. The analysis was used to inform decisions for the designation of roads, trails and areas for motor vehicle
use in the project area, as shown on pages 3-943 through 3-403.
=================================================================================
Comment: Please disclose the mileage of roads proposed for storage that fall in to the category of those that may be
stored by taking no action because they are currently hydrologically inert. This is important because reconstruction
of such roads would in most ways create the same adverse impacts as new road construction.
Response: Your comment will be taken into consideration.
==================================================================================
Comment: Perhaps the most important ecological feature for forest ecosystems is the functioning and integrity of
the soil. “Soil is a critical component to nearly every ecosystem in the world, sustaining life in a variety of ways—
from production of biomass to filtering, buffering and transformation of water and nutrients. …(B)ecause soils are
critically important building blocks for nearly every ecosystem on earth, an holistic approach to natural resources
protection requires that soils be protected…” (Lacy, 2001.) A holistic restoration proposal would reduce the legacy
effects from past timber harvest, and other human-caused disturbances which may affect watershed health and the
terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
Response: Comments will be taken into consideration.
==================================================================================
Comment: The Region 1 Soil Quality Standards (SQS) are quantitative (<15% detrimental soil disturbance),
demonstrating consistency and compliance involves disclosing the amount of detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) that
now exists in Activity Areas, and what the cumulative totals would be following disturbance by trails, roads, fire
lines, and other causes of DSD. The DEIS does not disclose that the 15% threshold is not based upon scientifically or
publicly (i.e., NEPA) developed limitations on the soil damage.
Response: Table 3.37 in Chapter 3 discloses all existing soil disturbance values on a unit by unit context in the
proposed activity area along with the post-harvest cumulative DSD% per unit per alternative. The cumulative value
includes not only proposed harvest activities as well as related new temporary road constructions and landings
located outside proposed harvest unit boundaries as well as post-harvest fuel abatement impacts such as fire line
constructions. It should be noted that not all proposed units involve similar fuel abatement activities.
Regarding the 15% threshold, it is based on research by Powers (1990). In areas where more than 15% detrimental
soil condition exist from prior activities, the cumulative detrimental effects from project implementation and
restoration should not exceed the conditions prior to the planned activity and should move toward a net improvement
in soil quality. The standards do not apply to infrastructure and intensively developed sites such as permanent
roads/landings, mines, developed recreation and administration sites.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS provides a very vague explanation of the methods used to use measured soil survey data from
assessment in the field to estimate total DSD for each proposed treatment unit. The accuracy of estimates given for
previously impacted units is doubtful.
Response: As discussed on page 62…”All units containing evidence of existing soil disturbance related to past
management activities received a full qualitative field survey using R1 Soil Survey Procedures. Field soil surveys
consisted of random stratified transect/sample point methods with confidence intervals at or above 80% ± 5% with
the majority of surveys being 95% ± 5%. Completed soil surveys can be found in the Soil Project File and/or District
Files. Existing detrimental soil disturbance numbers are a result of all currently measureable effects of past actions in
each activity area, including but not limited to timber harvest (trails and landings), temporary road construction,
management related burns, cattle grazing, off highway vehicles, natural disturbances, firewood gathering, etc. These
methods provide data that is used in the analysis to determine if Forest Plan and Regional Soil Quality Standards
would be met...”
The soil surveys completed by the KNF Soil Scientist or KNF Soil Assistant are completed with equal intensity thus
resulting in a confidence interval at or above 80% ± 5% with the majority of surveys being 95% ± 5%. As a result
the KNF reviews provide a very accurate quantitative value of what the existing physical conditions are within the
proposed management units. All data points are consistently sampled by reviewing the existing soil at every other
pace. Each pace is considered to be a sample location and soil review is completed with a tile spade shovel to
determine the resistance to penetrating the soil. Physical resistance to penetration was found to correlate well with
altered soil conditions related to management activities. In areas displaying the strongest properties of legacy soil
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

compaction the shovel blade is only capable of penetrating a short distance into the soil and with great effort.
The soils resource report goes on in Soils Table 3.32 (page 63) to display what the average DSD coefficients are
based on the average disturbance levels found in the field (2000-2005) following harvest and fuel abatement
activities. This data group is being used as it is felt that it more closely represents current harvest/fuel abatement end
soil disturbance values.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS states that there has been a lot of logging in the project area in the past, in the era when soil
impacts were of much lesser concern and therefore soil integrity was less protected. The fact that the DEIS does not
even estimate the amount of DSD over the vast majority of those acres is ignoring cumulative effects on soil
productivity and watershed effects, which is what NFMA requires the Forest Service to maintain. The soil quality
standards the DEIS relies upon mostly limit damage to soils while carrying out the next set of management actions,
without providing any scientifically justified metrics for soil productivity.
Response: The spatial scale or geographic bounds for considering cumulative effects consist of the same activity
area analyzed for the direct and indirect effects. This is appropriate because soil productivity is spatially static and
productivity in one location does not affect productivity in another location. The activity areas are delineated as
directed by Forest Service Manual R-1 Supplement No. 2500-99-1.
Furthermore, as stated on page 97…”The temporal is scale dependent on the issue being addressed with no one scale
being appropriate for all issues…..Furthermore, there is often a lag between some options and the observed effect.
This is particularly true for soils…”
The Soils Specialist Report follows Regional Guidelines for DSD as identified in FSM 2500-99-1. Not all
disturbance is identified as detrimental. The discussion of the adequacy of standards (FSM 2500-99-1) and lack of
public land laws is beyond the scope of this analysis.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS also fails to adequately explain how measurements of conditions relating to measured soil
damage equate with effects on short- and long-term soil productivity. The DEIS also ignores much science when it
claims that soil erosion, displacement, and compaction do not affect soil productivity.
Response: To address the temporal scale of both short-term and long-term soil productivity, the KNF has actively
been involved in an intensive post-harvest soil monitoring program. This KNF soil monitoring program originated in
1988 and is still actively continuing. As of 2012, a sum of 254 timber sales (538 timber sale units) involving 6,625
acres has been monitored following harvest and fuel abatement activities to determine the impacts of timber removal
activities on soils within the KNF. This information has been used to solidify the amount of disturbance expected to
occur based on differing harvest practices using different pieces of machinery.
Beginning in 2012-2013 field seasons, the KNF embarked on a soil study to determine if soil recovery was occurring
in a selected sub-group within the units where post-harvest soil monitoring data had been collected. The time period
of this study was those units monitored, between 1992 and 2006, which contained post-harvest soil monitoring
transect data. By the close of the 2012 field season, 55 timber sales (118 timber sale units) involving 3,338 acres
using soil sampling procedures identical to those between 1992 and 2006 was completed. Results found that
approximately 80% of the units had measureable reduced DSD value and thus an improved soil recovery and related
productivity as compared to initial soil monitoring surveys. This research has not yet been published.
Regarding Soil Erosion, Displacement and Compaction: All three if these variables were used to calculate the
existing DSD values. Refer to Chapter 3, page 63.
==================================================================================
Comment: The March 2009 “Region 1 Approach to Soils NEPA Analysis Regarding Detrimental Soil Disturbance
In Forested Areas: A Technical Guide” states, “When these indicators (compaction, rutting, burn severity,
displacement, surface erosion and mass movement) are found, the soil is considered disturbed. When management
activities cause the indicators to exceed the threshold established in the soil quality standards, the disturbance is
considered detrimental (potentially impairing productivity).” The DEIS fails to demonstrate that the disturbances
noted in soil survey project file documents don’t pass objectively and reasonably established thresholds.
Response: The adequacy of the Soil Technical Guide is beyond the scope of this project. The above summarizes
only what may be present on a single location within a proposed unit. Total DSD calculations are a quantification
summary for the entire unit along with proposed temporary roads constructed for timber harvest and new landings.
As a result, the total detrimental disturbance value needed to determine if 15% or greater disturbance is present is a
“quantitative summary value”.
==================================================================================
Comment: The above-mentioned March 2009 Region 1 Technical Guide indicates that the Forest Service allows
those doing soil surveys to lack basic scientific training or other proper qualifications. Such personnel are the only
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 55

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

ones collecting the field data, therefore solely making the determination of what is or what is not DSD. It is not clear
if the KNF surveys for this project were collected by properly trained and qualified individuals.
Response: All data for the East Reservoir Project were either collected by the KNF Forest Soil Scientist or someone
who has been trained in soil survey procedures.
==================================================================================
Comment: The above-mentioned March 2009 Region 1 Technical Guide also doesn’t specify or define the various
levels of soil survey intensity, to allow anyone to understand how soil surveys themselves can be considered
providing accurate information. Legacy soil damage such as compaction may not be evident from simple visual
surveys or shovel tests. Furthermore, the accuracy of soil compaction estimates using the survey methodology the
KNF utilized cannot be determined, because the DEIS did not disclose the accuracy and reliability of those
techniques.
Response: The March 2009 Region 1 Soil Technical Guide is beyond the scope of this project.
As discussed on page 62…”All units containing evidence of existing soil disturbance related to past management
activities received a full qualitative field survey using R1 Soil Survey Procedures. Field soil surveys consisted of
random stratified transect/sample point methods with confidence intervals at or above 80% ± 5% with the majority

management related burns, cattle grazing, off highway vehicles, natural disturbances, firewood gathering, etc.
These methods provide data that is used in the analysis to determine if Forest Plan and Regional Soil Quality
Standards would be met...”
The accuracy in soil disturbance values has been solidified through a very intensive post-harvest soil monitoring
program of units previously harvested and had fuel treatments completed. This soil monitoring program originated
in 1988 and is continuing into the future. As of 2012, a total of 254 timber sales (538 timber sale units) involving
6,625 acres have been monitored following harvest and fuel abatement activities to determine the impacts of timber
removal activities on soils within the KNF. This information has been used to solidify the amount of disturbance
expected to occur based on differing harvest practices using different pieces of machinery.
==================================================================================
Comment: The KNF has no regulatory mechanism, following from NFMA, which addresses the essentially
permanent loss of soil and land productivity due to the noxious weeds that active management cultivates. The DEIS
cites no monitoring results that actually demonstrate affirmative control of noxious weed outbreaks, nor is any
monitoring of the efficacy of noxious weed treatments cited.
Response: (ER DEIS pg. 329) The East Reservoir DEIS (ER DEIS) has incorporated by reference the Kootenai
National Forest Invasive Plant Management FEIS/ROD (2007) (KNFIPMFEIS/ROD) which addresses the
environmental effects of invasive plant treatments and authorizes control including chemical and biological control.
The EIS also states, “field studies of the effects of herbicides on soil microorganisms are limited. The risk
assessments conducted by SERA conclude that the plausibility of adverse effects on soil productivity from any of the
proposed herbicides is minimal. Results from studies on 2,4- D, aminopyralid, chlorsulfuron, clopyralid, and
metsulfuron methyl indicate that the maximum concentrations projected in the soil following herbicide application
would be below the toxic effect level. Laboratory and/or field studies on the other eight herbicides (dicamba,
glyphosate, hexazinone, imazapic, imazapyr, picloram, sulfometuron methyl, triclopyr) indicate some level of
inhibition in soil microbial activity but substantial impacts on soil – i.e. gross changes in capacity of soil to support
vegetation – do not seem plausible. Field experience in the use of these herbicides in cropland situations indicates no
change in soil productivity that would inhibit plant growth (KNFIPMFEIS pg. 3-100).”
==================================================================================
Comment: “Large woody debris is essential for maintenance of sufficient microorganism populations and long-term
site productivity.” (IPNF’s Bussel 484 DEIS at 161.) In order for to adequately analyze and disclose cumulative
effects, in the context of such “essential” factors, field surveys of representative past logged areas must be performed
in the project area. The DEIS fails to disclose data from project area surveys for coarse woody debris in old logging
units, which is another way that the cumulative effects analysis is inadequate.
Response: Over the past 2 years the KNF has resurveyed past harvest units to determine remaining CWD
concentrations following fuel abatements. These surveys show that in regeneration units post-harvest stands are
meeting the CWD requirements as determined by Graham et al. 1994 and Brown et al. 2003. Coarse woody debris
provides micro-sites for microbial activity, retains carbon on-site, and moderates soil moisture. Maintaining CWD at
required levels identified in these guidelines will ensure that both short-term and long-term soil productivity is
maintained. Implementation of the action alternatives in the DEIS is not expected to adversely impact nutrient
cycling as related to CWD requirements.

Comment: Applying the concept of Historic Range of Variability (HRV) for sustaining forest ecosystems, as the
DEIS does, may be appropriate as long as the uncertainties pertaining to reference conditions of the project area are
addressed, and all important resource conditions are adequately considered within the HRV framework. The DEIS,
unfortunately, represents an imbalanced use of the HRV concept. For example, given the paucity of historical data of
timber stands and landscape pattern of the project area, and given that data is obsolete, the DEIS’s analysis does
cannot adequately support the proposed manipulation of timber stands. It is extremely important to utilize the best
data available to make accurate determinations of the reference conditions and to be able to therefore correctly
identify departures from the reference conditions (Churchill, 2011; Noss, 2001).
Response: Churchill (2011) was written to provide a science summary for mesic forests for the Colville National
Forest restoration strategy. Churchill (2011) explains how HRV needs to use a variety of tools, it is not as simple as
just having current data.
“………Use multiple tools to derive site specific targets: Pre-settlement conditions offer a baseline from which to
evaluate current conditions and obtain a general direction for restoration. They are especially useful in identifying
conditions that are clearly outside of historical precedent. They can often tell us clearly what not to do. Deriving
specific targets from HRV is much more difficult, as the range of historical conditions is so wide. HRV should be
combined with functional information and tools such as habitat requirements for focal species, fire modeling (e.g.
flammap), aquatic restoration needs, and other objectives….”
In addition, Noss (2011) states:
“…the variable nature of ecosystems suggests that conservationists have a moving target. …One of the most useful
new ideas is the concept of “natural” or “historic” range of variability. This concept recognizes that natural
ecosystems are always changing, but that variation over time falls within certain bounds. …Many ecologists
consider the historic range of variability before European settlement (in North America) to be the appropriate set of
“reference conditions” for comparison with human-altered conditions and a guide to enlightened management.…The
logic behind the use of historic variability to guide ecosystem conservation and management is compelling. …The
challenge for conservationists is not to prevent change. A sustainable relationship with a dynamic earth requires that
we allow ecosystems to respond to environmental change with minimal losses of biodiversity. That means assuring
that the changes we impose on ecosystems are within the range of variability that native species have experienced
over their evolutionary histories.”
In order to understand the variations ecosystems have experienced over time, a variety of data sources are needed.
For instance, Noss makes reference to data from fire scars on trees and pollen and charcoal laid down in lake
sediments that helped assess and understand fire-return intervals and proportions of old growth in the Oregon Coast
Range over the last 3,000 years. Such data could have been gathered several decades ago and still be relevant when
it comes to understanding the historic range of variability in a forested environment.
Managing the forest for multiple resources while attempting to emulate natural processes is not an exact science
where there is one correct solution. The reference conditions that are used in this project analysis were derived from
a variety of sources. The ranges of conditions are estimates based on a synthesis of information from research of
historic vegetation (Lesica 1996, Losensky 1994, Fisher and Bradley 1987) as well as other documents and analysis
such as the Interior Columbia River basin Ecosystem Management Project (USDA, USDI 1997). Historic and prehistoric information (back to 351 A.D.) from research (Chatters and Leavell 1995) of bog cores (analyzed to identify
the species composition from pollen found in the cores) were also used to develop the reference ranges. The
reference conditions used in this analysis are documented in the Vegetation Response Unit Characterizations and
Target Landscape Prescriptions (USDA Forest Service 1999).
District vegetation databases (FACTS, FSVeg), a R1 Summary Database and field reconnaissance were utilized to
generate information on forest vegetation attributes such as forest cover type, stand density and successional stage,
the vegetation response unit (VRU) classification, incidents of insect and disease, as well as information on past
activities. Annual aerial observations of insect and disease activities were also evaluated to facilitate understanding
of longer term fluctuations in insect and disease dynamics across the landscape. Aerial photographs, both historic
and contemporary were used at various stages of the analysis. Scientific literature, field reviews and subsequent
silvicultural assessment were also used in the analysis. These analysis tools were used to identify site-specific
treatment needs that address the purpose and need for the project.
The inherent limitations to the database and models are recognized. Not all surveys and subsequent data come from
the same time period, with some surveys over 20 years old. A portion of the areas with older data were field
reviewed and determined it was still valid for analysis. The data is used primarily for broad generalizations,
arithmetic sums and means, and to supplement current, site-specific information gathered at each proposed unit and
area of interest. R1 FSVeg has adequate resolution and accuracy for applications required in this effects analysis
discussion.

We are not attempting to recreate past conditions, and do acknowledge that the modern human imprint cannot be
eliminated. Our proposal to restore ecosystems within a broad historical range is an attempt to keep all the parts, and
to maintain a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, based on coarse filter management theories.
Proposed management activities are designed to fit within acceptable and manageable historic ranges (reference
conditions) we have identified, and are designed to foster the processes and patterns that make up the ecosystem.
Knowledge of historic conditions and natural disturbance processes, as described in the VRUs later in this analysis,
can help clarify the types, extent and causes of ecosystem changes, and can help identify management objectives and
restoration priorities (Brown 2004). It is hypothesized where community composition and structure occur within a
historic range of conditions, the function of the landscape community will also be maintained within its historic
range. It is important to note that function cannot be maintained by restoring the vegetation structure, composition
and patch size without restoring fire on the landscape. No mechanical means alone can duplicate the unique
ecological effects of wildland fire, such as soil heating, nutrient recycling, and the resulting effects to the community
composition and structure (Kauffman 2004, pg. 880).
Reference conditions provide insights to important questions such as natural frequency, intensity and scale of
disturbances, abundance and rareness of plant and animal species, and the age-class, size classes, and tree species
composition (Kaufman et al. 1994). They also provide a valuable tool when combined with other information
gathered from a variety of sources, such as site-specific investigation, old timber type data, old photos, fen (bog)
sediment analysis, fire scar analysis, historical and research references, and inferences from VRU classifications
designed for the Kootenai National Forest.
==================================================================================
Comment: Whereas the project often retains the largest trees in treated units, the DEIS also discloses that logging of
some large-diameter trees may occur. This is inconsistent with the best science on the relative scarcity of large, old
trees on the landscape—even outside old growth. (E.g., Hessburg, et al. 2007.) The action alternatives would be
better in line with the latest science if a diameter limit on tree removal or cutting was adopted that would leave
standing the vast majority of large, old trees in treated units.
Response: In general, the largest trees will be left in treated units; however there are some situations where a smaller
diameter will be chosen over a larger tree due the unit specific objectives. For examples, leaving mosaics of habitats
including large and small trees while reducing density.
==================================================================================
Comment: The lack of an accurate, reliable forestwide old-growth inventory just increases our concern that the
Forest Service is unwilling to take the necessary steps to assure wildlife viability.
Response: The amount and distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest
Plan Monitoring Report. These reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently
meeting old growth standards set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: The majority of the unmanaged stands in the watershed are mature forest. Also, there is a need to
manage for the arrangement of potential future old growth. (DEIS at 5, 6). The lack of a desired condition statement
for this important wildlife habitat reduces the credibility of the DEIS. Whereas the DEIS has active management
prescribed to meet desired conditions related to vegetation, we strongly believe that identifying areas to be
prioritized for preserving as is areas of habitat for old-growth MIS and other key wildlife based upon the HRV of old
growth and the latest ecological science 2 are necessary to meet forest plan and legal requirements for insuring viable
populations of wildlife.
Harris, 1984 believes that “biotic diversity will be maintained on public forest lands only if conservation planning is
integrated with development planning; and site-specific protection areas must be designed so they function as an
integrated landscape system.” (Emphasis added.)
Response: Recognition of the need and desire for a variety of habitats for wildlife, including old growth, is
demonstrated by the first two statements under the purpose and need for the proposed action. The amount and
distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest Plan Monitoring Report. These
reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently meeting old growth standards
set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
==================================================================================
Comment: Largely because of past logging, the project area falls extremely below the HRV for old-growth habitat
2

See for example, Camp et al. 1997 regarding “old-growth refugia”, or the areas on the landscape where old growth would likely
persist in the face of natural disturbances, based upon such factors as slope, aspect, juxtaposition with streams, and forest types.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

conditions—even well below the 10% forest plan distribution standard. We appreciate that the DEIS documents the
FS designating “replacement” old growth to meet and even exceed the 10% distribution standard, however the result,
as viewed from the map, is still highly fragmented habitat with no dedicated habitat areas for connectivity. This is
not consistent with the best science.
Information from the KNF’s Gautreaux (1999) indicates that about 22% old forest or old growth is at the lower limit
for “reference conditions” on the KNF. The KNF’s Dueker and Sullivan, 2001 state: “We recognize that historical
conditions probably provided a higher level of old forest habitat through time than what is provided by the Forest
Plan direction (a mean of 27.7% as opposed to 10%).” So utilization of the Forest Plan’s 10% old-growth Standard
itself is not consistent with the KNF’s own best available science on “reference conditions.” Lesica (1996) stated that
use of 10% as minimum old-growth standard may result in extirpation of some species. This is based on his estimate
that 20-50% of low and many mid-elevation forests were in old growth condition prior to European settlement. The
KNF has never completed an analysis, based upon the best scientific information available, that adequately analyzes
the wildlife viability implications of managing the KNF well below the HRV.
The EIS does not disclose how much old growth, or how much habitat for old-growth associated wildlife species, has
been destroyed or degraded by all the past logging in the project area. The significance of these past cumulative
impacts is without analysis, contrary to NEPA.
The FS acknowledges that a substantial percentage of the old-growth blocks counted as “effective” old-growth in the
KNF are less than 50 acres, however Forest Plan states that this designation of such small blocks as effective was to
be the “exception rather than the rule.” Since the Forest Plan indicates that blocks of old-growth timber less than 50
acres in size do not “provide habitat for those wildlife species dependent on old-growth timber for their needs”, it
cannot be “best science” for any of the blocks less than 50 acres to be considered “effective” old growth for
inventory and viability analysis purposes. Designating these smaller blocks has become the rule, and not the
exception, as cautioned against when the Forest Plan and its related strategies were adopted.
Since there is no scientific support for the premise that the present amount and distribution of designated effective
old growth and replacement old growth (ROG) in the project area supports viable populations, it is troubling that the
project activities will deplete even more habitat for the wildlife that are associated with old growth. This runs counter
to the forest plan and NFMA mandates to assure viable populations.
The DEIS’s analysis methodology allows the Forest Service to continually log mature forest whenever and wherever,
without considering the potential of those areas to achieve the HRV of old growth, connectivity, patch size, edge
effects, etc.
Response: The DEIS provides a list of past management activities in the Cripple PSU, on page 3 of chapter 3, dating
back to 1976. Prior to 1976 records are few. Likely several of these treated areas contained large diameter trees, but
whether or not all elements of old growth were present is speculative. Since 1987 the KNF has been managing old
growth at 10 percent in all major drainages and will do so until new standards are in place. The amount and
distribution of old growth is monitored annually and documented in the annual Forest Plan Monitoring Report. These
reports are available on the Kootenai National Forest website. The KNF is currently meeting old growth standards
set by the 1987 Forest Plan.
While areas designated as old growth are not currently optimal, these areas are very well connected as demonstrated
by the amount of cover disclosed under the analysis for large ungulates (i.e. elk, deer, etc.). Current cover levels on
National Forest and US Army Corp. of Engineer lands exceeds 80% of the analysis area.
==================================================================================
Comment: The KNF and project area are not being managed compliance with the MA 13 Facilities Standard #1,
which requires that “Local roads will be restricted to prevent premature cutting of the snag component” (Forest Plan
at III-56). We note that both of the action alternatives would exacerbate this negative situation by fragmenting old
growth and increasing edge effect by new roads and logging adjacent to old growth, worsening the viability situation
for old-growth associated wildlife.
Response: Where old growth areas are thought to be susceptible to firewood cutters, they are signed as “no firewood
cutting” allowed and enforced through the issuance of form FS-2400-001 (Forest Products Removal Permit and Cash
Receipt). These permits are issued under certain conditions which clearly state where firewood cutting is
permissible. Granted some snags in old growth are likely lost due to individuals not adhering to these permit
conditions are those caught are prosecuted to the extent that the governing laws allow.
The East Reservoir project does propose new temporary roads (666 feet). Construction of these roads will likely
remove some snags and this effect is disclosed in the DEIS beginning on page 204. Following the use of temporary
roads, the temporary prism will be decommissioned and not passable by firewood cutters so a continued effect on
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 59

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

snags is not anticipated. Any portions of new permanent roads through old growth will be restricted by a barrier
(gate, rocks, berms etc.) following treatment activities and again, snags will not be susceptible to firewood cutters
unless illegal trespass occurs.
==================================================================================
Comment: The failure of documented pileated woodpecker nesting in the project area may be attributable to KNF
forest plan direction that does not recognize the average snag diameter being almost 30” dbh for this MIS. The need
for large diameter snags for nesting trees for the pileated woodpecker is downplayed in the DEIS. McClelland and
McClelland (1999) found, in their study in northwest Montana, that the average nest tree was 73 cm. (almost 29”)
dbh. The DEIS does not consider that such large snags are absolutely necessary for keystone wildlife species such as
the pileated woodpecker, therefore absolutely necessary for so many species that rely upon its excavated cavities.
The DEIS does not present data on pileated woodpecker population abundance or nesting success in the project area.
Since there is no scientific basis for assuming that 10% old growth is enough for species viability, and since there is
no scientific basis to support the KNF’s use of its MIS as adequately “indicating” for other species including the
Sensitive wolverine, black-backed woodpecker, fisher, flammulated owl, northern goshawk, western toad, wolverine,
Townsend’s big-eared bat, etc., the proof would be in the monitoring. And the Forest Service has not completed
monitoring that would validate the assumption inherent in the Forest Plan’s old-growth habitat standards—that they
are adequate for assuring old-growth species’ viability. We also note that the Forest Service has stated that this KNF
old-growth MIS don’t really work as the forest plan intended, which leaves NFMA’s viability purposes shortchanged.
Response: The DEIS discloses potential effects on old growth, snags, down wood, and pileated woodpecker
beginning on page 200; the fisher on page 265, flammulated owl on page 270, and the northern goshawk on page
235. The DEIS discusses the importance of large diameter trees and subsequent snags for all of these species in their
respective sections. For example, within the snag analysis it was noted that “In the long-term, the proposed
improvement harvests identified in the action alternatives are expected to provide for the continuity of large-diameter
ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir. This in turn provides a long-term benefit to cavity-dependent species, as over time
they would become snags. Commercial thinning would follow a basal area reduction prescription. A majority of the
ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir stands would retain larger and older trees in the overstory to maintain vertical structure
and provide future replacement snags” as well as this statement under flammulated owls which acknowledges that
“Proposed timber harvest has the potential to impact flammulated owl habitat. Selective logging that removes large
ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir trees can decrease the availability of early-season feeding sites, song and roost sites,
and trees for snag recruitment in areas already limited in large snag abundance (Wright 1996 p. 77). Snag removal
during timber harvest for OSHA safety standards also removes suitable habitat for flammulated owls,” thus
emphasizing the importance of the large snag component.
==================================================================================
Comment: There exists no scientific justification why the FS has dropped the goshawk from the Sensitive species
list for the KNF. USDA Forest Service, 2011d states on p. 3-194, “Region 1 has defined viability for the goshawk as
one pair for every 10,000 acres (Warren 1990).” Logically, the KNF being 2.2 million acres/10,000 acres per
goshawk pair = 220 pairs needed for viability on the KNF.
Given that its own (KNF) information on low goshawk numbers existed as least as early as 2006—when the northern
goshawk was on the Sensitive species list, it is inexplicable why the KNF has failed to consider its own scientific
information that strongly suggests viability of the goshawk has been severely in doubt on the KNF for years now.
Response: Northern goshawks, especially during the breeding season, can be difficult to find. Likewise, individuals
respond differently to solicit calling. The fact that only one goshawk pair responded to surveys does not rule out the
existence of other breeding pairs in the PSU. It is likely additional pairs of nesting goshawks will be found during
implementation and, if so, nesting territories will also be established for these goshawks. Concerns related to the
removal of the northern goshawk from the Region 1 Sensitive Species Lists need to be addressed to the Regional
Forester.
==================================================================================
Comment: Lacking valid scientific support for its habitat management strategy, and without adequate historical and
current data covering the project area, the Forest Service has left assurance of the viability of MIS and TES species
on the KNF in limbo. The Committee of Scientists (1999) makes this point about species viability;
(P)erhaps the single best metric of sustainable use of land is the persistence of species over time. The public
needs to understand that the productivity of an ecosystem can be sustained over the long term only if species
persist.
Population dynamics include assessing population size, population growth rate, and linkages to other populations and
must be included in a scientifically sound population viability analysis. Ruggiero, et al. (1994a) point out that a
sound population viability analysis must utilize measures of population dynamics. Mills (1994) explains the range of
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 60

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

parameters that must be used to make a scientifically sound assessment of the viability of wildlife species.
Population dynamics refers to persistence of a population over time—key to making predictions about population
viability.
The key factors that affect population dynamics of those MIS and Sensitive species are not adequately considered in
the cumulative effects analyses, therefore viability is not assured, as NFMA requires. The DEIS does not disclose
and utilize the best scientific information available on those species, as NEPA requires.
Response: Documentation for presence or absence of all suspected species and what is known about their
populations for the analysis area is disclosed in the respective sections of the DEIS.
The project complies with NFMA direction (16 USC 1604 (G)(3)(b) to “provide for diversity of plant and animal
communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use
objectives, and within the multiple-use objectives of a land management plan adopted pursuant to this section,
provide, where appropriate, to the degree practicable, for steps to be taken to preserve the diversity of tree species
similar to that existing in the region controlled by the plan.”
Field surveys for various species were conducted during the planning of this project with results disclosed under the
discussion for individual species. Potential effects of this project on these species or their habitats are also disclosed
as required under each respective resource section.
==================================================================================
Comment: The EIS conflates “replacement old growth” with old growth that meets Green et al. criteria in various
analyses. This is not in accord with the best science, NFMA, or NEPA, since the DEIS admits that “replacement” old
growth is not required to meet the criteria.
The old growth analysis together with the old-growth MIS analysis does not consider the HRV or any historic
conditions where addressing population viability.
Response: While areas designated as old growth are not currently optimal, these areas are very well connected as
demonstrated by the amount of cover disclosed under the analysis for large ungulates (i.e. elk, deer, etc.). Current
cover levels on National Forest and US Army Corp. of Engineer lands exceeds 80% of the analysis area. Designated
old growth acres within the Cripple PSU are 50 acres or greater. There may be some areas of undesignated old
growth that are less than 50 acres which is the rationale for why they are undesignated. Other areas categorized as
“designated replacement,” may contain enough large trees to meet Green et al. but may lack other elements of old
growth. Or these areas may contain all the old growth elements of old growth but lack enough large diameter trees.
Regardless of the reason for being categorized as replacement old growth, they represent the best habitat currently
available for old growth associated species.
==================================================================================
Comment: The science on climate change supports the idea that national forest management emphasis should shift
away from logging to carbon storage. All old-growth forest areas and previously unlogged forest areas should be
preserved indefinitely for their carbon storage value. Forests that have been logged should be restored and allowed
to convert to eventual old-growth condition. This type of management has the potential to double the current level of
carbon storage in some regions.
Response: The comment suggests the Forest Service's emphasis should shift to carbon storage and all old growth
forest areas and previously unlogged forest areas should be preserved indefinitely for their carbon storage value. The
scientific literature cited by the commenter does not support the policy prescriptions they suggest, particularly
within the disturbance driven ecosystems of the inland west, including the East Reservoir area (see literature
discussions in Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage Report (PF, Vol. S, Doc. 29). In addition, inferred carbon
inventory maintenance or gains from deferred harvest can be an illusory claim, particularly applied at stand level
practices such as in the East Reservoir project. These implied gains only hold true if harvest does not occur
elsewhere in the world to supply the same world demand for timber (Gan and McCarl 2007; Murray 2008; Wear and
Murray 2004). The result can be a net carbon impact if the timber is replaced in the marketplace with higher carbon
source products such as steel or concrete or is harvested in a manner that does not result in prompt reforestation
(Ryan et al. 201 0; Harmon 2009). However, the “No Action” alternative in the DEIS effectively represents the
comment’s intent, and the effects of the various alternatives on carbon storage and flux were examined (see East
Reservoir EIS, errata and the Forest Carbon Cycling and Storage Report in the project record, Vol. S, Doc. 29).
The scientific and other literature provided in the comment has limited direct relevancy to the issue at hand: whether
or not the relationship of the East Reservoir project to "climate change" warranted more detailed analysis in this
DEIS. All represent valid studies or treatises on their particular subject matter (arguably with the exception of
Hanson 2010), however their scope is either at the global scale or else study or focus on ecosystems quite different
than those being considered here.

For example, the various Harmon papers (1990, 2001, 2002), Keith et al. 2009, and Homann 2005 deal largely with
the relatively warm, wet forests of the Pacific NW where disturbance and succession dynamic, and thus carbon
dynamics, differ substantially from those of the Kootenai National Forest.
Turner et al. 1995 and Woodbury et al. 2007 report estimates of existing carbon stocks and flux in U.S. forests.
Neither paper recommends conversion of all forests to old growth conditions, or suggests a land management policy
similar to that proposed in the comment. Similarly, Turner et al., 1997 is a brief letter to the editor commenting that
another paper overestimates the potential benefits of carbon storage in harvested wood products and aforestation.
Kutsch et al. 2010 presents a standardized protocol for the assessment of soil CO2 fluxes, with particular focus
relative to monitoring national carbon budgets under global climate treaties and VanderWerf et al. 2009 is a
scientific commentary recognizing that deforestation (which is not part of this proposal) is the second largest
anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Solomon et al. 2007 is the IPCC Summary for
Policymakers on the physical science basis for climate change. All, within their global perspective, speak to human
actions quite unlike those contemplated here.
Harmon 2009 is Dr. Harmon's testimony to Congress concerning "The Role of Federal Lands in Combating Climate
Change." His seven key points are: "1) Forests are leaky carbon buckets; 2) Forests can play an important, but
limited roles in sequestering carbon; 3) All carbon pools need to be examined when thinking through the merits of
carbon policy; 4) To increase the sequestration of forest carbon, we need to either increase carbon inputs, decrease
carbon outputs, or put forest carbon somewhere else; 5) Forests are best seen as a bridging strategy in carbon
mitigation; 6) Seemingly "good" forest carbon ideas when examined at the stand level at a point in time dissipate
when looked at the forest level over time; and 7) With accelerating climate change, forests may shift from being part
of the carbon solution to being part of the carbon problem." The testimony is insightful and readable, but is aimed at
national policy and does not support the comment’s conclusions.
==================================================================================
Comment: The fuel reduction proposed actions have forest health implications—including adverse effects as the
scoping notice implies. Since the fuel reduction regime represented by the proposal was not a planning scenario dealt
with in sufficient detail (if at all) during Forest Plan development, both the project-level and programmatic
ecological and economic costs and impacts remain unexplained and undisclosed. The Forest Service has not
disclosed just how much of the KNF needs to be treated for fuel reduction in a manner that emphasizes maintaining
fuel conditions that are not necessarily consistent with native ecological processes. The agency must address the
cumulative impacts of fire and fire management under the current IKNF fire policy.
Response: From a fire and fuels management standpoint, fuel treatments in the WUI are the priority and the main
objective is to provide for firefighter and public safety. When it does not conflict with this objective WUI fuels
treatments are also intended to be consistent with native ecological process. Fuel treatments outside the WUI are
intended to meet the purpose and need of the East Reservoir project.
Cumulative impacts from fire suppression are addressed in Chapter 3 (Pages 176-177) under the No Action
Alternative of the Fire and Fuels Management section.
Analysis of the Kootenai National Forest’s fire suppression policy and how much of the Kootenai National Forest
needs to be treated for fuel reduction is beyond the scope of the analysis for this project.
==================================================================================
Comments: The large amounts of proposed canopy reduction via logging and burning concerns us also because of
the presently unstable condition of creeks and tributaries. Bedload sediment effects go largely ignored. Therefore the
impacts of rain-on-snow and other peak flow events are not adequately analyzed. The DEIS is not consistent with the
best science on forest hydrology.
The DEIS relies upon BMPs for showing consistency with the Clean Water Act, yet doesn’t disclose effectiveness of
BMPs for that very purpose. The condition of most of the managed watersheds on the District argues against the
validity of BMPs for protecting water quality and fisheries.
Response: Using the Rosgen methodology for assessing stream conditions, all the streams in the Analysis Area were
determined to be in a Fair to Good condition. The proposed canopy reduction as well as proposed peak flow
increases is within the range for streams in Fair and Good condition and as recommended in the Forest Plan.
BMP effectiveness and tracking for the KNF are located in the Water Resources Project File Appendix D and E.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS discloses that bull trout and redband trout have likely been extirpated from the project area
due to management actions. It also does not give any indication of population trends of the Sensitive westslope
cutthroat trout—if surveys are showing maintaining, improving, or declining stocks.
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 62

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Response: Surveys show that fish are utilizing available habitat. Electrofishing surveys found multiple year classes
in fish bearing streams throughout the project area. INFS default RHCAs will continue to protect aquatic habitat and
will avoid retarding RMOs. Streams in the project area were treated to remove native fish and allow stocked
westslopes and advantage for spawning and rearing. The drainages have not been stocked are now repopulated with
hybrid fish along the reservoir. Dunn Creek was not treated, however past stocking of the Kootenai River and its
tributaries created an extensive hybrid swarm of fish. These fish have invaded Dunn Creek creating hybrid
rainbows/cutthroat trout. The upper segment of the stream has a nearly pure population of westslopes that are
isolated from lower Dunn Creek. This population is regulated by flow conditions. There is only one perennial
tributary in upper Dunn Creek. The beaver flats below this tributary have been trapped out and no longer maintain
water from year to year.
==================================================================================
Comment: The DEIS does not discuss the fish viability issues related to stream segments not meeting
INFISH/Forest Plan Riparian Management Objectives (RMOs). The DEIS does not provide clear analysis as to how
RMOs would not be adversely affected, or achieved over any time frame.
Response: Refer to Tables 3.47 to 3.51 in the Fisheries and Aquatic Species Resources section of the DEISs. These
tables set the stage for RMOs in the project area. Fish viability was shown through electrofishing surveys which
proved the existence of multiple year class fish. We know fish are using available habitat and maintaining
populations that the local ecosystem can support. The data shows that, in general, most RMOs are being met or
exceeded. Large wood debris numbers fully meet or exceed Forest Plan standards in drainages across the project
area. Bank stability also meets or exceeds standards. Width to depth rations and pool frequency is mostly not being
met. As stated in the EIS, width to depth ratios most always do not fit into local numbers on the Kootenai. These
stream dimensions were calculated for streams on the Oregon and Washington coast. The numbers are therefore an
indicator of the dimensions of streams in the area. Pool frequency was an RMO that was not met in most cases in the
project area. Streams are still recovering from past activities and natural events. Large fires have influenced Cripple
Horse Creek and Canyon Creek. Past grazing on Cripple Horse, Canyon, Warland and Five Mile have caused
riparian problems. Past Forest Service fisheries habitat enhancement where wood was removed from stream
channels has been wide spread across the area. Implementation of INFS into the Kootenai National Forest Plan in
1995 created a set of RHCAs to protect the riparian area and improve or protect key fisheries habitat elements.
These elements were based on best scientific data that showed intact riparian areas led to healthier aquatic
ecosystems. RHCAs have been monitored since implementation of INFS and have showed through protection
streams have maintained or trended towards more natural states. This project will require all streams and wetlands
buffered by RHCAs. Therefore, the existing condition will maintain or improve conditions. Since this is the
language set in the Forest Plan this project will be consistent with INFS and will not retard the attainment of RMOs.
==================================================================================
Comment: In its overly narrow analyses of cumulative effects of past management activities, the DEIS does not
provide adequate summaries of the purpose and need statements from past NEPA documents, the level of
achievement of their desired conditions and/or project goals, results of required monitoring, nor the consistency of
past project with resource conditions as expressed in the desired condition and purpose and need statements.
Response: The proposed project utilized past information from the turn of the century through dam construction to
present conditions. Past management was consistent with direction and laws of that time. Recent management since
1995 has been consistent with INFS and is therefore consistent with the KNF Forest Plan. The project will also be
constant will all other State and Federal laws.
==================================================================================
Comment: In closing, we intend that you include in the record and review all of the literature we’ve cited herein,
and a comprehensive, detailed list will be provided shortly. Also, please keep each of our groups on the list to
receive further mailings on the proposal.
Response: Electronic files of all submitted literature cited are included in the project file.

Letter 8:

J. Wandler

Comment: The alternative that does nothing, would indicate that all motorized trails would be left in place, but any
other action suggests that a great portion of the motorized routes would need to be closed for wildlife ,ETC. This
makes no sense, since the current conditions must not be affecting wildlife as the do nothing alternative suggests.
Response: The no-action alternative (Alt 1) does nothing to improve security during the hunting season as the draft
EIS suggests. Currently, the security level is below desired security levels of 30% as recommended by Hillis et al.
1991. The desired condition is to meet or exceed the 30% standard and this will be made clear in the errata for the
final EIS. Closing all or portions of the motorized trails will allow the Cripple PSU to meet or exceed the desired
security conditions.
=================================================================================
Comment: If the need to close any motorized trails is included in any of the proposed actions, then as the process
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 63

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

moves forward then the closures should occur as the project progresses. If units are dropped then additional trails
will remain open, and not subject to closure. Over the course of the 10 year project?, it should take the 10 years to
close those motorized trails. This will give time to determine if wildlife is being impacted by the remaining open
routes, so that a minimal amount of closure would be necessary, if impacts are not present. This will also give
additional time to query the public to prioritize/ identify the most used versus the least.
Response: If an action alternative is chosen, the closing of trails could begin immediately if funding allows. Closing
trails over a 10-year period is unlikely because the area will be out of compliance with the security standards for elk
under the new Forest Plan which is expected to be new direction in late 2013 or early 2014.

Letter 9:

R. and B. Geber

Comment: Proposed harvest units 3A and 3B in the Fivemile creek drainage directly border our property and are
between our land and the Stenerson Mtn. road #4885. Currently we are unable to see road #4885 which is a heavily
hunted road during big game season. We have made improvements to our land some being very valuable and
providing our only source of power which is solar. The timber on Forest Service land is providing shelter to our
solar array from road #4885. The timber makes viewing our array impossible at this time. We fear that by removing
the timber in proposed harvest units 3A and 3B our array will be visible from the seasonally open road and may be
vandalized or stolen. Please consider dropping these small harvest units or consider a fuels treatment instead.
Response: Commenters have been contacted. A field visit with the commenters to create some design features in the
units/buffers and possibly drop the small piece directly above their property to mitigate concerns of hunters
shooting/viewing down at their property.
==================================================================================
Comment: Proposed harvest units 3A and 3B in the Fivemile creek drainage will open the forest up to a level that
people will be able to drive trucks or ATV’s off road #4885 right up to our property for illegal recreation or
firewood gathering. We have seen this become a problem across the Libby Ranger District after improvement
harvests. Also, we have a major concern with the spread of noxious weeds onto our property from Forest Service
lands, currently our property is nearly weed free except for the Forest Service easement along the southern side of
our property. The easement is 30 feet from center line and only about 8 feet of the weeds are sprayed annually. The
weeds have become established on the easement and do not all get sprayed, then blow their seeds onto our land and
become our problem. We have seen timber harvests across the Libby Ranger District that lead to a noxious weed
infestation that goes un-checked for many years. Please consider a fuels treatment or dropping these small harvest
units.
Response: Commenters have been contacted. A field visit with the commenters will occur to create some design
features in the units/buffers and possibly drop the small piece directly above their property to mitigate concerns of
hunters shooting/viewing down at their property.
==================================================================================
Comment: Proposed harvest unit 3C is a seed tree, as defined by 95% canopy removal. You mention on page 365 in
the DEIS under scenic resources that this harvest will not attract viewer attention but we will see it every day, as
well as the numerous recreationists, hunters, and firewood gatherers who use the road, and do not want a 95%
canopy removal next to our land. Please consider a fuels treatment as an alternative.
Response: Commenters have been contacted. A field visit with the commenters to create some design features in the
units/buffers and possibly drop the small piece directly above their property to mitigate concerns of hunters
shooting/viewing down at their property.
=================================================================================
Comment: We would like to voice our support of the following portions of the East Reservoir proposed action:
1) The proposed road changes and stream work in the Dunn creek drainage.
2) Seed tree harvests on the north aspect of the Fivemile creek drainage.
3) Converting current motorized trails to non-motorized. Approximately 26-36 miles.
Response: Thank you for your interest and comments in the East Reservoir project.

Kootenai Stakeholders Forest Coalition

Comment: New Permanent Roads- We believe the increase in new permanent roads from 2.4 miles in the draft to 9
miles in the DEIS is justified based on your further analysis of the transportation plan and changed land allocations
identified in the proposed Kootenai N.F. Forest Plan. Temporary roads that will be needed in the future should not
be obliterated. New road construction that will result in a net reduction of unneeded temporary roads is a positive
action.
Response: Thank you for your support in this area.

East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Comment: We encourage you to use existing temporary road templates where possible when converting to a
permanent road. We also encourage you to provide adequate drainage structures on any permanent roads that will
not be used for extended periods of time.
Response: Your comments will be taken into consideration.
==================================================================================
Comment: Motorized Trail Closure - We support your efforts to close motorbike trails that have simply evolved
over time. This will result in improved elk security. However, we also recognize the need for motorized ATV trails
and would recommend that the Boundary Mtn. Loop Trail be included in the selected action as proposed in
Alternative 3.
Response: The Forest Service agrees with your assessment. The motorized trails being considered for closure never
were designed for off-road vehicles when constructed 70 years ago and present serious safety issues to motorized
users. The development of motorized trails for off-road vehicles will require Forest Service and user commitment to
meet safety issues.
==================================================================================
Comment: Regeneration Units over 40 acres- We support stand treatments at landscape levels larger than 40 acres,
provided that their design emulates the appropriate fire ecology of the stand. A mixed severity fire regime might
have left smaller “skips” of unburned areas whereas a stand replacement fire regime would have tended to leave
fewer, but larger “skips”. We believe that these “skips” need to be designed through the prescription and
implemented in the unit design wherever possible and not just left to chance following the harvest.
We would also encourage you to better explain your description of regeneration units over 40 acres in the EIS. If the
end result will end up in a mosaic of different stands as described above, the reader needs to understand this.
Otherwise they will simply assume that you will have a large clearcut.
Response: The DEIS explains regeneration harvests and specifically clearcuts in Chapter 2 on page 9.
Regeneration harvest treatment is intended to replace a forest stand when modification treatments (i.e. intermediate
harvest) are not feasible due to poor quality trees for retention; stand is under stocked due past insect and disease
mortality; or incorrect overstory species that will not meet management objectives. In this analysis area,
regeneration is proposed in some stands to promote regeneration of seral, fire-tolerant species. Specifically,
regeneration harvest is needed to restore western larch, ponderosa pine and western white pine. Within proposed
harvest units, there will be both live and dead trees that are designated for reserve. The number of trees left and the
associated stand structure is described by the varying regeneration harvest methods proposed. A description of these
methods follows.
Clearcut with reserves also initiates establishment of a new stand. An average of 4 to 8 trees per acre will remain on
site post treatment and their function will be as snags, cavity habitat, or replacement snags. Clearcuts are typically
planted by hand, or may be reseeded by adjacent mature stands if desirable trees are present.
Each of the treatment units have been reviewed by a wildlife biologist and a visuals specialist. All of these clearcut
will have reserve trees ranging from a minimum of 6 trees per acre to 12 or more for replacement snags and
structural diversity. In addition, all snags that meet minimum snag criteria will be left in clearcut reserve treatment
areas. Units that have additional concerns from the the wildlife and visual specialists have been addressed and have
specific objectives to address them. For example, some clearcuts have more snag replacements required for leave
due to the habitat or more reserve trees for visuals.
Following NEPA, we will move into project implementation including layout and marking guides. During unit
layout we will be looking for cover patches within larger regeneration harvests to leave. Currently in the project, the
exact number of islands and placement of islands has not been determined. This will be determined on the ground
during layout and specific marking guides.
The response to this comment is fully disclosed in the project file, Vol. S, Doc. 30 (Over 40- acre justification).
==================================================================================
Comment: Old Growth – We support the treatment of old growth as originally proposed in Unit 133 during our
initial field trip. Removing the Douglas fir in-growth will improve the growing conditions of the ponderosa pine and
lessen the likeliness of insect attacks. We would also support treating the adjacent stand that appeared to be the same
as Unit 133.
Response: Unit #133 was dropped as there were only four ponderosa pine trees in this unit. We focused the
treatment where the majority of the Ponderosa pine is located in lower Fivemile Creek along the reservoir.
==================================================================================
Comment: Timber Harvest- Increasing the timber harvest acres from the draft of 8,070 acres to 8,845 acres is a
positive move provided that the purpose and need of the project are met.

Response: Thank you, we appreciate your support of this project.
==================================================================================
Comment: Area Planning- We encourage the district to take a close look at the initial planning work that Deena
Shotzberger had done on this project. We recognize that the lynx habitat requirements and the BORZ analysis of
grizzly bear habitat outside of the recovery area are going to complicate attempts at long range planning. Being able
to show where you can include existing old growth and replacement old growth in the future just makes a lot of
sense. If these areas can be incorporated into wildlife linkage zones it gives everyone a much better perspective of
the results of your future actions. We do not believe this level of planning will obligate the district to future action,
but only be a good faith effort to plan for the future.
We also support Deena’s explanation that these corridors are not necessarily “keep out” zones, but most likely
would need some level of management over time to accomplish and maintain their stated objective.
Completing an area analysis in a large area like this one gives the planner the opportunity to set objectives and
priorities for treatment. We do not feel this aspect of planning to be evident in the DEIS. Forests are certainly
dynamic and likely to change based on species, weather conditions, insects, disease and fire. However, determining
a priority for treatment appears to us to be necessity and not just a rolling of the dice. Our observations indicate that
based on the age and condition of the lodgepole pine component, these stands are most in need of immediate
treatment. Stands within the WUI and adjacent to private property should also make the priority list.
Response: The District’s position on the working map created by Shotzberger is that it served as a catalyst for longterm thinking or planning for managing forest connectivity using forest layers currently available (e.g. INFISH,
designated lynx habitat, as well as existing old growth stands) to visually display connecting habitats. Shotzberger’s
map was only a draft working copy and had not received additional input from other resources specialist during its
creation. For these reasons, this working corridor map will not be included in the FEIS for the East Reservoir
Project.
==================================================================================
Comment: We observed fir engraver beetle activity in the subalpine fir, which might be another consideration in
some stands. Some of the stands show root rot (armillaria) in the Douglas fir. Do you have a good handle on these
insects and disease? Road construction, reconstruction and post sale work are economical factors that need to be
considered.
Response: The Regional Pathologist and Regional Entomologist have reviewed the East Reservoir analysis area.
Both of these specialist spent several days in the analysis area and have prepared reports that can be found in the
project file. There is actually very little armillaria in the analysis area, however there is schweinitzii root disease in
the older Douglas-fir and western larch.
=================================================================================
Comment: We thank you for allowing our group to be a part of this project. The time that your district personnel
have spent with us is surely appreciated. We believe this is really a good project and we would hope that the
enclosed comments might help it be even a better one.
Response: Thank you for your interest and comments in the East Reservoir project.

Letter 11:

Yaak Valley Forest Council

Comment: The YVFC has been an active member of the Kootenai Stakeholder team that has been collaborating
on this project. As a result of that involvement and thanks to you and your staff, we are very familiar with the
purpose, need, and scope of the project. I’ve also been able to get out into a handful of the units on my own,
monitoring current stand conditions while referencing the proposed treatments.
Although the project area does not fall within CORE grizzly bear habitat, it is located directly in-between the
Northern Continental Divide (N.C.D.) and the Cabinet/Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones. Recent grizzly bear
movement between the Cabinet- Purcell and N.C.D. areas via the Salish Mountains has been increasing. In
2004, a male grizzly bear swam across Lake Koocanusa traveling from the Purcells to the Salish Range. Bears
are also moving west out of the N.C.D. area into the Salish Range with documentation of rising numbers of
female bears with cubs in the northern portion of the range. These bears are not considered Cabinet-Yaak nor
N.C.D. bears, but residents between the two recovery areas. The USFWS has acknowledged the importance of
establishing and protecting functional linkage corridors between recovery zones in order to insure the recovery
and long-term viability of grizzly bear populations.
Response: The East Reservoir Project is consistent with the biological opinion for the 2011 Forest Plan
Amendments for Motorized Access Management within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery
Zones, and associated BORZ. Areas outside of either recovery zone and any BORZ are very well connected with
these management boundaries (recovery zones or BORZ) as demonstrated by the amount of cover disclosed under
the analysis for large ungulates (i.e. elk, deer, etc.). Current cover levels on National Forest and Army Corp. of
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Engineer lands exceeds 80% of the analysis area. Radio-collared bears have clearly demonstrated, as by your own
statement as well as other examples, that bears do not appear to be having any difficulty moving between the NCDE
and SCYE.
================================================================================
Comment: During our first stakeholder field trip for the East Reservoir project in August of 2011, Deena
Schotzburger presented a “connectivity map” that was developed to address not only linkage zones for the
grizzly bear, but security and forage opportunities for several other species as well, along with old growth
forests. She was very clear in explaining that management would occur within these linkage zones, with a focus
placed on long- term attempts to satisfy varying needs; i.e., proposing treatments that would stimulate browse
within elk winter range or managing replacement old growth to form larger patch sizes of old growth into the
future. VRUs were factored into the map along with calculating various physical elements (topography).
Historical wildlife travel routes were also referenced to establish zones of various uses within the map.
We are discouraged that the connectivity map failed to find its way into the DEIS. As the KNF moves into a
new era of landscape scale assessment and away from the project-centric management model of the past, it’s
essential to equip the planning process with new tools that help shape large-scale treatments - the connectivity
map represented such an aid.
At the last Stakeholder team meeting, your staff informed us the map was dropped because it was flawed - in
that it did not take into consideration single-species or lynx management restrictions. While recognition of onthe-ground realities is a valid and necessary point, we don’t believe it warrants abandonment of the entire
effort. Why not instead consider an incorporation of management standards within the larger landscape
context? We feel there is room for refinement with the connectivity map idea that could mesh the agency’s
concerns for single-species management.
The District staff also told us that the map was completely taken out of context by an environmental
organization (a group that’s not affiliated with the Stakeholders). Apparently, that group interpreted the corridor
map as being a “no treatment” zone and wanted to see similar maps placed over the entire forest. One
misinformed individual should not trump an effort that was embraced with such enthusiasm by a larger diverse
group; whereas new endeavors should be coupled with an education time period with outreach designed to curb
disinformation.
The employment of this connectivity map as the primary planning tool for the project area was markedly
innovative. To members of the conservation community, it provided long-term assurances and reasons of
practicality for proposed treatments. We also believe that it could be an extremely effective tool for the KNF in
breaking down barriers with habitual litigants of USFS projects. But above all, it placed an emphasis on the
longevity and health of wildlife as the basis for vegetative treatments while also incorporating long-term plans
for old growth.
The new USFS Planning rule and Draft Forest Plan for the KNF both stress that ecosystem management is the
way forward on our National Forests. As the USFS has established standards and guidelines for a new era of
forest management, the agency should also be developing new ways of conveying their planning approach with
the public. We strongly urge the District to re-consider the incorporation of the connectivity map with the East
Reservoir project.
Response: The District’s position on the working map created by Shotzberger is that it served as a catalyst for longterm thinking or planning for managing forest connectivity using forest layers currently available (e.g. INFISH,
designated lynx habitat, as well as existing old growth stands) to visually display connecting habitats. Shotzberger’s
map was only a draft working copy and had not received additional input from other resources specialist during its
creation. For these reasons, this working corridor map will not be included in the FEIS for the East Reservoir
Project. Implementation of the East Reservoir Project will not in any way hinder development of a similar landscape
connectivity map under a future project that incorporates all current management direction.
=================================================================================
Comment: Three out of the five stated purposes for the East Reservoir project contain the word “landscape.”
- Re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to disturbance and
uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change
- Create a heterogeneous landscape that provides a variety of habitats to sustain populations of terrestrial
and aquatic species
- Reduce hazardous fuels adjacent to private property and across the landscape while re- introducing fire to
the ecosystem.
These goals won’t be achieved overnight and in some instances not during any of our lifetimes. The treatments
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 67

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

prescribed in the DEIS to achieve these targets are large-scale (both with pre-scribed fire and harvest units) and
will have a dramatic effect on the landscape. The agency’s intent to restore the landscape using HRV to help
guide the way is well intended and strongly supported by our organization, however we question a focus that’s
placed on an elongated temporal scale where the immediate and short-term needs for wildlife habitat are
jeopardized.
For example, we can support the long-term need to restore historic patch sizes that will one day provide large
blocks of elk security and a variety of other wildlife benefits. However, in some cases to achieve these historic
blocks the agency is proposing large regeneration units that are located next to already existing large
regeneration units. One need only to look at a map of previous management within the project area to see that
the landscape is currently awash in old clearcuts (or future large blocks). A majority of these existing clearcuts
are probably in need of pre-commercial thinning, yet are unable to receive such treatment due to LAU
restrictions. Un-thinned regenerated stands take an exceptionally long time to develop into mature forests and
also make for heavy fuel loading from a wildfire perspective. The point we’re trying to make here is that
regeneration followed by an underburn will not necessarily create a stand 250 years from now that is resilient
and restored. And even if it did, sacrificing wildlife security in the short-term would not justify the agency’s
end goal if there’s no wildlife left 250 years from now to inhabit the re-created “historic” habitat.
The addition of a few design features within proposed treatments would go a long way in lessening the
immediate impact of large openings on wildlife. For example, regeneration unit 62:
Unit 62 was designed for wildlife species to maximize forage potential within summer habitat while
maintaining 600 ft. to cover. This strategy allows elk to utilize both forage opportunities along the
unit’s edge and interior without the need to venture far from the forest cover. The shape of the unit
mimics naturally created openings and contributes to the juxtaposition of forage and cover for the
species. (DEIS, 224)
We strongly encourage the agency to re-shape the other eight regeneration harvest over
40 acres in size on the East Reservoir project in a similar manner to unit 62. In keeping their current
boundaries, this could be accomplished within units via strategically placed leave islands or linear leave strips
where silviculturally appropriate and feasible within logging operations. After all, why would the agency
prescribe a treatment that mimics fire in only one unit out of an entire project that’s using historical conditions
of the ecosystem as a guide and where fire is the dominant disturbance regime?
The DEIS states that within regeneration harvests:
Stringers and groups of trees would be left within the units to provide screening and minimize the
effect of the openings when possible. (DEIS, chapter 3/ page 224)
This statement does not go far enough for our organization to get behind such large- scale regeneration
treatments. We recommend for the agency to provide within their prescriptions a range of percentages for the
groups of trees (leave-islands) that will be left within each unit over 40 acres in size. For a clear description of
what we mean by this, please see Project-level Sideboards for Regeneration Harvest (Attachment 1). The
common-ground sub-committee of the Kootenai Stakeholders developed these sideboards. Although that group
has yet to formally agree to them, the YVFC fully supports them.
In alternative 2, Units 147, 148, 149, and 150 encompass 338 combined acres. Stand conditions within these
units vary greatly. The larger a unit is, the greater amount of diversity it contains. And these are some rather
large units. Yet in the DEIS, they all have the same blanketed seed-tree prescription. If the agency seeks buyin from the conservation community on large 40 acre + units, then the agency needs to provide more
descriptive objectives, accurate conditions, and historically appropriate treatments for individual stands
within their prescriptions. If leave trees and security groupings are going to be left, then we need to know
how much and in what portion of the unit they will occur. Because as it currently looks like on paper, these just
appear to be 338 acres of clear-cuts in an already cut-over part of the KNF.
There appears to be a real opportunity within units 147 & 150 to implement mosaic treatments that would be
more representative of the mixed-severity fire regime that historically occurred within VRUs 5 and 7. Units 147
and 150 both contain multiple acre pockets of healthier forest that could be left as leave islands within the units
(Attachments 2 & 3). During the last stakeholder team meeting at the District, I mentioned some specific
concerns that I had on unit 147. I have since spoken with Ann Weber on the phone and she has invited me to go
out and take a look at that unit together. I greatly appreciate the offer and very much look forward to the trip
and the opportunity to go over issues together in the field.

When the subject of regeneration units over 40 acres came up at the last stakeholder team meeting for East
Reservoir, it appeared that the District did not have the same level of commitment as in previous meetings to
mimicking fire within proposed regeneration units – leaving more of a mosaic that would have occurred within
the mixed-severity regime. This was discouraging news to hear because there seemed to be real support for
management that emulated fire on the landscape.
The DEIS states the resolution to regeneration units over 40 acres:
Concerns of regeneration units exceeding 40 acres can be addressed by altering the shape of the unit
and or leaving leave islands within the interior of the unit. These strategies address distance to
cover, making the unit more available to wildlife species during daylight hours. Alternative 3 best
addresses this issue by either re-shaping units to meet 600 ft. to cover or reducing units down to 40
acres or less in size. (DEIS, chapter 2/page 2)
We don’t believe this is the best resolution to the issue. If the agency proposes a project the size and scope as
East Reservoir, then the agency should be prepared to handle and incorporate issues that the conservation
community may have on a project so large. We do not accept the placing of supposed resolutions into an
alternative that we all know will not be selected as the preferred. We challenge the agency to consider taking
not only the recommendations made in this letter but the ideas that the stakeholder team brought forth on
this issue as well and develop a project within alternative 2 (the proposed alternative) that all parties can
be satisfied with. In the true spirit of ecosystem management, we are asking you tom honor and value the
social input on this project in balance with the ecological and economic needs. With some creativity and
boldness, we believe there’s more than enough room to incorporate all these values within alternative 2.
Response: Each of the treatment units have been reviewed by a wildlife biologist and a scenery specialist. All of the
acres prescribed for clearcuts are clearcuts with reserve trees. All of these clearcut will have reserve trees ranging
from a minimum of 6 trees per acre to 12 or more for replacement snags and structural diversity. In addition, all
snags that meet minimum snag criteria will be left in clearcut reserve treatment areas. Units that have additional
concerns from the wildlife and scenic specialists have been addressed and have specific objectives to address them.
For example, some clearcuts have more snag replacements required for leave due to the habitat or more reserve trees
for visuals.
Following NEPA we will move into project implementation including layout and marking guides. During unit
layout, we will be looking for cover patches within larger regeneration harvests to leave where possible. Currently in
the project, the exact number of islands and placement of islands is not determined. This will be determined on the
ground during layout and specific marking guides. We have reviewed Project-level sideboards for regeneration
harvest (Attachment 1). We feel we can implement these guidelines where it is feasible on the ground during
project layout. We appreciate your understanding of the fact in some cases, due to logging system or prescribed fire
implementation, skips may not be feasible in every unit.
The proposed action for the East Reservoir Project would create forest openings larger than 40 acres in
size through the use of even-aged regeneration methods. Specifically, these larger openings are needed in
order to:
• Trend the landscape towards a more desirable pattern of patch sizes that mimics natural processes and
restores historical patterns of patch size (DEIS, pp.23-25; Vegetation Report, Desired Condition, VRU
4,5 and 7).
• Create a pattern of fuel treatments at a landscape scale that is likely to disrupt large fire growth and
spread and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts. Design fuel treatments to provide a fuel break
immediately adjacent to a major power transmission line (DEIS, Fire and Fuels Report, p. 182).
• Create openings that reduce edge effect and reduce fragmentation, which can result from more numerous
treatment areas and still achieve the same objectives (DEIS, Wildlife Report, pp. 224, 301, 308).
With past harvest activities, forage patches have become more uniform in size (30-40 acres) and
shape. The existing condition, for the most part, is not representative of reference conditions. Past
timber harvests have noticeably influenced the juxtaposition of wildlife cover and forage. Harvests
have unnaturally affected "edge" habitats as well as interior habitats, the greatest impacts likely being
on those species associated with large expanses of interior habitats (DEIS, Chapter 1, p. 4).
This disturbance regime (30-40 acre) provides suitable habitat for species that are adapted to the edges
between forested and non-forested areas. However, species that require larger blocks of habitat are at a
disadvantage under such a disturbance regime (DEIS, p.S-2). The majority of the past harvest within this
area on NFS lands has fragmented the landscape due to the 40 acre opening limitation (DEIS, Ch. 3, p. 24).
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement

Final Environmental Impact Statement

Four of the regeneration harvests (Units 62, 40, 150 and 362) are proposed as over 40 acre regeneration, but
do not mimic the large historic patch size of 5,000 to 100,000 acres. However, Units 62, 40 and 150 are
placed adjacent to past harvest that are recovered, but are within the early-successional stage. By these units
being blocked up with other early-successional stages, this larger block mimics historic conditions and would
move into the future as a connected patch of interior forest (DEIS, Vegetation Report, pp. 45, 46, 47).
Additionally, Units 147, 148, 149 and 150 in Upper Fivemile Creek and Unit 170 in Warland Creek were
designed to tie in with past regeneration harvests to simulate a fire that would have burned from the creek
bottom to the ridge top due to continuous fuels and favorable topography. This would have been more typical
of historic patch size and bum pattern when strategically located directly adjacent to existing regeneration
harvests that are still an effective barrier to high fire spread rates. Treatments of this scale are also more likely
to disrupt large fire growth and spread, and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts when a fire occurs in
these areas. Fire modeling indicates these areas are at risk of experiencing stand-replacing crown fire behavior
if left untreated and both areas are within 1 ¼ miles of private property. In addition to the benefits described
previously, Unit 362 near Hornet Ridge (Dunn Creek) was partially designed to provide a fuel break
immediately adjacent to a major power transmission line.
For wildlife, creating openings over 40 acres better approximates the patch size and pattern of habitat that
would have been available under natural disturbance processes and reduces edge effect and fragmentation that
would occur with a greater number of openings of lesser acreage. Additionally, stringers and groups of trees
would be left within the units to provide screening and minimize the effect of the openings when possible.
There may be short-term disturbances within identified big game travel corridors due to project related
activities (DEIS, pp. 224,301,308). Therefore, with the implementation of an action alternative, Alternative 2
which promotes large patch size, would benefit wildlife by addressing the issues of edge effect, fragmentation,
and interior forests better than Alternative 3 which limits regeneration harvest units to 40 acres or less.
===========================================================================
Comment: The YVFC supports the proposal in Alternative 3 that creates an OHV loop in the vicinity of
Boundary Mountain. It is our understanding that allowing for this loop trail would leave the elk security rating
at 33% for the Cripple PSU. We suggest the District explore options for partnering with local ATV groups in
finding the funds necessary to bring this loop trail system up to USFS standards - as opposed to diverting any
money away from an already struggling USFS budget.
Response: The incorporation of the Boundary Mountain OHV loop will be the discretion of the Forest Supervisor.
The Forest Supervisor will make that decision in the final EIS (FEIS) for this project. If chosen to be included,
partnerships with local ATV groups are highly likely to occur.
===============================================================================
Comment: The Libby District should be commended for attempting to undertake a project of this size and
scope. Viewing projects as a part of the larger landscape is an approach that can lead to widespread restorative
efforts on the forest. We believe in the long-term goals of the project, yet feel that with a project so large –
more planning and assurances need to be in place.
Response: Thank you for your interest and comments in the East Reservoir Project.

Attachment 1
Project level sideboards for regeneration harvests
Regeneration harvests sideboards serve to retain various wildlife habitat components and balance the aesthetic
concerns associated with created openings while also providing the flexibility for land managers to apply sitespecific silvicultural prescriptions within the Suitable and Available Timber-base.
1.) Regeneration harvest prescriptions should be used as a silvicultural tool when it is appropriate within the
VRU/HRV context, previous burn history, and serves to meet the desired future condition.
2.) Regeneration harvests need to be executed in a manner where cuts look and function biologically more like
natural forest clearings resulting from fire or windthrow events. For example, in the mixed-severity fire
regimes, the cuts should more accurately mimic burn areas that are irregular and although there may be large
areas that were intensely burned, there were often leave areas that escaped the intense fire.
The intent is to avoid creating large open areas lacking retention, while also providing conditions suitable for
development of early successional ecosystems and regeneration of shade-intolerant species. To some extent,
logging systems and fuels treatments will constrain these “retained” mimicking characteristics, but burn
history, prevailing winds, slope, and aspect should guide the placement of these features along with
operational feasibility.
a.) Opening should retain an average of 30% in most of the mesic VRU’s of the pre-harvest forest, but with
a range of 5-50%. The majority of the retention/skips should be in the form of small (e.g., ½ to 3 acre)
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 70

East Reservoir Project

Final Environmental Impact Statement

intact patches.
b.) VRU’s with more of a stand replacement fire history would typically leave less of the pre-harvest forest,
but should leave an average of at least 20% uncut. The majority of the retention/skips should be 5-10 acres
patches.
i.) Selection of Retention Acres (Skips) – Several types of areas will be candidates for location of
retention acres. Including:
- Riparian buffers
- Special habitats such as seeps, rocky outcrops, and other areas of high species diversity.
- Patches dominated by hardwoods.
- Representative patches of the pre-harvest forest stand.
- Clusters of shade-intolerant tree species.
c.) Edges of regeneration units should be buffered / “feathered” with two average dom/co-dom tree lengths
of an intermediate treatment along the edge of 25 - 50% of the unit. We recognize that this may be difficult
to obtain, particularly where you have a very decadent stand of lodgepole or stands susceptible to
windthrow.
d.) Units with a regeneration prescription should be irregular shaped, i.e. not square.
e.) Our group acknowledges the difficulty of prescribed burning small irregular sized areas located on steep
slopes. We also recognize the technical challenges associated in the layout/design and operation of logging
systems that will be required to implement some of our regeneration guidelines. It is our hope that the
agency embraces such challenges with creativity and views them as opportunities. However, we recognize
that to some extent logging system feasibility and prescribed fire limitations will sometimes hinder the full
implementation of these guidelines.

Appendix 2 – Design Features of Alternative 2 with Modifications
Appendix 2 describes the design features and management measures that will be applied to this project to protect
resources in all action alternatives.
Appendix 2 – East Reservoir Project Management Measures & Design Features
Trails and Roads: Timber Sale Standard Provision B(T)6.22, Protection of Improvements, will be included in all
timber sale contracts. It will require the purchaser to protect specified improvements, such as trails, roads and
fences. Slash disposal adjacent to the Lake Koocanusa Scenic Byway (MSH 37) and Lake Koocanusa is critical
to meeting KNFP VQOs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Soil: Refer to Appendix E for specific management requirements for the soil resource.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sensitive Plants: Legal and biological requirements for the conservation of endangered, threatened, proposed,
candidate and sensitive plants will be met. These species have been identified in cooperation with other agencies
such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP). Plant surveys will
be completed prior to any ground-disturbing activities. Emphasis for surveys will be placed on areas with
moderate-to-high potential to provide sensitive plant habitat. These surveys will be conducted by the District
Botanist or a qualified biological technician. If any of these plant species are located prior to or during
implementation of any management activities, the activity will be altered so that proper protection measures could
be taken. Timber sale contract provision B(T)6.25, Protection of Habitat of Endangered Species, will be included
in any subsequent timber sale contract. If necessary, additional modifications will occur through creation of
special treatment zones or by relocating unit boundaries to avoid negative impacts. Disturbance to any sensitive
plant populations observed during sale activity will be avoided through cooperation between sale administrators
and sale purchaser. Surveys for PTES plants of in-stream work areas to improve pool quantity and quality will be
completed before implementation.
• Retain all cottonwood, aspen and birch in all harvest units except in designated skid trails.
• Avoid burning and logging through the western pearl flower (Heterocodon rariflorum) population in Unit 16 by
creating a special treatment zone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Noxious Weeds: Noxious weeds can have a large impact on not only rare plant habitat but any native plant habitat
the following measures will be used to manage concerns for the spread of noxious weeds.
• Winter Tractor Units to Avoid Noxious Weed Spread: Winter tractor operations for Units 2B, 2C, 2D, 3A, 9,
10, 11, 17, 28, 157, 158, 158A, 190, 194T, 196, 305, 306, 307, COE1 and COE3.
• Certified weed-free forage is required for use on all national forest lands in Montana (36 CFR 261.50)
• Treat existing noxious weeds on roads to be reconstructed or stored prior to that activity, (if possible schedule
spraying two or more seasons before activities are expected to occur to reduce the amount of viable weed seed
stored in the soil).
• Treat existing noxious weeds in gravel/rock pits, inspect these sources for weeds and treat before material is
transported.
• Survey and pre-treat existing noxious weeds on proposed trailhead construction site, and access sites for in-stream
work.
• Require weed free certified straw for all construction, reconstruction, and restoration activities.
• Seed and fertilize stored roads with certified weed free seed immediately following restoration activities.
• Limit scarification objectives to the minimal required to meet reforestation objectives.
• Pressure-wash logging equipment, road maintenance and restoration equipment before entering the analysis area.
• Require timber sale purchaser to treat existing noxious weeds along haul routes the first operational season for
weed spraying (spring or early summer)
• Seed newly constructed roads, trailheads, landings and major skid trails with certified weed-free seed.
• Prevent road maintenance machinery from blading or brushing through known populations of new invaders. In
areas where weeds are established, (and activities are opening and blading restricted or closed roads with
significantly lesser infestations); brush and blade road systems from un-infested segments of road systems to
infested areas. Limit brushing and mowing to the minimum distance and height necessary to meet safety
objectives in areas of heavy weed infestations
• Minimize soil disturbance and mineral soil exposure during activities. Soil disturbance should be no more than
needed to meet project objectives. This includes not exceeding recommended mineral soil exposure for site
preparation in regeneration harvest units; and utilizing timing and designated skid trails to minimize mineral soil

exposure in harvest units.
• Survey proposed burn units for noxious weeds. Determine the risk of weed spread with prescribed fire. If there is
a risk of spread beyond the road corridor, defer burning until the weeds can be treated or ensure post treatment
funding for weed control.
• Survey proposed access for mechanized in stream for noxious weeds. Determine the risk of spread with the
associated activity. If there is risk of spread, pre-treat the area before activity.
• Continue to monitor/survey the analysis area for new invader weed species. Monitor weed population levels in
treated areas, with particular emphasis on haul routes, stored and decommissioned roads, and landings. Retreat as
funding allows.
• Treat and sign sites if new invaders are located and defer ground disturbing activities within those sites until the
weed specialist determines the site is no longer a threat, and approves those activities.
• Site-specific guidelines will be followed for weed treatments within or adjacent to known sensitive plant
populations. All future treatment sites will be evaluated for sensitive plan habitat suitability; suitable habitats will
be surveyed as necessary prior to treatment.
• All noxious weed control activities will comply with state and local laws and agency guidelines.
• As per the 2007 KNF Invasive Plant Management EIS and ROD, all herbicides used in the analysis area will be
applied according to the labeled rates and recommendations to ensure the protection of surface water, ecological
integrity and public health and safety. Herbicide selection will be based on target species on the site, site factors
(such as soil types, distance to water, etc.), and with the objective to minimize impacts to non-target species.
• Design road storage to allow passage of a 4-wheeler to continue treatment of hawkweeds and common tansy in
the future. Hawkweed and common tansy populations will continue to expand even after the template has revegetated.
• Keep administrative traffic on closed roads to a minimum. Whenever possible, time activities prior to seed set of
the primary weed species or emphasis weeds on a given road.
• Release bio-control agents on applicable sites, as they become available, and funding allows.
• Plan follow up noxious weed treatment the spring or early summer, following final purchaser blading of all haul
roads if funds allow (this will be funded with appropriated or KV dollars).
• Burning and Noxious Weed Spread: A decision matrix will be developed to address weed concerns and to
prioritize the units for burning based on desired objectives of the burning. This decision matrix will identify
potential weed concerns and identify target habitat enhancement or fuel reduction objectives. This way weed
control efforts can focus on particular species prior and post-burning.
• Design road storage to allow passage of a 4-wheeler to continue treatment of hawkweeds and common tansy in
the future. Hawkweed and common tansy populations will continue to expand even after the template has revegetated.

Burning and Noxious Weed Spread
A decision matrix will be developed to address weed concerns and to prioritize the units for burning based on
desired objectives of the burning. This decision matrix will identify potential weed concerns and identify target
habitat enhancement or fuel reduction objectives. This way weed control efforts can focus on particular species
prior and post-burning.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pile Burning Emissions
The amount of smoke emissions, resulting from prescribed burning of natural and activity fuels will be mitigated by
four general methods: fuel loading reduction, reduction in the amount of fuel consumed, flaming combustion
optimization, and impact avoidance.
Fuel Loading Reduction: The KNF has encouraged, through sale contract provisions, utilization of submerchantable material. Purchasers may be required to pay for, and therefore encouraged to utilize, top wood
smaller than the normal utilization standard. These measures help decrease the amount of woody fuel, thus
reducing the amount of smoke produced during burning.
Reduction in the Amount of Fuel Consumed: The reduction of the amount of fuel consumed by prescribed
burning will be accomplished by burning under higher fuel moisture conditions as long as it still makes these fuels
less available for consumption, thereby reducing the fuel consumed. Sometimes this can be part of the resource
objective to retain coarse woody debris on the site.
Flaming Combustion Optimization: Methods that increasing the flaming combustion phase will be used when
prescribed burning is determined to be the most appropriate fuel treatment. Concentration of logging slash by
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 79

whole tree yarding or excavator piling increases the amount of material consumed during flaming combustion and
also allows material to be burned in the late fall when the risk of escape is low. Purchasers are required to
construct piles so they are compact and free of excess soil.
Impact Avoidance: Smoke impact avoidance will be accomplished through daily monitoring of airshed
conditions. Burns will be coordinated with Montana/Idaho Smoke Monitoring Unit. This will help ensure smoke
impacts are minimized and burning only occurs when dispersion is forecasted to be good and cumulative effects
are not likely.

Winter Tractor Units to Avoid Over 15% and DSD for Alternatives 3:
Units: 2, 3, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 24, 26, 73T, 74T, 159A, 183, 190A, 305, 307, 311, 318, 319, 327, 328, 334, 335, 339,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Forest Vegetation:
In addition to the appropriate BMPs, riparian guidelines and standard contract clauses, the following management
measures and monitoring will be included:
a. All harvest units will retain 7-30 tons per acre of downed woody material (or recruitment) greater than 3” in
diameter to provide nutrient recycling and habitat for mammals and invertebrates. The volume and distribution of
material may be subject to specific site conditions such as within the wildland urban interface. The tons retained
by VRU are described previously in Table 3.11.
b. All harvest units will be designed to retain adequate levels of replacement snags to provide for cavity-associated
wildlife species, genetic seed reservoirs, relic overstory, and long-term soil productivity. Replacement trees will
be scattered throughout harvest units to the extent possible. A minimum of 8-10 replacement snags per acre will
be retained. Where not consistent with your description of a clearcut with 4-8 trees retained possible within safety
requirements, sound snags may be marked for retention. If they are felled for safety purposes, they will be
retained on site. Silvicultural and burning prescriptions will be prepared with the goal of protecting large diameter
relic trees, during site preparation and fuels treatment.
c. A marking review will be performed by a silviculturist on a minimum of 10% of proposed units to ensure marking
guides are being implemented as per the prescription.
d. All tractor harvest units with an intermediate harvest prescription will have designated skid trails to facilitate
removal of designated material while minimizing damage to less than 15% of the residual trees.
e. Harvest treatments will be designed to mimic natural process, and marking guides will emphasize working with
existing stand structures, and will not result in a uniform or evenly spaced residual stand or an evenly spaced seed
trees or relic trees.
f. If insect activity is present in the area, prescribed fire in dryland types may be postponed to a later date to give the
residual trees time to recover.
g. Spring burns in the dryland types will be implemented before the ponderosa pine and bunchgrass are actively
growing to minimize damage to native grasses.
h. Maintain old growth characteristics within old growth character stands (Green et al, 1992; USDA Forest Service,
1987a).

Wildlife:
Minimize Disturbance to Raptors: If raptor-nesting territories are observed, avoid disturbance when possible,
during the nesting/fledgling period (5/15-8/15). Include in sale contract if sites are known prior to selling. Consult
with Wildlife Biologist on specific buffers and disturbance period dates. Utilize this criterion specifically on Unit
68 for Alternatives 2 and 3 - Pre-sale and harvest – all alternatives.
Protect Cripple Horse Goshawk Nest:
1. No management activities should occur within 0.5 miles of nest area (as mapped) between 3/1 and 8/30;
2. Route helicopter flights away from nest site and PFA as shown on territory maps (Project File).
3. Activities greater than ½ mile from the nest site should not occur until after July 15th or prior to April 1 (also see
Criterion #2).
All criteria applicable to all alternatives for pre-sale, during and post-sale activities.
Maintain Cavity-Nesting Habitat: Where snag numbers are insufficient to meet snag levels by VRU (identified in
the Snag Section at the 100% level) existing DF, WL and PP snags greater than 10" dbh and 10 feet in height will
be marked and protected during timber harvest and site preparation as long as safety requirements are met.
Merchantable trees (live or dead) will be reserved (Provisions CT2.3# and CT6.32#) C2.3# and C6.32# -provisions were never intended for snags – intended for superior seed trees, research trees or high value wildlife
trees (nest trees)). C6.32# - requires liquated damages ($) for damage. Not advisable to use if snag levels are still
not met. If felled for safety, they will be left on site. Maintain the largest snags first. Favor trees further than one
tree length from the road prism or any external boundary - Pre-sale and harvest – all alternatives.
Provide for Future Cavity-Nesting Habitat, Down Woody Habitat Recruitment, and Structural Diversity:
KNF snag management protocol will be utilized to provide adequate snags for wildlife habitat. Units in MA 15
will be managed at the 40% level as prescribed in the KNFP. All other MAs will be managed at the 100% cavity
habitat effectiveness level. Pre-sale – all alternatives.
Leave Tree Protection: Evenly distribute slash to protect leave trees. Pre-sale - all alternatives.
Maintain Winter Range Integrity: Restrict mechanized activities associated with logging and slashing off Roads
4885, 4886, 6271, 4916 (Dec. 1 – June 30); 6274, 4908A/B (Oct 15 – June 30); 4890, 5298 Sept 1 – May 30) to
be consistent with the Road Closures as shown and applicable. Pre-sale, harvest and site prep – all alternatives.
Winter logging will be required in Unit 1 in Alternative 2 and Units 1, 1A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 3A, 9, 10, 17, 28, 157,
158, 158A, 190, 194T, 169, COE1and COE3 for Alternative 3.
Provide for Wildlife Security: Determine the time of road restrictions involved with timber sales in the pre-sale
roundtable discussion. Implement new road restrictions after timber harvest where applicable and maintain
existing restrictions to the public during all operations. Pre-sale, Post-sale – all alternatives. This criterion could
vary by MA (e.g. summer range versus winter range) and could be influenced by other management boundaries
such as Bears Outside Recovery Zone (BORZ). Generally, roads entering into or within these management
boundaries will not be open to the public while treatment activities are occurring.
Meet Standards and Guides of the Lynx Amendment for Management in Lynx Habitat: including use of
prescribed fire. Prior to activity – Alternative 3 as described in effects analysis, Chapter 3 of this document. If
these are for alts, need to correct the PA.
Meet ESA Requirements: If critical habitat is identified during implementation of the proposed activities, special
protection measures will be implemented by including provision CT6.251 in all applicable timber sale contract
packages. This provision is mandatory. Contract prep and logging – all alternatives.
Maintain Minimum/All Associated Old Growth Characteristics within Old Growth Character Stands (Green
Et Al, 1992; USDA Forest Service, 1987a): In the MA 13 portions of Units F1OG, F3OG, F11OG, F13OG,
F14OG and F15OG no merchantable material will be removed. Outside MA 13 in these units, products (e.g.
biomass) may be removed. Harvest Prescription, Sale Prep – Alternative 2. Ensure burning is planned to minimize
impact on the large old tree component and subsequent risk of insect infestation. May want to defer burning until
MPB population has subsided.
Protect Specialized Wildlife Habitats: Protect currently unknown (not mapped) specialized habitats (e.g. wetlands,
fens, bogs, elk wallows, nests, etc.) found during timber sale preparation activities with appropriate buffers. When
new sites are found consult wildlife biologist, fish biologist or hydrologist for direction. Pre-sale and during
activities – all alternatives.
Temporary Roads within the Tobacco BORZ: Portion of the East reservoir Analysis area will be returned to
East Reservoir Project Final Environmental Impact Statement
Page 81

contour immediately following harvest and slash activities (units) or within one active bear year (4/1 to 11/30),
unless unforeseen circumstances (e.g. weather) prevents completion of the treatment units accessed by these
temporary roads. Temporary roads needed for another work season will be closed with the appropriate restriction
device (i.e. rods, gate, earth barrier, etc.).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heritage Resources:
Heritage resource surveys were completed on all treatment units. The action alternatives were designed to protect
known cultural sites, provide for protection of sites discovered during implementation, and protect treaty rights.
These concerns will be addressed through ongoing consultation with tribal representatives. Appropriate Timber
Sale Contract Provisions will be included in any timber sale contract. The appropriate provision specifies that the
Forest Service may modify or cancel the contract to protect cultural resources, regardless of when they were
identified.
Winter logging will be required for Unit 1 in Alternative 2, and Units 1 and 1A for Alternative 3.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scenic Resource:
To meet visual quality objectives the following measures will be taken:
Units 2, 3, 6, 16, 18 – High level of slash disposal along Highway 37.
Units 7, 8, 59, 62, 80, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 – 10 to 12 trees/acres leave trees in unit.
Units 41, 81 – Leave tree islands (1 – 2 acres) left in unit.
Unit 6 – 10 to 15 tress/acre leave trees in unit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
U.S. Corps of Engineer Land: The following BMP must be employed within the boundary of recorded
archaeological sites and/or in areas where additional archaeological identification work cannot be completed prior to
project implementation.
A) Soil and duff moistures must be high enough to prevent thermal damage to artifacts that may be present in the
lower duff layers or soil. Duff moistures of greater than 120% tend not to burn (Timmons, et al. 1996);
consequently, the burn shall take place in the spring and/or late fall when conditions favor high duff moistures.
B) Any stumps within recorded archaeological sites that will be burned must be protected by wetting or foaming
prior to ignition.
C) To keep excavation of soil to a minimum, control lines for prescribed burn operations must be located on
existing roads, trails, topographical breaks, and any other natural barriers. Wet lines and/or foam lines are
strongly recommended.
D) Slash piling, for the purpose of burning, will not occur within recorded archaeological sites. Many areas on
COE fee owned land considered high probability: Slash piling, for the purpose of burning, shall be avoided
where feasible.
E) Mechanical timber harvest must be done on frozen ground within recorded archaeological sites and high
probability areas and in accordance he following stipulations.
1. Logging must be performed over frozen ground or over an accumulation of a minimum of one foot of
compacted snow.
2. A rubber-tired skidder shall be used.
3. Logs will be limbed at the stump.
4. Dispersed skidding.
5. Logging landings shall be designated in areas outside of recorded archaeological sites and high probability
areas. Landings will be clearly delineated by the COE archaeologist on the ground for the sale administrator
and the contractor.
6. Slash piling will not occur within any recorded archaeological sites or high probability areas. Appropriate
areas must be clearly delineated by the COE archaeologist on the ground for the sale administrator and the
contractor.

Appendix 4: Forest Plan Amendments
East Reservoir Project-Specific Amendment #1
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-64, in Management Area 15 (MA15) is modified for Recreation
Standard #4 – meeting Visual Quality Objective of maximum modification.
Unit 40 (156 acres) is proposed as an over 40 acre regeneration harvest, but does not mimic the large historic
patch size of 5,000 to 100,000 acres. However, it is placed adjacent to past harvests that are recovered, but are
within the early-successional stage. By these units being blocked up with other early-successional stages, this
larger block mimics historic conditions and will move into the future as a connected patch of interior forest
(DEIS, Vegetation Report, p. 45, 46, 47). Even though the unit will be viewed from a SL3 (Significance
Level 3 = very low) road, visually, due to large unit size, position of unit (face terrain), low number of leave
trees (seedtree harvest, 93% of canopy removed) the proposed treatment would not meet KNFP standards of
maximum modification for scenic resources (FEIS, Ch.3, pg. 367).
Unit 75 (36 acre shelterwood) sits next to Unit 188 (40 acre seedtree) creating an opening in excess of 40 acres. This
treatment would be effective at reducing hazardous fuels, reducing crown fire potential, and improving fire
suppression efficacy. Separately, these units meet QVOs but they are located adjacent to each other on the ground
making a 76 acres seedtree/shelterwood harvest which removes 90% of the canopy. Due to large unit size, position
of unit, low number of leave trees, the proposed treatment would not meet KNFP standards of maximum
modification for scenic resources (FEIS, Ch.3, pg. 370, 372). This area is a very low visual significance level.
Unit 147 (93 acre seedtree), Unit 148 (77 acre seedtree), Unit 149 (65 acre seedtree) and Unit 150 (103 acre
seedtree) are proposed for over 40 acre regeneration harvests. These units were designed to tie in with past
regeneration harvests to simulate a fire that would have burned from the creek bottom to the ridge top due to
continuous fuels and favorable topography. Treatments of this scale are more likely to disrupt large fire growth and
spread and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts when a fire occurs in these areas. Fire modeling indicates
these areas are at risk of experiencing stand-replacing crown fire behavior if left untreated. With regard to wildlife,
this strategy may result in openings that may not be fully utilized by elk as foraging areas, however, creating these
openings reduces edge effect and fragmentation that would occur with greater number of openings of lesser acreage.
When considered in combination with existing adjacent openings on National Forest System lands these
regeneration harvests will create six openings larger than 40 acres in size. Opening sizes will decrease over
time as regeneration is established and grows. It was estimated that regeneration openings will be
hydrologically recovered when they are approximately 25-30 years old. By the time a regeneration opening is
this old, the conifer regeneration is tall enough to maintain enough canopy cover above the average winter
snow depths to moderate rates of snow melt. The time required to realize hydrologic recovery is longer than the
recovery needs of other resources and is therefore the most conservative estimate of recovery for openings
caused by even-aged regeneration harvest.
Alternative 2 with Modifications will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seedtree and/or shelterwood
prescription in concert with exceeding 40 acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Treatment of these units supports
purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to
disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change.

size and pattern of habitat that would have been available under natural
processes and reduce edge effect and fragmentation that would occur
with a greater number of openings of lesser acreage.

Fuels: Reduce fuels and provide a fuel break immediately adjacent to a
major power transmission line. By locating the units adjacent to past
treatments they will be more effective at disrupting large fire growth
and be more conducive to fire control actions.

The Forest Plan states, “If it is determined during project design that the best way to meet the goals of the Forest
Plan conflicts with a Forest Plan standard, the Forest Supervisor may approve an exception to that standard for the
project”
This project-specific amendment allows achievement of the overall Forest Plan goal for MA15 which is timber
production using various standard silviculture practices while providing for other resource values such as soil, air,
water, wildlife, recreation and forage for domestic livestock (FP, Vol. 1, pg. III-64).
Project-specific amendments must comply with the National Environmental policy Act procedures. Compliance
with these procedures and rationale for this project-specific amendment is contained in the East Reservoir Project
DEIS, FEIS and draft ROD.

Project Specific Amendment #2:
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-48, in Management Area 12 (MA12) is modified for Recreation
Standard #2 – meeting Visual Quality Objective of maximum modification in areas of low visual significance,
modification in areas of moderate visual significance, and partial retention in areas of high visual significance,
unless infeasible when attempting to meet the goals of the management area.
Unit #362 (192 acres) cannot meet MA 12 visuals direction because it is planned for regeneration treatment
(clearcut) to exceed 40 acres with the resulting visual quality objective (VQO) of unacceptably moderate (FEIS,
Ch.3, pg. 373) due to reducing tree canopy from fully stocked to a clearcut.
Treatment of Unit 362 supports purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are
more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental
conditions such as climate change.
When considered in combination with existing adjacent openings on National Forest System lands these
regeneration harvests will create six openings larger than 40 acres in size. Opening sizes will decrease over
time as regeneration is established and grows. It was estimated that regeneration openings will be
hydrologically recovered when they are approximately 25-30 years old. By the time a regeneration opening is
this old, the conifer regeneration is tall enough to maintain enough canopy cover above the average winter
snow depths to moderate rates of snow melt. The time required to realize hydrologic recovery is longer than the
recovery needs of other resources and is therefore the most conservative estimate of recovery for openings
caused by even-aged regeneration harvest.
Alternative 2 with Modifications will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seedtree and/or shelterwood
prescription in concert with exceeding 40 acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Treatment of these units supports
purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to
disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change.

Project Specific Amendment #3:
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-69 in Management Area 16 (MA16) is modified for Recreation
Standard #4 – meeting Visual Quality Objective of modification.
Unit #73T (31 acres) and Unit 188 (40 acres) are adjacent to one-another. Together they cannot meet MA 16 visuals
direction because the planned for regeneration treatment (seedtree) combines to exceed 40 acres with the resulting
visual quality objective (VQO) of maximum modification (FEIS, Ch.3, pgs. 370, 372) due to reducing tree canopy
from fully stocked.
When considered in combination with existing adjacent openings on National Forest System lands these
regeneration harvests will create six openings larger than 40 acres in size. Opening sizes will decrease over

************************************************************************************
Project Specific Amendment #4:
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-49, is modified for Wildlife and Fish Standard #7- to maintain
movement corridors of at least two site distances (400 feet) between openings, and generally not to exceed openings
over 40 acres.
Alternative 2 with Modifications proposes one unit with acreage on MA12 land that result in openings that do not
meet this standard. Unit 362 (clearcut) results in a 192 acre opening on MA12. Therefore, a site-specific KNFP
amendment is necessary for this unit.
Treatment of Unit 362 supports purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are
more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental
conditions such as climate change.
When considered in combination with existing adjacent openings on National Forest System lands these

caused by even-aged regeneration harvest.

prescription in concert with exceeding 40 acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Treatment of these units supports
purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to
disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change.
Amendment #4 amends the edge effect and movement corridors in MA 12. One 192 acre unit results in less edge
effect than a number of units (in this case up to five units at 40 acres each) with forested corridors of 600 feet
separating the units. Reducing edge effect is favorable for many resident species, such as fisher, brown creeper,
goshawk and lynx, and once the 192 unit re-establishes hiding cover (approximately 15 years) a large block of
uniform interior forest will result for those species more associated with interior forest habitats. Contrarily, edge
creation is beneficial to many other hawk species such as red-tails and other birds including black-headed cowbirds
for both foraging and nesting. Any edge creation will benefit these species in the 15 to 30 years immediately
following harvest. However, as time progresses, these larger patch sizes and subsequent interior forest development
will become more beneficial to those interior species listed previously by creating areas for movement, nesting,
rearing and foraging.

Draft Record of Decision

Draft Record of Decision
I. DECISION SUMMARY
After careful consideration of the potential impacts of the alternatives analyzed and documented in the East
Reservoir Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) (issued in June 2013), and public comments on this
project, I have decided to implement management actions as described below for Alternative 2 with Modifications.
My decision does not include activities analyzed by the East Reservoir EIS on lands administered by the Army
Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps of Engineers will issue their own decision regarding lands within their
jurisdiction that were analyzed for the East Reservoir EIS.
Project activities will occur within the 92,407 acre Cripple Planning Subunit (Cripple PSU) approximately 15 miles
east of Libby, Montana.
With this Record of Decision (ROD) I am authorizing the following activities to meet the purpose and need for
action described in Section V:
• Timber harvest and associated fuel treatment on 8,845 acres, including intermediate harvest on approximately
5,387 acres and regeneration harvest on approximately 3,458 acres to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes
that are more resistant and resilient to disturbance and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change;
create a heterogeneous landscape that provides a variety of habitats to sustain populations of terrestrial and aquatic
species; reduce hazardous fuels adjacent to private property and across the landscape while re-introducing fire to
the ecosystem and contribute timber to the local and regional economy. This harvest is dispersed over the 92,407
acre project area. These activities will contribute approximately 78,761 hundred cubic feet (CCF) of timber
products to the economy. Approximately 91% of this harvest will be accomplished with ground-based systems
and 9% by skyline yarding. An estimated 37% (approx. 3,310 acres) of the harvest will be restricted to winter
harvest to protect resources.
• Precommercial thinning on approximately 5,775 acres to improve growing conditions and restore shade-intolerant
species in managed sapling-sized stands.
• Planting of conifer seedlings will occur on approximately 3,348 acres in this decision. This planting will
supplement the natural reforestation anticipated and restore tree species that are presently not sustainable due to
inadequate seed source in the residual or adjacent stands.
• Prescribed fire will be used to reduce hazardous fuel loadings, create fuel breaks along ridge lines and restore
natural fire regimes. Prescribed fire treatments will be completed on 4,149 acres and will be spaced over time to
avoid displacing big game from the entire burn area at any given time.
• Approximately 10, 049 acres of burning and/or slashing (Appendix 1) over the next ten years to enhance wildlife
habitat (bighorn sheep escape habitat and foraging), increase ungulate browse and to reduce hazardous fuels.
• Best Management Practice (BMP) and road maintenance work will be applied to approximately 176.40 miles of
haul roads.
• New road construction totaling approximately 9 miles of new permanent roads (Appendix 1) in order to access
harvest units, fuels units and allow the DNRC access to their lands.
• Temporary road construction totaling approximately 4.26 miles (Appendix 1) in order to accomplish harvest
activities. These roads will be obliterated following harvest to reduce erosion risk.
• A change to yearlong, open access on approximately 1.79 miles of roads (Appendix 1) that currently only provide
seasonal access to existing dispersed campsites along the Koocanusa Reservoir.
• Access changes from motorized to non-motorized on five trails (279, 280, 420, 426, 500) for a total of approx. 27
miles (Appendix 1). Trails 281 and 420 will remain motorized, creating a loop which includes open NFS roads
(roads 4904 and 4925).
• Watershed rehabilitation will include road decommissioning and intermittent stored service (storage) work.
Decommissioning work is authorized on 5.93 miles of existing road. Approximately 0.51 miles of these roads are
open yearlong to traffic while the rest are currently restricted yearlong to traffic (Appendix 1).
Road storage will occur on 17 road segments totaling approximately 16 miles. Two roads (#5060, 5167) are
currently open (0.65 miles), the rest of the roads are currently seasonally closed but open to snow vehicles. These
roads will remain open to snow vehicles (Appendix 1).
• Undetermined roads occur in the East Reservoir area. These are roads that exist on the ground but are not
officially part of the NF System. Approximately 13 miles of these undetermined roads will be added to the
National Forest System. These roads currently access dispersed camping sites, are needed to access harvest units
and needed for existing or future land management. An additional 6.24 miles of undetermined roads that are not
needed now or in the future will be decommissioned.
• The Forest Service and the Montana State Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) have
proposed to cost-share in several roads in the analysis area for access purposes (approx. 30 miles, Table 7). Of the
Page 1 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

approximately 30 miles, new road construction will be authorized for 0.20 miles (N39, Appendix 1).
• Access to the recreation sites on the south side of the mouth of Fivemile Creek and in the Yarnell area will be
improved. New road construction and improvement of existing access will occur to provide more opportunities for
dispersed campsites. Improvements will be made while maintaining the character of the sites.
• A new non-motorized trail within the East Reservoir analysis area will be created. The trail is located south of the
mouth of Cripple Horse Creek between Lake Koocanusa and Montana State Highway 37and will be a 2.75 mile
loop. The trail will be managed for non-motorized travel (horse, bicycle, foot) yearlong with trailhead parking to
accommodate four to six vehicles.
• Design features and mitigation measures to maintain and protect resource values (see Appendix 2).
See draft ROD, Section VIII and the appendices for a more detailed description of the activities authorized with this
decision.

Alternative 2 with Modifications
My decision is to implement Alternative 2 with some activities analyzed under Alternative 3 in order to respond to
public concerns regarding loss of access by motorized vehicles and snowmobiles. I have determined that the changes
to Alternative 2 are minor, and it is sufficient and appropriate to file the DEIS (June 2013) with the FEIS (February
2014) as the final documentation for this project (40 CFR 1503.4(c)).
The design features incorporated from Alternative 3 discussed in the Draft EIS are as follows
• I have included Unit F19 which is adjacent to state land on the Koocanusa Reservoir near the mouth of Cripple
Horse Creek. This unit was added during field reconnaissance and includes slashing and burning to address excess
fuels.
• Road #4904, in the Boundary Mountain area will be changed from restricted yearlong to restricted seasonally
(10/15 – 06/30) to give additional access to the trailhead for Trail #425.
• The five motorized trails (279, 280, 420, 426, 500) will change from motorized to non-motorized for a total of
about 27 miles to improve big game security. Trails 281 and 420 will remain as motorized trials creating a loop
which includes open NFS roads. This has been analyzed in Alternative 3. The reason for changing the motorized
routes to non-motorized was to increase big game security. The existing security is 28% which is below the
recommendation of 30%. Leaving the loop as motorized increases security from 28% to 33.4% while leaving
some motorized trails for recreationist.
• Two undetermined roads in the Canyon Bay area will be decommissioned to protect resource values at risk (Table
2.22). These are roads #5298 and 2598A (0.24 miles).
• A new non-motorized trail within the East Reservoir analysis area will be created as described in Alternative
3.This trail will increase established recreation area along the Koocanusa Reservoir and will be part of the
decision.
Following my review of the Interdisciplinary Team’s analysis of the action alternatives, I have determined that the
changes I am making to Alternative 2are minor and within the scope and context of the environmental effects
disclosed in the DEIS, FEIS, Biological Assessments, Biological Evaluation, and supporting documentation located
in the project file (PF).

The East Reservoir analysis area makes up the analysis boundary for most resources. The analysis area for the
wildlife resource varies with species and is described in the Wildlife Section in Chapter 3 of the DEIS.
The East Reservoir analysis area consists of five major drainages: Fivemile Creek, Warland Creek, Cripple Horse
Creek, Canyon Creek and Dunn Creek. These drainages flow from east to west. These drainages are deeply incised
by their streams and the ridgelines have fairly gentle slopes. Side slopes between these two features are generally
steep.

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

The Reservoir East analysis area is a diverse landscape that ranges in elevation from a low of about 2,200 feet along
the Kootenai River to 6,051 feet at the top of Davis Mountain. The south and west aspects of the analysis area have
numerous small natural openings in a ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir canopy. The north and east aspects have a
nearly continuous canopy of Douglas-fir, larch and lodgepole pine. This tree canopy is broken sharply by drainages.
The East Reservoir analysis area provides a variety of recreation opportunities. Recreation activities are varied and
occur year-round. Activities include snowmobiling, hunting, fishing, off-highway vehicle (OHV) use, hiking, scenic
viewing, wildlife viewing, camping and gathering forest products such as berries and firewood. There are several
major rock forms visible in this analysis area, especially along Lake Koocanusa Reservoir.

III. OVERVIEW of our ANALYSIS and DECISION PROCESS
National Forest planning takes place at several levels: national, regional, forest and project levels. The East
Reservoir EIS is a project-level analysis; its scope is confined to addressing the major issues and possible
environmental consequences of the project. It does not attempt to address decisions made at higher levels. It does,
however, implement direction provided at those higher levels. The decision I am making here does not preclude the
need for future decisions to help meet the desired conditions in the project area.
The Kootenai National Forest (KNF) Forest Plan (USDA 1987) provides the primary management direction for my
decision. The Forest Plan prescribes goals and management standards for the KNF as a whole and for 23
subdivisions of the Forest referred to as management areas. In general, the goals and standards of the Forest Plan
require me to balance a variety of resources and interests in managing these lands (e.g. maintaining or enhancing
wildlife and fisheries habitat and providing a sustained yield of timber).
Specific management area (MA) direction from the Forest Plan further guides project development and location of
activities in different areas. MAs affected by this project are described in the DEIS beginning in Chapter 1 on page
11 and displayed on the MA Map in the DEIS. The Forest Plan provides MA - specific goals and standards on pages
III-43 through III-118. The KNF is in the process of Forest Plan revision. The Analysis of the Management Situation
for the Revision of the Kootenai and Idaho Panhandle Forest Plans describes revision topics and issues being
considered during revision (USDA Forest Service 2003).
The analysis and decision processes for this project are based on the consideration of the best available science. The
manner in which best available science is addressed can be found throughout the disclosure of rationale found within
the Biological Assessments, FWS Concurrence Letter, ROD, DEIS, FEIS Response to Comments, and the project
file.
I also considered information presented in the Northern Region Overview.

IV. PURPOSE AND NEED FOR ACTION
A number of specific resource and vegetation conditions that are currently not meeting long-term management
objectives were identified in the broad scale assessment of the Cripple Planning Subunit (East Reservoir Landscape
Assessment 2010) located in the project record. Opportunities to improve these conditions were developed through a
comparison of reference conditions (generally presettlement condition) with current conditions and determining
actions to improve those ecosystem components that are outside of a manageable natural range of variability. This is
discussed in more detail in the Forest Vegetation, and Fire/Fuels sections in Chapter 3 of the DEIS. The assessment
was based on Kootenai Forest Plan direction, the National Fire Plan, findings in the Northern Region Overview, the
Upper Kootenai Assessment, and trends observed by interdisciplinary specialists conducting the landscape
assessment.
The Purpose and Need for the activities proposed in the East Reservoir Project are to:
• Re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease
infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change;
• Create a heterogeneous landscape that provides a variety of habitats to sustain populations of terrestrial and
aquatic species;
• Provide amenities, jobs and products to the communities;
• Reduce hazardous fuels adjacent to private property and across the landscape while re-introducing fire to the
ecosystem;
• Enhance recreation settings and facilities with the goal of providing high quality experiences.

V. PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT
Proposed Action Development
The Libby Ranger District completed a broad scale assessment of the Cripple Planning Subunit (East Reservoir
Page 3 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

Landscape Assessment) in 2010. The proposed activities in the East Reservoir EIS were developed from
opportunities identified in the East Reservoir Landscape Assessment and Travel Analysis Process (TAP) for the
Cripple Planning Subunit. A copy of both these documents can be found in the project file.
Proposed Action Scoping
Site-specific public comments on the East Reservoir Project proposed action were requested in November 2010
through publication of a Notice of Intent (NOI) in the Federal Register on November 15, 2010, and public scoping
notices in December 2010 in the Kalispell, Montana, Daily Inter Lake; and the Libby, Montana, Western News. A
notice was also mailed, on December 21, 2010, to individuals, agencies, organizations and tribal governments on the
district mailing list for planning projects; 14 comment letters were received.
Meetings
Meetings and field trips were held with the Kootenai Forest Stakeholders Coalition at their request to clarify the
proposal and provide maps. (Please see Public Involvement section of the project file for documentation).
Public Comments on Draft EIS
On June 10, 2013, the DEIS was mailed to all required agencies, and a DEIS summary, CD or notice of availability
was mailed to all other project participants. A notice of availability was also mailed to all land owners of record in
the project area. On June 14, 2013, a Notice of Availability for the East Reservoir Project DEIS was published in the
Federal Register. A legal ad appeared in the Kalispell Daily Inter Lake (June 15, 2013) and display ads appeared in
the Libby Western News (June 21, 2013) and Kootenai Valley Record (June 18, 2013), Eleven comment letters were
received (see the FEIS for these letters and agency responses). On July 19, 2013 an extension to the comment period
was published in the Federal Register. It extended the comment period to August 15, 2013.
Tribal Involvement
The concerns of the Kootenai and Salish tribes were solicited through project scoping. In addition, the Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Tribes have provided a tribal liaison to work in partnership with the Kootenai NF to review
project proposals and provide tribal input. No concerns regarding this project were expressed by tribal governments.
Other Agency Involvement
The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks were consulted regarding
fish and wildlife habitat. The Lincoln and Sanders County Commissioners were contacted. The Montana
Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of
Interior Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance (DOI) also received project notifications or hard copies.
The US Environmental Protection Agency (FEIS Response to Comments, Letter #1) had some specific edits to the
hydrology and air quality sections of the DEIS, which are reflected in the FEIS.
A biological assessment was sent to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) on May 31, 2013. On August 8,
2013, the FWS concurred that the project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the grizzly bear. This
determination is based on the following: 1) the East Reservoir Project activities fall within the range-of-effects
analyzed by the FWS in their programmatic BO and the Incidental Take Statement for the 2011 Forest Plan
Amendments for Motorized Access Management within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones
and therefore, is not likely to contribute to the loss of grizzly bears from the Tobacco BORZ; 2) helicopter use
associated with this project is consistent with the management strategies found in the Guide to Effects Analysis of
Helicopter Use in Grizzly Bear Habitat (2009) that are not likely to adversely affect grizzly bears; the associated
helicopter activities would not prohibit bears from using the area during any period of biological importance such as
breeding, late fall foraging (hyperphagia), or denning; 3) the East Reservoir Project does not change the livestock
management in the Tobacco BORZ; 4) project activities would not result in an increase in food attractants and
would comply with the 2011 KNF Food Storage Order; 5) the project would not result in measurable increases in
recreation use of the Tobacco BORZ based on limited improvements; and 6) the project does not involve changes to
any type of mining activities within the Tobacco BORZ and would not result in habitat fragmentation between the
SCYE and NCDE grizzly bear ecosystems.
The FWS also concurred that the project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect Canada lynx or Canada
lynx critical habitat. This determination is based on the facts that: 1) the alternatives of the East Reservoir DEIS
comply with all standards, guidelines, and objectives of the Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction Record
of Decision and its activities fall within the scope of those analyzed in the subsequent Biological Opinion (2007),
more specifically, the project would not result in habitat conditions that would cumulatively contribute to the low
level of species loss estimated by the 2007 BO; 2) these projects do not involve any activities that may result in
increased areas of snow compaction, nor permanent loss of lynx habitat; and 3) although this project would
temporarily affect the primary constituent sub-element, ‘matrix’ habitat and stem-exclusion stands, it meets ALL S1
Page 4 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

standards, therefore maintaining habitat connectivity within and between associated LAUs. Additionally, the project
would not remove or significantly alter any of the other primary constituent sub-elements including: space;
nutritional or physiological requirements; cover or shelter; breeding or rearing sites; or habitats protected from
disturbance that represent historic, geographical, and ecological distribution of the species. USFWS concurred with
this determination.
The gray wolf Northern Rocky Mountains distinct population segment outside of Wyoming was removed from the
List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife effective May 4, 2009 (Federal Register Vol. 74, No. 62, pp. 1512315188). Section 7 consultation is no longer required for the gray wolf in Montana.
Biological assessments document that the project will have no effect on the water howellia, Spalding’s catchfly, bull
trout or white sturgeon.

VI. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
Internal and external comments revealed three issues representing unresolved conflict with the proposed action
(Alternative 2). These issues were used to develop alternatives to the proposed action.
1) Regeneration Units over 40 acres: Concerns of regeneration units exceeding 40 acres were received as they do
not meet Kootenai National Forest Plan (KNFP) standards for MAs 11, 12 and 15. Forest Service policy (FSM
2471) states that the size of harvest openings created by even-aged silviculture in the Northern Region will be
normally 40 acres or less. Creation of larger openings will require 60-day public review and Regional Forester
approval.
The National Forest Management Act of 1976 [USC 1604 (g) (3) (F) (IV)], establishes opening size limits
according to geographic areas, forest types or other suitable classifications. Regulations establish the size limit for
our geographic area at 40 acres, with exceptions for larger openings when they will produce a more desirable
combination of net public benefits. For information regarding this issue see page 14 of this draft ROD.
2) Impact to Old Growth Forest Stands: There is a concern that there is not enough old growth in the East
Reservoir analysis area and that treatments prescribed in old growth would further decrease old growth within the
project area. For information regarding this issue see page 14 of this draft ROD.
3) Closing of approximately 36.6 miles of motorized trails in the project area would limit motorized user
access: Public comment received on the proposed action indicated that changing 36.6 miles of motorized trails to
non-motorized would reduce motorized recreation and was not a favorable action. For information regarding this
issue see page 14 of this draft ROD.

VII. DESCRIPTION of the ALTERNATIVES
1. ALTERNATIVES GIVEN DETAILED STUDY
Alternative 1 – No Action
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires that an EIS include a "no action" alternative. The noaction alternative is based on the premise that ecosystems change, even in the absence of active management. It is
essentially a "status quo" strategy that allows current activities and policies, such as recreation administration, road
maintenance, and fire suppression to continue. It proposes no actions that are contained in the action alternatives
described in the following paragraphs. This alternative provides a baseline for comparison of environmental
consequences of the other alternatives to the existing condition (36 CFR 1502.14) and is a management option that
could be selected by the deciding official.
Alternative 2 – Proposed Action
Intent: Alternative 2 is the proposed action, designed to meet the purpose and need for this project. It includes timber
harvest, slash treatment, site preparation, prescribed burning, tree planting, and precommercial thinning that move
the landscape toward desired conditions. Other activities of this action alternative are access management changes,
construction of new roads, road storage and decommissioning activities, temporary road construction,
implementation of BMPs, wildlife habitat enhancement and improvement of recreation settings, opportunities and
experiences. Table 1 and the FEIS, Chapter 2, pages 6 to 2 contain more detailed information on these activities.
Alternative 2 includes four project-specific Forest Plan amendments. They are:
Project-Specific Amendment #1: Units #40, 73T, 147, 148, 149 and 150 cannot meet MA 15 visuals direction
because they are planned for regeneration treatments (seed tree & shelterwood) to exceed 40 acres either
singularly or in combination with other units (USDA Forest Service 1987a, III-64-65).
Alternative 2 will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seed tree prescription in concert with exceeding 40
acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Management Area 15 VQO is maximum modification. Treatment of
these units supports purpose and need statement #1.
Page 5 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

Project Specific Amendment #2: Unit #362 cannot meet MA 12 visuals direction because it is planned for
regeneration treatment (clearcut) to exceed 40 acres. (USDA Forest Service 1987a, III-48-49).
Alternative 2 will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a clearcut prescription in concert with exceeding 40
acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Management Area 12 VQO is “maximum modification in areas of low
visual significance, modification in areas of moderate visual significance, and partial retention in areas of high
visual significance, unless infeasible when attempting to meet the goals of the Management Area.” Treatment
of this unit supports purpose and need statement #1.
Project Specific Amendment #3: Units #73 and 188 cannot meet MA 16 visuals direction because they are
planned for regeneration treatment (seed tree) to exceed 40 acres in combination. (USDA Forest Service 1987a,
III-69-70).
Alternative 2 will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seed tree prescription in concert with exceeding 40
acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Management Area 16 “minimum VQO is modification.” Treatment of
these units supports purpose and need statement #1.
Project Specific Amendment #4: This alternative will require a project-specific KNFP amendment for harvest
treatments in MA12 that removes hiding cover and movement corridors resulting in openings greater than 40
acres (Chapter 3, Wildlife Section for more information on hiding cover and openings). The KNFP standard for
opening sizes in MA 12 is to maintain movement corridors of at least two site distances (400 feet) between
openings, and generally not to exceed openings over 40 acres (KNFP p. III-49, Wildlife and Fish standards #7).
Alternative 2 proposes one unit with acreage on MA12 land that result in openings that do not meet this
standard. Unit 362 results in a 192 acre opening on MA12. Therefore, a site-specific KNFP amendment and
Regional approval is necessary for this unit.
Alternative 2 will also require Regional Forester approval for exceeding NFMA opening requirements and 36
CFR Part 219.27(d)(2) which states the maximum regeneration harvest treatment for Montana is 40 acres.
Past management within the analysis area has interspersed the forest with a series of 20-to-40 acre openings with
very distinct (hard) edges between harvested and unharvested areas. This disturbance regime provides suitable
habitat for species that are adapted to the edges between forested and non-forested areas. However, species that
require larger blocks of habitat are at a disadvantage under such a disturbance regime. The analysis presented in
the DEIS found the effects of larger openings will not result in adverse effects for big game, however treatments
could result in openings that may not be fully utilized by elk as foraging areas, at least diurnally.

Alternative 3
Intent: Alternative 3 was designed to implement projects that meet the purpose and need for action and to meet all
standards put forth in the KNFP and NFMA. Briefly these standards include opening size in MA 12 and 15, impacts
to old growth forest stands and amount of motorized trails in project area changing to non-motorized.
To meet NFMA requirements and KNFP recommendations for over 40 acre openings, all units were reduced to 40
acres or under (Issue #1). All treatments in old growth units were dropped as a KNFP amendment would have been
needed (Issue #2). Two of the six motorized trails will remain motorized creating a loop for recreationist to travel
(Issue #3). Further reconnaissance showed the need to add fuel unit F19. Several units were dropped to meet the
maximum protection measures for goshawk according to Reynolds et al. 1992. Unit 68 was dropped due to the
presence of a red-tailed hawk nest. The white bark pine thinning was dropped from this alternative so as not to
implement the exception in the Northern Rockies Lynx management Direction. Overall acres in the Fuels and
Wildlife units could be reduced (by approx. 608 ac) if burning conditions are not favorable within the lynx analysis
unit and burning would result in habitat reduction. Treatment units for which this reduction would occur are
available in the project file.
No Forest Plan amendment would be needed with this alternative.

2. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED BUT ELIMINATED FROM DETAILED STUDY
The following alternatives, suggested in public comments or by ID team members, were considered but dismissed
from detailed consideration for the reasons summarized below.
Alternative 5 addressed public comments concerning no road storage and no change in motorized trail access. Some
of the public was concerned that road storage would limit access for public recreation and forest management. Some
public felt that changing motorized trails to non-motorized trails would decrease access for public recreation.
Alternative 5 was not analyzed in detail for several reasons. First, road storage (intermittent stored service) is a
category to manage existing roads that have adverse impacts on watershed quality. The roads would be closed to
traffic and left in a condition that there is little resource risk if maintenance is not performed. Second, road storage
would not measurably impede future forest management. Roads that are not needed in the short-term (10 to 20
years), but would likely be needed at some time in the future would be stored. Storage may include surface ripping,
seeding and/or cross ditching and may include some sections of partial road recontouring as needed on a sitespecific basis, but the majority of the road prism would be retained for future access needs. The majority of road
prisms would be left in place based on the Travel Analysis Process (TAP), most of these roads are not needed for
short-term (10 to20 yrs.) access for commercial timber management. The TAP can be found in the Project File.
Action Alternative 4 was also developed to address public concerns on regeneration treatment units over 40 acres,
treatments in old growth, treatments in lynx habitat, and motorized trail access. However, subsequent to the
application of design measures for both Alternatives 2 and 3, Alternative 4 did not measurably add to the range of
alternatives and was dropped as all public and internal concerns were addressed fully in Action Alternatives 2 and 3.

VIII. SPECIFICS OF THE SELECTED ALTERNATIVE
ALTERNATIVE 2 with MODIFICATIONS
I am implementing Alternative 2 with some modifications. The changes I made to Alternative 2 are summarized in
draft ROD Section I, responding to public concerns. See Section IX, Principal Factors Considered in My Decision
for more information on the rationale for this decision, including how it best responds to public concerns.
A map of the selected alternative and a summary of treatments are included in this Record of Decision. The selected
Page 7 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

alternative, Alternative 2 with modifications, is the environmentally preferred alternative. While Alternative 2 with
modifications includes more vegetation harvest treatments and disturbs more acreage than Alternative 3, it will
result in more area moving toward the desired condition as described in the FEIS.
The following is my decision for various management practices contained in Alternative 2 with modifications:
1. Whether to implement vegetation management activities (silvicultural prescriptions, logging methods, slash
treatment, reforestation, prescribed fire), including mitigation measures and design features to protect
resources and, if so, the site-specific location of these activities and practices.
Commercial harvest will be implemented on approximately 8,845 acres to maintain the vigor and long-term
productivity of forest stands by:
• Enhancing species diversity trending toward reference conditions (Vegetation Section, Chapter 3) which are
better adapted and more resistant and resilient to disturbances. This will occur through regeneration harvest and
planting western white pine, western larch and ponderosa pine.
• Move timber stand towards tree stocking densities through commercial thinning, regeneration harvest and
planting trending the stands towards reference density conditions. The risk of tree mortality from insect and
disease infestations, primarily mountain pine beetle, will decrease with density reduction especially on the dry
land sites and in LPP stands.
• Restoration toward reference condition levels of successional stages through improvement harvests and
regeneration harvests. This alternative will restore successional stage diversity across the landscape that is better
adapted to disturbances and will provide foraging areas for various wildlife species including Canada lynx,
grizzly bears, large ungulates, and various small mammals.
• Encroachment of Douglas-fir will be reduced on the dry ponderosa pine habitat types, in turn reducing the fire
risk in the wildland-urban interface (WUI).
Draft ROD Appendix 1 presents a summary of the treatments for each unit. A map of the site-specific locations
is attached to this document.
Activity fuels will be treated by yarding tops (26%), grapple piling (43%), underburning (30%) and slashing
(1%). Approximately 91% (8,053 acres) of the proposed harvest units will utilize ground-based logging systems
(tractor yarding) and 9% (792 acres) will utilize a skyline yarding system due to steep slopes with available
access roads.
Road maintenance and Best Management Practices (BMP) work will be applied to approximately 176 miles of haul
roads.
Design features to protect resource values, including trails, visuals, soils, streams, noxious weed reduction and
wildlife habitat are included in this decision (draft ROD Appendix 2).
2. Whether to construct temporary roads to access proposed timber harvest units
Approximately 4 miles of temporary road construction is proposed to access harvest units. These roads are needed to
access the various harvest units to meet the purpose and need of this project. These roads will be restored after timber
harvest is completed since they will not be needed in the future. Table 2 displays the list of temporary roads, their
length, the drainage they will be in and which units they access.

4. Whether to construct new permanent roads to harvest units and recreation sites.
Approximately nine miles of new permanent road construction is proposed in this project. These new roads will
access harvest and fuels units (Table 4). About 0.20 miles of the new road will be built on FS lands to allow the
DNRC access to their lands. The new roads are not only needed for the East Reservoir Project but have been
assessed through the Travel Analysis Process (TAP) to be needed for future management. Table 4 displays the road
numbers and corresponding mileages for the proposed new road construction plus the units that are accessed.

5. Whether to make improvements to recreation sites.
The recreation proposal involves the dispersed recreation sites on the south side of the mouth of Fivemile Creek and
at the Yarnell camping area.
Currently the Fivemile area receives relatively little dispersed camping use due primarily to poor access. Existing
roads will be improved. New road construction (N1) to access harvest Units 4 and 132 will be left to provide more
opportunities for dispersed camping. Native rock ring fire pits, vault toilets and signage and other improvements will
be provided.
The Yarnell area is a very popular destination for dispersed camping. The site(s) are occupied primarily from
Memorial Day through Labor Day and receives steady use. The road infrastructure is in place and the objective
would be to improve the road without changing the character of the area.
In addition, several roads that access dispersed camping areas along the Koocanusa Reservoir will be open yearlong
which is a change from seasonal closures. Table 5 displays the roads that are proposed to change access.

6. Whether to change motorized trails to non-motorized trails.
Access changes will occur on approximately 27 miles of motorized trails in Alternative 3 (Table 6). Trail 281 and
420 will remain as motorized routes creating a loop which includes open NFS roads for recreationists to enjoy. By
making this change, wildlife security will increase from 28% to 33% meeting the recommended percent security in
the analysis area while keeping trails open to motorized travel.

8. What, if any, specific project monitoring requirements are needed to assure management measures and
design features are implemented and effective, or to evaluate success of project objectives.
The monitoring plan in the draft ROD Appendix 3 will be implemented. This plan includes implementation and
effectiveness monitoring activities related to design features for noxious weeds, soils, protection of trails, wildlife
habitat, and fisheries. Design features included in the project are located in the draft ROD Appendix 2.
9. Whether to request Regional Forester approval for regeneration units over 40 acres.
Part of the purpose and need of the East Reservoir Project is to 1) re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are
more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental
conditions such as climate change; 2) create a heterogeneous landscape that provides a variety of habitats to sustain
populations of terrestrial and aquatic species; and 3) enhance recreation settings and facilities with the goal of
providing high quality experiences. To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to create openings larger than 40
Page 11 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

acres in size. Specifically, these larger openings are needed in order to:
• Trend the landscape towards a more desirable pattern of patch sizes that mimics natural processes and restores
historical patterns of patch size (FEIS, pp.23-25; Vegetation Report, Desired Condition, VRU 4,5 and 7).
• Create a pattern of fuel treatments at a landscape scale that is likely to disrupt large fire growth and spread and
assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts. Design fuel treatments to provide a fuel break immediately adjacent to
a major power transmission line (FEIS, Fire and Fuels Report, p. 182).
• Create openings that reduce edge effect and reduce fragmentation, which can result from more numerous
treatment areas and still achieve the same objectives. (FEIS, Wildlife Report, p. 224, 301 and 308).
The proposed action for the East Reservoir Project will create forest openings larger than 40 acres in size through
the use of even-aged regeneration methods. Eight of the regeneration harvests (Units 40, 62, 73T, 147, 148, 149,
150 and 362) are proposed as over 40 acre regeneration but do not mimic the large historic patch size of 5,000 to
100,000 acres. However, Units 40, 62, 73T, 147, 148, 149 and 150 are placed adjacent to past harvest that are
recovered but are within the early-successional stage. By these units being blocked up with other earlysuccessional stages this larger block mimics historic conditions and will move into the future as a connected patch
of interior forest (FEIS, Vegetation Report, p. 45, 46, 47). In accordance with direction provided in the R1
supplement to FSM 2471.1, Regional Forester approval to exceed the 40 acre size limit has been requested and
granted (Project File Vol. s, Doc 31).

IX. PRINCIPLE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN MY DECISION
I have selected Alternative 2 with modifications, as it is described previously, because it best addresses public
concerns while meeting the purpose and need for the project and protecting resources. This section details my
rationale for this decision.
Benefits of Implementing the Action Alternatives
Both of the action alternatives satisfy my decision criteria and implementation of either of them will result in many
benefits as follows:
• Maintain diverse age classes of vegetation for viable populations of all existing vertebrate species;
• Reduce overall stand densities and promotion of fire-adapted species such as ponderosa pine and western larch;
• Introduce prescribed fire to simulate natural ecological processes, prevent excessive fuel buildups, create habitat
diversity for wildlife, reduce fire suppression costs, maintain ecosystems, and to create shrub fields for wildlife
foraging habitat;
• Provide forest products within the sustainable capability of the ecosystem;
• Provide access to National Forest System and private lands while providing ecological integrity, wildlife security
habitat and protecting water quality;
• Maintain a balance of open and closed roads to ensure big-game habitat security;
• Improves recreation experience through improvements in dispersed camping sites.
All action alternatives respond in various ways to the purpose and need for action. Because the purpose and need for
action responds to Forest Plan goals, objectives, and standards, I used it as an indicator of Forest Plan
implementation. Table 8 displays a comparison of purpose and need objectives by alternative, which helped me
evaluate how well the effectiveness of each alternative responds to the Forest Plan.

Why I Did Not Select the No-Action Alternative (Alternative 1)
There are many reasons I did not select Alternative 1 (no-action). While in the short-term, doing nothing may have
less effect than the short-term disturbances associated with the action alternative activities, over time, the
consequences of doing “nothing” are potentially far greater. I did not select Alternative 1 because:
• Species diversity, stocking density and successional stages consistent with reference conditions is better adapted
and therefore more resistant and resilient to disturbances. Without disturbance this landscape will continue to
trend away from reference conditions for species diversity. There will be no prescribed fire, regeneration harvest
and planting western white pine, western larch and ponderosa pine in the no action alternative.
• Restoring tree stocking densities through commercial thinning, precommercial thinning, regeneration harvest and
planting will not occur. These stands will not trend towards reference density conditions. The risk of tree mortality
from insect and disease infestations, primarily mountain pine beetle, will likely increase on the dry land sites and
in lodgepole pine (LPP) stands. Wildfire potential and intensity will also remain higher than reference conditions
• Trending successional stages toward reference condition levels through improvement harvests and regeneration
harvests will not occur. Restoring successional diversity across the landscape that is better adapted to disturbances
will not occur.
• In concert with continued wildfire suppression, encroachment of Douglas-fir will continue in the dry ponderosa
pine habitat types creating an increased fire risk in the wildland-urban interface (WUI).
• Existing motorized trails will not be closed which will maintain security habitat at less than desired secure habitat
by seven percent within the analysis area for large mammals including moose, elk, deer and sheep.
• Without weed treatment and burning activities, shrub and grass species in the natural openings will continue to
decline in value as browse for big game. Weed treatment will continue consistent with Weed EIS and funding, but
will not be increased and may not keep up with the expansion of noxious weeds.
• With continued fire suppression, conifer encroachment on bighorn sheep escape habitat will result in higher risk
of mortality from predators because increased cover will be provided for stalking predators.
• Lack of forest regeneration in concert with fire suppression will result in less early successional forest which
provides snowshoe hare foraging habitat, thus likely reducing prey numbers for the threatened Canada lynx.
• Natural regeneration of seral species such as ponderosa pine and western larch will be minimal. These species are
better adapted to disturbance such as fire and were present in larger numbers historically.
• Precommercial thinning will not occur, allowing overstocked sapling-size stands to become stagnant and allowing
shade-tolerant species to dominate.
• Improperly installed or undersized culverts will continue to impede aquatic organism passage and have a higher
likelihood for plugging and failing than properly-sized culverts.
• There will be no management for visuals along Scenic Byway 37.
• There will be no jobs or labor income associated with timber harvest and other resource activities.
In summary, the no-action alternative does not satisfy the purpose and need for the project and does not implement
the Forest Plan direction for this area, which includes improving forest conditions and habitats through management
practices. (See FEIS Chapter 3 analysis of Alternative 1 for more detailed information on the effects of no action).
Why I Selected Alternative 2 with Modifications
I selected Alternative 2 with modifications over the other action alternative because it best addresses public concerns
while achieving project objectives. The following paragraphs explain my rationale by key issue for this project:
Regeneration Units Over 40 Acres
Concern over regeneration units exceeding 40 acres is addressed by altering the shape of the units and/or retaining
leave islands within the interior of the units. Eight of the regeneration harvests (Units 40, 62, 73T, 147, 148, 149,
150 and 362) are proposed as over 40 acre regeneration but do not mimic the large historic patch size of 5,000 to
100,000 acres. However, Units 40, 62, 73T, 147, 148, 149 and 150 are placed adjacent to past harvest that are
recovered but are within the early-successional stage. Blocking up with proposed units with existing earlysuccessional stage stands creates larger blocks that do mimic historic conditions. Over time these stands will
Page 13 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

mature into a connected patch of interior forest (FEIS, Vegetation Report, p. 45, 46, 47). In accordance with
direction provided in the R1 supplement to FSM 2471.1, Regional Forester approval to exceed the 40 acre size
limit has been requested and granted (Project File Vol. s, Doc 31).
Impact to Old Growth Forest Stands
Concern regarding the impact to old growth stands are addressed by dropping proposed vegetation treatments in old
growth. Alternative 2 maintains fuel treatments (~173 ac) in some old growth such as in VRU 2.The purpose of
prescribed fire in old growth, as identified in the KNFP, is to maintain old growth characteristics. These will occur
in dry land old growth such as south aspects of VRU2 and VRU3. Treatments to be implemented are designed to
reduce ladder fuels via a combination of slashing and prescribed burning. Reducing ladder and surface fuels will
maintain or enhance some of the dry land old growth attributes and help ensure the survivability of the older, large
diameter trees in these individual stands. The overall goal is to work towards returning these stands to their
appropriate fire regime and increased fire resiliency.
Closing of Approximately 27 miles of Motorized Trails (Big Game Security)
As explained previously, both action alternatives meet many of the purpose and need objectives to a similar extent.
However, in response to public comment, Alternative 2 with modifications changes less motorized trails to nonmotorized while meeting recommended values for wildlife security (Table 6).
Table 9 displays a comparison of the alternatives by significant issue.

Cumulative Effects
In addition to the purpose and need and public issues, I considered the potential for cumulative effects from past,
present, and reasonably foreseeable actions in conjunction with project activities, as disclosed in Chapter 3 of the
FEIS, and I determined there will be no significant cumulative effects. In making this determination, I examined
past, present, ongoing, proposed, and reasonably foreseeable future actions and the cumulative effects analysis is
consistent with the Forest Service NEPA Regulations (36 CFR 220.4(f), July 24, 2008) in accordance with the
Council on Environmental Quality Memorandum, Guidance on the Consideration of Past Actions in Cumulative
Effects Analysis.
My conclusion is based on: 1) the project’s consistency with CEQ direction, 2) on-the-ground review and
discussions with district resource specialists, and 3) review of the extensive project environmental documentation,
including biological assessments, and findings that through project design resources are protected.

X. FINDINGS REQUIRED BY LAW, REGULATION, AND AGENCY POLICY
Numerous laws, regulations, and agency directives require that my decision be consistent with their provisions. I
have determined that my decision is consistent with all laws, regulations and agency policy. The following
summarizes findings required by major environmental laws:
1. NATIONAL FOREST MANAGEMENT ACT (16 USC 1600 ET SEQ.)
The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) and accompanying regulations require that several specific findings
be documented at the project level. These are:
A. Consistency with Forest Plan (16 USC 1604(i))
The Kootenai Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) establishes management direction for the
Page 14 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

Kootenai Forest. This management direction is achieved through the establishment of Forest goals and objectives,
standards and guidelines, and Management Area (MA) goals and accompanying standards and guidelines. Project
implementation consistent with this direction is the process by which we move toward the desired condition
described by the Forest Plan. Forest Plan direction provides the sideboards for project planning. In addition, the
National Forest Management Act (NFMA) requires that all resource plans are to be consistent with the Forest Plan
(16 USC 1604 (i)). The Draft EIS displays the Forest Plan and MA goals and objectives applicable to the East
Reservoir project area (FEIS, Ch. 1, pgs. 11 through 12). The alternative development process and the
management goals of the alternatives are described in the FEIS Chapter 2, while the environmental consequences
of the alternatives in relation to the Forest Plan standards and guidelines are displayed in the FEIS Chapter 3.
Forest Plan Amendment
The Forest Plan states "If it is determined during project design that the best way to meet the goals of the Forest Plan
conflicts with a Forest Plan standard, the Forest Supervisor may approve an exception to that standard for that
project." With this decision I have approved four amendments to the Forest Plan.
Project-Specific Amendment #1: Units #40, 73T, 147, 148, 149 and 150 cannot meet MA 15 visuals direction
because they are planned for regeneration treatments (seed tree & shelterwood) to exceed 40 acres either
singularly or in combination with other units (USDA Forest Service 1987a, III-64-65).
Alternative 2 will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seed tree prescription in concert with exceeding 40
acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Management Area 15 VQO is maximum modification. Treatment of these
units supports purpose and need statement #1.
Project Specific Amendment #2: Unit #362 cannot meet MA 12 visuals direction because it is planned for
regeneration treatment (clearcut) to exceed 40 acres (USDA Forest Service 1987a, III-48-49).
Alternative 2 will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a clearcut prescription in concert with exceeding 40
acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Management Area 12 VQO is “maximum modification in areas of low
visual significance, modification in areas of moderate visual significance, and partial retention in areas of high
visual significance, unless infeasible when attempting to meet the goals of the Management Area.” Treatment of
this unit supports purpose and need statement #1.
Project Specific Amendment #3: Units #73T and 188 cannot meet MA 16 visuals direction because they are
planned for regeneration treatment (seed tree) to exceed 40 acres in combination (USDA Forest Service 1987a,
III-69-70).
Alternative 2 will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seed tree prescription in concert with exceeding 40
acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Management Area 16 “minimum VQO is modification.” Treatment of these
units supports purpose and need statement #1.
Project Specific Amendment #4: This alternative will require a project-specific KNFP amendment for harvest
treatments in MA12 that removes hiding cover and movement corridors resulting in openings greater than 40
acres (Chapter 3, Wildlife Section for more information on hiding cover and openings). The KNFP standard for
opening sizes in MA 12 is to maintain movement corridors of at least two site distances (400 feet) between
openings, and generally not to exceed openings over 40 acres (KNFP p. III-49, Wildlife and Fish standards #7).
Alternative 2 proposes one unit with acreage on MA12 land that result in openings that do not meet this standard.
Unit 362 results in a 192 acre opening on MA12. Therefore, a site-specific KNFP amendment and Regional
approval is necessary for this unit.
I have determined that these are non-significant project specific amendments, because the amendments are for this
project only; only applies to the East Reservoir project area, and affects a small area. With the inclusion of these
amendments, this project is consistent with Forest Plan management direction.
Grizzly Bear
In November 2011 the Record of Decision for the Forest Plan Amendments for Motorized Access Management
within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones (Access Amendment) was signed. The Access
Amendment amended the Idaho Panhandle, Kootenai and Lolo National Forest land management plans (forest
plans) to include standards for open motorized route density (OMRD), total motorized route density (TMRD), and
Core area within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bear recovery zones (Access Amendment 2011 ROD, p. 5).
These habitat security standards were determined through consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS), recommendations by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee (IGBC), and the research performed by
grizzly bear research scientists Wayne Wakkinen (Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG)) and Wayne
Kasworm (USFWS). In addition, the 2011 Access Amendment also sets linear miles of open and total road
Page 15 of 40

Draft Record of Decision

standards for areas outside the recovery zones that are experiencing recurring use by grizzly bears (i.e. BORZ)
(Access Amendment 2011 ROD, p. 5). The East Reseervoir Project acticites fall within the range of effects
analyzed in the programmatic BO for the 2011 Forest Plan Amendments for Motorized Access Management
within the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones and therefore, in itself, is not likely to
contribute to the loss of grizzly bears from the Tobacco BORZ. In their letter dated August 8, 2013, the U.S.Fish
and Wildlife Service concurred with this finding.
Soil and Water Resources
NFMA requires that timber will be harvested from NFS lands only where soil, slope, or other watershed conditions
will not be irreversibly damaged - 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i). All activities proposed are consistent with this
direction.
The Forest Plan states that project plans for activities requiring the use of ground-based equipment will establish
standards for the area allocated to skid trails, landings, temporary roads or similar areas of concentrated equipment
use (USDA Forest Service 1987a). None of the activities will exceed the Regional Soil Quality Standards for
detrimentally disturbed soils (FSM R1 Supplement 2500-99-1). The project soils analysis found that the amount of
cumulative detrimental soil disturbance is below the regional guideline of 15% (FEIS pg. 3-136).
The proposed project is consistent with the goals, objectives and standards for soil and water resources set forth in
the Kootenai Forest Plan because project mitigation and BMPs have been included to protect soil and water
resources. The BMPs include Soil and Water Conservation Practices at a minimum to control non-point source
pollution and protect soil and water resources from permanent damage. The2002 KNF Monitoring Report (USDA
Forest Service 2003) states that monitoring between 1990 and 2002 shows that 94% of the BMPs implemented
during that time were effective. Each of the alternatives will follow INFS standards and guidelines for any activities
in riparian areas.
Old Growth
Alternative 2 with modifications does propose fuel activities in old growth. Alternative 2 maintains fuel treatments
(approx. 173 ac) in some old growth such as in VRU 2.The purpose of prescribed fire in old growth, as identified in
the KNFP, is to maintain old growth characteristics. These will occur in dryland old growth such as south aspects of
VRU2 and VRU3. Treatments are designed to reduce ladder fuels via a combination of slashing and prescribed
burning. By reducing ladder fuels and surface fuels the treatments are expected to maintain or enhance some of the
dryland old growth attributes and help ensure the survivability of the old, large diameter trees in these individual
stands. The overall goal is to work towards returning these stands to their appropriate fire regime and increase fire
resiliency.
The project maintains 12% of designated and undesignated old growth in the project area, well distributed across
dominate habitat types of suitable National Forest acres below 5,500 feet elevation, and has been designed to
conserve old growth attributes wherever they exist outside of old growth management areas. All alternatives will
maintain a sufficient amount and distribution of old growth forest habitat as directed by the Kootenai Forest Plan.
The 2011 Forest Plan Monitoring Report (FY2010, August 2011) indicates the KNF has 1,869,222 acres below
5,500 feet elevation (minus lakes and highways). Using the stand-level data, there are currently 201,577 acres or
10.8% of KNF acres below 5,500 feet that are OG (designated or undesignated). An additional 97,717 acres are
replacement old growth (designated and undesignated). Forestwide, OG or ROG on the KNF totals 299,294 acres or
16.0% of acres below 5,500 feet based on the stand-level data.
B. Suitability for Timber Production
No timber harvest, other than salvage sales or sales to protect other multiple-use values, shall occur on lands not
suited for timber production {16 USC 1604(k)}.
Determination that lands are suitable: All acres proposed for harvest in the selected alternative were reviewed by
a certified silviculturist and determined to be suitable for timber production and capable of being regenerated within
five years of timber harvest (FEIS, Ch. 3, page 19).
Analysis of current and historical regeneration data for the project area supports the conclusion that adequate
stocking of the proposed harvest units is assured with site-preparation efforts occurring in a timely manner following
harvest (FEIS, Ch. 3, page 36).
C. Timber Harvest on National Forest System Lands
A Responsible Official may authorize site-specific projects and activities to harvest timber on National Forest
System lands only where:
1. Soil, slope, or other watershed conditions will not be irreversibly damaged - 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(i). The
Page 16 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

selected alternative will avoid impairment of soils. This determination is supported by the disclosures in
FEIS, Ch. 3, Soils Resource, page 73 and the application of Best Management Practices contained in the
Soil and Water Conservation Practices Handbook 2509.22 (USDA Forest Service 1988) to prevent the loss
of soil. Documentation of the effects of the selected alternative to site productivity and soil and water
resources are contained in the soils analysis and the Project File. The estimated cumulative disturbance by
harvest unit ranges from 0-15%, meeting regional guidelines limiting detrimental disturbance to 15%.
Mitigation measures, including using existing skid trails and ripping and seeding landings and skid trails,
are prescribed to ensure that all units will meet the regional standard.
Watershed rehabilitation activities are designed to improve the overall conditions of the watershed.
2. There is assurance that the lands can be adequately restocked within five years after final regeneration
harvest (16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(ii). The knowledge and technology currently exists to adequately restock the
harvested areas and is documented in the vegetation analysis (FEIS, Ch. 3, page 19) and project file.
3. Streams, streambanks, shorelines, lakes, wetlands, and other bodies of water are protected from
detrimental changes in water temperatures, blockages of water courses, and deposits of sediment where
harvests are likely to seriously and adversely affect water conditions or fish habitat - 16 USC
1604(g)(3)(E)(iii). Alternative 2 with modifications meets all Forest Plan standards as amended by INFS (FEIS,
Ch. 3, page 128, 169). All streams and wetlands will be buffered with riparian habitat conservation areas
(RHCAs) as directed by INFS. Undersized culverts on haul routes will be replaced during the dry season to
avoid sediment introduction in to streams when bull trout eggs will be vulnerable to smothering by sediment.
4. The harvesting system to be used is not selected primarily because it will give the greatest dollar return
or the greatest unit output of timber - 16 USC 1604(g)(3)(E)(iv). The decision to implement the selected
alternative is based on a variety of reasons as discussed earlier in this decision, not solely on economics.
Economics was but one of the many factor which I considered.
D. Clearcutting and Even-aged Management
A Responsible Official may authorize projects and activities on National Forest system lands using cutting methods,
such as clearcutting, seed tree cutting, shelterwood cutting, and other cuts designed to regenerate an even-aged stand
of timber, only where:
1. For clearcutting, it is the optimum method; or where seed tree, shelterwood, and other cuts are
determined to be appropriate to meeting the objectives and requirements of the relevant plan (16 USC
1604(g)(3)(F)(i)). I have determined that clearcutting is the optimal method of treatment for all or portions of
Units 41, 61, 68, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 367A, 368A and 368B, in the selected alternative. I have also
determined that prescribing other even-aged systems under the selected alternative is appropriate for all or
portions of Units 1A, 2, 3, 3C, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14A, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 36, 39, 40, 44, 45A, 45B,
46. 47. 51, 52A, 53, 54, 59, 62, 64, 64A, 64B, 69, 70, 70T, 71, 72, 73T, 75, 80, 81, 82, 141, 142, 143A, 144S,
144T, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 158, 159A, 170, 185, 185N, 188, 193, 207, 208, 214 and 219. My determination
is based upon field reviews; discussion of alternative silvicultural systems, prescriptions and the use of evenaged management found in the diagnosis (FEIS, Ch. 3, pages 58, 59, project file); the evaluation of effects
found in Chapter 3 of the FEIS; and the Forest Vegetation section of the project file.
2. The interdisciplinary review has been completed and the potential environmental, biological, aesthetic,
engineering, and economic impacts have been assessed on each advertised sale area and the cutting
methods are consistent with the multiple use of the general area (16 USC 1604 (g)(3)(F)(ii)). As discussed
in the FEIS, the environmental analyses were completed by an interdisciplinary team (see list of preparers in
Chapter 4 of the FEIS). The cutting methods are consistent with the Forest Plan goals and objectives for the
affected MAs (FEIS, Ch. 1, Page 11 – 12; Ch. 2, pages 9 to 12; Ch. 3, Page 59).
3. Cut blocks, patches, or strips are shaped and blended to the extent practicable with the natural terrain
(16 USC 1604 (g)(3)(F)(iii)). Alternative 2 with modifications does not meet Forest Plan visual quality
objectives (VQOs) in six regeneration units. See Scenic Resource analysis, Chapter 3 of the FEIS, pages 362 to
377. These openings are needed to meet the purpose and need of this project which include:
a. Re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to disturbance
(insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate
change;
b. Create a heterogeneous landscape that provides a variety of habitats to sustain populations of
terrestrial and aquatic species;
c. Reduce hazardous fuels adjacent to private property and across the landscape while re­
introducing fire to the ecosystem.
Three project specific Forest Plan amendments for visual quality objectives will be needed to accomplish this
goal (FEIS, Ch. 2, pg. 20).
4. Cuts are carried out according to the maximum size limit requirements for areas to be cut during one
Page 17 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

harvest operation (16 USC 1604 (g)(3)(F)(iv)). Alternative 2 with Modifications does propose regeneration
units with openings that exceed 40 acres in size (FEIS, Ch. 2, Table 2.13). These larger openings are needed to
trend the landscape towards a more desirable pattern of patch sizes that mimics natural processes and
restores historical patterns of patch size (DEIS, pp.23-25; Vegetation Report, Desired Condition, VRU 4,5
and 7); create a pattern of fuel treatments at a landscape scale that is likely to disrupt large fire growth and
spread and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts and design fuel treatments to provide a fuel break
immediately adjacent to a major power transmission line (DEIS, Fire and Fuels Report, p.182); create
openings that reduce edge effect and reduce fragmentation, which can result from more numerous treatment
areas and still achieve the same objectives (DEIS, Wildlife Report, p. 224, 301 and 308). Regional Forest
approval will be needed to exceed NFMA opening requirements plus a project specific amendment for
harvest treatments in MA 12 that remove hiding cover and movement corridors resulting in openings
greater than 40 acres (FEIS, Ch. 2, pg. 20).
5. Timber cuts are carried out in a manner consistent with the protection of soil, watershed, fish, wildlife,
recreation, esthetic resources, cultural and historic resources, and the regeneration of timber resources
(16 USC 1604 (g)(3)(F)(v)). The timber harvest conducted under the selected alternative provides the necessary
protection for the above resources. This determination is supported by disclosures in Chapter 3 of the FEIS.
The standards and guidelines contained in the Forest Plan are designed to provide the desired effects of
management practices on the other resource values. Alternative 2 with modifications meets or exceeds
applicable standards and guidelines, as noted under "Consistency with Forest Plan" previously in this section.
My consideration of these factors is documented throughout Chapters 2 and 3 of the FEIS and the project file.
E. Sensitive Species
NFMA provides direction applicable to sensitive species. In making my decision, I have reviewed the analysis and
projected effects on all sensitive species listed as possibly occurring on the Kootenai National Forest (FEIS, Ch. 3,
Wildlife Resource pgs. 246 -321; Fisheries and Aquatic Species Resources, pg. 104; 123 - 131; and PTES Plants pg.
191, 192 - 199). The statement of findings for this project are as follows:
 No impact on the Coeur d’Alene salamander, common loon, harlequin duck, northern bog lemming, northern
leopard frog, peregrine falcon, and all other PTES plant species not listed under the “may impact” section
below.
 May impact individuals or habitat, but would not contribute to a trend towards federal listing or cause
loss of viability to the population of species for the bald eagle, bighorn sheep, black-backed woodpecker,
fisher, flammulated owl, Townsend’s big-eared bat, western toad, westslope cutthroat trout, western pearlshell
mussels, gray wolf, Allium acuminatum (taper-tipped onion), Botrychium ascendens (upswept moonwort),
Botrychium crenulatum (wavy moonwort), Clarkia rhomboidea (common clarkia), Heterocodon rariflorum
(western pearl flower), Phegopteris connectilis (northern beechfern), Cypripedium fasciculatum (clustered
lady’s-slipper) and Collema curtisporum (lichen).
I concur with the findings documented for these species.
2. THE CLEAN WATER ACT AND STATE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS
Beneficial uses of the East Reservoir project area include human uses such as drinking water, irrigation and
recreation, as well as protection of fisheries and aquatic life. I believe that the selected alternative complies with
applicable Clean Water Act and Montana State Water Quality standards and maintains beneficial uses through the
application of BMPs and other design features as listed in FEIS Appendix A. These beneficial uses in the East
Reservoir project area will be maintained as a result of the application of general and site-specific Best Management
Practices (BMPs) contained in the Soil and Water Conservation Practices Handbook 2509.22 (USDA Forest Service
1988) (FEIS Appendix C) as well as other protective design features. These include, but are not limited to: 1)
harvest will not occur in Riparian Habitat Conservation Areas (RHCAs); 2) temporary road construction will utilize
BMPs to reduce erosion and will be recontoured following harvest; 3) haul road maintenance will address currently
poor road drainage and will be timed to occur during drier months to avoid sediment mobility during rain events; 4)
ground-based logging (approximately 91% of this project) is restricted to sustained slopes of 40% or less and
measurable effects to peak flows are unlikely due to application of RHCA buffers and BMPs; approximately 37%
required winter harvest; and 5) proposed actions are in compliance and will meet Inland Native Fish Strategy (INFS)
standards and guidelines. Specific practices are described in detail in Appendix 25 of the Forest Plan.
As required by the Clean Water Act, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) has published a
list of streams and portions of streams where the state has identified water quality concerns. The FS and MDEQ
have a policy that MDEQ will be notified when activities are proposed in watersheds that are on the 303(d) list.
EPA comments (Letter #3) are displayed and addressed in the Appendix 5 of this document. Ongoing and project
specific water quality monitoring is displayed in the draft ROD Appendix 3. This monitoring includes BMP
Page 18 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

Implementation and Effectiveness Reviews. These steps will document the results of the protective measures
employed in this project and serve as ongoing monitoring of their effectiveness in protecting water quality and
downstream beneficial uses.
3. THE CLEAN AIR ACT
Upon review of the FEIS (Ch. 3, Air Quality, pgs. 355 to 358), I find that the selected alternative will be
coordinated to meet the requirements of the State Implementation Plans, Smoke Management Plan, and Federal air
quality requirements.
4. THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT (16 USC 1531 ET. SEQ.)
As required by the Endangered Species Act, biological assessments were prepared addressing the potential impacts
to threatened or endangered species utilizing the project area. The analyses concluded that this project will have no
effect on water howellia, Spalding’s catchfly, bull trout or white sturgeon.
A biological assessment was submitted to FWS for determination of concurrence on September 11, 2012 (revised
May 31, 2013). Through consultation, the FWS concurred that the project may affect, but is not likely to adversely
affect the grizzly bear, Canada lynx or designated critical lynx habitat, and will not jeopardized the continued
existence of the proposed threatened wolverine. The gray wolf was removed from the List of Endangered and
Threatened Wildlife effective May 4, 2009 (Federal Register Vol. 74, No. 62, pp. 15123-15188, April 2, 2009).
Concurrence was received on August 8, 2013.
5. NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT, AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM
ACT AND NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVE PROTECTION ACT
Heritage resource inventories have been completed on all areas to be impacted by ground-disturbing activities. No
heritage resources are expected to be affected by this action. Recognizing that the potential exists for unidentified
sites to be encountered and disturbed during project activity, contract provision B(T) 6.24# will be included in all
timber sale contracts. This provision allows the Forest Service to unilaterally modify or cancel a contract to protect
cultural resources regardless of when they are identified. This provision will be used if a site were discovered after a
harvest operation had begun.
6. GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS
The Forest Service consulted with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and Kootenai Tribe of Idaho during
the analysis process. The intent of consultation has been to remain informed about Tribal concerns regarding
American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) and other tribal issues. In addition, the Salish (Flathead),
Kootenai and Upper Pend d’Oreilles have rights under the Hellgate Treaty of 1855 (July 16, 1855). These rights
include the "right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory, and of
erecting temporary buildings for curing; together with the privilege of hunting, gathering roots and berries, and
pasturing their horses and cattle upon open and unclaimed land.” The federal government has trust responsibilities to
Tribes under a government-to-government relationship to insure that the Tribes’ reserved rights are protected.
Consultation with the tribes throughout the project planning helped insure that these trust responsibilities were met.
7. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
I have considered the effects of this project on low income and minority populations and concluded that this project
is consistent with the intent of the Environmental Justice Act of 1994 (EO 12898). Representatives from low income
and minority populations were notified of this project through the public participation process and no concerns were
received. This project was designed to contribute to the economic wellbeing of local communities (draft ROD
Section V, purpose and need, and FEIS Chapter 3 Economics Analysis and Required Disclosures). Resource
analysis disclosed no disproportionate effects to low income or minority populations.
8. MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT
On January 10, 2001, President Clinton signed an Executive Order outlining responsibilities of federal agencies to
protect migratory birds. Upon review of the effects analysis regarding neotropical migratory birds in the FEIS,Ch.
3, pg. 322 - 323, I find that the selected alternative complies with this Executive Order.
9. ADMINISTRATION of the FOREST DEVELOPMENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM – ROADS
POLICY - 36 CFR PART 212 ET AL. (PUBLISHED in the FEDERAL REGISTER ON JAN. 12, 2001).
A travel analysis process (TAP) has been prepared for the East Reservoir project area (in the project file). I have
determined that the selected alternative, which includes the construction of approximately 9 miles of new permanent
road and approximately 4 miles of temporary road, as well as the storage or decommissioning of approximately 27
miles of unneeded road, complies with the Roads Policy (DEIS, Chapter 2, Tables 2.9 and 2.10A).

Draft Record of Decision

10. NATIONAL FIRE PLAN
The proposed action for the East Reservoir project responds to the intent of the National Fire Plan (FEIS, Ch. 3, pg.
170). I have determined that the selected alternative meets the goals and objectives of the National Fire Plan to: 1)
reduce the number of small fires that become large, 2) reduce the threat to life and property from catastrophic
wildfire, 3) increase firefighter safety, and 4) restore natural ecological systems to minimize uncharacteristically
intense fires.

2021. Fuels treatments are anticipated to be accomplished by 2022 if funding is obtained. Typically, BMP work on
haul roads will be accomplished prior to haul of timber products. Precommercial thinning activities are expected to
be accomplished by 2025.

Draft Record of Decision

Appendix 2 – Design Features of the Selected Alternative
Appendix 2 describes the design features and management measures that will be applied to this project to protect
resources in all action alternatives.
Appendix 2 – East Reservoir Project Management Measures & Design Features
Trails and Roads: Timber Sale Standard Provision B(T)6.22, Protection of Improvements, will be included in all
timber sale contracts. It will require the purchaser to protect specified improvements, such as trails, roads and
fences. Slash disposal adjacent to the Lake Koocanusa Scenic Byway (MSH 37) and Lake Koocanusa is critical
to meeting KNFP VQOs.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Soil: Refer to Appendix E for specific management requirements for the soil resource.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sensitive Plants: Legal and biological requirements for the conservation of endangered, threatened, proposed,
candidate and sensitive plants will be met. These species have been identified in cooperation with other agencies
such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP). Plant surveys will
be completed prior to any ground-disturbing activities. Emphasis for surveys will be placed on areas with
moderate-to-high potential to provide sensitive plant habitat. These surveys will be conducted by the District
Botanist or a qualified biological technician. If any of these plant species are located prior to or during
implementation of any management activities, the activity will be altered so that proper protection measures could
be taken. Timber sale contract provision B(T)6.25, Protection of Habitat of Endangered Species, will be included
in any subsequent timber sale contract. If necessary, additional modifications will occur through creation of
special treatment zones or by relocating unit boundaries to avoid negative impacts. Disturbance to any sensitive
plant populations observed during sale activity will be avoided through cooperation between sale administrators
and sale purchaser. Surveys for PTES plants of in-stream work areas to improve pool quantity and quality will be
completed before implementation.
• Retain all cottonwood, aspen and birch in all harvest units except in designated skid trails.
• Avoid burning and logging through the western pearl flower (Heterocodon rariflorum) population in Unit 16 by
creating a special treatment zone.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Noxious Weeds: Noxious weeds can have a large impact on not only rare plant habitat but any native plant habitat
the following measures will be used to manage concerns for the spread of noxious weeds.
• Winter Tractor Units to Avoid Noxious Weed Spread: Winter tractor operations for Units 2B, 2C, 2D, 3A, 9,
10, 11, 17, 28, 157, 158, 158A, 190, 194T, 196, 305, 306, 307, COE1 and COE3.
• Certified weed-free forage is required for use on all national forest lands in Montana (36 CFR 261.50)
• Treat existing noxious weeds on roads to be reconstructed or stored prior to that activity, (if possible schedule
spraying two or more seasons before activities are expected to occur to reduce the amount of viable weed seed
stored in the soil).
• Treat existing noxious weeds in gravel/rock pits, inspect these sources for weeds and treat before material is
transported.
• Survey and pre-treat existing noxious weeds on proposed trailhead construction site, and access sites for in-stream
work.
• Require weed free certified straw for all construction, reconstruction, and restoration activities.
• Seed and fertilize stored roads with certified weed free seed immediately following restoration activities.
• Limit scarification objectives to the minimal required to meet reforestation objectives.
• Pressure-wash logging equipment, road maintenance and restoration equipment before entering the analysis area.
• Require timber sale purchaser to treat existing noxious weeds along haul routes the first operational season for
weed spraying (spring or early summer)
• Seed newly constructed roads, trailheads, landings and major skid trails with certified weed-free seed.
• Prevent road maintenance machinery from blading or brushing through known populations of new invaders. In
areas where weeds are established, (and activities are opening and blading restricted or closed roads with
significantly lesser infestations); brush and blade road systems from un-infested segments of road systems to
infested areas. Limit brushing and mowing to the minimum distance and height necessary to meet safety
objectives in areas of heavy weed infestations
• Minimize soil disturbance and mineral soil exposure during activities. Soil disturbance should be no more than
needed to meet project objectives. This includes not exceeding recommended mineral soil exposure for site
preparation in regeneration harvest units; and utilizing timing and designated skid trails to minimize mineral soil
exposure in harvest units.

• Survey proposed burn units for noxious weeds. Determine the risk of weed spread with prescribed fire. If there is
a risk of spread beyond the road corridor, defer burning until the weeds can be treated or ensure post treatment
funding for weed control.
• Survey proposed access for mechanized in stream for noxious weeds. Determine the risk of spread with the
associated activity. If there is risk of spread, pre-treat the area before activity.
• Continue to monitor/survey the analysis area for new invader weed species. Monitor weed population levels in
treated areas, with particular emphasis on haul routes, stored and decommissioned roads, and landings. Retreat as
funding allows.
• Treat and sign sites if new invaders are located and defer ground disturbing activities within those sites until the
weed specialist determines the site is no longer a threat, and approves those activities.
• Site-specific guidelines will be followed for weed treatments within or adjacent to known sensitive plant
populations. All future treatment sites will be evaluated for sensitive plan habitat suitability; suitable habitats will
be surveyed as necessary prior to treatment.
• All noxious weed control activities will comply with state and local laws and agency guidelines.
• As per the 2007 KNF Invasive Plant Management EIS and ROD, all herbicides used in the analysis area will be
applied according to the labeled rates and recommendations to ensure the protection of surface water, ecological
integrity and public health and safety. Herbicide selection will be based on target species on the site, site factors
(such as soil types, distance to water, etc.), and with the objective to minimize impacts to non-target species.
• Design road storage to allow passage of a 4-wheeler to continue treatment of hawkweeds and common tansy in
the future. Hawkweed and common tansy populations will continue to expand even after the template has revegetated.
• Keep administrative traffic on closed roads to a minimum. Whenever possible, time activities prior to seed set of
the primary weed species or emphasis weeds on a given road.
• Release bio-control agents on applicable sites, as they become available, and funding allows.
• Plan follow up noxious weed treatment the spring or early summer, following final purchaser blading of all haul
roads if funds allow (this will be funded with appropriated or KV dollars).
• Burning and Noxious Weed Spread: A decision matrix will be developed to address weed concerns and to
prioritize the units for burning based on desired objectives of the burning. This decision matrix will identify
potential weed concerns and identify target habitat enhancement or fuel reduction objectives. This way weed
control efforts can focus on particular species prior and post-burning.
• Design road storage to allow passage of a 4-wheeler to continue treatment of hawkweeds and common tansy in
the future. Hawkweed and common tansy populations will continue to expand even after the template has revegetated.

Burning and Noxious Weed Spread
A decision matrix will be developed to address weed concerns and to prioritize the units for burning based on
desired objectives of the burning. This decision matrix will identify potential weed concerns and identify target
habitat enhancement or fuel reduction objectives. This way weed control efforts can focus on particular species
prior and post-burning.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pile Burning Emissions
The amount of smoke emissions, resulting from prescribed burning of natural and activity fuels will be mitigated by
four general methods: fuel loading reduction, reduction in the amount of fuel consumed, flaming combustion
optimization, and impact avoidance.
Fuel Loading Reduction: The KNF has encouraged, through sale contract provisions, utilization of submerchantable material. Purchasers may be required to pay for, and therefore encouraged to utilize, top wood
smaller than the normal utilization standard. These measures help decrease the amount of woody fuel, thus
reducing the amount of smoke produced during burning.
Reduction in the Amount of Fuel Consumed: The reduction of the amount of fuel consumed by prescribed
burning will be accomplished by burning under higher fuel moisture conditions as long as it still makes these fuels
less available for consumption, thereby reducing the fuel consumed. Sometimes this can be part of the resource
objective to retain coarse woody debris on the site.
Flaming Combustion Optimization: Methods that increasing the flaming combustion phase will be used when
prescribed burning is determined to be the most appropriate fuel treatment. Concentration of logging slash by
whole tree yarding or excavator piling increases the amount of material consumed during flaming combustion and
also allows material to be burned in the late fall when the risk of escape is low. Purchasers are required to
Page 28 of 40

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

construct piles so they are compact and free of excess soil.
Impact Avoidance: Smoke impact avoidance will be accomplished through daily monitoring of airshed
conditions. Burns will be coordinated with Montana/Idaho Smoke Monitoring Unit. This will help ensure smoke
impacts are minimized and burning only occurs when dispersion is forecasted to be good and cumulative effects
are not likely.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Forest Vegetation:
In addition to the appropriate BMPs, riparian guidelines and standard contract clauses, the following management
measures and monitoring will be included:
a. All harvest units will retain 7-30 tons per acre of downed woody material (or recruitment) greater than 3” in
diameter to provide nutrient recycling and habitat for mammals and invertebrates. The volume and distribution of
material may be subject to specific site conditions such as within the wildland urban interface. The tons retained
by VRU are described previously in Table 3.11.
b. All harvest units will be designed to retain adequate levels of replacement snags to provide for cavity-associated
wildlife species, genetic seed reservoirs, relic overstory, and long-term soil productivity. Replacement trees will
be scattered throughout harvest units to the extent possible. A minimum of 8-10 replacement snags per acre will
be retained. Where not consistent with your description of a clearcut with 4-8 trees retained possible within safety
requirements, sound snags may be marked for retention. If they are felled for safety purposes, they will be
retained on site. Silvicultural and burning prescriptions will be prepared with the goal of protecting large diameter
relic trees, during site preparation and fuels treatment.
c. A marking review will be performed by a silviculturist on a minimum of 10% of proposed units to ensure marking
guides are being implemented as per the prescription.
d. All tractor harvest units with an intermediate harvest prescription will have designated skid trails to facilitate
removal of designated material while minimizing damage to less than 15% of the residual trees.
e. Harvest treatments will be designed to mimic natural process, and marking guides will emphasize working with
existing stand structures, and will not result in a uniform or evenly spaced residual stand or an evenly spaced seed
trees or relic trees.
f. If insect activity is present in the area, prescribed fire in dryland types may be postponed to a later date to give the
residual trees time to recover.
g. Spring burns in the dryland types will be implemented before the ponderosa pine and bunchgrass are actively
growing to minimize damage to native grasses.
h. Maintain old growth characteristics within old growth character stands (Green et al, 1992; USDA Forest Service,
1987a).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wildlife:
Minimize Disturbance to Raptors: If raptor-nesting territories are observed, avoid disturbance when possible,
during the nesting/fledgling period (5/15-8/15). Include in sale contract if sites are known prior to selling. Consult
with Wildlife Biologist on specific buffers and disturbance period dates. Utilize this criterion specifically on Unit
Page 29 of 40

68 for Alternative 2 - Pre-sale and harvest – all alternatives.
Protect Cripple Horse Goshawk Nest:
1. No management activities should occur within 0.5 miles of nest area (as mapped) between 3/1 and 8/30;
2. Route helicopter flights away from nest site and PFA as shown on territory maps (Project File).
3. Activities greater than ½ mile from the nest site should not occur until after July 15th or prior to April 1 (also see
Criterion #2).
All criteria applicable to all alternatives for pre-sale, during and post-sale activities.
Maintain Cavity-Nesting Habitat: Where snag numbers are insufficient to meet snag levels by VRU (identified in
the Snag Section at the 100% level) existing DF, WL and PP snags greater than 10" dbh and 10 feet in height will
be marked and protected during timber harvest and site preparation as long as safety requirements are met.
Merchantable trees (live or dead) will be reserved (Provisions CT2.3# and CT6.32#) C2.3# and C6.32# -provisions were never intend for snags – intended for superior seed trees, research trees or high value wildlife
trees (nest trees)). C6.32# - requires liquated damages ($) for damage. Not advisable to use if snag levels are still
not met. If felled for safety, they will be left on site. Maintain the largest snags first. Favor trees further than one
tree length from the road prism or any external boundary - Pre-sale and harvest – all alternatives.
Provide for Future Cavity-Nesting Habitat, Down Woody Habitat Recruitment, and Structural Diversity:
KNF snag management protocol will be utilized to provide adequate snags for wildlife habitat. Units in MA 15
will be managed at the 40% level as prescribed in the KNFP. All other MAs will be managed at the 100% cavity
habitat effectiveness level. Pre-sale – all alternatives.
Leave Tree Protection: Evenly distribute slash to protect leave trees. Pre-sale - all alternatives.
Maintain Winter Range Integrity: Restrict mechanized activities associated with logging and slashing off Roads
4885, 4886, 6271, 4916 (Dec. 1 – June 30); 6274, 4908A/B (Oct 15 – June 30); 4890, 5298 Sept 1 – May 30) to
be consistent with the Road Closures as shown and applicable. Pre-sale, harvest and site prep – all alternatives.
Winter logging will be required in Unit 1 in Alternative 2 and Units 1, 1A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 3A, 9, 10, 17, 28, 157,
158, 158A, 190, 194T, 169, COE1and COE3 for Alternative 3.
Provide for Wildlife Security: Determine the time of road restrictions involved with timber sales in the pre-sale
roundtable discussion. Implement new road restrictions after timber harvest where applicable and maintain
existing restrictions to the public during all operations. Pre-sale, Post-sale – all alternatives. This criterion could
vary by MA (e.g. summer range versus winter range) and could be influenced by other management boundaries
such as Bears Outside Recovery Zone (BORZ). Generally, roads entering into or within these management
boundaries will not be open to the public while treatment activities are occurring.
Meet Standards and Guides of the Lynx Amendment for Management in Lynx Habitat: including use of
prescribed fire. Prior to activity - Alternative 3 as described in effects analysis, Chapter 3 of this document. If
these are for alts, need to correct the PA.
Meet ESA Requirements: If critical habitat is identified during implementation of the proposed activities, special
protection measures will be implemented by including provision CT6.251 in all applicable timber sale contract
packages. This provision is mandatory. Contract prep and logging – all alternatives.
Maintain Minimum/All Associated Old Growth Characteristics within Old Growth Character Stands (Green
Et Al, 1992; USDA Forest Service, 1987a): In the MA 13 portions of Units F1OG, F3OG, F11OG, F13OG,
F14OG and F15OG no merchantable material will be removed. Outside MA 13 in these units, products (e.g.
biomass) may be removed. Harvest Prescription, Sale Prep – Alternative 2. Ensure burning is planned to minimize
impact on the large old tree component and subsequent risk of insect infestation. May want to defer burning until
MPB population has subsided.
Protect Specialized Wildlife Habitats: Protect currently unknown (not mapped) specialized habitats (e.g. wetlands,
fens, bogs, elk wallows, nests, etc.) found during timber sale preparation activities with appropriate buffers. When
new sites are found consult wildlife biologist, fish biologist or hydrologist for direction. Pre-sale and during
activities – all alternatives.
Temporary Roads within the Tobacco BORZ: Portion of the East reservoir Analysis area will be returned to
contour immediately following harvest and slash activities (units) or within one active bear year (4/1 to 11/30),
unless unforeseen circumstances (e.g. weather) prevents completion of the treatment units accessed by these
temporary roads. Temporary roads needed for another work season will be closed with the appropriate restriction
device (i.e. rods, gate, earth barrier, etc.).

Heritage Resources:
Heritage resource surveys were completed on all treatment units. The action alternatives were designed to protect
known cultural sites, provide for protection of sites discovered during implementation, and protect treaty rights.
These concerns will be addressed through ongoing consultation with tribal representatives. Appropriate Timber
Sale Contract Provisions will be included in any timber sale contract. The appropriate provision specifies that the
Forest Service may modify or cancel the contract to protect cultural resources, regardless of when they were
identified.
Winter logging will be required for Unit 1 in Alternative 2, and Units 1 and 1A for Alternative 3.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scenic Resource:
To meet visual quality objectives the following measures will be taken:
Units 2, 3, 6, 16, 18 – High level of slash disposal along Highway 37.
Units 7, 8, 59, 62, 80, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151 – 10 to 12 trees/acres leave trees in unit.
Units 41, 81 – Leave tree islands (1 – 2 acres) left in unit.
Unit 6 – 10 to 15 tress/acre leave trees in unit.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
U.S. Corps of Engineer Land: The following BMP must be employed within the boundary of recorded
archaeological sites and/or in areas where additional archaeological identification work cannot be completed prior to
project implementation.
A) Soil and duff moistures must be high enough to prevent thermal damage to artifacts that may be present in the
lower duff layers or soil. Duff moistures of greater than 120% tend not to burn (Timmons, et al. 1996);
consequently, the burn shall take place in the spring and/or late fall when conditions favor high duff moistures.
B) Any stumps within recorded archaeological sites that will be burned must be protected by wetting or foaming
prior to ignition.
C) To keep excavation of soil to a minimum, control lines for prescribed burn operations must be located on
existing roads, trails, topographical breaks, and any other natural barriers. Wet lines and/or foam lines are
strongly recommended.
D) Slash piling, for the purpose of burning, will not occur within recorded archaeological sites. Many areas on
COE fee owned land considered high probability: Slash piling, for the purpose of burning, shall be avoided
where feasible.
E) Mechanical timber harvest must be done on frozen ground within recorded archaeological sites and high
probability areas and in accordance he following stipulations.
1. Logging must be performed over frozen ground or over an accumulation of a minimum of one foot of
compacted snow.
2. A rubber-tired skidder shall be used.
3. Logs will be limbed at the stump.
4. Dispersed skidding.
5. Logging landings shall be designated in areas outside of recorded archaeological sites and high probability
areas. Landings will be clearly delineated by the COE archaeologist on the ground for the sale administrator
and the contractor.
6. Slash piling will not occur within any recorded archaeological sites or high probability areas. Appropriate
areas must be clearly delineated by the COE archaeologist on the ground for the sale administrator and the
contractor.

Appendix 4: Forest Plan Amendments
East Reservoir Project-Specific Amendment #1
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-64, in Management Area 15 (MA15) is modified for Recreation
Standard #4 – meeting Visual Quality Objective of maximum modification.
Unit 40 (156 acres) is proposed as an over 40 acre regeneration harvest, but does not mimic the large historic
patch size of 5,000 to 100,000 acres. However, it is placed adjacent to past harvests that are recovered, but are
within the early-successional stage. By these units being blocked up with other early-successional stages, this
larger block mimics historic conditions and will move into the future as a connected patch of interior forest
(DEIS, Vegetation Report, p. 45, 46, 47). Even though the unit will be viewed from a SL3 (Significance
Level 3 = very low) road, visually, due to large unit size, position of unit (face terrain), low number of leave
trees (seedtree harvest, 93% of canopy removed) the proposed treatment would not meet KNFP standards of
maximum modification for scenic resources (FEIS, Ch.3, pg. 367).
Unit 75 (36 acre shelterwood) sits next to Unit 188 (40 acre seedtree) creating an opening in excess of 40 acres. This
treatment would be effective at reducing hazardous fuels, reducing crown fire potential, and improving fire
suppression efficacy. Separately, these units meet QVOs but they are located adjacent to each other on the ground
making a 76 acres seedtree/shelterwood harvest which removes 90% of the canopy. Due to large unit size, position
of unit, low number of leave trees, the proposed treatment would not meet KNFP standards of maximum
modification for scenic resources (FEIS, Ch.3, pg. 370, 372). This area is a very low visual significance level.
Unit 147 (93 acre seedtree), Unit 148 (77 acre seedtree), Unit 149 (65 acre seedtree) and Unit 150 (103 acre
seedtree) are proposed for over 40 acre regeneration harvests. These units were designed to tie in with past
regeneration harvests to simulate a fire that would have burned from the creek bottom to the ridge top due to
continuous fuels and favorable topography. Treatments of this scale are more likely to disrupt large fire growth and
spread and assist in the efficacy of suppression efforts when a fire occurs in these areas. Fire modeling indicates
these areas are at risk of experiencing stand-replacing crown fire behavior if left untreated. With regard to wildlife,
this strategy may result in openings that may not be fully utilized by elk as foraging areas, however, creating these
openings reduces edge effect and fragmentation that would occur with greater number of openings of lesser acreage.
When considered in combination with existing adjacent openings on National Forest System lands these
regeneration harvests will create six openings larger than 40 acres in size. Opening sizes will decrease over
time as regeneration is established and grows. It was estimated that regeneration openings will be
hydrologically recovered when they are approximately 25-30 years old. By the time a regeneration opening is
this old, the conifer regeneration is tall enough to maintain enough canopy cover above the average winter
snow depths to moderate rates of snow melt. The time required to realize hydrologic recovery is longer than the
recovery needs of other resources and is therefore the most conservative estimate of recovery for openings
caused by even-aged regeneration harvest.
Alternative 2 with Modifications will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seedtree and/or shelterwood
prescription in concert with exceeding 40 acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Treatment of these units supports
purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to
disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change.

BENEFITING RESOURCE

Wildlife: Reduce edge effect and fragmentation by blocking up treatment areas
together versus 40 acre blocks.
Wildlife: Creating openings over 40 acres better approximates the patch size
and pattern of habitat that would have been available under natural processes
and reduce edge effect and fragmentation that would occur with a greater
number of openings of lesser acreage.
Wildlife: species associated with less edge effect and interior forest- creating
openings over 40 acres better approximates the patch size and pattern of habitat
that would have been available under natural processes and reduce edge effect
and fragmentation that would occur with a greater number of openings of lesser
acreage.
Fuels: Reduce fuels and provide a fuel break immediately adjacent to a major
power transmission line. By locating the units adjacent to past treatments they
will be more effective at disrupting large fire growth and be more conducive to
fire control actions.

East Reservoir Project

Draft Record of Decision

The Forest Plan states, “If it is determined during project design that the best way to meet the goals of the Forest
Plan conflicts with a Forest Plan standard, the Forest Supervisor may approve an exception to that standard for the
project”
This project-specific amendment allows achievement of the overall Forest Plan goal for MA15 which is timber
production using various standard silviculture practices while providing for other resource values such as soil, air,
water, wildlife, recreation and forage for domestic livestock (FP, Vol. 1, pg. III-64).
Project-specific amendments must comply with the National Environmental policy Act procedures. Compliance
with these procedures and rationale for this project-specific amendment is contained in the East Reservoir Project
DEIS, FEIS and draft ROD.

************************************************************************************
Project Specific Amendment #2:
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-48, in Management Area 12 (MA12) is modified for Recreation
Standard #2 – meeting Visual Quality Objective of maximum modification in areas of low visual significance,
modification in areas of moderate visual significance, and partial retention in areas of high visual significance,
unless infeasible when attempting to meet the goals of the management area.
Unit #362 (192 acres) cannot meet MA 12 visuals direction because it is planned for regeneration treatment
(clearcut) to exceed 40 acres with the resulting visual quality objective (VQO) of unacceptably moderate (FEIS,
Ch.3, pg. 373) due to reducing tree canopy from fully stocked to a clearcut.
Treatment of Unit 362 supports purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are
more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental
conditions such as climate change.
When considered in combination with existing adjacent openings on National Forest System lands these
regeneration harvests will create six openings larger than 40 acres in size. Opening sizes will decrease over
time as regeneration is established and grows. It was estimated that regeneration openings will be
hydrologically recovered when they are approximately 25-30 years old. By the time a regeneration opening is
this old, the conifer regeneration is tall enough to maintain enough canopy cover above the average winter
snow depths to moderate rates of snow melt. The time required to realize hydrologic recovery is longer than the
recovery needs of other resources and is therefore the most conservative estimate of recovery for openings
caused by even-aged regeneration harvest.
Alternative 2 with Modifications will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seedtree and/or shelterwood
prescription in concert with exceeding 40 acre limitation as directed by NFMA. Treatment of these units supports
purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are more resistant and resilient to
disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental conditions such as climate change.

Project Specific Amendment #4:
The Kootenai National Forest Plan, page III-49, is modified for Wildlife and Fish Standard #7- to maintain
movement corridors of at least two site distances (400 feet) between openings, and generally not to exceed openings
over 40 acres.
Alternative 2 proposes one unit with acreage on MA12 land that result in openings that do not meet this standard.
Unit 362 (clearcut) results in a 192 acre opening on MA12. Therefore, a site-specific KNFP amendment is necessary
for this unit.
Treatment of Unit 362 supports the purpose and need statement to re-establish, restore and retain landscapes that are
more resistant and resilient to disturbance (insect and disease infestations, fire) and uncertain environmental
conditions such as climate change.
Alternative 2 with Modifications will reduce tree canopy from fully stocked to a seedtree and/or shelterwood
prescription in concert with exceeding 40 acre limitation as directed by NFMA. While local movement of big game
may be affected as a result of one 192 acre unit, one unit results in less edge effect than a number of units (in this
case up to five units at 40 acres each) with forested corridors of 600 feet separating the units. Reducing edge effect
is favorable for many resident species including goshawks, varoius woodpeckers, fisher, and once the 192 unit reestablishes hiding cover (approximately 15 years) a large block of uniform interior forest will result for those species
more associated with interior forest habitats.

Draft Record of Decision

Amendment #4 amends the edge effect and movement corridors in MA 12. One 192 acre unit results in less edge
effect than a number of units (in this case up to five units at 40 acres each) with forested corridors of 600 feet
separating the units. Reducing edge effect is favorable for many resident species, such as fisher, brown creeper,
goshawk and lynx, and once the 192 unit re-establishes hiding cover (approximately 15 years) a large block of
uniform interior forest will result for those species more associated with interior forest habitats. Contrarily, edge
creation is beneficial to many other hawk species such as red-tails and other birds including black-headed cowbirds
for both foraging and nesting . Any edge creation will benefit these species in the 15 to 30 years immediately
following harvest. However as time progresses, these larger patch sizes and subsequent interior forest development
will become more beneficial to those interior species listed previously by creating areas for movement, nesting,
rearing and foraging.
