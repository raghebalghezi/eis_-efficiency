The proposed exchange includes the transfer of one 344.24-acre parcel of federal land into private ownership and 18 parcels, totaling 1,719.32 acres, of private land into federal ownership. The land to be transferred to the USFS includes one 110.57-acre parcel to the ASNFs; eleven parcels totaling 1,153.18 acres to the CNF; one 11.15-acre parcel to the PNF; and five parcels totaling 444.42 acres to the TNF. The proposal to exchange lands responds to the USFS’s need for consolidation of federal land ownership patterns. Non-federal lands within national forests that are included in this exchange proposal are surrounded by national forest system lands and contain special features and habitats such as wildlife species habitat and perennial waters. The non-federal lands are also classified as desirable for acquisition because they contribute to an undesirable ownership pattern across the forests, making management of surrounding national forest system land more challenging. Table of Contents Abstract ........................................................................................................................................... i Acronyms and Abbreviations ..................................................................................................... vii Executive Summary ..................................................................................................................... ix Document Structure ..................................................................................................................... xi Chapter 1.

The federal land proposed for exchange is located in Navajo County and the non-federal lands proposed for exchange are located in Cochise, Gila, Graham, Maricopa, Navajo, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Yavapai Counties. The USFS units the parcels lie within are the Lakeside Ranger District on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs); the Douglas, Nogales, Safford, Santa Catalina, and Sierra Vista Ranger Districts on the Coronado National Forest (CNF); the Bradshaw Ranger District on the Prescott National Forest (PNF); and the Cave Creek, Pleasant Valley, and Tonto Basin Ranger Districts on the Tonto National Forest (TNF). The proposal to exchange lands responds to the USFS’s need for consolidation of federal land ownership patterns. Non-federal lands within national forests that are included in this exchange proposal are land parcels that break up USFS ownership requiring the USFS to manage around these lands. They also contain special features such as critical habitat and perennial waters. These land parcels are available for future development that could diminish the value of those resources and support activities that would be incompatible with the surrounding national forest character. Due to these characteristics, these lands are identified as desirable for acquisition by the USFS. The federal land parcel also meets criteria of the 2015 ASNFs Land Management Plan that make it desirable for exchange as it is an isolated parcel surrounded by private land on three sides and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation on the fourth side. It also lacks many of the characteristics of desirable and suitable National Forest System (NFS) land and requires administrative oversight of several uses that must be authorized to occur on NFS land. Management direction states that lands proposed for exchange by the USFS would provide for consolidation of public lands, improve management of or benefit specific resources, and meet overriding public needs including that of expanding communities. The federal lands, if conveyed, could be subject to development. However, the stated intent of the proponent is to continue operating the Camp Tatiyee youth camp at its current site on the parcel if the land is conveyed.  Preliminary issues identified with this proposal include concerns over the loss of opportunity for the continued use of the ASNFs land for wildlife viewing and recreation by residents living in the area adjacent to the federal parcel and concerns regarding the effect of possible future development of the federal parcel. At this time, the alternatives under consideration include taking no action or exchanging lands among those analyzed in the Proposed Action dependent on final appraisal and value equalization. The EIS analyzes the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future activities on both private and NFS lands are considered in the analysis. The EIS also includes discussion of site-specific mitigation. Major conclusions include: The proposed and preferred alternative would result in federal acquisition of up to 1,719.32 acres of private land in the national forests of Arizona and conveyance of up to 344.24 acres of federal land within the incorporated Town of Pinetop-Lakeside in the ASNFs. If the exchange occurs, the non-federal lands exchanged would no longer be subject to potential development but would instead be incorporated into the appropriate USFS management area and regime. The conveyed federal lands would be subject to future development. However, the stated intent of the proponent is to maintain and improve the youth camp, which has been operated on a portion of the parcel since 1958. If developments were to occur, no riparian habitat, aquatic or wetland habitat would be impacted because these habitats do not naturally exist on the federal lands proposed for exchange. Future uses or development on the lands conveyed out of federal ownership would become subject to all applicable laws, regulations, and zoning authorities of state and local governing bodies. If the no action alternative were selected, the federal lands would continue to be managed by the USFS. The non-federal lands, which include special features and habitats such as critical habitat and perennial waters, would remain subject to future development. Based on the potential effects of the alternatives analyzed in this EIS and finalization of the appraisal and value equalization of lands, the Forest Supervisor, ASNFs (the responsible official), will decide whether or not to exchange lands, what lands within this analysis will be exchanged, and whether or not cash equalization will be included as part of the exchange package.Document Structure The United States (U.S.) Forest Service (USFS) has prepared this Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other relevant federal and state laws and regulations. This FEIS discloses the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts that would result from implementation of the proposed action and alternatives. The document is organized into six chapters: Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action: This chapter includes information on the purpose of and need for the project, the decision framework; the main laws, regulations, and policy that apply to the project; public notification and involvement; SHPO and tribal consultation; and issues identified through public and tribal involvement. Chapter 2. Alternatives, including the Proposed Action: This chapter provides a detailed description of the proposed action (preferred alternative) and a no action alternative as well as alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study and the reasons for their elimination. Alternatives considered were developed based on the purpose and need and in consideration of issues raised by the public and tribes. This chapter also includes mitigation measures of the proposed action and provides a summary table comparing each alternative. Chapter 3. Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences: This chapter describes existing conditions and the potential environmental consequences from implementation of the proposed action and no action alternative. This analysis is organized by resource area. Chapter 4. Other Considerations Required Under NEPA: This chapter describes short-term uses and long-term productivity; unavoidable adverse effects; irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources; cumulative effects; and other required disclosures. Chapter 5. Consultation and Coordination: This chapter provides a list of preparers who worked on this EIS or related documents and agencies consulted during the development of the environmental impact statement (EIS). Chapter 6. References: This chapter lists the references referred to throughout this analysis. Appendices. The appendices provide more detailed information to support the analyses presented in the FEIS. Additional documentation, including further detailed analyses of certain project-area resources, such as cultural resources, may be found in the administrative record located at the Lakeside Ranger District, 2022 West White Mountain Boulevard, Lakeside, Arizona 85929. Some of this documentation is included in this FEIS by reference. Chapter 1. Purpose of and Need for Action Purpose and Need The United States (U.S.) Forest Service (USFS) currently owns a section of land (344.24 acres) on the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) that is challenging to manage because (1) it is an isolated parcel, surrounded by private land on three sides and the Fort Apache Indian Reservation on the fourth side; (2) it requires more administrative oversight because other authorized uses, including the Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace Youth Camps and several utility and irrigation rights of way, are also located on the parcel and must be overseen by the USFS, and (3) it lacks many of the characteristics of desirable and suitable National Forest System (NFS) land.  The USFS also currently has to manage around several isolated private land parcels lying within the Prescott National Forest (PNF), ASNFs, Tonto National Forest (TNF), and Coronado National Forest (CNF). Managing around these parcels makes management of NFS land in those areas more complicated, costly, and less efficient. These private parcels also include special features, wildlife species critical habitat, perennial waters, and other forest resources and characteristics of desirable and suitable NFS land. These resources are at risk of possible future loss or use that differs from surrounding NFS land management uses if the parcels remain under current private ownership.  The USFS needs (1) reduced administrative oversight of the section of USFS land where special use permits have increased over the years and (2) consolidated contiguous federal land ownership patterns on NFS lands, particularly on proclaimed Arizona national forests, specifically the PNF, ASNFs, TNF, and CNF, with land containing resources and characteristics of desirable and suitable NFS land and excluding land no longer suitable for NFS land management. Further detailed information that informed the purpose and need for and development of this project is found in the Forest Plans Compliance section and the affected environment sections in Chapter 3, which provides more details on the land parcels proposed for exchange. Decision Framework The responsible official for making a decision on this project is the ASNFs Forest Supervisor. The Forest Supervisor will review the alternatives considered in Chapter 2 and the environmental consequences in Chapter 3 in consideration of the purpose and need in order to make an informed decision. The final decision may include implementation of the proposed action with exchange of all lands analyzed for exchange with or without cash equalization to equal the value of lands exchanged (as explained under the Land Exchange Process section), the proposed action with exchange of some of the lands analyzed with or without cash equalization, or the no action alternative leaving lands under current ownership and management. Applicable Laws, Regulations, Policy, and Agency Direction This project is compliant with all applicable laws, regulations, policy and Agency direction including the major applicable laws identified below: Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976: Requires that public lands be managed in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archaeological values; that, where appropriate, will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition; that will provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife and domestic animals; and that will provide for outdoor recreation and human occupancy and use. Also states that the United States shall receive fair market value of the use of public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided for by law. General Exchange Act of 20 March 1922: Permitted the United States Secretary of the Interior to accept or acquire lands outside of the boundaries of current national parks deemed to be of national-forest purposes interest. Federal land could also be exchanged for privately owned land within the boundaries of United States National Forest. The law permits acquisition of lands by exchange, encumbered by reservations of timber, or minerals or easements that would not interfere with use of the lands for National Forest purposes. Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 20 August 1988: Outlines the types of land desired for acquisition, specifically inholdings; identification of inholdings and their prioritization, and provides direction on the processes for notification of acquiring such land and direction on disposing of federal land. Directs that the Secretary shall not acquire lands contaminated by hazardous substances or that are difficult or uneconomic to manage due to location or other characteristics. National Environmental Policy Act of January 1, 1970: Directs all Federal agencies to consider and report the potential environmental impacts of proposed Federal actions and established the Council on Environmental Quality. Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended: Authorizes the determination and listing of species as endangered and threatened; prohibits unauthorized taking, possession, sale, and transport of endangered species; authorizes the assessment of civil and criminal penalties for violating the act or regulations; and, authorizes the payment of rewards to anyone furnishing information leading to arrest and conviction for any violation of the act or any regulation issued thereunder. Section 7 of the act requires Federal agencies to use their authorities to carry out programs for the conservation of endangered and threatened species and to insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. National Historic Preservation Act: Sets forth the Federal government’s policy to preserve and protect historical and cultural resources. This act states that the historical and cultural foundations of the Nation should be preserved as a living part of the Nation’s community life and development in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people. Directs all Federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings (actions, financial support, and authorizations) on properties included in or eligible for the National Register. Establishes inventory, nomination, protection, and preservation responsibilities for federally owned historic properties. As amended extends the policy in the Historic Sites Act to state and local historical sites as well as those of national significance, expands the National Register of Historic Places, establishes the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the State Historic Preservation Officers, and requires agencies to designate Federal preservation officers. Establishes criteria for designating tribal historic preservation officers to assume the functions of a state historic preservation officer on tribal lands. Archaeological Resources Protection Act: The act establishes permit requirements for removal or excavation of archaeological resources from Federal and Indian lands. Provides criminal and civil penalties for the unauthorized excavation, removal, damage, alteration, defacement, or the attempted unauthorized removal, damage, alteration, or defacement of any archaeological resource, more than 100 years of age, found on Federal or Indian lands. Prohibits the sale, purchase, exchange, transportation, receipt, or offering of any archaeological resource obtained from public lands or Indian lands. The act further directs Federal land managers to survey land under their control for archaeological resources and create public awareness programs concerning archaeological resources. American Indian Religious Freedom Act: Protects and preserves for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians including, but not limited to, access to sites, use, and possession of sacred objects and the freedom to worship through ceremonial and traditional rites. Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 (NAGPRA) (25 USC 3001): Provides a process for Federal agencies to return Native American human remains, funerary objects, and sacred objects to the ancestors and appropriate Native American tribe. Includes provisions for the intentional excavation and unanticipated discovery of Native American cultural items on Federal and tribal lands, and penalties for noncompliance and illegal trafficking. The act requires agencies to identify holdings of such remains and objects and to work with appropriate Native American groups toward their repatriation. Forest Plans Compliance The LMPs of all four involved forests provide direction on lands to acquire and exchange. The ASNFs and the PNF recently finalized new LMPs, the ASNFs in August of 2015 and the PNF in June of 2015. The CNF and TNF are developing new LMPs but manage under the current plans in place, the CNF under the 1986 plan and the TNF under the 1985 plan. Following direction of the plans, land adjustments (e.g. exchanges, purchases) should be completed to help consolidate the NFS land base, reduce administrative problems and costs, enhance public access and use, and support resource management objectives. All four of the applicable LMPs were reviewed to determine if land parcels considered meet criteria of land desirable for acquisition or conveyance. The non-federal land parcels were determined to be desirable for acquisition as follows criteria from the applicable plan and the federal parcel desirable for conveyance as follows criteria in the LMP for the ASNFs. Applicable criteria reviewed from the four current forest plans is listed below and includes issues, concerns, and opportunities; goals and objectives; standards and guidelines; and management prescriptions and direction. Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (2015) • The Apache-Sitgreaves NFs exist in a pattern that promotes efficient management which consists of large contiguous tracts of NFS lands (design criteria). • Land exchanges should not result in the creation of isolated NFS parcels surrounded by other ownerships (guideline). • Land acquisitions and exchanges should evaluate, and possibly include, associated beneficial encumbrances (e.g., water rights, mineral rights, easements, instream flow) (guideline). • Land adjustments (e.g., exchanges, purchases) help to consolidate the NFS land base, reduce administrative problems and costs, enhance public access and use, and support resource management objectives. Management emphasis is to work with local communities to understand their community expansion needs and retain access to NFS land. The Apache-Sitgreaves NFs work with communities during development of their master plans and with communities, developers, and homeowner groups to retain legal access to public lands (e.g., easements, trailheads).  NFS lands that are made available for exchange generally meet one or more of the following criteria: (1) isolated tracts or scattered parcels that cannot be efficiently managed, (2) recreation residence tracts, (3) provide for consolidation of public lands, (4) improve management or benefit specific resources, or (5) overriding public needs. Lands desirable for acquisition generally meet one or more of the following criteria: (1) lands that contain vital species habitat or vital wildlife habitat (e.g., calving areas, critical winter range); (2) lands needed for developed or dispersed recreation; (3) wetlands, riparian areas, and other water oriented lands; (4) lands that contain unique natural or cultural values; (5) lands that improve public land management, meet specified administrative needs, or benefit other NFS programs; (6) lands that provide needed access, protect public lands from fire or trespass, or prevent damage to public land resources; (7) lands that are needed to consolidate public landownership or meet research needs; (8) lands that are needed to meet programs prescribed or endorsed by acts or reports of Congress or the Department of Agriculture; (9) inholdings that contain needed access; or (10) undeveloped inholdings. When acquired, lands are evaluated for suitability (chapter 4) prior to being allocated for appropriate uses. (management approaches for lands) Coronado National Forest (1986) While the Coronado is substantially solid blocks of federal land, there are areas where lands Special Uses would be better suited for private uses or where administration is made more costly because of the ownership pattern. Conversely, some included private lands are of a National Forest character. Demand for a wide variety of special uses of the Forest continues to grow. Three issues are listed: 1. Revision of land ownership adjustment plans to update lands desirable for acquisition and available for disposal.  • Use land ownership adjustment to accomplish resource management objectives.  • Capitalize on opportunities to consolidate small private land holdings into economically viable units through land ownership adjustment.  • Recognize, in the periodic review of Forest land ownership adjustment planning, the public benefits to be gained and the effect of the planning on land adjacent to the Coronado National Forest. • Take actions necessary to determine status of NFS lands and interests in lands. • Acquire lands or interest in lands through exchange, purchase or donation in accordance with the Forest Land Adjustment Classification Maps and criteria set forth in Table 11 • Make the following changes in the Forest Land Adjustment Program: a. East Whitetail Canyon (Chiricahua Mountains)  Reclassify approximately 183 acres of National Forest land as base-for-exchange.  Reclassify approximately 464 acres of private land from priority 3 for acquisition to undesirable for National Forest purposes. b. Holy Cross Area (Santa Catalina Mountains)  Reclassify approximately 340 acres of National Forest land as base-for-exchange. c. Summerhaven Area (Santa Catalina Mountains)  Reclassify approximately 41 acres of private land from priority 1 to priority 3 for acquisition. d. North and east side of Santa Rita Mountains. Reclassify approximately 2500 acres of National Forest land as base-for-exchange. • Exchanges should result in an improved forest land ownership pattern. • Emphasize acquisition of water oriented property inside the National Forest boundary. This property provides much needed high density public recreation use as well as high value wildlife and fish habitat. • Attempt to acquire private land from willing sellers that will provide additional public recreational opportunities including open space. Acquisition will receive low priority Forest-wide. • Act on land exchange offers involving Priority 1 lands and the Administration most desirable Priority II lands to the extent possible. • Attempt to acquire private lands that will "fill in" ownership pattern, resulting in more effective management of National Forest lands. • Act on all exchange offers that appear to be in the public interest. • Act on all land exchange offers involving acquisition of private land. • To improve management and benefit the administration of the National Forest, certain private lands within or adjacent to the boundary of the Forest have been classified as desirable for acquisition. Because local and physical conditions may change during the life of this plan, the lands classified in this plan and others that may be considered, will meet one or more of the following criteria.   Lands within designated wildernesses.   Lands that contain vital threatened and endangered species habitat, or vital wildlife habitat (i.e. lambing areas).   Lands needed for developed and dispersed recreation.   Wet lands, riparian areas, and other water oriented lands.   Lands that contain unique, natural, or cultural values.   Lands that will improve public land management, meet specific administrative needs, or benefit other National Forest programs.   Lands that provide needed access, or protect public lands from fire, or trespass or prevent damage to public land resources.   Lands that need rehabilitation or stabilization to restore their productivity.   Lands that are needed to block up public land ownership or meet research needs.   Lands that are needed to meet programs prescribed or endorsed by acts, or reports of Congress, or the Department of Agriculture.   Acquire inholdings that contain needed rights-of-way and will contribute to the Forest Resource Management Base.  • The acquisition program will be achieved through purchase, exchange, and donation authorities. The Purchase Program Centers about the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act that designates that lands within the following categories are eligible for acquisition with L&WCFA funds:   Congressionally designated areas.   Wilderness.   Threatened and endangered species habitat.   Recreation acquisition composites and inholdings.  The basic goals of the composite program are to provide:   Lands needed for construction of public recreation facilities.  Lands needed for dispersed recreation and open space.   Protection of public recreation resources.  Prevention of private usurpation of public resources and facilities on nearby public lands.  The following table shows the approved and proposed L&WCFA composites:  Table 1. Approved and proposed recreation acquisition composites1/Coronado National Forest Composites  Date Approved  Acres Approved as desirable for Acquisition  New Acres Remaining  1980 Est. Cost of Lands (million $)  Madera  2/16/78  15.49  15.49  0.5  Santa Catalina  10/17/78   65.27  54.17  0.5  Huachuca Mountain  Proposed2  2174  2175  2.5  Dragoon Mountain  Proposed2  1463  1463  1.5  Chiricahua Mountain  Proposed2  6387  6387  8.0  1. Essentially all of the lands identified for acquisition with L&WCFA Funds are also eligible for acquisition by exchange or donations, and will be acquired by these authorities when the opportunity arises and when appropriate. 2. This RAC has been reviewed by the Regional Office and personnel of the U.S. Department of Interior. • The Land Exchange Program operates under several authorities and is the major land adjustment program that can be employed to acquire all of the lands that meet the acquisition criteria. The lands offered by the United States in a land exchange are tentatively classified as base-in-exchange. Because local and physical conditions may change during the life of this plan, those lands classified in this plan and any other that may be considered will generally meet one or more of the following criteria:  Lands needed to meet the needs of expanding communities.  Isolated tracts or scattered parcels that cannot be efficiently managed.  Provide consolidation of the public lands.  To improve management, benefit specific resources, or increase management efficiency.  To meet overriding public needs. Prescott National Forest (2015) In coordination with general factors to consider in 36 CFR 254.3(1), proposals for acquisition should meet one or more of the following criteria: • Lands within designated wilderness • Lands that contain important wildlife habitat, including that needed for species viability, such as habitat needed to maintain migration patterns or important habitat linkages • Wetlands, riparian areas, and other water oriented lands • Lands that contain unique, natural, or cultural values • Lands that provide needed access, protect public lands from fire or trespass, or prevent damage to resources Tonto National Forest Plan (1985) • Land ownership adjustments within and adjacent to local communities need a continuing emphasis to significantly increase efficiency in resource management and to satisfy the needs of expanding communities. The Plan provides for accomplishment of property boundary surveys, elimination of backlog rights-of-way surveys, and approximately 300 acres of land exchange per year. The base-for-exchange land is reduced by 4,500 acres near Payson and increased by 600 acres near Young. • Use land ownership adjustment to accomplish resource management objectives. Post identifiable property boundaries. • Review land classification and determine the need for land adjustment to meet management objectives of providing for community expansion and logical boundary adjustments. Per criteria of the four plans provided above, the proposed action would meet or move toward objectives, goals, standards, guidelines, and management direction of the four forest plans. The no action alternative would not contribute to but would also not detract from or move away from objectives, goals, standards, guidelines, and management direction of the forest plans as lands considered for exchange would remain in their current situation. Management area information of the different plans is discussed by each parcel proposed for exchange under the Land Use section in Chapter 3. Additional Documents/Requirements for Implementation For an exchange to occur under the proposed action, some additional documents are required. An exchange agreement must be signed by the parties involved to complete the exchange. This agreement would follow the decision made by the responsible official (see the Decision Framework section) and would include any necessary details pertinent to the exchange. Tribal Consultation Through the NEPA scoping process and Sections 101 and 106 of NHPA, nine tribes and one chapter were consulted about the proposed action. The tribes consulted were the Ft. McDowell Yavapai Nation, Navajo Nation, Pueblo of Zuni, Ramah Chapter of the Navajo Nation, San Carlos Apache Tribe, The Hopi Tribe, Tonto Apache Tribe, White Mountain Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Apache Nation, and the Yavapai-Prescott Tribes. Consultation was initiated in November 2006. The Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Pueblo of Zuni, and White Mountain Apache Tribe responded to the initial letter. In December 2006, as part of the consultation process for NHPA, the ASNFs sent another letter about the proposed land exchange to all affiliated tribes. A determination of adverse effect was made for all of the National Register-eligible sites that would be transferred out of federal ownership under the proposed action. The ASNFs received Arizona State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) concurrence of the determinations of eligibility and effect in December 2007 and Phase 1 data recovery was recommended for all eight sites. The Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Yavapai-Prescott Tribe, and the White Mountain Apache Tribe responded to the letter.  In June 2008, the ASNFs sent a follow-up letter to the White Mountain Apache Tribe, the Pueblo of Zuni, Yavapai-Prescott Tribe, and the Hopi Tribe requesting further input on the land exchange process and inviting tribal representatives to visit the proposed land exchange area. Over the course of the next five years, the project team developed a treatment plan for the cultural resources (refer to the Cultural Resources analysis in Chapter 3) and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). The MOA is between the US Forest Service Southwestern Region and the SHPO with the concurring parties the Pueblo of Zuni, LFA, and BC2 LLCs. It was signed by the main signatories the Regional Forester on 29 April 2014 and the SHPO on 18 June 2014 and the concurring parties LFA and BC2 LLCs on 2 September 2014. To date, the Pueblo of Zuni has not signed the MOA. Members of the Hopi tribe have expressed interest in continued consultation, reviewing and commenting on the treatment plan, reviewing and commenting on the data recovery report, and visiting the federal parcel, but have not been responsive to attempts by ASNFs personnel to schedule a tour over the last eight years. Members of the White Mountain Apache Tribe have expressed interest in visiting the exchange area and have attended several meetings and visited the area over the last few years. During one of the site visits in 2015, cultural staff of the White Mountain Apache Tribe discovered an Apache petroglyph at one of the sites and have expressed an interest in protecting/preserving the petroglyph. LFA and the Tribe agreed to protection measures and further discussion will be continuing. The Navajo Nation did not identify any concerns. ASNFs is continuing tribal consultation pursuant to 36 CFR 800. Public Involvement During the initial evaluation of the exchange as an Environmental Assessment (EA), the ASNFs initiated a public scoping process. A land exchange notice was published once per week for four consecutive weeks between 5 and 27 November 2007 in the newspapers serving the areas affected by this proposal: the White Mountain Independent (ASNFs), Arizona Daily Star/Tucson Citizen (CNF), Daily Courier (PNF), East Valley Tribune (TNF), and Payson Roundup newspapers. The board of supervisors in the counties containing federal and non-federal parcels, elected state representatives, tribal governments, and the Arizona Congressional Delegation were notified via mail. A scoping letter dated 30 October 2007 was mailed to adjacent landowners, potentially interested parties, and affected SUP holders who were believed may have an interest in or be affected by the project. The letter explained that interested parties should access the listing of the project on the ASNFs website to find a description of the lands being considered for exchange, the legal land descriptions of the parcels, and maps displaying their locations. Comments were requested by 15 December 2007. The analysis was moved to the level of an EIS from an EA and a Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was published in the Federal Register on 25 March 2010. In addition, notification included listing of the project in the ASNFs’ Quarterly Schedule of Proposed Actions; distribution of letters to individuals, organizations, and agencies who previously indicated interest in the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange; and communication with Tribes. News releases were also distributed inviting the public to an open house on the project held on 13 April 2010. News releases were distributed to the Arizona Republic (the regional newspaper of record), and each forest’s newspaper of record: the White Mountain Independent (ASNFs), Arizona Daily Star (CNF), Daily Courier (PNF), Arizona Capitol Times (TNF), and to other papers serving areas affected by this proposal: Tucson Citizen, Sierra Vista Herald, Nogales International, Eastern Arizona Courier, East Valley Tribune, and Payson Roundup. Supervisors in the counties containing federal and non-federal parcels, elected state representatives, tribal governments, and the Arizona Congressional Delegation were notified of the scoping meeting in a letter dated 31 March2010. Commenters were encouraged to contact the ASNFs concerning any questions about the proposed land exchange or to obtain additional information. Letters dated 1 June 2015 were sent to interested publics and agencies providing notification that a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) had been completed and was available for public review on the Forest project web page. The letters also provided notification of the expected publication of a Notice of Availability (NOA) of the DEIS in the Federal Register and information on an upcoming public meeting to be held 16 June 2015. The NOA was published 5 June 2015 initiating an official comment period that extended for 45 calendar days ending on 20 July 2015; Nine legal notices were also published in the newspaper of record for each ranger district and forest that had parcels included in the exchange: the White Mountain Independent, the Arizona Daily Star, Nogales International, Eastern Arizona Courier, Daily Dispatch, Daily Courier, Arizona Republic, Arizona Capitol Times, and Payson Roundup. These legal notices provided notification of the comment period and the availability of the DEIS, referencing the NOA for timeframe, and gave directions on how to provide comments on the DEIS. The public meeting held on 16 June 2015 had 17 members of the public sign in; ten of whom identified themselves as members of LFA and/or tied in to Camp Tatiyee. Comment forms were provided at the meeting to allow meeting attendees to provide comments on the project. Environmental Assessment Scoping Period During the EA scoping period in 2007, the ASNFs received 14 responses/inquiries. Several commenters expressed concern about effects to wildlife use/viewing, and concern about the continued use of the federal parcel for outdoor recreation by local residents. The DEIS provided analysis of effects of foreseeable future uses on the federal land to wildlife use/viewing and outdoor recreation should the land be conveyed to the proponent, and that analysis is included in Chapter 3 of this FEIS. Other comments expressed concern about the extent of possible future development on the federal parcel, excluding currently existing authorized land uses. The DEIS evaluated these concerns, and that analysis is a part of Chapter 3 of this FEIS. Environmental Impact Statement Scoping Period During the EIS scoping period, the ASNFs received 9 comments. Comments included notice from special use permit (SUP) holders who wish to establish easements on the Camp Tatiyee parcel if the land exchange is completed (Issue 3 under the Issues section). One commenter expressed concern that the land exchange was unbalanced and that there may be socioeconomic ramifications that would result from the transfer. Socioeconomic impacts associated with the balancing of federal and non-federal properties are analyzed in detail in Chapter 3 under Socioeconomics. One comment requested that the EIS address the future management of the non-federal parcels, including the habitat benefits and other resource concerns at issue on these parcels. Analysis of habitat benefits and related resource concerns is provided in Chapter 3, mainly under Plants, Fish, and Wildlife. One comment emphasized the importance of maintaining the Mogollon Rim Trail for public use (Issue 1 under the Issues section). Three comments expressed concern regarding loss of property values for landowners with property abutting the Camp Tatiyee parcel (Issue 2 under the Issues section). Draft Environmental Impact Statement Comment Period During the DEIS official 45-day comment period, the ASNFs received 16 comments. Comments included reiterations of SUP holders who wish to continue their permitted uses across the Camp Tatiyee parcels if the land exchange is completed; a request for additional analysis of development growth induction that may result from the exchange (any possible development of the parcel is analyzed in Chapter 3); questions regarding access to and across the Camp Tatiyee parcel, particularly relating to the Mogollon Rim Trail, which is discussed under the proposed action and analyzed in Chapter 3; and general statements regarding the exchange, both supportive (four comments) and opposing (one comment).  Issues The project interdisciplinary team identified a list of issues to address from public and agency comments received during the EA and EIS scoping periods and DEIS comment period as well as input from tribes. Issues are disputes, debates, or discussions about environmental effects of a proposed project. The USFS separated the issues identified from comments received on the project into two groups: issues eliminated from detailed study and key/significant issues.  Issues eliminated from detailed study are those identified in regulations as (1) outside the scope of the proposed action; (2) already decided by law, regulation, forest plan, or other higher level decision; (3) irrelevant to the decision to be made; or (4) conjectural and not supported by scientific or factual evidence. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations explain this delineation in Sec. 1501.7, stating that agencies shall “identify and eliminate from detailed study the issues which are not significant or which have been covered by prior environmental review (Sec. 1506.3).” All comments received during the scoping periods and comment period, any responses to them, and identification of any issues from those comments is in Appendix A.   Key/significant issues identified are those directly or indirectly caused by implementing the Proposed Action. The project team reviewed key/significant issues to determine if any of the concerns would require development of another alternative, further refinement of the Proposed Action, or addition of any further possible mitigation measures. Below are the issues identified used to refine this analysis. Issue 1: Recreation and Access Concern 1: The land exchange would remove access to the popular Mogollon Rim Trail and would reduce forest access and existing recreational opportunities in the Pinetop-Lakeside area. Response: The parcel is not known for any unique particular recreation other than the Mogollon Rim Trail and ease of access to NFS lands for nearby owners. Although the trail would no longer be under public ownership, the LFA has agreed to maintain part of the Mogollon Rim Trail, a very popular trail that is the main recreational draw to the area. LFA would maintain the paved portion of the trail with a 25 foot buffer on all sides, and would maintain the parking area, trailhead, and entrance road. Access to and use of the trail would continue to be available to the public so residents and visitors can continue to enjoy use of the trail and the beautiful vistas. Public access to the remainder of the parcel would be at the discretion of the landowner. Residents of abutting properties would need to travel a farther distance to reach ASNFs land but the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside abuts NFS land for miles and has numerous access points to forest land that provide opportunities for various types of recreation. Issue 2: Land Values and Socioeconomics Concern: Residents owning property that abuts the Camp Tatiyee parcel raised the concern that privatizing the land and allowing it to be subject to development would adversely affect their property values.  Response: In consideration of the present economy and general oversupply of housing, the land within the Camp Tatiyee parcel would likely remain vacant until a demand exists for new residences and development would be a profitable enterprise. If the land exchange occurs, the proponent working with the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside would utilize reasonable setbacks and other measures to help minimize impacts to surrounding areas and maintain the mountain forest character of the area. When development becomes economically feasible on the Camp Tatiyee parcel, the parcel would be subject to the rezoning and subdivision approval processes required by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Both of these processes include an opportunity for public comment and input. While development plans are not known at this time, the development would likely be similar to the surrounding low-density residential development. Camp Tatiyee would continue to operate at its current location. Camp Grace would have the option to purchase the land where it is located to continue operating as well. The parcel would become part of an “open space” zoning designation upon initial exchange. Issue 3: Retention of Utility Easements Concern: Utility access across Camp Tatiyee is currently managed under the USFS SUP process. Utility companies are concerned that without a defined easement, the utilities would need to be relocated. Response: Existing easements would remain as easements after the exchange. Existing utilities, including the irrigation ditch and storage pond, would be granted easements or other appropriate authorizations on the Camp Tatiyee parcel at the time of the exchange to allow continued authorized use. Issue 4: Loss of Cultural Resources Concern: Tribes expressed concern over the loss of cultural resources in the project area and other projects transferring NFS land in the area that contained cultural resources and stated the loss was significant. Response: A memorandum of agreement (MOA) among the SHPO and the USFS that includes a historic properties treatment plan HPTP was developed to resolve and mitigate the direct and indirect adverse effects to any cultural resources (USFS 2014d) in the project area and is available in the project record files. Mitigation measures in the treatment plan include photographic documentation, mapping the sites, conducting surface artifact collections, and data recovery through excavation. Through documentation and data recovery, adverse effects to these sites would be mitigated. The signed MOA and HPTP were shared with the tribes that responded and other design criteria of the project was also shared, some that would help protect a specific site identified as associated with the White Mountain Apache Tribe. The suggested protection measure for that site was agreed to by the tribal representative and LFA. Other projects in the area underway are receiving or would receive similar mitigation measures, one project was adjusted to maintain a section of land of cultural significance in NFS ownership rather than transfer that section of land. The USFS has consulted with the tribes on any concerns on this project over the length of the project, as described in the Tribal Consultation section, and on other projects in the surrounding area (some described in the section below) and will continue coordination efforts as needed for mitigation of effects to cultural resources. Other Related Efforts Other USFS Real Estate Activities in the Geographic Region The ASNFs has been consolidating ownership through land exchanges throughout the geographic region. Other similar efforts include the Black River Land Exchange and the Show Low South Land Exchange. These exchanges are land-for-land exchanges seeking to move private parcels surrounded by Forest Service land into Forest Service ownership and isolated Forest Service lands surrounded by private land into private ownership. These exchanges are completed to consolidate Forest Service lands and improve management across those lands or benefit specific natural resources as well as to meet public needs including allowing growing communities to meet development needs in the future. In addition, the ASNFs is engaged in two disposition actions: the Woodland Lake Park Land Conveyance, in which the Woodland Lake Park parcel is being sold to the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, and the Lakeside District Office Conveyance, in which the ASNFs is proposing to sell land currently housing the Lakeside Ranger District Office and adjacent parcels at auction. The NEPA analysis for the Black River Land Exchange has been completed and decision signed for the Show Low South Land Exchange and Woodland Lake Park Conveyance. The Lakeside District Office Conveyance is still in the phase of developing the project’s alternatives. Chapter 2. Alternatives Including the Proposed Action Introduction This chapter describes and compares the two alternatives considered for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange Project—the no action and proposed action (preferred alternative)—and identifies alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study with the rationale for their elimination. Some of the information used to compare the alternatives may be based on the design of the alternative (e.g., acres of land currently in federal ownership versus acres of land in federal ownership after exchange) and some of the information may be based on the environmental, social, and economic effects of implementing each alternative (e.g. total acres of federal land currently containing wetlands and floodplains versus total acres of federal land containing wetlands and floodplains after exchange). Alternatives Considered in Detail Alternative 1: No Action Under the no action alternative, lands would remain under the current ownership and existing management. While this alternative does not satisfy the purpose and need of the project, it was analyzed as required by the CEQ regulations 40 CFR 1502.14 (d). Alternative 2: The Proposed Action The proposed action is the preferred alternative of the USFS. Under this alternative the USFS would exchange one large parcel of federal land of up to 344.24 acres to LFA and BC2 LLC, for up to 18 private parcels totaling up to 1,719.32 acres with cash equalization if needed to equal the value of the exchange (see figure 1 for locations of all the parcels and the Land Exchange Process section for information on the exchange process and cash equalization). The exchange would be with Lions Foundation of Arizona, Inc. (LFA) and BC2 LLC, through Lawyer’s Title of Arizona, Inc., which holds the 18 private parcels in trust as Trustee. The exchange would occur under authority of the General Exchange Act of 20 March 1922, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and the Federal Land Exchange Facilitation Act of 20 August 1988. The exchange would convey land, interests in land, and the resources associated with them, including subsurface mineral resources and any associated rights, royalties, or other interests, any agreed to water rights/claims, and any roads lying within the parcels. Some agreements and mitigation measures would apply as outlined in the Design Criteria section. Information on the locations of the parcels proposed for exchange is provided below. Details on the current uses and resources of each parcel and the forest management areas they lie within are provided in the Land Use, Affected Environment Section of Chapter 3 as well as under affected environment sections for other resources in Chapter 3. Information is also available in the administrative record from the Lakeside Ranger District Office. In accordance with USDA Forest Service policy, parcels must be appraised in the manner in which they were acquired, so some of the parcels may be lumped together in identification in documents in the administrative record under one name. For example, Stronghold and Stronghold Well Site may be considered together and referenced simply as “Stronghold,” but identified as separate parcels in this analysis. The Tonto Creek Parcels may also be identified with different numbers in project record and lands documents, i.e. with “Tonto Creek 1 Parcel” labeled “Tonto Creek 3 Parcel.” Locations & Acreage of Land Parcels Proposed For Exchange Information on the location of the lands involved in the proposed exchange is provided below with the priority order for exchange of the sections and lots of the federal parcel and priority order of the non-federal parcels outlined in Tables 2 and 3 below. Some parcels were identified together in the priority listing and so have the same priority order number. Table 2.

The northern boundary of the parcel is the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside road easement for Wagon Wheel Road. The land north of the Wagon Wheel Road is private land occupied primarily by single family residences with one commercial business located north of the northwest corner of Wagon Wheel Road and State Route (SR) 260. The majority of the eastern boundary is the centerline of SR 260. The land on the east side of SR 260 is private land and primarily subdivided residential property. The southern one-third of the east boundary is shared with commercial business properties located in the Maverick Center, and the other part of the southern boundary is the Navajo County road easement Vallery Lane. Land south of Vallery Lane is private land occupied primarily by single family residences. The western boundary abuts undeveloped Fort Apache Indian Reservation land. Non-federal Land Parcels Locations The 18 parcels of private land include one 110.57-acre parcel within the ASNFs; 11 parcels totaling 1,153.18 acres within the CNF; one 11.15-parcel within the PNF; and 5 parcels totaling 444.42 acres within the TNF. Information on the locations of the individual parcels follows. Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests  Carlisle Parcel The Carlisle Parcel (110.57 acres) is located approximately 6.5 miles northwest of Show Low, Arizona. The parcel is bordered by NFS land on three sides with private land bordering the western side (see figure 3). Coronado National Forest Happy Valley 40 The Happy Valley 40 Parcel is located in the Happy Valley area east of Tucson approximately 1 mile east of Saguaro National Park within the Rincon Mountains approximately 0.5 miles east of the Rincon Mountain Wilderness area. The parcel is almost completely surrounded by NFS land with an exception of a private parcel that borders the southeast end (see figure 4). Happy Valley West The Happy Valley West Parcel is also located in the Happy Valley area east of Tucson within the Rincon Mountains just over 1 mile east of the Happy Valley 40 parcel. The parcel is bordered by NFS land on the north, south, and southeast sides with private land on the western side (see figure 4). Happy Valley East The Happy Valley East Parcel is also located in the Happy Valley area east of Tucson within the Rincon Mountains just over 1 mile east of the Happy Valley 40 parcel. The parcel is bordered by NFS land on the south, southeast, and part of the north sides with State Land bordering one portion of the north side and the Happy Valley West Parcel on the eastern side (see figure 4). Harshaw Creek Parcel The Harshaw Creek Parcel is located approximately 8 miles southeast of Patagonia, Arizona along Harshaw Creek between the Patagonia Mountains and the Canelo Hills. The parcel is bordered by NFS land on north, east, and south sides with private land on the west side (see figure 5). Mansfield Parcel The Mansfield Parcel is located in the Santa Rita Mountains southeast of Tucson, Arizona, and approximately 7 miles northwest of Patagonia, Arizona, in Mansfield Canyon.

The operators of Camp Grace have been extended the opportunity by LFA to acquire the land where their camp is located at the conclusion of the exchange if it occurs so they can also continue operating. The parcel, or portions of it, specifically those outside the camp boundaries, could also be made available for residential or commercial development in full compliance with and if permitted under the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances and processesLand Use section of Chapter 3 of this FEIS.  1. Further information on the foreseeable future developments on the land are addressed in the 1 Lands conveyed out of federal ownership become subject to all laws, regulations and zoning authorities of State and local governing bodies (Forest Service Manual 5400). Various State of Arizona agencies as well as the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, and possibly Navajo County, are the regulatory authorities for all land uses and development related activities that would be permitted on the conveyed federal land the same as for the other private land within the corporate limits of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. The USFS has long taken the position that zoning and regulation of uses on private land are within the responsibility of state and local governments. Local authorities are in the best position to determine appropriate uses of private land. Except as authorized by law, order, or regulation, USFS policies, practices, and procedures shall avoid regulating private property use (Forest Service Manual 5403.3). Local governments have traditionally agreed and insisted that such decisions be left to them. Non-federal Future Parcel Use Non-federal parcels exchanged would be incorporated into the four different forests and management areas within which they are located (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 254.3(f)). Management direction for the acquired parcels would follow management area direction for that area and be the same as that for the surrounding federal lands, unless management of the area is modified by future amendment(s) to the forest LMP or as a result of a project specific change See the Land Use, Affected Environment Section of Chapter 3 for information on the management areas the individual parcels would become part of. Existing Easements & Special Use Permits Existing easements would remain as easements after the exchange. All current special uses, described in more detail in the Land Use section of Chapter 3, including utility uses and the irrigation ditch and storage pond on the parcel would be converted to easements or provided other appropriate authorization to allow continued use and management.  The Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail (#615) LFA, has agreed to maintain and preserve from any future building sites the Mogollon Rim Trail parking lot area and road connecting the parking lot area to SR 260 with the trailhead and the paved portion of the trail including a buffered area extending 25 feet from all sides of the paved trail and including a small buffered outcrop vista area (see figure 15 below). This identified area that includes the trail would remain available to the public as a recreation hiking trail area. Figure 15. Mogollon Rim Trail preservation area  Figure showing the Mogollon Rim Traii paved portion that will be preserved with a 25-foot buffer and including vista areas, the trailhead, and parking area.Mitigation Measures Cultural Resources: Since the exchange of land is expected to be a significant effect to cultural resources in the removal of sites from federal ownership, the USFS, in consultation with the Arizona SHPO and interested tribes, has developed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) that includes a historic properties treatment plan (HPTP) outlining mitigation measures to be used as part of the Proposed Action (USFS 2014d) to mitigate any effects of sites changing ownership. By following the treatment plan outlined in the MOA, discussed further in the cultural resources section of Chapter 3, adverse effects to cultural resources would be mitigated through data recovery. Consultation with tribes that have expressed affiliation to the sites and interest in involvement in the project and mitigation is ongoing for mitigation purposes. Land Exchange Process For a land-for-land exchange of federal and private lands to take place, a proponent develops an initial proposal of lands to exchange for lands to acquire. Lands to be conveyed and acquired must be desirable for both the federal and non-federal parties and must be within equal value requirements of FLPMA for an exchange to be considered and the exchange and analysis process begun. An exchange package is arrived at by a series of proposals and counter proposals between the parties of what land is made available by private owners and the USFS until both agree on a proposal of parcels that falls within the equal value requirement. Once an acceptable proposal is reached, it is finalized in an agreement to initiate that begins the land exchange process, and the USFS moves forward with analysis of exchanging those parcels. An appraisal is completed and reviewed to determine the actual market value of the land parcels proposed for exchange. Lands must be of equal value or cash equalization may occur to equal the value of lands exchanged. In cash equalization, one side of the exchange may provide payment to supplement the lands to be exchanged in order to equal the higher value of lands on the other side. Both parties to the exchange must agree on the total package of lands to be exchanged and any cash equalization before the exchange is completed. Because of this process, a final exchange may include all lands in the proposal with or without cash equalization, some of the lands in the proposal with or without cash equalization, or a determination not to exchange. The exchange proposal analyzed in this document considers the final exchange possibilities and all the lands mutually agreed upon by a proponent and the USFS. Information on the history of the proposal and its development is provided below. Land Exchange Proposal History In August 1997, Page Land & Cattle Co. representing LFA, an Arizona non-profit organization, proposed to exchange private land parcels within NFS land for NFS land where the Camp Tatiyee youth camp is located in order to continue operation of the camp with improved abilities to manage it. The camp has been operated under a USFS SUP since 1958. LFA proceeded to acquire further non-federal properties within the ASNFs, CNF, PNF, and TNF, and presented the ASNFs with an informal proposal for consideration that included these properties for the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange in June 2000. LFA provided a formal offer to enter into an exchange of lands in January 2002.  In 2003, a preliminary value analysis concluded that the estimated value of the federal land far exceeded that of the offered non-federal lands. Following this analysis and discussion between the two parties, a determination was made that LFA would need to acquire additional properties for the proposed exchange to proceed. Reduction of the federal parcel to equalize the lands proposed for exchange was not considered because it would simply result in continued management of a smaller isolated parcel, and goals of the ASNFs and USFS are to reduce management of such parcels and SUPs like those that exist on the Camp Tatiyee Parcel.  In December 2005, Page Land & Cattle Co. submitted a revised proposal with more private parcels offered, including a number of parcels located within the CNF that were previously acquired by BC2 LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, for a land exchange proposal that had been known as the Cote Land Exchange. At this time, one previously offered private parcel within the ASNFs, the Carlock Parcel (60 acres) was also withdrawn from the offered non-federal lands. A Value Consultation for the proposed land exchange was completed on 9 May 2007, and a Feasibility Analysis was approved by the Acting Director of Lands & Minerals, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, Southwestern Region on 9 August 2007. The Value Consultation concluded that the proposed land exchange was in compliance with the equal value requirement of the FLPMA, as amended. An Agreement to Initiate the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange was authorized by the Acting Director of Lands & Minerals, USDA Forest Service, Southwestern Region on 1 October 2007.  The project was delayed for a time and when moved forward again, an updated Feasibility Analysis was prepared and was approved by the ASNFs’ Deputy Forest Supervisor on 1 August 2014 and an Amended Agreement to Initiate was authorized by the ASNFs’ Deputy Forest Supervisor on 1 August 2014. Land proposed for exchange remained the same as in the December 2005 proposal and are the same lands analyzed for exchange under the Proposed Action in this EIS. Alternatives Considered but Eliminated from Detailed Study Federal agencies are required by NEPA to rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives and to briefly discuss the reasons for eliminating any alternatives that were not developed in detail (40 CFR 1502.14). Public comments received in response to the Proposed Action provided suggestions for alternative methods for achieving the purpose and need. Some of these alternatives may have been outside the scope of the purpose and need of the project, not feasible for specific reasons, or duplicative of the alternatives considered in detail. Also, the land exchange process in land-for-land exchanges itself limits alternatives of the land proposed for exchange as both parties must agree to the lands to be exchanged. Details on two specific alternatives considered but eliminated from further consideration and detailed study follow. Direct Purchase of Non-federal Parcels Alternative The direct purchase of non-federal lands by the U.S. is an alternative to a land-for-land exchange. However, Land and Water Conservation Fund Act funds that are the primary source of funding for the purchase of non-federally owned lands have historically been available in very limited amounts and only for the highest national priorities. It is anticipated that funding available for land purchases will continue to be very limited into the foreseeable future. Even if funds were available, the exchange proponents have stated they are not interested in selling the land to the U.S. Their offer is only for a land-for-land exchange for the federal land containing the Camp Tatiyee youth organization camp.  Deed Restrictions Alternative The use of deed restriction(s) to direct and control possible future development on the federal land once it has been conveyed into private ownership was considered. The purpose for deed restricting the federal land is to limit or control its use or development after conveyance in order to protect public interest. Since the federal land would originally be zoned “open space,” immediate development is not expected, and future development would be subject to the same state laws, county ordinances, and Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances, processes, and subdivision regulations as the adjacent private lands, which include public input prior to rezoning, so a deed restriction was not deemed necessary. Furthermore, for a land exchange to occur, both sides of the exchange must agree to the exchange and the components therein. A deed restriction could reduce or eliminate interest in the exchange and so was not considered. A deed restriction could also affect market value of the land. Comparison of Alternatives Below is a short summary of the effects of implementing each alternative analyzed in Chapter 3. Information in Table 4 is focused on activities and effects where different levels of effects or outputs can be distinguished quantitatively or qualitatively among alternatives. Chapter 3, Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences, provides a detailed analysis of the effects found within Table 4. Summary of Alternatives Comparison The conveyance of the federal land would increase the number of acres of private land within the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside by up to 344.24 acres and eliminate the isolated USFS parcel from USFS ownership and management. USFS administration of over a dozen special use permits (SUPs) on the federal land would no longer be necessary though such uses and existing easements would continue.  The acquisition of the non-federal lands would result in a reduction in mixed ownership patterns and consolidation of public land ownership. The elimination of numerous miles of common federal/private property boundaries and corners would contribute to increased management efficiency and a reduction in future administrative costs. Possible future residential/subdivision development on the private parcel inholdings would be eliminated. The USFS would gain a net total of up to 1,375.08 acres of land that would no longer need to be managed around and would be included as land available for public use. Non-federal lands would also provide additional federally managed habitat for wildlife and plant species. Table 4. Alternatives comparison Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1: No Action  Alternative 2: Proposed Action  Land Use      Federal  No change; SUPs would continue to need periodic review and re-authorization for existing land uses to persist.  Significant change, as property would no longer be subject to USFS management. SUPs and USFS oversight of SUPs would no longer be needed. Land zoning of “open space” would apply. Development could occur if the land owners change the zoning of the parcel, which would follow required public involvement processes.  Non-federal  No change.   Significant change possible as parcels would be subject to land management under the forest LMP rather than less-restrictive county planning and would not be available for development.  Recreation and Public Access      Federal  No change  Negligible impacts. Federal parcel would no longer be accessible for public use, with the exception of the Mogollon Rim Trail and associate parking area.  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. Non-federal parcels would be available for public recreation, as appropriate under their forest LMP designation.  Socioeconomics      Federal  No change  Less than significant impacts. County would see a reduction in payment in lieu of taxes (PILT) funding. Loss may be offset by property taxes on previously federal parcel, pending any development that may occur on the parcel.  Non-federal  No change  Less than significant impacts. Counties where non-federal parcels lie would see a reduction in private property tax, but this would be offset by an increase in PILT funding.  Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1: No Action  Alternative 2: Proposed Action  Plants, Fish, and Wildlife      Federal  No change  Negligible impacts. The federal parcel has minimal quality habitat for sensitive, threatened, or endangered species.  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. The non-federal land includes high value habitat for sensitive, threatened, and endangered species that is adjacent to critical habitat designations.  Grazing      Federal  No change  No change.  Non-federal  No change  Negligible impacts. Non-federal parcels currently used for grazing would be evaluated within each forest for the suitability of ongoing grazing access.  Prime and Unique Farmlands      Federal  No change  No change.  Non-federal  No change  No change.  Wetlands and Floodplains      Federal  No change  No change; no wetlands or floodplains are located on the federal parcel.  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. Approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain would be conveyed to and managed by the USFS.  Water Quality, Rights, and Claims      Federal  No change  No change. All existing water rights would be maintained with the exchange.  Non-federal  No change  No change. All existing water rights would be maintained with the exchange.  Cultural Resources      Federal  No change  Cultural sites located within the federal parcel would leave federal ownership. Mitigation of the adverse effects would be completed by data recovery prior to transference to private ownership. The protection of an Apache petroglyph located on the federal parcel was agreed upon by LFA, the new land owner, and the White Mountain Apache Tribe that would be further detailed in an agreement upon exchange.   Affected Resource/Issue  Alternative 1: No Action  Alternative 2: Proposed Action  Non-federal  No change  Beneficial impacts. Any cultural resources located on non-federal parcels would be conveyed to and managed by the USFS.  Mineral Resources      Federal  No change  No change. Subsurface/mineral rights are conveyed as part of the exchange.  Non-federal  No change  No change. Subsurface/mineral rights are conveyed as part of the exchange. Any mineral exploration would be subject to USFS policies and requirements.  Roads      Federal  No change  Negligible impact. Parking access to the Mogollon Rim Trail would be maintained as part of the Proposed Action.  Non-federal  No change  Negligible impact. Private road access on the non-federal parcels would transfer to USFS ownership for evaluation for improvement, maintenance, closure, or obliteration.  Fire and Fuels      Federal  No change  Negligible impacts.

Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences Introduction Land exchanges convey land, interests in land, and the resources associated with them. This Chapter considers all of those aspects and summarizes the physical, biological, social, and economic resources in the project area and the effects of implementing each alternative on those resources. Analysis of the proposed action considers all parcels proposed for exchange with the recognition that the exchange may fall within those analyzed and may involve cash equalization as explained in the Land Exchange Process section. It also focuses on the future use and management of the lands conveyed and acquired and the effect of the exchange on the lands that adjoin them, presents the scientific and analytical basis for the alternatives comparison in Chapter 2, and identifies the actions considered for cumulative effects below. Projects & Actions Analyzed for Cumulative Effects A cumulative effect is the effect on the environment that results from the incremental effect of the action when added to the effects of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes the other actions and regardless of land ownership on which the other actions occur. An individual action when considered alone may not have a significant effect; however, when its effects are considered in sum with the effects of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions, the effects may be significant. Cumulative effects are assessed in terms of how the Proposed Action will combine with effects of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future activities. Table 5 displays projects/actions which are near the project area, have the potential to contribute to cumulative effects to resources, and were analyzed in conjunction with actions of the alternatives for cumulative effects. Table 5.

This management area is composed of areas within a one-half mile distance of communities at risk. The ASNF 2015 LMP defines “communities-at-risk” as “identified in the Federal Register, high risk urban communities within the wildland-urban interface” (USFS 2015a). The wildland-urban interface areas are areas of the ASNFs adjoining human development at imminent risk from wildfire. The Community-Forest Intermix MA can be used as a zone for fire suppression activities and acts as a buffer to protect land and property adjacent to the MA from wildfire. Management direction for this area is focused on management activities for fire control and prevention to minimize the risk of fire spreading into (or from) adjacent developed areas (USFS 2015a). Land Use The federal parcel is partially developed and includes several special use permit (SUP) land uses authorized and overseen by the USFS. SUP uses include two organization camps that occupy portions of the parcel: Camp Tatiyee, operated by Camp Tatiyee, Inc., an instrumentality of the LFA, and Camp Grace, a separate and unrelated organization operated by Mission of Grace, Inc. that occupies a nearby portion of the federal parcel. The parcel also contains other uses including the Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail (#615), a popular hiking trail, and an attached parking lot area; several easements; national forest system roads (NFSRs); and water, energy, and telephone utility features and structures. Table 6 below summarizes the land uses currently authorized on the federal parcel. Table 6.

Facilities on the site include four dormitories with a total capacity of 125 people, three staff cabins, a dining hall and kitchen, a recreation hall with a stage, an indoor heated pool, an outdoor ramada with barbeque, an infirmary, a sensory therapy room and outdoor recreational amenities. The recreational amenities include nature trails, a fishing pond, an archery range, an outdoor playground, a baseball field, and a basketball court. Throughout the summer, Camp Tatiyee hosts intervals of 72 campers per week and up to 600 per season. When the summer camp is not in session, late August through early May, groups can rent facilities for private use (Lions Camp Tatiyee 2014). Camp Grace is available to rent year-round by groups for private use. Facilities on the site include 14 cabins, a three-bedroom guest house, two restroom facilities with showers, an outdoor ramada, an amphitheater-style campfire pit, a commercial kitchen and dining hall, and outdoor recreational amenities. The recreational amenities include a volleyball area, a horseshoe pit, a basketball court, a baseball and a soccer field, a tetherball site, an activity course, and a small lake (Mission of Grace 2014).  The remainder of the parcel is primarily used for pedestrian recreation such as walking, which occurs intermittently. The Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail (#615) lies entirely within the parcel and is the main recreational draw of the area with heavy year-round use by thousands of people. The USFS manages an access road, parking lot, and trailhead for this trail. The Recreation and Public Access section in this chapter provides additional details on the Mogollon Rim Trail. Three other NFSRs other than the access road to the Mogollon Rim Trail are also located on the parcel that are directly managed by the USFS. NFSR 300 (the Rim Road; currently closed to the public), NFSR 9705L1, and NFSR 9705L2, which are the access roads to Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace from SR 260. Further details on roads within the federal parcel is provided in the Roads section. Local Zoning The Camp Tatiyee parcel is bordered on the north, east, and south by light commercial and residential development that follows the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside and Navajo County zoning ordinances as depicted in figure 16. Zoning districts established for the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside are outlined in the Town Code that guides local development. Since the Camp Tatiyee parcel is owned by the USFS and the Town does not have jurisdiction over federal land, zoning does not currently apply to the parcel. However, the Town has zoned the parcel within its municipal limits as “open space.” The existing land use of the parcel is consistent with this designation. Surrounding areas zoning designations are described in detail below.  Town of Pinetop-Lakeside Zoning: The land to the east is within the Town’s municipal boundary, and the current uses are consistent with the Town’s zoning district designations. The properties along the northeastern border of the federal parcel, across SR 260, are zoned as primarily planned unit development (Planned Development on map) surrounded by small areas zoned as open space. The Planned Development zoning district allows for mixed-residential uses, such as townhomes, condos, multi-family dwellings, cooperatives and timeshares (Town of Pinetop-Lakeside 2014). Currently, a number of lots in that area are being marketed for residential development. The properties along the southeastern border, both across SR 260 and abutting the federal parcel, are zoned as light commercial (Commercial 1 on map) and rural residential (Low Density Residential on map). The Commercial 1 zoning district allows for a wide variety of uses, including multiple/single family dwellings, hotels/motels, private schools, churches, banks, offices, home occupations, restaurants, cafes. A number of the lots in that area are currently being marketed for commercial development, and a few have been developed as commercial properties. The Low Density Residential zoning district is more limited, allowing for a maximum of one dwelling unit per acre (Town of Pinetop-Lakeside 2001). In addition to single-family dwellings, other types of structures are allowed and may include guest ranches, churches, private schools, and home occupation structures. Navajo County Zoning: The lands to the north and south of the Camp Tatiyee parcel do not fall within the Town’s municipal boundary, and are therefore subject to the planning and zoning regulations of Navajo County. The light commercial and residential uses present are consistent with Navajo County zoning designations. The land to the north of the federal parcel is zoned as Medium Density Residential, Neighborhood Commercial, and Community Commercial (Navajo County 2014). The Neighborhood Commercial zoning district allows for multiple family dwellings or other types of high-density housing (minimum 2,000 square feet per dwelling unit, minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet) as well as orphanages, rest homes, nursing homes, and convents. The Community Commercial zoning district allows for multiple-family residential (minimum 1,000 square feet per dwelling unit, minimum parcel size of 6,000 square feet) uses as well as commercial retail and entertainment, and light manufacturing, The Medium Density Residential zoning district allows for residential uses (single-family dwellings, one dwelling per a minimum of one acre), farms, recreational, institutional, commercial and industrial uses (Navajo County 2012). The land to the south of the parcel is zoned Medium Density Residential. The land to the west of the Camp Tatiyee parcel is undeveloped, part of the Fort Apache Reservation, under the jurisdiction of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, and not subject to municipal or county zoning. The land is often used for fishing, camping, rafting and other outdoor recreational activities as allowed by permits purchased from the Tribe (White Mountain Apache Tribe Game & Fish 2014). Figure 16. Zoning districts adjacent to the Camp Tatiyee Federal Parcel  Figure showing the town and county zoning districts surround the Camp Tatiyee Federal Parcel.Non-federal Land Management areas surrounding the 18 non-federal parcels and land uses occurring on the parcels are identified and described in the table below with descriptions of the management areas following the table. Local zoning was not analyzed for the non-federal parcels because city and county zoning would not apply to the non-federal parcels under the proposed action and would not change under the no action alternative. Table 7.

The parcel lies almost completely within the Tonto Creek floodplain. The land surrounding the parcel is also undeveloped. A small modern man-made dam of boulders exists on the site. This dam lies within the creek and is of ephemeral construction; it would not have survived high water conditions and could not date any earlier than the modern period. The land is mainly used for recreational activities, including hunting and fishing and is accessed via SR 188  Pleasant Valley  TNF MA 1F: General Management Area  Not currently encumbered and remains mostly undeveloped (a water tank for cattle is located on the parcel). The parcel is mainly used for free range cattle grazing and a large water tank exists on site (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Detailed information on grazing can be found in the Grazing section of this chapter. Portions of the parcel’s perimeter are fenced but not enclosed entirely. Walnut Creek runs southwest to the northeast of the property, but the creek occasionally runs dry. The parcel is accessed via NFSR 254  Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests (ASNFs) Management Area (MA) – General Forest: This MA encompasses the majority of the Apache-Sitgreaves NFs (2015a). The management area contains undeveloped areas as well as developed facilities and open roads and trails. It also contains special areas including eligible and suitable wild and scenic rivers, national recreation trails, and scenic byways (though none of these are within or near the Carlisle parcel). This MA is managed to restore priority 6th level HUC watersheds and fire-adapted ecosystems, reduce the threat of uncharacteristic wildfire, and provide forest products. A wide variety of management activities occur and a wide variety of forest products are available within this management area including timber. Coronado Nation Forest (CNF) MA 3 – Recreation: This area includes undeveloped grasslands, woodlands, coniferous forest and riparian areas that have a high attraction to recreationists. Many are near developed recreation sites and are influenced by the presence of these sites, although not developed themselves. This area is to be managed for a variety of dispersed recreation opportunities while protecting or maintaining the unique physical, biological and cultural resources. Visual quality objectives are to be met. Other activities should maintain or enhance the recreational opportunities. Watershed conditions are to be improved or maintained. Cave Creek, outside the South Fork, is to be managed with an emphasis on wildlife habitat. Habitat for species shown under standards and guidelines will be maintained or improved primarily through coordination with other resource activities. Wildlife oriented recreation is also an important part of the management for dispersed and developed use in Cave Creek. CNF MA 4 - Fuelwood/forage production: Land under this MA typically includes desert scrub, grassland, chaparral, and woodland vegetative types identified as capable and suitable for fuelwood harvest (USFS 1986). The fuelwood/forage production MA focuses on the sustained availability and harvest of fuelwood and livestock forage. Dispersed recreational activities are encouraged when the productivity of the land or resources is not adversely affected, visual qualities objectives are to be met, and watershed and soil conditions are to be maintained or improved. Management or activity impacts on cultural resources and non-game wildlife are to be fully mitigated. CNF MA 7A - Riparian habitat protection and improvement: This MA includes undeveloped lands that have been identified as supporting flora and fauna associations that are unique enough to require special management practices, identified riparian ecotypes, deciduous and coniferous forest types, and known, essential habitats for threatened and endangered plants and animals. This MA focuses on perpetuating the unique wildlife or vegetative species and improving and managing riparian areas to benefit riparian dependent resources. Dispersed recreation activities and other uses may be allowed to the extent they do not degrade the unique values. Facilities may be allowed and maintained for the purpose of protecting these resources. Visual quality objectives are to be met. CNF MA 7B - Maintenance of unique ecological values: This MA includes undeveloped lands that have been identified as supporting flora and fauna associations that are unique enough to require special management practices; identified higher ecosystem extensions, such as oak and mesquite bottoms; and known, essential habitats for threatened and endangered plants and animals. Management of this MA focuses on perpetuating the unique wildlife or vegetative species while producing livestock forage and fuelwood on a sustained basis. Recreation activities and other uses may occur to the extent they do not degrade the unique values. Visual quality objectives are to be met. Facilities may be allowed and maintained for the purpose of protecting these resources. Prescott National Forest (PNF) MA Crown King: The terrain in this MA is rugged and consists of steep hillsides, desert plants (primarily chaparral with interspersed pinyon-juniper vegetative types), and boulders. This MA is focused on the availability of recreational opportunities including both motorized and non-motorized. Management in this MA focuses on providing developed camping in Horsethief Basin, reduction of recreation impacts such as soil compaction or loss of vegetation in dispersed camping areas, and providing a sanitary, primitive camping opportunity in the vicinity of Horsethief Basin and the Crown King community (USFS 2015b). This MA includes non-motorized day-use of the Grapevine Botanical Area and non-motorized recreation in the Castle Creek Wilderness area. Tonto National Forest MAs 1F, 5G, and 6J – General Management Area: These MAs focus on managing for a variety of renewable natural resources with primary emphasis on wildlife habitat improvement, livestock forage production, and dispersed recreation. Watersheds in this MA are to be managed so as to improve them to a satisfactory or better condition. Direction includes improving and managing the included riparian areas (as defined by FSM 2526) to benefit riparian dependent resources.  Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Forest Land Management Plan Under the proposed action, Community-Forest Intermix MA designation under the 2015 LMP would no longer be applicable to the federal parcel as it would transfer out of federal ownership and become part of private land within the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Land Use While the Camp Tatiyee federal parcel would be conveyed under the proposed action, the majority of the land uses would continue. The Camp Tatiyee youth organization camp would continue operation. Camp Grace, would have the option to purchase the land that Camp Grace occupies and may continue operation as well. Existing easements on the parcel, including roads such as Vallery Lane and Wagon Wheel Road, would remain easements under current management and continue to be used as they currently are. Existing SUPs for utilities on the parcel would no longer need require administrative oversight of the USFS and would be converted to easements or other appropriate authorizations at the time of the exchange to allow continued use. The paved portion of the Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail (#615) that leads out to a scenic vista and surrounding vegetation within 25 feet of the trail as well as the access road, parking lot area, and trailhead would continue to be available for public use. Access roads to Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace are expected to remain as Camp Tatiyee is planned to continue operation and Camp Grace is expected to as well. The section of NFSR 300, the Rim Road, which is closed, would leave federal management and be subject to the land owner’s management. Public use of the remainder of the parcel would be at the discretion of the landowner and could be restricted. The remaining section of the parcel could also be developed when a demand exists for new residences and development would be a profitable enterprise, but the proponent working with the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside would utilize reasonable setbacks and other measures to help minimize impacts to surrounding areas and maintain the mountain forest character of the area. For development to occur, the areas considered for development would have to go through rezoning processes as described below.  Local Zoning The existing zoning designation of “open space” for the parcel would apply upon transfer to private ownership. In order for any uses other than open space to be established on the parcel, the parcel would have to go through the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside rezoning process, which provides multiple opportunities for public notification, review, and comment, via Planning and Zoning Commission and Town Council hearings prior to the approval and adoption of the new zoning ordinance. Areas of the parcel, if rezoned, would likely be developed consistent with the adjacent zoning districts and may include a planned development, commercial 1, and low density residential designations, as described in the previous affected environment section outlining zoning of the area. Development of the parcel would be dependent on planning and zoning reviews, market demands, and regional growth demands. Non-federal Land Under the Proposed Action, the 18 non-federal parcels would become a part of the forests they lie within and no future development on them would occur. Management of the non-federal parcels would follow the USFS LMP MA surrounding each parcel as outlined in the affected environment Non-federal Land Parcels section for Land Use. New LMPs were recently finalized in 2015 for the Apache-Sitgreaves and Prescott National Forests. The Coronado and Tonto National Forests are currently undergoing development of new LMPs. The revision process for the CNF and TNF is still preliminary, but MA designation may change after the completion of this NEPA process. With finalization of those new plans, the non-federal parcels would likely become a part of newly established MAs in those LMPs. Management of specific resources on the parcel, such as streams, habitat, roads, etc. would follow direction for those resources as outlined in each respective forest’s forest plan. The parcels would also be evaluated by the USFS for potential inclusion in any surrounding grazing allotments and recreation areas, as applicable. Further details on other resources are provided in other sections of this chapter. The USFS would continue to recognize existing easements and authorized uses located on the non-federal parcels such as state and county roads and utilities, including communication lines, several of which are described in Table 7 in the Affected Environment section above. Cumulative Effects Actions and projects in the surrounding vicinities that are most likely to contribute to cumulative effects to land use and that were analyzed include 1. The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase  2. The Show Low South Land Exchange  3. Lakeside District Office Conveyance  See the Projects & Actions Analyzed for Cumulative Effects section for details on each project/action. Federal Land The projects identified in 1 – 3 in the list above all involve the transfer of land out of federal ownership. The combination of the Proposed Action with these other real estate actions would result in a transfer of approximately 1,722 acres of undeveloped federal land from federal to private ownership of land that is used by the residents of the City of Show Low, the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, Navajo County, and visitors from other areas. While this does constitute a substantial transfer of land from NFS ownership, much of the access to and important current uses of these lands would remain. In the Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase (543 acres), the highly popular and main recreational area on the parcel is the town park Woodland Lake Park (107 acres), which would remain open as a town park for continued use by local residents and visitors. Retention of the park for use into the future was a key reason for the transfer. Facilities that would also remain open for public use within the town park area include a playground area, baseball/softball parks, and restroom facilities that were under permit to the town prior to the transfer. Trails in the area would also remain available. The rest of the parcel may be used on occasion, but is not known to be an area popular for major recreational, aesthetic, utility, or other such uses. The area is an open area that is remaining open space currently (436 acres) but could be developed in the future similar to surrounding areas following zoning ordinances and processes of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. The Show Low South Land Exchange includes the popular Buena Vista Trail (#637), which will be relocated with the construction of a new trailhead on federal land to maintain the trail in that area. With continued public use of the Mogollon Trim Trail, uses of the Camp Tatiyee parcel for Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace, and the continuance of other utility uses the conveyance of the Camp Tatiyee parcel, considered cumulatively with other local land activities, is not expected to result in significant adverse cumulative impacts to land use. Non-federal Land The Proposed Action combined with other local land activities outlined above would result in a cumulative reduction of isolated private parcels within NFS land that would altogether reduce the number of SUPs the Forest Service must administer. The Proposed Action combined with the Show Low South Land Exchange would also cumulatively consolidate NFS land, eliminating some common boundaries through acquiring private land inholdings and thereby removing the possibility of future uses inconsistent with NFS land surrounding those parcels. Several current uses on the non-federal parcels within the Show Low South Land Exchange and the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange would either not change or may increase slightly when the land becomes open to the public. These uses include current utility uses, hiking, hunting, fishing, grazing, and other such uses as identified in the Affected Environment section for the non-federal parcels. Such uses would be allowed as follows management areas of the forest plan for that area and are also discussed in the sections that follow. Since many of the current uses will remain including the main uses identified by the public and local organizations with some use becoming available to the public from transfer of the non-federal parcels into federal ownership, no major cumulative adverse effects are expected and a cumulative beneficial effect for public use from the proposed action in conjunction with the other projects is expected from acquisition of these lands. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, existing conditions would remain unchanged. Land use would remain as it currently is with the USFS administering the SUPs and easements located on the federal parcel and incurring the associated expenses for such administration and for managing an isolated parcel surrounded by urban development. The parcel would remain zoned under the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances although zoning would continue to not apply. Non-federal Land Parcels The no action alternative would leave the non-federal parcels in private ownership and would not change any of the current land uses on the non-federal parcels. The parcels would remain available for possible future development. While further future development and use is difficult to predict as it is at the discretion of the private landowners and the parcels are more rural, if occurring, some development and use may be inconsistent with management of surrounding NFS land. The Forest Service would also continue to manage around private inholdings and maintain the current extent of boundaries shared by NFS and private land. Cumulative Effects Actions and projects most likely to contribute to cumulative effects to land use that were analyzed for the no action alternative are the same as those analyzed under the Proposed Action Cumulative Effects section. Federal Land No adverse cumulative effects to land use with the no action alternative in conjunction with other land actions in the area is expected as all land uses would remain as currently exist with no changes on the Camp Tatiyee Federal Parcel. The parcel would remain desirable for future exchange for the USFS as it is isolated and requires a lot of oversight of SUPs. The parcel could be exchanged in the future with different conditions that could affect land use differently than this exchange in the future, but predictions on future exchange would be speculative at this time. With no direct and indirect effects to land use, no cumulative effects would occur. Non-federal Land No adverse cumulative effects to land use are expected with the no action alternative in conjunction with other land actions in the area as all land uses on the non-federal parcels would continue as currently occurring. Future development or changes in use would occur at the discretion of the private landowner. Future exchange could occur as the parcels would remain desirable for acquisition by the USFS and could include conditions that would affect land use differently than this exchange but would be speculative. With no direct and indirect effects to land use, no cumulative effects would occur. Recreation and Public Access Affected Environment Federal Land The existing youth organization camps Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace that occupy the eastern portion of the federal land are both private facilities and are therefore not legally open to free public use although both camps have a high use of youth camp attendees and both camps allow renting of their facilities. Detailed descriptions of the facilities at these camps and their uses are provided under the prior Affected Environment Federal Parcel Land Use section. Together these camps occupy approximately 96 acres, or 28 percent of the 344-acre site. The rest of the federal parcel is available to and used by the public as follows: The Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail #615 is the main recreational attraction on the federal parcel and is a one-mile-long self-guided recreational trail open to public use. The main portion of the trail is a paved section that winds through a forested area to a few beautiful vistas that overlook an expanse of forested land on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation with the pavement turning to a dirt path just after the last beautiful open vista area. These vistas are highly popular spots for photos and short walks with thousands of people using the trail annually, local and summer residents and visitors alike (USFS 2014a). The trailhead for the trail begins at a parking lot located along the western side of Highway 260 and is accessed by a current NFS Road that lies between the road entryways to Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace. Use of the rest of the parcel for walks by residents living nearby also occurs. Non-federal Land The non-federal land parcels are private property and not legally open to free public use. However, many of these non-federal parcels are located adjacent to USFS MAs that permit or encourage recreational activities under specified conditions (i.e. when recreation does not adversely affect the productivity of the land or resources). Recreationists must go around these private parcels to remain on NFS land, but depending on the condition of fencing or other barriers along the property boundaries adjoining federal land, may enter these private land parcels unknowingly. Recreational uses such as hunting have been known to occur on many of the parcels and a USFS trail crosses through the northwest corner of the Ronstadt Tank Parcel. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the Proposed Action, the main recreational use area on the parcel the Mogollon Rim Interpretive Trail (#615) would remain open for public recreational use for the entire paved portion of the trail including 25 feet on every side. The trailhead, parking area, and access road would remain available to the public for trail access. Public access to and use of the camp areas isn’t expected to change as the camps are expected to continue operation. Use of the rest of the parcel would be at the discretion of the new landowner.Therefore, no major impacts to recreation and public access are expected. Non-federal Land Under the Proposed Action, the public would be able to legally access additional NFS land on up to 18 parcels encompassing up to approximately 1,719 acres that do not currently provide legal public access, public roads use, or public recreation thereon. The following non-federal parcels are located adjacent to USFS MAs that encourage recreation under certain circumstances: • Happy Valley East • Happy Valley West • Harshaw Creek • Ronstadt Highway • Rucker East • Rucker West • Stronghold • Stronghold Well Site The above parcels total more than 990 acres. Assuming that these parcels would be designated to permit or encourage recreation, consistent with the adjoining USFS MAs, then the Proposed Action would increase the amount of land that is accessible to the public for recreational purposes with the acquisition of these parcels. Based on a review of LMP compliance and public benefits determinations presented in Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange Feasibility Analysis (USFS 2014b), all of the non-federal parcels would provide a benefit to dispersed recreation, which includes camping, hiking, hunting, wildlife viewing, and vehicular access. As a result, the Proposed Action would have a beneficial impact to recreation and public access on the non-federal land acquired. Cumulative Effects Actions and projects in the surrounding vicinities that are most likely to contribute to cumulative effects to recreation and that were analyzed include 1. The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase  2. The Show Low South Land Exchange  3. Lakeside District Office Conveyance  4. Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration Project 5. Second Knoll Target Range See the Projects & Actions Analyzed for Cumulative Effects section for details on each project/action Federal Land Parcel Actions identified in 1 – 3 in the list above involve the transfer of land out of federal ownership and items 1 and 2 include some high use recreational areas. However, the high use recreational areas in actions 1 and 2 are intended to be maintained for public recreational use. The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase was completed for the purpose of maintaining a public use town park—Woodland Lake Park—and nearby amenities of a playground, baseball fields, and restroom facilities into the future. The main recreational concern in the Show Low South Land Exchange involved the popular Buena Vista Trail (#637), which will be relocated with the construction of a new trailhead on federal land to maintain the trail in that area. No high use recreational areas are involved in the Lakeside District Office Conveyance. The Lakeside District Office Conveyance does include an area that was a campground, but is closed now and no longer open to the public. The campground had high use on a couple of days out of the year, but a very low percentage of use over the year for many years and little funding available for administrative oversight and was closed due to such low use. The Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration project included improvement of two walking/hiking trails and designation of an ATV/UTV route across mainly already existing roads to connect existing routes that would improve resource conditions and benefit recreation opportunities in that area. The Second Knoll Target Range was focused on increasing recreatin through development and management of a target range for public target shooting for rifles and pistols. Some intermittent recreation, usually walking for bordering residents, occurs on some parts of the parcels outside the high-use recreational areas, but is usually intermittent. Development on any of these areas, if it occurs, would need to go through town zoning ordinances and process and is expected to be more gradual as need arises then immediate.  Since most of the actions in the surrounding vicinities involve maintaining and even improving the high use recreation areas and loss of recreation in areas is focused to areas not of high use and is also expected to change gradually rather than immediately and dramatically, no major cumulative adverse effects are expected with implementation of the proposed action in conjunction with these projects. Non-federal Parcels With the Show Low South Land Exchange project, there would be a net gain of up to 530 acres of private land, which would be largely available to recreationists (USFS 2013). Statewide the Proposed Action and the Show Low Land Exchange project would result in a net increase of approximately 1,900 acres that would be transferred to USFS management with much of that land expected to be available to the public for rural recreational activities such as camping, hunting, and hiking.  No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, recreation would remain as it is on the federal parcel with Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace operating privately under permit, the Mogollon Rim Trail accessible as it currently is, and the parcel available for intermittent walking/hiking. The parcel would remain desirable for future exchange for the USFS and could be exchanged with different conditions that could affect recreation differently than this exchange in the future, but predictions on a future exchange would be speculative at this time. Non-federal Land The non-federal parcels would remain legally closed to free public recreational use at the discretion of the private landowners although intermittent recreational activities, such as hunting, on the non-federal parcels may continue to occur where boundaries are not fenced or clear or as allowed by the landowners. Overall, no direct or indirect impacts would occur to recreation on the non-federal parcels a result of the no action alternative. Possible future development would be at the discretion of the landowners, but could alter opportunities for certain recreational activities depending on what developments occur. Cumulative Effects Federal Land No adverse cumulative effects to recreation are expected to occur under the no action in conjunction with other land actions in the area as recreation would remain as currently exists with no known changes on the Camp Tatiyee Federal Parcel. The parcel would remain desirable for future exchange for the USFS and future exchange could affect recreational use differently than this exchange in the future, but such predictions would be speculative. With no direct and indirect effects to recreation, no cumulative effects would occur. Non-federal Land No adverse cumulative effects to land use are expected with the no action alternative in conjunction with other land actions in the area if the non-federal parcels remain in current ownership as recreation would remain closed to the public with no changes in allowed recreation unless allowed at the discretion of the private landowners. The parcels would remain desirable for acquisition by the USFS and if acquired under another future land exchange would be considered for recreational use at that time under the current forest plan. Socioeconomics Affected Environment Much of the information from this section was obtained from census data and is, therefore, limited to the past but most recent decade. Federal Land Population Table 8 shows past population statistics in 2000 and 2010 and population growth projections in 2020 and 2030 for Navajo County (where federal land would become private land), the state of Arizona, and the U.S. Navajo County had a population of 90,470 in 2000 and 107,449, growing 10.2 percent over the decade. From 2000 to 2010 Navajo County grew at a slower rate than Arizona but at a faster rate than the U.S. overall. Population growth in near future decades is expected to be greater for Navajo County than for the nation overall but slower than Arizona. Table 8.

These funds help offset losses in property taxes due to non-taxable federal lands within county boundaries. In 2014, Navajo County received $1,519,256 in lieu of taxes for 598,977 acres of federal land (DOI 2014), a rate of $2.54 in payments per acre. Given that the Camp Tatiyee Parcel is 344.24 acres, a rough estimate of the Camp Tatiyee Parcel contribution to PILT funds received by Navajo County in 2014 is around $874, which is less than 0.06 percent of the total PILT funds for that year. Non-federal Land Population Table 13 shows past population statistics in 2000 and 2010 and population growth projections in 2020 and 2030 for the counties the non-federal parcels lie within, the state of Arizona, and the U.S. Maricopa County had a population of 3,817,117 in 2010, making it the most populous county in Arizona. Population growth in Arizona (24.6 percent) exceeded the national average (9.7 percent) by more than double; with growth in each county containing lands proposed for exchange, excluding Gila County (4.4 percent), exceeding the growth of the nation overall. Population growth is expected to continue to be greater for Arizona than for the nation overall. For the 20-year period from 2010 to 2030 population in Arizona is expected to increase by 38.5 percent. Of the counties containing lands proposed for exchange, Gila County is expected to have the least amount of growth (7.3 percent) with projections suggesting increases from 53,597 residents in 2010 to approximately 57,500 residents in 2030. The next slowest estimated growth for a county a non-federal parcel lies within, 17.3 percent growth between 2010 and 2030 in Navajo County, is greater than the expected growth in the nation overall (16.1 percent). Maricopa County is expected to see the greatest amount of growth (40.4 percent), increasing from 3.8 million residents in 2010 to a projected 5.36 million residents in 2030. Table 13.

In comparison to the population of the nation overall, Arizona had a similar proportion of White/Caucasian and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; a higher number of Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, or Alaska Native; and fewer Asian or Black or African American residents. All counties containing land proposed for exchange, compared to the nation as a whole, had a larger proportion of Hispanic or Latino residents, and only Santa Cruz County had a lower proportion than the nation of American Indian or Alaska Native residents. In Navajo County 44.9 percent of the residents identified as American Indian or Alaska Native, while approximately half (51.3 percent) of the residents identified as White/Caucasian. All other counties were similar to, or greater than, the nation in the proportion of residents identifying as White/Caucasian. Table 14.

No immediate development of the federal parcel is expected and uses of the parcel for the two youth camps are expected to continue. However, any future development of the parcel if and as allowed following zoning ordinances and processes of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside may help accommodate expected increases in population in the local area. Availability of the parcel for possible development in the future could focus some of the future increases in population in the area of the parcel, although several other areas are also available for development in the local communities, so increases are expected to be gradual and would likely be limited to low density town zoning requirements similar to the surrounding areas if rezoned in the future as described below. Employment and Income The parcel would be zoned as open space originally and would have to go through the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside rezoning and development processes to allow for any development, including development of any businesses. While the camps are expected to continue operation on part of the parcel, any future rezoning of the rest of the parcel would likely be similar to that of the surrounding area, which is mainly low density residential with some open space and limited commercial zoning. Due to its original expected zoning, no immediate effects are expected on employment and income. Any possible future rezoning could result in some business development if authorized, but such development would likely be limited. Effects to employment and income would be beneficial to employment of local residents in Navajo County but also correspondingly minor. Development of housing may provide employment and income temporarily, but is not expected to be a major change in employment and income in the area as it is expected to be gradual. Property Values and Taxes The foremost socioeconomic change that could occur from the exchange of lands would be related to local property taxes. Federal property is not taxable by local governments while private property is taxable. As such, the land that is being transferred would become taxable. As the land would become taxable, two effects would be anticipated (1) property tax revenues would increase and (2) PILT revenues would decrease. The net effect would likely be minimal because the amount of PILT payments from the federal parcel is less than 0.06 percent of all the PILT funds received by Navajo County. Also, property taxes would be levied that would likely be close in amount to the decreased PILT payments, so any change in government revenue and the provision of public services would likely be very minor.  Some concerns have been raised that if the land is developed (changing from its current open space land use) it may have a detrimental effect on nearby residential property values. Research does suggest that proximity to open space can have an effect on property values (Bolitzer and Netusil 2000, Geoghegan 2002, Sengupta et al. 2003, Anderson and West 2006). Effects of open space on nearby property values have been shown to be mixed but, overall, beneficial to prices (Bolitzer and Netusil 2000, Sengupta et al. 2003). Furthermore, one study indicates that beneficial effects on property values are stronger with permanent open space than with developable open space (Geoghegan 2002). Given the findings of this study, because the Proposed Action would convey land from being non-developable to being developable, the Proposed Action may negatively affect nearby property values. The impact on individual properties, however, would tend to be small given that the overall impact of open space on property values is greatest in more urban areas where open space is at a premium, and lower in areas like Navajo County where nearby open space is abundant (Anderson and West 2006). Because Navajo County is a rural area where open space is not at a premium, any effects on property values related to conveying land from permanent open-space to developable land are expected to be less than significant and more limited to those properties nearest to the transferred parcel. Non-federal Land Population Under the Proposed Action, residential property development would not occur on the non-federal parcels because they would become a part of NFS land. The Proposed Action is not expected to have much effect on population characteristics or trends in the counties the parcels lie within because the parcels are more rural and not known to be areas of high focus for development or population expansion. Transfer of the non-federal parcels is also not expected to change population characteristics or trends in the surrounding remaining private lands as those lands are already near or adjoin NFS land boundaries. Employment and Income The Proposed Action is not expected to change employment rates or income in any of the counties the parcels lie within. Most of the parcels are rural and undeveloped, do not include any businesses, current open mining operations or areas with higher potential for minerals that are expected to be a focus for mining, or provide employment or generate known income of any kind related to the parcels or the resources thereon, other than utility use management, which would continue, and grazing, which may continue with any future analysis and inclusion of the parcels into federal grazing allotments. Property Values and Taxes The foremost socioeconomic change that would occur from the transfer would be related to local property taxes. Federal property is not taxable by local governments while private property is. As such, the non-federal parcels that would be transferred would become non-taxable thereby decreasing local government revenues, but PILT revenues would increase, increasing local government revenues. Table 20 shows estimates of increased acreages of federal land in each county, PILT payments per acre, and associated increased PILT payments for each county that would be affected. Table 20.

The net effect would be minor as decreased property tax revenues would likely be similar in amount to increased PILT payments and any overall effects related to government revenue and the provision of public services would be less than significant. For those counties that would result in a net loss of income (i.e., Gila County, Santa Cruz County, and Yavapai County), the total property tax contributes less than 0.02 percent of each counties’ property tax revenue. Thus, the net loss is expected to be less than significant. Table 21.

Second Knoll Target Range 2. The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase  3. The Show Low South Land Exchange  4. Lakeside District Office Conveyance  5. Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration Project 6. Rim Country 4-FRI See the Projects & Actions Analyzed for Cumulative Effects section for details on each project/action Federal Land The proposed action in conjunction with other projects that would convey land from federal to private ownership, items 2 – 4 in the list above, is not expected to result in increased population in the area, which is projected to increase in the local area regardless over the next couple decades, but may provide availability of land for the expected increasing population. Some increase in employment and income in the local area could occur due to development of businesses on transferred land in items 2-4 in the future, although most transferred areas are expected to be residential similar to surrounding areas. Effects of gradual increased development on nearby home prices is expected to be mixed and for the vast majority of properties in the region less than significant relative to other factors that have an effect on housing values. The Second Knoll Target Range is expected to provide some jobs for local residents, and the Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration Project and Rim Country 4-FRI may contribute to employment of some local residents for implementation of project activities; however, the increase in employment and income is not expected to have much of a measureable effect on the unemployment rates or number of families in poverty and is expected to be gradual and minor.  Non-federal Land Transfer of the non-federal parcels into USFS ownership is not expected to have an effect on population in the counties the parcels lie within as they Projects that convey land from private to federal hands could have cumulative impacts in terms of the potential for reduced economic activities that may result from federal ownership. For instance, some existing or potential mining operations or cattle grazing activities may be disallowed under federal ownership, leading to a potential reduction in overall economic activity. This effect is anticipated to be less than significant relative to overall economic activity in the region. Under the Proposed Action, residential property development would not occur on the non-federal parcels because they would become a part of NFS land. The Proposed Action is not expected to have much effect on population characteristics or trends in the counties the parcels lie within because the parcels are more rural and not a high focus for development. Transfer of the non-federal parcels is not expected to change population characteristics or trends in the surrounding remaining private lands as those lands are already near or adjoin NFS land. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal and Non-federal Land Since no changes would be made to land ownership under the no action alternative, no changes or effects would occur to socioeconomic conditions. Cumulative Effects Federal Land and Non-federal Land Because the no action alternative would not affect socioeconomic conditions, no impacts are anticipated in association with the Proposed Action; as such cumulative impacts are not anticipated. Plants, Fish, and Wildlife Affected Environment Consultation between the USFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) associated with the ASNFs 2015 LMP resulted in a Biological Opinions (BO) that provides guidance on all activities conducted on ASNFs lands. The ASNFs LMP BO (USFWS 2015) was issued 13 May 2015 and is applicable to the Proposed Action. It is the current direction of the Southwestern Region to conduct a consistency check to determine whether a project is consistent with the requirements of the ASNFs LMP BO. Based on a review of the ASNFs LMP BO in relation to proposed project activities, implementation of any of the alternatives proposed would be consistent with the new ASNFs LMP BO.  The ASNFs also completed a biological assessment and evaluation (BA&E) for the proposed land exchanged that evaluated impacts of the proposed action on federally protected species listed as threatened and endangered (T&E) under the ESA; Forest Service sensitive species, management indicator species (MIS), which were listed by the ASNFs under a prior forest plan; and migratory birds protected under the Migratory Birds Treaty Act. The BA&E focused only on the federal parcel proposed for conveyance out of USFS ownership (3C Consulting 2010) as that is the only federal parcel involved in the exchange. Habitat and potential for species on the non-federal parcels is discussed generally in this analysis based on what is known for the non-federal parcels and habitat types for different species. The BA&E did not analyze effects to plants and wildlife as a result of the no action alternative because no change would occur under that alternative. An Addendum BA&E was completed (September 2016) to cover species not analyzed, new listings, and/or status changes since the 2010 BAE. Management indicator species were analyzed in the 2010 BA&E as followed the current plan at the time, but under the new Forest Plan (2015) the ASNFs no longer has MIS species. The MSO, goshawk, and antelope are identified as focal species in the new Forest Plan and are only analyzed at the Plan level, so further analysis of them in this EIS as MIS is not included. MSO and goshawk are federally listed and sensitive species so they are analyzed as such in the BA&E and the analysis included in this EIS.   Federal Land The vegetation of the federal parcel is primarily ponderosa pine with a small Gambel oak component and two man-made ponds. No naturally occurring riparian habitat exists on this parcel; however, an irrigation ditch and the ponds do support some riparian plant and animal species. The ponds have water year round but the irrigation ditch that feeds them is frequently dry. Willows and sedges grow along the irrigation ditch and ponds. The ponds have cattails, and are populated with bullfrogs, bass, and sunfish. Non-federal Land Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests The Carlisle parcel is a combination of semi-arid grassland and pinyon-juniper woodland. The parcel is relatively flat. The Carlisle parcel has potential habitat for Chiricahua leopard frog within a small pond. The Carlisle parcel also has potential habitat for the Mexican gray wolf. The wolves are habitat generalists and can be found in deserts, grasslands, shrublands/chaparral, and various types of woodlands. The wolves succeed where human population density and persecution level are low and prey densities (primarily elk or other ungulates) are high.  Coronado National Forest The Happy Valley 40, East, and West parcels are part of the Happy Valley Riparian Area, a large riparian corridor along Page Creek. The corridor is considered to be an exceptional habitat for neo-tropical migrant birds. The Happy Valley parcels also include a combination of oak and mesquite woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands. The parcels have assemblages of diverse mesquite and acacia types, creosote brush, and succulents. The riparian corridors include mesquite species, mulefat, arrow-weed, and willow species. Page Creek and Turkey Creek could provide potential habitat for the northern Mexican gartersnake. The Happy Valley 40 parcel is within designated Mexican spotted owl critical habitat; the Happy Valley East and West parcels, while not within critical habitat, may provide foraging habitat. The Happy Valley parcels also include potential habitat for the northern aplomado falcon (Falco femoralis septentrionalis), a federally endangered falcon. The falcon is considered a “non-essential experimental population” within Arizona, a status which provides protection similar to that of a listed threatened species. Northern aplomado falcons use varying habitats, including oak savannahs, various desert grassland associations, and open pine woodlands. The falcons require open terrain with scattered trees, relatively low ground cover, an abundance of insects and small to medium-sized birds (for prey), and a supply of nest sites. The falcon has not been observed in Arizona for over 40 years. The Happy Valley Riparian Area offers potential habitat for the southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii), a federally endangered bird that breeds in the southwestern United States. The flycatcher favors dense riparian habitats (cottonwood/willow and tamarisk vegetation) with saturated soils, standing water, or nearby streams, pools, or cienegas. The three Happy Valley parcels may also provide habitat for the Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii), a bird species identified as a candidate for federal listing. Habitat within these parcels is likely to be marginal at best, for while the birds do use grasslands and wetlands similar to those interspersed throughout these parcels, they generally prefer large expanses of these habitats, rather than the small clumps of habitat present here. However, the habitat is better quality for the federally threatened yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus). The cuckoos prefer open woodlands and riparian woodlands, and typically nest in tall cottonwood and willow riparian woodland. The Harshaw Creek parcel includes three-eighths of a mile of the intermittent Harshaw Creek, which supports a healthy riparian community. The Harshaw Creek parcel also includes a combination of oak and mesquite woodlands, shrublands, and grasslands. The parcel has assemblages of diverse mesquite and acacia types, creosote brush, and succulents. The Harshaw Creek parcel also includes an isolated area of bedrock outcropping, typified by cliffs and canyons, with unstable scree slopes. Species associated with the outcropping areas include elephant-tree, ocotillo, Bigelow's bear-grass, teddy-bear cholla, and other desert species and succulents. The Mansfield parcel includes a perennial spring that drains into Mansfield Canyon Creek. The creek supports riparian and wetland habitats within and beyond the Mansfield parcel. The Mansfield parcel includes pinyon-juniper woodlands, pine-oak forests and woodlands, and diverse grasslands. The riparian corridor includes willow species and large cottonwoods. The Ronstadt Highway and Ronstadt Tank parcels are primarily a combination of desert grassland and chaparral, with a sizeable pinyon-juniper woodland component. The Rucker parcels include Rucker Canyon Creek, an intermittent stream with perennial pools and a robust riparian community. The parcels are primarily a combination of pinyon-juniper and oak woodlands. The Rucker West parcel includes bedrock outcroppings, as well as smaller areas of chaparral and grasslands. The Rucker East parcel has more riparian habitat, and is almost entirely pinyon-juniper and pine-oak woodlands. The parcels also include portions of federally designated critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, as well as a post-fledgling area for northern goshawks. The Stronghold Parcels are entirely pinyon-juniper woodland. Prescott National Forest The Babcock parcel is an interspersed mix of chaparral and pine-oak woodlands and forests.  Tonto National Forest The Pleasant Valley parcel is primarily savannah grasslands, with two isolated patches of pinyon-juniper woodlands, and a corridor of riparian woodland surrounding Walnut Creek Canyon. The Red Rover parcel is an interspersed mix of chaparral and pinyon-juniper woodlands. The parcel also has an isolated patch of pine-oak woodlands. The Tonto Creek parcels run in and along Tonto Creek. This creek supports habitat for several threatened, endangered, and sensitive species, as well as provides substantial wetland habitat. The Tonto Creek 1, 2, and 3 parcels are primarily Sonoran Desert scrub, typified by cactus (including saguaro and barrel cactus) and paloverde and creosotebrush scrub. There are few grasses or herbs. While the majority of the cover of Tonto Creek 1 is Sonoran Desert scrub, there are also several pockets of mesquite-dominated scrub, riparian woodlands, and desert wash assemblages. The riparian woodland features box-elder, cottonwood, and various willow species. The desert wash has sparse vegetation, primarily acacia, mesquite, and desert willow species. Tonto Creek 1 also has a large riparian area that is dominated by introduced species (primarily salt cedar). Tonto Creek 2 has large continuous areas of riparian woodlands, but also has a small pocket of invasive riparian species. Tonto Creek 3 also has high quality continuous native riparian woodlands, but also has the largest assemblages of non-native riparian species. Tonto Creek is home to the northern Mexican gartersnake, but invasive bull frogs have been observed to be adversely impacting the population. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Table 22 summarizes the potential impact to species potentially found on the federal parcel proposed for exchange under the proposed action. These summaries are derived from the BA&E completed for this project. A list of Endangered, Threatened, Candidate, and Proposed Species was compiled by the Apache-Sitgreaves NFs with concurrence on September 20, 2013 by the Phoenix Endangered Species Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The USFWS-approved species list for the Apache-Sitgreaves NFs was used in determining which, if any, listed species or critical habitat may be affected. The Apache-Sitgreaves NFs received the Region 3 Forest Service sensitive species list, dated September 2013 from the Regional Forester. The most recent survey information, knowledge of species and habitats, review of official web sites providing information on the species, and site-specific locations, as well as the overall range of species were used in determining if any listed, proposed, sensitive species, or critical/suitable habitats would be affected by the proposed action. Each species was reviewed to consider potential impacts the proposed action could have. If impacts are considered discountable or non-existent the species is not evaluated in detail and discounted in the table below. Those species with possible effects will be evaluated in greater detail.   Subsequent to the development of the concurrence list, the Mexican gartersnake and narrow-headed gartersnake were listed as federally threatened. While these species are not included on the official concurrence list, they are included in this analysis.  Only one federally listed threatened, endangered, proposed, or candidate species was identified as having potential habitat within the federal lands: the federally threatened Chiricahua leopard frog. None of the federally listed species have designated critical habitat within the federal parcel.Table 22.

In Arizona, this species nests mostly below 5,000 feet.  No montane riparian hardwoods present. Not documented as occurring on the District.  No suitable habitat exists within or near the analysis area.  No effects from the proposed action will occur.     NO EFFECT  Southwestern willow flycatcher Empidonax traillii extimus   E/SEN  Found in riparian habitats along perennial drainages where dense growth of willows, tamarisk, and other shrubs and medium-sized trees are present with a scattered overstory of cottonwoods. Nests in thickets of trees and shrubs approximately 12-24 feet tall, with a high percentage of canopy cover and large volume of foliage.   This species has not been found in mid-elevation riparian habitats from 3,400 to 7,960 feet. The analysis area is at the mid-elevation level. The species is not known to occur in or near the analysis area and no suitable or occupied habitat occurs near the analysis area. Critical Habitat was designated final in February, 2013.  No critical habitat was designated on the Lakeside Ranger District.  No habitat modifications or detectable indirect impacts will occur from the proposed action.    NO EFFECT  American peregrine falcon  Falco peregrinus anatum    SEN  Steep, sheer cliffs overlooking woodlands, riparian areas or other habitats supporting avian prey species in abundance.

Inhabit unfrozen inland waters where abundant prey. Winter habitat has open water and abundant food supply. Nests usually on cliff ledges, rock pinnacles, and in cottonwood tree, but have been found in junipers, pinyon and ponderosa pines, sycamores, willows, snags.  Potential habitat in project area.  Additional evaluation required  Mexican spotted owl  Strix occidentalis lucida   T/SEN  Spotted owls use a wide variety of habitats including open and non-contiguous forests, pure ponderosa pine stands, small cave openings, and rocky slopes. In northern Arizona, they are associated primarily in unlogged mixed-conifer forests.  Suitable habitat does not occur within the action area.  Surveys in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 found no spotted owls. The Area was thinned in 2006 as part of a WUI project. Based on the negative survey data and the presence of residential development on three sides of the parcel it is not considered potential MSO habitat.     NO EFFECT  Fish          Little Colorado sucker Catostomus sp. 3  SEN  Found from 2200’ to 7100’, principally in rocky pools and riffles of creeks and small to medium rivers with abundant cover.  They are also found in impoundments.    Species not present in action area.  No suitable or potential habitat is present in the action area   NO IMPACT  Species  Status  Key Habitat Elements  Occurrence within Project Area/Habitat Present  Determination of Effect  Little Colorado spinedace Lepidomeda vittata   T/SEN  Found in water 0.5-4.3 ft deep, but appear most abundant in depths of about 1.9 ft. Spinedace are most common in slow-to-moderate water currents that flow over fine gravel bottoms. They avoid deep, heavily shaded pools and shallow, open areas, preferring unshaded pools with rocks or undercut banks for cover. Temperatures where populations exist generally range from 58-79° F. Spinedace appear quite capable of tolerating relatively harsh environments that undergo dramatic fluctuations in pH, dissolved gases, and water temperatures.  Species not present in action area.  No suitable or potential habitat is present in the action area.    NO EFFECT  Loach minnow Tiaroga cobitis  E/SEN  The loach minnow is primarily a benthic species, inhabiting moderate to large streams at intermediate elevations, and is typically associated with shallow, turbulent riffles with cobble and gravel substrates.  The species feeds on a variety of aquatic insects.  Spawning occurs in the same riffle habitat that is normally inhabited by the species, where eggs are deposited on the underside of small, flattened rocks.   Periodic flooding that cleans riffles of embedding sediments is important to the survival of loach minnows. Major floods do not appear to displace loach minnows, but may aid the species by flushing away non-native fish with which the loach minnow appears incompatible.  Species not known to occur in project area and no habitat present.  No impact to species or habitat.    NO EFFECT  Species  Status  Key Habitat Elements  Occurrence within Project Area/Habitat Present  Determination of Effect  Amphibians and Reptiles          Chiricahua leopard frog  Lithobates chiricahuensis  T/SEN  Occurs chiefly in the oak and mixed oak and pine woodlands. Highly aquatic and almost always associated with permanent water, preferably with emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation. Prefers rocky streams with deep rock bound pools. Species inhabits montane springs, streams, and tanks, it was historically found in numerous valley wetlands and cienegas. Fifty percent of the populations documented in Arizona were associated with natural lotic systems. The others were associated with stock tanks (39%) and natural or artificial lakes (11%).  There are no known populations within the project area or within dispersal distance. Last recorded on Lakeside RD in 1970s.  The presence of crayfish, non-native fish, and/or bullfrogs would likely prevent this species from occurring within any riparian zone or wetted area in or near the project area.  Critical Habitat was designated final in April, 2012.  No critical habitat was designated on the Lakeside Ranger District.   Additional evaluation required  Northern leopard frog  Lithobates pipiens  SEN  Grassland, brush land, woodland, and forest ranging high into the mountains, usually in permanent waters with rooted aquatic vegetation; also frequents ponds, canals, marshes, springs, and streams. May forage far from water. 2,640 – 9,155’ elevation.  Species not documented in action area but potential habitat does occur.     Additional evaluation required  Northern Mexican gartersnake Thamnophis eques megalops  T/SEN  Permanent water with lush vegetation. Lakes, large streams and rivers, and rich springs and headwaters. It is semi-aquatic and seldom seen more than 15 meters from permanent water.   There are no known occurrences of this species within the project area or within dispersal distance.  No proposed critical habitat occurs within the project area or district.  There are no populations within dispersal distance.  No effects from this project will occur.     NO EFFECT  Narrow-headed gartersnake Thamnophis rufipunctatus  T/SEN  Permanently flowing streams, sometimes sheltered by broadleaf deciduous trees, in pinyon-juniper and pine-oak woodland up to ponderosa pine forest.  There are no known occurrences of this species within the project area or on the district.

This frog is highly aquatic, and is almost always associated with permanent water, preferably with emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation. Chiricahua leopard frogs prefer rocky streams with deep rock bound pools; it inhabits montane springs, streams, and tanks. Historically, it was found in numerous valley wetlands and cienegas. Fifty percent of the populations documented in Arizona were associated with natural lotic systems. The others were associated with stock tanks (39 percent) and natural or artificial lakes (11 percent). No individuals were found during 2003 or 2009 surveys within federal parcel. The presence of predatory species including bull frogs and predatory fishes in the ponds would likely prevent the Chiricahua leopard frog from being established in the federal parcel. Effects Determination The determination of effects for this species is based on the following: • Habitat for the Chiricahua leopard frog occurs in the project area in the form of two man-made ponds that are stocked with bass and sunfish, and have bullfrogs.  All of these species prey on leopard frogs. • All potential habitat sites were surveyed in 2003 and 2009.  No leopard frogs were found.  Bass, sunfish, and bull frogs were found to be common. • The most recent sighting of Chiricahua leopard frogs on the Lakeside Ranger District occurred immediately south of the project area in Rainbow Lake in 1974. • This species is likely absent from the Little Colorado Watershed. The final rule listing the Chiricahua leopard frog as threatened states that once extirpated from a region, natural recolonization of suitable habitats is unlikely to occur in the near future. • Current populations are not within reasonable dispersal distances to suitable habitat within the project area. • The nearest critical habitat occurs approximately 45 miles away in the Deer Creek drainage of Apache County near Conch Bill Spring (USFWS 2012c). Based on the above discussion, implementation of the proposed action would have no effect on the Chiricahua leopard frog. Forest Service Sensitive Species American Peregrine Falcon The American peregrine falcon occurs around steep, sheer cliffs overlooking woodlands, riparian areas or other habitats supporting avian prey species in abundance. The falcons may also be found in less optimal habitat, including small, broken cliffs in ponderosa pine forest or large, sheer cliffs in very dry areas. American peregrine falcons favor birds as their primary prey, and may feed on bats secondarily. The federal parcel is relatively flat, and does not provide the cliffs or open expanses favored by the falcons. There is no suitable nesting habitat within the federal parcel but it is likely used as foraging habitat.  Effects Determination The effects of this project on the American peregrine falcon consider the following information: • No peregrine falcon eyries are known within the project area or on the district   • The proposed action would not affect the suitability of this parcel as foraging habitat  • Residential development on the parcel could increase the falcon’s prey base on the parcel as residents feed and attract birds.   • There are no cliffs or nesting habitat in the project area. Based on the above discussion, the proposed action may impact individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability.   Bald Eagle Bald eagles favor areas with high water-to-land edge, and areas with unimpeded views including both horizontal and vertical aspects. Areas selected for as wintering habitat will have an adequate food supply, and have open water such as river rapids, impoundments, dam spillways, lakes, and estuaries. Potential roosting and perching habitat are present in federal parcel. The two ponds within the parcel could be used as foraging habitat for bald eagles; however, these ponds are so small that it is unlikely that they could provide sufficient space and forage to be important to wintering bald eagles. There is a bald eagle nest approximately ¾ of a mile to the east of the project at Show Low Lake.  Nest watchers from the AZGFD have not observed eagles foraging at the ponds.   Effects Determination The effects of this project on the bald eagle consider the following information: • One nesting pair of bald eagles are known on the Lakeside Ranger District at Show Low Lake approximately ¾ mile east of the parcel.   • Eagles have not been observed roosting, foraging, or nesting on the parcel.   • The 2 ponds on the 344 acre parcel are likely too small and don’t provide enough prey base for wintering bald eagles.  They freeze in the winter and no prey are present.   • Nest watchers from the AZGFD have not observed eagles foraging at the ponds during their monitoring. Based on the above discussion, the proposed action may impact individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability. Northern Goshawk The northern goshawk is a forest generalist foraging in most forest types. It typically nests in stands of large ponderosa pine or mixed conifers. The federal parcel contains both potential foraging and nesting habitats. This parcel was surveyed for goshawks in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2009, and 2010. A single goshawk responded to the surveyor in 2003. No nest was found; it is likely the goshawk was foraging in the area but was likely nesting outside of the parcel. The presence of Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace on this parcel likely cause sufficient noise disturbance during the goshawk breeding season to preclude nesting adjacent to the existing structures even though some of the largest trees on the parcel are located close to and within these camps. Additional noise disturbance could be contributed to the presence of SR 260 on the northeast side of the parcel and the residential and commercial development on the north, south and east sides of the parcel.  Effects Determination The effects of this project on the northern goshawk consider the following information: • Lack of suitable habitat on 3 sides of the parcel lessens the importance of the 344 acres being used for foraging habitat.   • The closest northern goshawk PFA is approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the parcel.  • The presence of Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace on this parcel likely cause sufficient noise disturbance during the goshawk breeding season to preclude nesting adjacent to the existing structures even though some of the largest trees on the parcel are located close to and within these camps.  • Residential and commercial development on 3 sides of the parcel also likely preclude goshawks from foraging on the parcel.   Based on the above discussion, the proposed action may impact individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability. Northern Leopard Frog Northern leopard frogs may be found in a variety of habitats including grassland, brush land, woodland, and forest. The frogs are usually in permanent waters with rooted aquatic vegetation, but are also found in ponds, canals, marshes, springs, and streams. Northern leopard frogs primarily feed on small invertebrates, and may forage far from water. The presence of predatory species including bull frogs and predatory fishes in the ponds on the federal parcel would likely prevent the northern leopard frog from being established in the federal parcel. Effects Determination The effects of this project on the northern leopard frog consider the following information: • Habitat for the northern leopard frog occurs in the project area in the form of two man-made ponds that are stocked with bass and sunfish, and have bullfrogs.  All of these species prey on leopard frogs.  • All potential habitat sites were surveyed in 2003 and 2009.  No leopard frogs were found.  Bass, sunfish, and bull frogs were found to be common.  • With the presence of predators it is unlikely that northern leopard frogs could persist in the two ponds.   • There are no known populations that exist on the parcel or on the district.   • There are no known populations that exist within dispersal distance of the parcel. Based on the above discussion, the proposed action will have no impact to northern leopard frogs. Allen’s Lappet-browed Bat Allen’s lappet-browed bat has been found primarily in ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, Mexican woodland and riparian areas of sycamores, cottonwoods and willows. The bats are often found near boulder piles, cliffs, rocky outcrops or lava flow, and have been captured along streams or over ponds where the bats may be seeking insects, water or both. The bats generally roost in caves and abandoned mineshafts, but may use snags as well. The bats primarily feed on soft-bodies insects. The federal parcel provides suitable foraging habitat, but few large snags on the parcel and no known caves or rock crevices that could provide suitable roosting habitat.  Effects Determination The effects of this project on the Allen’s lappet-browed bat consider the following information: • No occupancy within the project area has been documented but foraging habitat is available. • No boulder piles, cliffs, or rocky outcrop roosting habitat occurs on the parcel. Based on the above discussion, the proposed action may impact individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability. Arizona Sneezeweed Arizona sneezeweed is an annual or biennial flowering forb found in regions of ponderosa pine forests, especially around wet places such as bogs, ponds, lakes, and roadside ditches. Arizona sneezeweed habitat is common throughout the ASNFs. Potential habitat for this species occurs on the federal parcel around the two ponds, on roadsides and in low lying areas where water puddles after rainstorms.  Effects Determination The effects of this project on the Arizona sneezeweed consider the following information: • Potential habitat occurs on the federal parcel around the two ponds, on roadsides, and in low lying areas after rainstorms.   • Proposed action would not alter potential habitat around ponds but might alter habitat in other areas of the parcel. • No Arizona sneezeweed plants have been observed on the parcel • If Arizona sneezeweed is present the proposed action would not result in a measurable change in the species population on the ASNF.   Based on the above discussion, the proposed action may impact individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability. Arizona Sunflower The Arizona sunflower is a flowering herbaceous perennial, found in open pine and juniper woodlands. It has been found within five miles of Show Low, but has not been documented in Arizona since 1984. The federal parcel includes suitable habitat for the Arizona sunflower, and it could potentially occur there. Effects Determination The effects of this project on the Arizona sunflower consider the following information: • No Arizona sunflower plants have been documented within the project area but habitat is available. • Arizona Sunflower has been observed within 5 miles of Show Low but not recently. Based on the above discussion, the proposed action may impact individuals, but is not likely to result in a trend toward federal listing or loss of viability. Non-federal Land The proposed action would bring the non-federal parcels into federal ownership and allow for more continuous habitat management by eliminating these inholdings. The USFS mandate to improve habitat and water quality would result in an overall benefit to biological resources located on these parcels. Several of the parcels also have the potential to benefit listed or sensitive species. The Rucker parcels include areas mapped as Mexican spotted owl critical habitat which would be transferred to federal ownership and would not undergo future development. Thus, the project would have a beneficial effect to Mexican spotted owl critical habitat. These parcels also include a northern goshawk post-fledgling area that would also be subject to federal management and protection. Cumulative Effects With only beneficial direct or indirect effects through the gain of potential habitat in the land exchange to any T&E species, no detrimental cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would remain under federal ownership, no development would occur, and plant, fish, and wildlife resources would continue to receive protection. The non-federal parcels, however, would continue to be unprotected, and the management of sensitive but unlisted species (e.g., the northern goshawk) would be at the discretion of the land owner.  Cumulative Effects Projects that include development and noise (i.e., Second Knoll Shooting Range and the Pueblo Park Mineral Materials Pit projects) could affect the habitat used by Mexican gray wolf. Wildfires can reduce or degrade habitat quality. Given the scale of these potential developments relative to the larger scale of existing habitat, no adverse cumulative effects to T&E species would occur. Migratory Birds A detailed analysis of effects on migratory birds is found in Appendix 2 of the BAE. The proposal is to trade 344 acres of Federal Land on the Lakeside Ranger District of the Apache –Sitgreaves National Forests for 1719 acres of private land in 14 parcels and in 4 National Forests all within Arizona.  Due to the high real estate values in the Pinetop Area one acre of land will trade for 4.9 acres of land elsewhere.  The Camp Tatiyee parcel has a high value for development, but limited value for wildlife due to the current human disturbance associated with the Rim Trail, unofficial hiking trails, traffic noise from the adjoining highways, and surrounding residential areas.  The analysis primarily considered the 344 acres of ponderosa pine and pinyon juniper habitat that will pass out of Forest Service control.  It is assumed that the 1719 acres that will come under Forest Service control will be only a benefit for migratory birds as it will be protected from further development.  It is determined that this land exchange will be a net benefit for migratory birds Grazing Affected Environment Lands throughout Arizona are used for livestock grazing. A stockman may elect to graze livestock on his own land, on someone else’s private land via a grazing lease, or on a federal grazing allotment as a permittee if authorized. Federal Land As of 2011, the ASNFs administered 92 active grazing allotments and two designated sheep driveways. Livestock grazing contributes to the livelihood of the permittees and to the economy of local communities and counties. Although the federal parcel could be utilized for grazing (among other uses), as specified in the LMP, grazing does not currently occur on the site and the parcel is not included in any grazing allotment (USFS 2015a). Non-federal Land Privately-administered grazing leases exist on 15 of the non-federal parcels (figure 17): • Carlisle Parcel  • Happy Valley 40 Parcel • Happy Valley East Parcel • Happy Valley West Parcel • Harshaw Creek Parcel • Mansfield Parcel • Pleasant Valley Parcel • Red Rover Parcel • Ronstadt Highway Parcel • Ronstadt Tank Parcel • Rucker East Parcel • Rucker West Parcel • Tonto Creek 1 Parcel • Tonto Creek 2 Parcel • Tonto Creek 3 Parcel The individuals who hold grazing leases on the non-federal parcels are also permittees with authorized active permits for grazing on allotments on adjacent federal land. The allotments are managed through separate permits by the individual ranger districts. Grazing does not currently occur on any of the other non-federal parcels (USFS 2014c). Figure 17. Grazing Activities on the federal and non-federal parcels proposed for exchange  Grazing Activities on Federal and Non-federal Parcels to be ExchangedEnvironmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Since the federal parcel is not part of a grazing allotment, the land exchange would not result in any reduction of animal units on an active grazing allotment and have no direct or indirect impacts to grazing. Non-federal Land Under the Proposed Action, the existing grazing leases on the non-federal lands would be terminated. Since, the grazing leases on the non-federal parcels belong to the same permittees on adjacent federal land, the permittees are likely to be able to continue to graze livestock on the exchanged parcel if the USFS is able to expand the existing allotment. The non-federal lands would be integrated into ongoing USFS management plans for each respective area and the non-federal parcels would be evaluated by the USFS for potential inclusion in any surrounding grazing allotments and permits. However, any decision to authorize future livestock grazing on the affected allotments is not a component of the analysis for an exchange of lands and would be considered in a separate environmental analysis following the exchange. Because the areas surrounding the non-federal parcels would continue to be grazed under the existing allotments, no significant direct or indirect effects to grazing are anticipated from the Proposed Action. Cumulative Effects The non-federal lands would be integrated into the USFS management plans area under the Proposed Action. The federal land would not be part of a grazing allotment initially. Any future grazing effects to the non-federal lands, if any, would be considered in the environmental analysis for the affected allotments. There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the Proposed Action, would result in substantial impacts to grazing. No cumulative effects are anticipated. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Since the federal parcel is not part of a grazing allotment nor would any changes occur to the parcel under the no action alternative, no direct or indirect impacts to grazing would occur. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the non-federal parcels would remain private and would likely continue to be grazed as they currently are, so no direct or indirect effects to grazing would occur. Cumulative Effects Since no changes to grazing would occur on the federal or non-federal parcels and grazing doesn’t occur on the federal parcel, no cumulative effects would occur under this alternative. Wetlands and Floodplains Affected Environment Water resources reports were prepared for the federal and non-federal land parcels that are part of the proposed land exchange. Information from these reports is summarized below. Federal Land Parcel The federal parcel has 0 acres of wetlands and 0 acres of floodplains. Non-federal Land Parcels As summarized in Table 23, the non-federal parcels contain approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplains (USFS 2014b). Table 23.

The total surface area inundated by the stock tank is approximately 2.9 acres and can contain up to approximately 27 acre-feet of water (USFS 2011). The earthen stock tank and overflow spillway appear to be in good condition with no erosion or sinkholes (USFS 2011). Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land No direct or indirect effects to wetlands or floodplains would occur with transfer of the federal parcel to private ownership as the parcel does not contain any wetlands or floodplains. Non-federal Land With acquisition of the non-federal parcels the USFS would receive a net gain of up to approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplains. These wetlands and floodplains and any associated riparian habitat would then be managed by the USFS and would receive greater protection under federal jurisdiction and management. This would complement the USFS’s ongoing efforts to protect and increase riparian habitat. This would also comply with USFS policy (Forest Service Manual [FSM] 2527.3) and is consistent with the intent of Executive Order (EO) 11988, Floodplain Management and EO 11990, Protection of Wetlands. The livestock and wildlife watering tank at the Ronstadt Tank parcel would continue to provide a source of water for wildlife and for livestock if the parcel were included in a grazing allotment in the future and would also benefit from management by the USFS. If acquired in the land exchange, the tank would be classified as a “Class D Dam” (FSM 7511.1) and would have a hazard classification of LOW (FSM 7511.2(1)). Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects with regards to wetlands and floodplains are discussed in a general qualitative manner due to the scale of the analysis area. A number of past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions have the potential to impact wetlands and floodplains: • The proposed Second Knoll Target Range and associated access roads in the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs. • The Woodland Lake Park Tract Townsite Act Purchase project, which would result in a net loss of 543 acres of land administered by the ASNFs but there is no expected change to existing wetlands and floodplains in the parcels to be sold. • The sale of National Forest lands at the Lakeside Ranger Station under the Forest Service Facility Realignment & Enhancement Act, which would result in no expected change to existing wetlands or floodplains. • Timber Mesa – Vernon Wildland-Urban Interface Project. • The Show Low South Land Exchange on the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coconino, and Prescott national forests, which would result in USFS receiving a net gain of approximately 110.5 acres of wetlands and between 163 and 166 acres of floodplains. • The Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration in the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs. • The Show Low South Fire Risk and Fuels Reduction in the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs. • Residential development as addressed in the City of Show Low General Plan. While these projects could potentially affect wetlands and floodplains, these projects on NFS lands are managed to mitigate impacts to wetlands. Under the Proposed Action alternative, a net gain in approximately 98 acres of wetlands and 527.76 acres of floodplain would occur. Other projects would result in either a net gain (approximately 110.5 acres of wetlands and between 163 and 166 acres of floodplain under the Show Low South Land Exchange) or no change in acreage of existing wetlands and floodplains and in conjunction with the proposed action would result in a cumulative gain in and protection of wetlands and floodplains. Federal acquisition of additional lands containing these resources would contribute towards reversing the long-term trend of declining riparian habitat in the southwest. With more stringent management objectives under federal ownership, beneficial cumulative impacts are anticipated. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Since no wetlands or floodplains exist on the federal parcel and no changes would occur to the parcel under the no action alternative, no cumulative adverse effects to wetlands or floodplains would occur. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, no immediate change to wetlands or floodplains is expected; however, future development and use of these lands would be at the discretion of the private landowners and dependent on any developments or uses, could negatively affect wetlands and floodplains and potentially remove associated riparian habitat. Cumulative Effects There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the no action alternative, would result in substantial impacts to wetlands or floodplains. Water Rights/Claims & Water Quality Affected Environment Federal Land The federal parcel does not have any naturally occurring intermediate or perennial waters located on the parcel nor any water rights or claims. Water quality in the Show Low Creek watershed, which includes areas of the federal parcel, is monitored by the Arizona Department of Water Quality and the City of Show Low and managed through the Show Low Creek Watershed Enhancement Partnership (2007). Water in the watershed is primarily used for municipal, recreational, and some agricultural and industrial purposes and is supplied mostly by snowmelt and Pinetop, Thompson, and Scott Springs. Drought conditions from 1996 to 2005, coupled with increasing residential growth, spurred shortages in water supplies in the Show Low and Pinetop-Lakeside area and drew concern for water quality issues. In 1988, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality placed the nearby Rainbow Lake on Arizona’s 303(d) list of impaired waters due to excessive weeds, pH, and nutrient overloading. The issues were due primarily from agricultural and residential pollutants that infiltrate tributaries such as Show Low Creek.  Non-federal Land No existing water rights have been identified on the Happy Valley 40, Happy Valley East, Happy Valley West, Babcock, Red Rover, Tonto Creek, or Pleasant Valley parcels. A Water Resources Evaluation was completed as part of the Feasibility Analysis (USFS 2014b) and details the existing water rights on the remaining parcels. The findings of that evaluation are summarized below. The Carlisle parcel includes one claim (Certificate Record No. 38-83314) for 2 acre-feet per year stock pond for use as stockwater.  The Stronghold parcel has no surface water rights; however, it does have a divided interest well. The Stronghold parcel, as defined in this analysis includes an undivided 2/20th interest in and to the well site; Well Registration No. 55-610090. No known agreement exists between any of the interest holders regarding how this well is maintained or managed. The Ronstadt Tank parcel includes both a surface claim and a registered well. The surface claim (Certificate of Water Right No. 33-089677) authorizes use of the waters of Bar X Canyon for the purpose of stock watering. This is used primarily in conjunction with the use of a grazing permit on the adjacent federal lands (Forest Grazing Permit 50462, 0 Bar 0 Allotment). The well site (Well Registration No. 55- 601473) is similarly used for stock watering. The Ronstadt Highway parcel includes two distinct surface water claims for the purpose of stock watering. Statement of Claim of Right to Use Public Waters of the State No. 36-102332 includes 0.5 acre-foot per year within section 3, and 0.2 acre-foot per year within section 4, Township 10 South, Range 24 East. Certificate of Water Right No. 33-89575 includes the waters of a unnamed wash, a tributary of Pitchfork Canyon for the purpose of stock watering, and for a volume up to 768,000 gallons per year and storage up to 2 acre-feet. The Mansfield parcel includes one surface claim to be used for stockwater and mining. The claim is registered as Assignment (Conveyance) of Statement of Claim No. 36-48816 and is for up to 16 acre-feet per year. The Harshaw Creek parcel includes one surface claim to be used for stock watering. The claim is for the Santa Cruz River, Harshaw Creek, (Registry No. 36-102368.2), and is for 2 acre-feet per year. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Since no naturally occurring intermediate or perennial waters are located on the parcel and no water rights or claims exist, no direct or indirect effects to water rights/claims would occur. While the transfer of the federal parcel to private ownership would have development limited by current zoning, any future zoning changes would have to be considered in light of regional water quality as an increase in demand for water use in the Show Low and Pinetop-Lakeside area could further the issues facing the watershed. Non-federal Land Under the Proposed Action, agreed upon water rights/claims (up to a total of 720 acre-feet in annual volume) would be conveyed to federal ownership. Under the protection of the USFS, the parcels would not be developed and no adverse effects to water quality would occur. Cumulative Effects There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the Proposed Action alternative, would result in measurable cumulative impacts to water quality, rights, or claims. Any future land exchanges, including the planned Show Low South Exchange, would involve a similar trade of lands and any associated water rights and claims. However, as with the Proposed Action alternative, land exchanges often involve a net gain of water rights and claims. In general, projects on national forests are designed to minimize effects to water quality. No cumulative impacts are anticipated. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would continue to be managed by the Forest Service and no direct or indirect effects to water rights/claims or water quality would occur. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the non-federal parcels would remain in private ownership and water rights/claims would continue. While the parcels could be developed at the discretion of the landowners and development could affect water quality, plans would likely include mitigation measures to avoid major impacts to water quality. No adverse direct or indirect impacts to water rights/claims or water quality would likely occur. Cumulative Effects There are no known actions that, in conjunction with the no action alternative, would result in cumulative impacts to water quality, rights, or claims. Cultural Resources Affected Environment Federal Land An intensive pedestrian survey for cultural resources (Leonard 2006) was conducted for the entire parcel of land proposed for exchange out of federal ownership. This survey resulted in the identification of 12 archaeological sites and 38 isolated occurrences. Five additional isolates were found in 2006 during unrelated surveys on the parcel. Two additional historic sites were documented in 2007. Five of the cultural resource sites and all of the isolated occurrences were determined not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP; Leonard 2006, Stein 2007). The sites within the federal parcel determined not eligible to the National Register with SHPO concurrence include: AR-03-01-07-1383/AZ P:16:236 (ASM) – Rock pile AR-03-01-07-1387/AZ P:16:240 (ASM)  – Historic artifact scatter AR-03-01-07-1388/ AZ P:16:241 (ASM)  – Historic road segment AR-03-01-07-1428/No ASM number – Historic Camp Grace AR-03-01-07-2101/No ASM number – Historic Camp Tatiyee The remaining National Register-eligible sites located within the federal parcel include: AR 03-01-07-1378/AZ P:16:231 (ASM) - Lithic and ceramic scatter AR-03-01-07-1379/AZ P:16:232 (ASM) - Mogollon habitation site AR 03-01-07-1380/AZ P:16:233 (ASM) - Bedrock milling area AR-03-01-07-1381/AZ P:16:234 (ASM) - Lithic and ceramic scatter AR 03-01-07-1382/AZ P:16:235 (ASM) - Bedrock milling area, Apache petroglyph, and lithic scatter AR-03-01-07-1384/AZ P:16:237 (ASM) - Lithic and ceramic scatter AR 03-01-07-1385/AZ P:16:238 (ASM) - Bedrock milling area AR-03-01-07-1386/AZ P:16:239 (ASM) - Bedrock milling area AR-03-01-07-1389/AZ P:16:242 (ASM) – Historic irrigation ditch (1909) All prehistoric sites listed above are eligible for listing in the NRHP under criterion D for their potential to yield information important to understanding the prehistory of the area. The historic irrigation ditch (AR-03-01-07-1389/AZ P:16:242 [ASM]) is eligible for listing in the NRHP under criterion A for its importance to the development of local agricultural infrastructure.  However, continued use and maintenance of the ditch has obliterated or replaced any original features dating before fifty years ago. Therefore, no further archaeological work was recommended and “no further treatment was recommended.”  Non-federal Land AZSite, Arizona’s online cultural resource inventory system, was examined for archaeological surveys and resources within the 18 non-federal parcels. The record search indicated that four of these parcels had been partially surveyed: the Happy Valley East parcel (three surveys); the Ronstadt Highway parcel (one survey); Rucker West parcel (one survey); and the Tonto Creek 1 parcel (one survey). Of the survey efforts that were carried out on portions of these parcels, only the survey for the Rucker West parcel resulted in any cultural resources being recorded  (Horton 1999). The survey in the Rucker West parcel is a small linear corridor running through the parcel. Three sites were recorded within the parcel, two of them, a multicomponent prehistoric ceramic scatter and historic house foundation and a prehistoric lithic scatter that have been determined eligible for the NRHP (Horton 1999). Archaeological surveys have not been conducted on 14 of the non-federal parcels: the Carlisle, Happy Valley 40, Happy Valley West, Harshaw Creek, Mansfield, Ronstadt Tank, Rucker East, Stronghold, Stronghold Well, Babcock, Red Rover, Tonto Creek 2, Tonto Creek 3, and Pleasant Valley parcels. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land In accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, nine Native American tribes and one chapter were notified of the project: Hopi Tribe, Navajo Nation, Pueblo of Zuni, San Carlos Apache Tribe, Tonto Apache Tribe, White Mountain Apache Tribe, Yavapai-Apache Tribe, Yavapai- Prescott Tribe, Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, and the Ramah Chapter of the Navajo Nation. Under the Proposed Action, nine archeological sites on the federal parcel considered eligible for listing in the NRHP would be adversely affected by the proposed transfer of these properties out of federal control. One eligible archaeological site, AR-03-01-07-1389, is a historic irrigation ditch constructed in 1909. The Ditch Bill Act of 1986 grants permanent easements for irrigation ditches across federal land. SHPO concurrence on National Register eligibility (concurrence date is 12/4/2007), states, "This site is of local historical interest and is considered eligible for the [NRHP] under Criterion A, because it pertains to the historic development of the local agricultural infrastructure.  However, continued use and maintenance of the ditch has obliterated or replaced any original features dating before A.D. 1950.  Therefore, no further archaeological work is recommended.  The easement, ownership, operation, and use of the ditch would not be affected by the proposed land exchange, and this site will not be considered further. For the remaining eight archaeological sites eligible for the NRHP that would be adversely affected by the Proposed Action, a historic properties treatment plan and memorandum of agreement among the SHPO and the USFS was developed to resolve and mitigate the direct and indirect adverse effects (USFS 2014d). Mitigation measures in the treatment plan include photographic documentation, mapping the sites, conducting surface artifact collections, and data recovery through excavation. Through documentation and data recovery, adverse effects to these sites would be mitigated. Non-federal Land Transfer of the non-federal lands to federal ownership would have a beneficial effect on any cultural resources present. Any cultural resource sites found on the non-federal lands would come under federal management and would receive the full protection of federal laws. No negative direct or indirect effects to cultural resources would occur to cultural resources on the non-federal land as a result of the Proposed Action. Cumulative Effects Federal Land Policies set forth in the ASNFs LMP are designed to avoid or mitigate adverse effects to cultural resources. Because of these policies, all future projects in progress or proposed for the ASNFs, which are considered as cumulative events, include appropriate avoidance and mitigation practices for cultural resources. Several planned or reasonably foreseeable activities within the Lakeside RD of the ASNFs have the potential to adversely affect cultural resources. Four actions on the ASNFs; the Rim Country Restoration project, in conjunction with the KNF, TNF and CNF, the Timber Mesa-Vernon Wildland Urban Interface Fuels Reduction and Forest Restoration Project, Show Low South Fire Risk and Fuels Reduction Project, and Upper Rocky Arroyo Restoration Project involve work with vegetation for fuels reduction and/or habitat restoration. Each of these projects requires that all known cultural resources be avoided or treated to reduce the potential for negative fire impacts by use of Appendix J of the Region 3 Programmatic Agreement. The cumulative effects of these projects would be a net beneficial effect for cultural resources through protection from uncharacteristic wildfire. Three additional planned or reasonably foreseeable actions; the Woodland Lake Park Townsite Act Purchase, Lakeside Ranger Station Conveyance, and the Show Low South Land Exchange are expected to transfer six archaeological sites eligible for the NRHP and two unevaluated archaeological sites out of federal ownership, and adversely affect one eligible site through construction. Any adverse effects anticipated through these projects would be mitigated through data recovery in consultation with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Arizona SHPO, and culturally affiliated Tribes. Data recovery as a mitigation strategy would lead to a cumulative loss of historic properties. The loss of the National Register-eligible and unevaluated sites is significant, but loss of the archaeological sites will be recovered through data recovery.  The loss of an Apache petroglyph site from federal ownership protection located within the federal parcel can be mitigated with a preservation agreement between the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the proponent/new land owner(s), and a suggested protection measure for the site was agreed to by the tribal representative and LFA. Non-federal Land Parcels The acquisition of additional lands through the Show Low South Land Exchange in conjunction with the acquisition of the non-federal parcels under this project may have a cumulative beneficial effect on cultural resources. Any cultural resources on non-federal land that do not currently receive protection, would receive federal protection once the land is transferred into federal ownership. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would not be transferred out of federal ownership and would continue to be administered by the ASNFs. All federal lands within the ASNFs are managed according to the ASNFs forest plan, which mandates protection for cultural resources. As a result of this protection, no adverse effects to cultural resources on federal lands would occur. Non-federal Land Cultural resources on non-federal lands would continue to remain in private ownership and receive no additional protection with the exception of human burials, which are protected under the Burial Protection Law (Arizona Revised Statues [ARS] 41-865 and ARS 410844). If present, direct or indirect adverse effects to cultural resources could occur as a result of future development activities. Under the no action alternative, the added benefit of consideration and protection for cultural resources when under federal control would not occur. Cumulative Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, assuming that the other proposed land exchanges take place, the cumulative effects to cultural resources on NFS lands would be the same as described in the cumulative effects of the Proposed Action, except that fourteen sites located within the Camp Tatiyee parcel would not be transferred out of federal ownership and protection. As discussed in the cumulative effects section for the Proposed Action, the adverse cumulative effects to cultural resources would be mitigated through data recovery. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the cumulative effects to cultural resources on non-federal lands would be the same as described in the cumulative effects of the Proposed Action. The effects of past, presents and reasonably foreseeable projects could result in the transfer of cultural resources into federal ownership and protection, if there are cultural resources located on those lands. Through the transfer of non-federal lands into federal ownership, additional resources would receive protection with a net beneficial effect to the cultural resources that had no protections under private ownership. Mineral Resources Affected Environment A mineral report (dated 7 August 2003) was prepared by a certified mineral examiner for Region 3 of the USFS for the exchange parcels in 2003 and updated in 2008. Conclusions of this report are presented below. Federal Land The federal parcel has little to no potential for mineral commodities; a low potential for coal, oil, and gas; and is not considered prospectively valuable. Non-federal Land None of the non-federal parcels are considered prospectively valuable. The Happy Valley, Stronghold, Rucker, and Ronstadt parcels are not prospectively valuable for leasable minerals, and have low potential for locatable minerals and salable minerals. Several of the remaining parcels have low to moderate potential for resources: • The Carlisle non-federal parcel has low potential for coal and oil & gas. The parcel has low potential for locatable minerals and salable minerals. • The Mansfield parcel has low to moderate potential for locatable minerals, and low potential for salable minerals. • The Harshaw Creek parcel has low potential for sodium and potassium. • The Babcock parcel has low to moderate potential for locatable minerals, and low potential for salable minerals. • The Red Rover parcel has low to moderate potential for locatable minerals, and low potential for salable minerals. • The Tonto Creek and Pleasant Valley parcels have low potential for locatable minerals. The mineral report was forwarded to the Bureau of Land Management, Albuquerque, New Mexico office, which submitted their concurrence on 2 December 2008. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Although any mineral resources on the federal parcel would be conveyed along with the land surface of the federal parcel, no direct or indirect effects are expected for mineral resources for the federal parcel, because it has low potential for mineral resources and is not considered prospectively valuable, the camps intend to continue operation, and if the rest of the parcel were zoned for development in the future, it would likely be residentially developed with the possibility of a few commercial businesses. Non-federal Land Mineral resources on the non-federal parcels would be conveyed along with the surfaces of the parcels and management of the resources on the parcels would follow the respective forest plan. While exploration of minerals could occur on some of the parcels, no plans exist to further explore the potential for locatable minerals on the Mansfield, Babcock, Red Rover, Tonto Creek, Pleasant Valley, or any of the other non-federal parcels and no plans exist to pursue the potential for oil, gas, or coal on the Carlisle parcel or any of the other non-federal parcels. No effects regarding mineral resources are expected to occur.  Cumulative Effects With no direct or indirect effects to mineral resources, no cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Mineral estates would remain the same under the no action alternative with no change occurring to current use and management of the federal parcel and no future use of mineral resources expected; therefore, no effects regarding mineral resources would occur.  Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the non-federal parcels and any possible mineral resources therein would remain in private ownership and could be developed or explored for mineral resources, but is unlikely. No direct or indirect effects on mineral resources are expected.  Cumulative Effects With no direct or indirect effects to mineral resources, no cumulative effects would occur. Roads Affected Environment Federal Land The federal parcel is located along the western side of SR 260 between Wagon Wheel Road (to the north) and Vallery Lane (to the south). SR260 is under a special use permit to AZ Dept. of Transportation and the other two roads are easements to Navajo County.  NFSR 300 (Mogollon Rim Drive) also passes through the eastern portion of the federal parcel but has been closed for public use for years. This roadway generally follows the southern boundary of the Lakeside RD. Sections of this road in adjacent sections to the parcel are under jurisdiction and management of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside (USFS 2008) as they were transferred with prior exchanges. The section of Mogollon Rim Drive to the north of the federal parcel is paved and currently open. A portion of the section immediately south of the federal parcel (the east 2835 feet) is partly paved and graveled.  The federal parcel also contains three short east/west roads that provide access to Camp Tatiyee, Camp Grace, and the Mogollon Rim Trail parking are and trailhead from SR 260. These roads are designated as open to all motorized vehicles. This designation includes Maintenance Level 2, which is assigned to roads open for use by high clearance vehicles. Non-federal Land Access to and from many of the non-federal parcels is provided by various NFSRs, and other public and private roadways. Table 24 lists NFSRs and other roadways that cross portions of the non-federal parcels. As described in the Feasibility Analysis (USFS 2014b), private landowners have informally permitted public access through their land via various NFSRs. Table 24. Access to and from non-federal parcels Parcel Name  NFSRs  Other Roads  Carlisle  134, 9892E  Two low-standard roads  Happy Valley (all parcels)  4408, 4410, 4411  N/A  Stronghold (both parcels)  84  N/A  Rucker (both parcels)  74, 74E  N/A  Ronstadt (both parcels)  4597, 665  SR 266  Mansfield  72A, 4092  N/A  Harshaw Creek  49, 58  N/A  Babcock  N/A  N/A  Parcel Name  NFSRs  Other Roads  Red Rover  2021  N/A  Tonto Creek (all parcels)  N/A  N/A  Pleasant Valley  134, 2725, 484  N/A  Note: N/A = Not Applicable. Source: USFS 2014b. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the Proposed Action, the segment of Mogollon Rim Drive and the three other USFS roads that provide access to Camp Tatiyee, Camp Grace, and the Mogollon Rim Trail parking area and trailhead would be transferred to private ownership. Management and use of the segment of Mogollon Rim Drive would be under control of the private landowner upon exchange. The roads to Camp Tatiyee, Camp Grace, and the Mogollon Rim Trail area are expected to remain open under private ownership for access to the two camps that are expected to continue operation and public access to the popular Mogollon Rim Trail by agreement of LFA. Use of these roads is expected to continue as currently occurs and no effects to local or regional traffic circulation from their use are expected. No non-NFS roads on the federal parcel would be affected by the land exchange. Although immediate development is not expected on the federal land parcel, a future indirect traffic effect may occur if this land is developed further on. As discussed in the Land Use section of this chapter, nearby land uses in the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside are designated for residential or commercial development and part of the parcel outside of the two camp areas could eventually be developed following zoning re-designation through processes of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. These types of developments could add new roads to the surrounding road system and thereby contribute to incremental increases in existing traffic volume in adjacent areas. Increases may necessitate traffic control measures to regulate the flow of traffic into and out of the parcel, particularly during peak commuting periods. The future indirect impacts of site development would generally be addressed in planning when a specific development proposal is brought to the Planning and Zoning department of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside and any adjustment to help regulate traffic addressed then. Non-federal Land Access to and from non-federal parcels would continue to be provided by the roads summarized in Table 24. After acquisition, possible future transportation improvements within the non-federal land would be in accordance with USFS travel management requirements and procedures, including the managing forest’s LMP, Travel Management Plan, and the Travel Management Rule. NFSRs that have been informally permitted for public use across the non-federal parcels would continue to be available for public access and USFS administrative resource management under the Proposed Action. Private roads on non-federal parcels would be analyzed for potential inclusion in the USFS transportation system and included where determined necessary or useful. Cumulative Effects Provided that access to surrounding areas is maintained, The Proposed Action would not contribute toward any direct cumulative effect on this resource. However, an indirect cumulative impact may occur as the result of potential future development of the federal parcel, as discussed above. The additional traffic associated with this development, taken together with traffic from present and reasonably foreseeable future projects, would increase traffic volumes on SR 260, NFSRs, and other public streets near the federal parcel. In turn, this may cause increased vehicle delays and queues at intersections, and increased congestion along roadway segments. The significance of this indirect cumulative impact should be determined by the applicant at the time a specific development proposal is brought forward to the Planning and Zoning department of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Where significant traffic impacts are identified, applicable measures should be implemented to reduce the effect to a less than significant level. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, the federal parcel would remain in USFS ownership and the existing USFS roads would be retained in their current condition and alignment. No direct or indirect impacts to roads would occur. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, possible indirect effects may arise if private landowners elect to revoke their informal permissions for NFSRs to cross their land. If revocation of permission were to occur, the NFSRs would no longer be available for public access and administrative resource management. However, no current indications that permissions may be revoked currently exists and roads are expected to remain as they are, so no or few impacts are currently expected. Cumulative Effects Since roads are expected to remain in the same ownership and conditions, this project would not contribute to any cumulative to roads in conjunction with other projects in the nearby vicinities. Fire and Fuels Affected Environment Federal Land Existing levels of live and dead fuels on the federal parcel are generally consistent with surrounding forest lands. No evidence of recent wildfires exists on the federal parcel. The parcel underwent fuels treatment in 2005 – 2006 as authorized in a Decision Memo issued in 2004 (USFS 2004). Treatment was accomplished via mechanical thinning to achieve a goal of 60 square feet of basal area per acre and materials/fuels were removed how so. Thinning of live trees was accomplished. Non-federal Land Fuels on the non-federal parcels are generally consistent with surrounding NFS land. Three of the non-federal parcels were burned in part of major fire events within the past 15 years. The Cave Creek Complex fire was initiated by a lightning strike in 2005 and burned a total of 43,950 acres, including the entirety of the Red Rover parcel. The Grapevine Fire was initiated by lightning in 2012 and burned a total of 18,431 acres, including the majority of the Ronstadt Highway parcel and parts of the Ronstadt Tank parcel. Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land With exchange of the federal parcel, implementation of fire and fuel treatments would be at the discretion of the new landowner. Firefighting capabilities would be provided to meet requirements of the respective counties. The Forest Service would be responsible for ensuring that proper vegetation management occurs within the wildland-urban interface to mitigate or lessen the potential of wildfires from spreading from forest land to the newly acquired private parcels. Non-federal Land Management of the non-federal parcels would become the responsibility of the USFS, and fire and fuels management would be consistent with the respective forest plans. Cumulative Effects The Cave Creek Complex Fire killed many of the trees and older shrubs on the Red Rover parcel; however, the majority of the parcel vegetation is grasses, so the parcel experienced low to moderate intensity surface fires that burned quickly. Similar conditions existed on the Ronstadt Tank and Highway parcels, where the Grapevine Fire was primarily grass- and brush-fed, and thus fairly fast burning. Future fuels reduction and management projects that are completed across all the involved forests would help continue to ensure that the risk of fire to residential properties, including those resulting from development within the federal parcels proposed for exchange, is minimized or eliminated. No cumulative effects would occur. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Fire and fuels on and in the vicinity of the federal parcels would not be affected by the no action alternative. The federal parcels would continue to be managed following the ASNFs forest plan for Community-Forest Intermix Management Areas. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, the private owners of the non-federal parcels would continue to be responsible for implementation of any fire and fuel treatments during and following development. Firefighting capabilities would be provided to meet requirements of the respective counties. Fire and fuels management in the surrounding forest lands would be the responsibility of the Forest Service. No direct or indirect effects with regards to fire and fuels would occur. Cumulative Effects There are no direct or indirect effects to fire and fuels; therefore, no cumulative effects would occur. Hazardous Materials Affected Environment The federal and non-federal lands proposed for exchange have been examined in accordance with Section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Phase I Environmental Site Assessments were completed for the federal and non-federal parcels. These evaluations were conducted via records searches, interviews, and site visits consistent with good commercial or customary practice as set forth in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Designation E 1527-05. The objective of the environmental site assessments was to evaluate each parcel for recognized environmental conditions (RECs) that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substance or petroleum product into structures on the properties or into the ground, groundwater, or surface water of the properties. The Phase I Environmental Site Assessments also evaluated each parcel for Issues of Concern (IOCs), a non-ASTM term used to identify an environmental-related issue of interest to the purchaser of the subject site that does not rise to the level of a REC, such as out-of-date permits, or the presence of toxic substances regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act such as asbestos-containing building materials, lead-based paint, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and the potential for radon gas to accumulate inside structures. Federal Land The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment found no evidence of recent or historical RECs associated with the federal parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Small amounts of hazardous materials such as gasoline, diesel, and oil-based paints are used and stored at both Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace for basic appropriate uses of those materials (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). The types and quantities are similar to what would be used by a small landscaping business (i.e. 30 gallons being the largest quantity and the most common quantities ranging from one to five gallons)These materials are stored on concrete surfaces (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a).  Electrical transformers at Camp Grace were clearly marked as non-PCB containing units (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Transformers elsewhere on the federal parcel were observed to be in good condition with no evidence of stains or leaks (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment also noted the Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. Wagon Wheel electrical substation and 40-foot wide 69 kilovolt transmission line on the federal parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Transformers and other electrical equipment associated with the substation and the transmission line were observed to be in good condition with no evidence of stains or leaks (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). Several IOCs exist on the parcel. The Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace buildings were constructed in the 1960s, so it is possible that they may contain lead-based paint and/or asbestos-containing building materials (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2011a). A 30-inch diameter concrete water pipeline built in the 1960s and taken out of service before 2007 crosses part of the parcel (Western Technologies, Inc. 2007). The pipeline is buried 10 to 20 feet below the ground surface. It is unknown whether the concrete pipeline contains asbestos, or what procedures were followed in the final closure of the pipeline west of the irrigation ditch (Western Technologies, Inc. 2007). Only a small portion of the extreme western end of the pipeline was actually closed. The line was capped with a riser installed to put water into the irrigation ditch. The pipeline is owned and operated by the City of Show Low. There are no plans to disturb the pipeline where it is currently buried. Non-federal Land Six RECs were identified during the Environmental Site Assessment conducted at the Mansfield parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). Waste rock piles at four former mine sites on the Mansfield parcel were identified as RECs due to their possible effects on water quality (increased turbidity during rainfall and erosion events; acidic runoff) within the Mansfield watershed (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). However, these four piles total an estimated 2,900 cubic yards covering approximately one acre of the +/-182.41 acres, with the majority of the material possibly having low concentrations of the sulfide minerals that contribute to acidic runoff (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). The former Dixie Mine located about 1/4 mile northwest of the Mansfield parcel was identified as an REC for the Mansfield parcel. Approximately 8,000 to 10,000 cubic yards of waste rock remaining from former mining activities exist at the Dixie Mine, which is upgradient from the Mansfield parcel and may be affecting surface and groundwater quality in the Mansfield Watershed, including the Mansfield parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). The former Dixie Mine is on NFS land. The former Hosey Mine located on NFS land about 1 mile west-northwest of the Mansfield parcel was also identified as an REC for the Mansfield parcel. The former Hosey Mine is listed on the Arizona State Hazardous Waste List/Environmental Protection Agency Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System (a part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [USEPA] Superfund) (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). Approximately 14,000 cubic yards of waste rock remain from former activities at the Hosey Mine (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). The site was assessed and assigned USEPA ID number AZ 0002001857 and is not listed on the Superfund National Priorities List (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a; USEPA 2010a, 2014). The non-National Priorities List status for the Hosey Mine is listed as “assessment complete-decision complete” (USEPA 2014). The former Hosey mine was identified as an REC for the Mansfield parcel because the large quantities of waste rock remaining at the Hosey Mine site may be affecting surface and groundwater within the Mansfield parcel (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009a). Since the Environmental Site Assessment was completed, the landowner has closed the open mine features and filled in shafts on the Mansfield parcel. Waste rock piles have also been reduced in size. The Environmental Site Assessment identifies two IOCs of potential lead-based paint and/or asbestos-containing building materials in an abandoned cabin of unknown age on the Mansfield parcel. However, the cabin was removed from the parcel by the landowner since the Environmental Site Assessment was completed, so the IOCs no longer apply. No RECs or IOCs were found at any of the other non-federal parcels (Tetra Tech EM Inc. 2009b, 2010, 2011b). Environmental Consequences Proposed Action Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land The use of hazardous materials such as gasoline, diesel, and oil-based paints would continue to be used at the two camps on the federal parcel with their continued operation and storage of the materials on concrete surfaces. No change in hazardous materials from existing conditions would occur and as materials are stored safely and used for appropriate uses, no effects from hazardous materials is expected. If buildings at either camp are renovated or demolished, the operators would be required to comply with all applicable federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations regarding testing, handling, and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. All other development should abide by federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations to minimize risk associated with hazardous materials. The Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. would continue to operate its Wagon Wheel electrical substation, the 69 kilovolt transmission line, and the electrical transformers at Camp Tatiyee in accordance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding the use and disposal of PCBs. If part of the parcel is developed in the future following rezoning, expansion of waste water treatment facilities at the Pinetop-Lakeside Sanitary District would adhere to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and USEPA requirements and provisions for solid waste disposal in an approved landfill in order to minimize the risk of impacts regarding hazardous materials. Since there are no RECs on the federal lands, and IOCs would be managed according to applicable federal and state regulations, no direct or indirect effects regarding hazardous materials are anticipated. Non-federal Land The only non-federal parcel where the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment identified RECs is the Mansfield parcel, where there is waste rock from past mining activity. The Mansfield parcel also has potential for surface and groundwater quality to be adversely affected by runoff from mining waste rock on surrounding NFS land. The DOI Bureau of Land Management and the USFS jointly operate an Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) program to improve the quality of the public lands the two agencies manage (DOI Bureau of Land Management and USDA Forest Service 2007). The AML program implements a risk-based approach to encourage watershed-wide cleanups, and addresses high-risk and high-priority abandoned sites to protect public health and safety (DOI Bureau of Land Management and USDA Forest Service 2007). The waste rock on the Mansfield parcel would be evaluated and assigned a priority for cleanup under the AML program. No other non-federal lands contain RECs associated with past mining or potentially hazardous materials. The evaluation and potential eventual remediation of the waste rock on the Mansfield parcel would result in a positive effect on the local resources. Cumulative Effects Federal Land The only hazardous materials present on the federal parcel are the small quantities used at Camps Tatiyee and Camp Grace. Under the Proposed Action, the camps would continue to operate and use the same types and quantities of hazardous materials they presently use; thus there would be no cumulative impact with respect to hazardous materials. Given proper testing, management, transportation and disposal of any identified lead-based paint and/or asbestos-containing materials in the Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace buildings if they were renovated in the future, and the unused City of Show Low water pipeline there would be no cumulative hazardous materials impact. Non-federal Land No RECs or IOCs exist on the non-federal lands, except for waste rock from past mining activities the Mansfield parcel. Since the Mansfield parcel would be evaluated and assigned a priority for cleanup under the AML program, the cumulative impacts with regard to hazardous materials would be positive. No Action Alternative Direct and Indirect Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, no change would occur to the current use and management of the federal parcels so no effects from hazardous materials are expected. The types and quantities of hazardous materials used at Camp Tatiyee and Camp Grace would continue to be used stored appropriately. If buildings at either camp are renovated or demolished, the operators would be required to comply with all applicable federal, state of Arizona, and local rules and regulations regarding testing, handling, transporting and disposal of asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. The Navopache Electric Cooperative, Inc. would continue to operate its Wagon Wheel electrical substation, the 69 kilovolt transmission line, and the electrical transformers at Camp Tatiyee in accordance with all applicable federal and state regulations regarding the use and disposal of PCBs, and the rest of the parcel would remain as is; therefore, no direct or indirect effect from hazardous materials are expected. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, no change would occur to the current use and management of the non-federal parcels. The Mansfield parcel would not be evaluated for potential cleanup under the AML program and a potential for adverse hazardous materials impact from lack of evaluation and cleanup could occur. Cumulative Effects Federal Land Under the no action alternative, there would be no change from existing conditions on the federal parcel; therefore, there would be no direct or indirect cumulative hazardous materials impacts on the federal parcel. Non-federal Land Under the no action alternative, there would be no change from existing conditions. The waste mine rock on the Mansfield parcel would not be evaluated for potential cleanup under the AML and would continue to contribute sediments and acidic runoff to the Mansfield watershed. This could contribute to some cumulative adverse hazardous materials impacts.Chapter 4. Other Considerations Required Under NEPA Prime and Unique Farmlands Under the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA) (7 U.S. Code § 4201 [2011]), federal agencies are directed to identify and take into account the adverse effects of federal programs on the preservation of farmland, to consider appropriate alternative actions which could lessen adverse effects, and to assure that such federal programs are, to the extent practicable, compatible with state or local government programs and policies to protect farmland. FPPA guidelines developed by the USDA apply to farmland classified as prime or unique, or of state or local importance. Farmland subject to FPPA does not have to be currently used for cropland.  All of the parcels were reviewed, and no prime or unique farmland was found, so analysis of effects to farmland was not considered in Chapter 3. Details of information of the review of the parcels for prime or unique farmland follows:  The federal parcel is composed of Amos clay loam, Overgaard gravelly loam, and Overgaard-Elledge complex. None of the soils located on the parcel are considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014). The Babcock parcel is composed of Barkerville extremely rocky sandy loam and Moano very rocky loam. These soils are not considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014). Happy Valley East parcel is composed of Romero-Nodman rock outcrop complex and Mabray rock outcrop complex. These soils are not considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014). The Harshaw Creek parcel is composed of Grabe-Comoro complex, Fareway rock outcrop complex, and Chihuahua-Lampshire association. The Grabe-Comoro complex is considered prime and unique farmland, if irrigated. However, no area of the Harshaw Creek parcel is currently used for agriculture and the Harshaw Creek parcel is not irrigated. Thus, the Grabe-Comoro complex is not considered prime and unique farmland. The remaining Harshaw Creek parcel soils are not considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014). The Mansfield parcel is composed of Lampshire-Graham rock outcrop association, Barkerville-Gaddes and association. Neither of these soils are considered prime and unique farmland (USDA 2014). The remaining non-federal parcels do not have available soil data. Given the lack of prime and unique farmland soils in the geographic area, it is highly unlikely that prime and unique farmland occurs on the Carlisle, Pleasant Valley, Red Rover, Stronghold, Stronghold Well Site, Tonto Creek 1, Tonto Creek 2, and Tonto Creek 3 parcels (USDA 2014). The Rondstadt Highway, Ronstadt Tank, Rucker East, and Rucker West parcels all have prime and unique farmland (if irrigated) within 5 miles, but no area of these parcels is currently irrigated (USDA 2014). Short-term Uses and Long-term Productivity NEPA requires consideration of “the relationship between short-term uses of man’s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity” (40 CFR 1502.16). As declared by Congress, this includes using all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare of and to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans (NEPA Section 101). The exchange would result in the permanent transfer of the federal parcel into private ownership and the up to 18 non-federal parcels into federal ownership. Since the two camps on the federal parcel are expected to continue operation, little, if any, change in short-term uses or long-term productivity on these sections of the conveyed lands are expected. The future of the remaining sections of the Camp Tatiyee parcel are less clear. Based on current zoning of “open space” no development would occur in the immediate future. However, the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside does include a procedure for a landowner to seek changes in zoning that could allow for future development. If development were to occur on the remaining part of the conveyed federal parcel, impacts to the productivity of upland soils from compaction and the removal of trees and some of the open space could occur where building foundations or concrete slabs and buildings are constructed. Open space, however, remains abundant in areas surrounding the town and the Mogollon Rim Trail would remain with a buffer leading out to scenic vistas that overlook an expanse of open forest land on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Any foreseeable future development on the federal lands would not result in any measurable effects to threatened or endangered plant and animal species or their habitat as the only species with potential habitat is the Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuens), and known populations exist within the project area or within dispersal distance, the last recorded frog on Lakeside RD was in the 1970s, and presence of crayfish, non-native fish, and/or bullfrogs would likely prevent this species from occurring within any riparian zone or wetted area in or near the project area. Since the federal parcel is completely surrounded by city and reservation land and much of the land within the city limits was at points in time made available for private ownership through transfer from federal ownership, exchange of the federal parcel and some future development could contribute to a small increase in economic productivity and availability of land for development in the area if zoned for development in the future. The Proposed Action would preclude development on the non-federal parcels, providing protection to the more sensitive soils and habitats of wetlands, riparian areas and riverine systems, increasing the likelihood of production of natural flora and fauna in those areas in the short and long-term. The Proposed Action affords greater long-term protection to listed species and management indicator species. This would occur as a result of the acquisition of important riparian and wildlife habitat currently located on the non-federal lands. With respect to management indicator species, forest-wide analyses do not indicate any management-induced trends that would be influenced by action or inaction at the scale of the proposed land exchange. Wetlands and floodplains in federal ownership are subject to more stringent management objectives than those in private ownership. Acquisition of the non-federal lands would contribute toward reversing the long-term trend of declining wetland and riparian habitat in the Southwestern Region. No wetlands or floodplains are located on the federal lands therefore, none would leave federal ownership. Unavoidable Adverse Effects Unavoidable adverse effects are expected to occur with implementation of the Proposed Action. Eight archaeological sites eligible for the NRHP would be adversely affected by the Proposed Action through transfer of these resources from public to private ownership. A historic properties treatment plan and MOA among the SHPO and the USFS were developed to resolve and mitigate the direct and indirect adverse effects to cultural resources from this exchange (USFS 2014d). Mitigation measures in the treatment plan include photographic documentation, mapping the sites, conducting surface artifact collections, and data recovery through excavation. Through data recovery, adverse effects to these sites would be mitigated. No unavoidable adverse effects are expected to occur as a result of the no action alternative, if no future development occurs. If future development occurs, the amount of impact, if any, would depend upon the scale, specific location and intensity of future development, and the types of cultural resources located within the area.  Irreversible and Irretrievable Commitments of Resources Irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources are those that cannot be regained, such as the extinction of a species, the removal of mined ore, or the destruction of cultural resources. The removal of National Register-eligible cultural resources from the land through data recovery and transference from NFS land to private land is an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources that would occur from the exchange of lands and resulting change in ownership. In the case of no action, the non-federal lands would remain subject to possible development at the discretion of the private landowners. If future development occurs, the change in land use from riparian influenced riverine habitats to residential home sites or other type of development could be considered an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources. Cumulative Effects Cumulative effects associated with the Proposed Action are detailed for each resource in Chapter 3 for both the Proposed Action and the no action alternative. Table 25 summarizes the cumulative effects of the Proposed Action in conjunction with the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions for the resources analyzed within this EIS. Table 25. Summary of cumulative effects Resource Name  Cumulative Impact  Does the Proposed Action Contribute to the Impact?  Is the Cumulative Impact Significant?  Land Use  Change in management of allowable land uses on all parcels involved in the exchange. The change is compounded with multiple other land exchanges in the region.   Yes  Yes-Neutral  Recreation and Public Access  Locally to the federal parcel, a cumulative loss of over 2,065 acres of NFS lands available for public recreation. Statewide, a net gain of over 3,618 acres of NFS lands available for public recreation.  Yes  No  Socioeconomics  Locally to the federal parcel, loss of PILT funding may potentially be offset via private property taxes. Where development is planned, local economic boosts may result via increased employment, property value, and purchase orders. Statewide, loss of property taxes on remote and undeveloped private land would be partially offset by PILT funding.  Yes  No  Plants Fish, and Wildlife  Locally to the federal parcel, there would be a loss of protected habitat used by northern goshawks and potentially used by Mexican spotted owls. Net gain of valuable riparian and sensitive species habitat for the USFS throughout the Region. Fuels treatment projects are anticipated to improve forest health throughout the region.  Yes  Yes-Beneficial  Resource Name  Cumulative Impact  Does the Proposed Action Contribute to the Impact?  Is the Cumulative Impact Significant?  Grazing  Impacts to grazing are limited to the Proposed Action and the planning efforts to revised LMPs on several of the Region’s forests. The LMP revisions are not expected to have substantial impacts to grazing.   Yes  No  Prime and Unique Farmlands  None of the regional land exchanges propose the conveyance of farmland from the USFS to a private party. LMP revision efforts may improve quality of NFS farmlands.  No  No  Wetlands and Floodplains  The USFS is anticipated to have a net cumulative gain in wetlands and floodplains. Riparian quality is expected to increase regionally as more waters come under USFS management.  Yes  Yes-Beneficial  Water Quality, Rights, and Claims  The USFS is anticipated to have a net cumulative gain in water rights and claims. Water quality is expected to increase regionally as more waters come under USFS management.   Yes  No  Cultural Resources  Land exchanges, including the Proposed Action, would result in a total of 21 cultural resource sites that would leave federal management within Navajo County. This impact is mitigated as determined appropriate for each project via tribal consultation and SHPO/ACHP consultation  Yes  Yes1  Mineral Resources  No plans for mining or mineral development are proposed as part of the Proposed Action or any of the present or reasonably foreseeable future projects.  No  No  Roads  No substantial direct cumulative impact is anticipated on road access, quantity, or maintenance. However, the development proposed as part of the Show Low South Land Exchange and Woodland Lake Park land sale has the potential to indirectly increase traffic throughout the region.   No  No  Fire and Fuels  Multiple fuels management projects are ongoing or proposed in the region. Past treatment on the federal parcel reduced fuel loading and fire risk.   No  No  Resource Name  Cumulative Impact  Does the Proposed Action Contribute to the Impact?  Is the Cumulative Impact Significant?  Hazardous Materials  None of the identified past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future actions are anticipated to introduce or expose hazardous materials to the environment.  No  No  Note: 1Impact is significant but would be mitigated through measures incorporated in the various projects. Other Required Disclosures NEPA at 40 CFR 1502.25(a) directs “to the fullest extent possible, agencies shall prepare draft environmental impact statements concurrently with and integrated with other environmental review laws and executive orders.” EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, tasks “each federal agency [to] make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high adverse human health and environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.” EO 12898, dated 11 February 1994, aims to: (1) focus the attention of federal agencies on the environmental and human health conditions in minority communities and low-income communities with the goal of achieving environmental justice; (2) foster non-discrimination in federal programs that substantially affect human health or the environment; and (3) give minority communities and low-income communities greater opportunities for public participation in and access to public information on matters relating to human health and the environment. The EO specifically requires that Native American populations are included in discussions and analysis of potentially affected minority and low-income populations. The USEPA describes environmental justice as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies (USEPA 2010b). Fair treatment means that no group of people, including racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic, should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal programs and policies. The goal of fair treatment is not to shift risks among populations but to identify potential disproportionately high and adverse effects and identify alternatives that may mitigate these effects. Federal agencies must provide minority and low-income communities with access to information on matters relating to human health or the environment and opportunities for input in the NEPA process, including input on potential effects and mitigation measures. Tables 9 and 14 identify race and ethnicity characteristics for the potentially affected areas and Tables 11 and 16 identify poverty characteristics of the affected areas. Impacts that have been identified throughout this EIS were reviewed to determine those that have the potential to adversely and disproportionately affect minority, low-income and tribal populations. None of the impacts would be focused to minority or low-income populations but a mix of populations in the area, White/Caucasian and other as well as minority populations. The project was also designed to minimize adverse impacts; involves features to maintain current uses, such as use of the Mogollon Rim Trail, utility uses, etc; and includes some possible beneficial impacts. The Cultural Resources section identifies adverse effects to cultural resource sites, which would be focused to related minority Native American populations. However, consultation with interested and affected tribes has occurred for several years and mitigation measures developed and agreed by the tribes that would help mitigate effects to sites through data recovery and other such measures. Effects to an Apache petroglyph would be mitigated through an agreement between the White Mountain Apache Tribe and the new land owner, who have already agreed on a protective measure. As long as results of the excavations are made available to Tribes and the White Mountain Apache Tribe continues to have unencumbered access to the petroglyph as expected, no minority or low-income groups would receive disproportionately high adverse effects. Chapter 5.

EA scoping comments are provided in a comment response analysis format as analyzed in a separate report, EIS scoping comments are included directly in a table as they were reviewed and used for refining the EIS analysis but not analyzed in a report, and DEIS comments are included verbatim in a comment response and issues analysis format as analyzed in a separate report. EA Scoping Period  Potential issues were screened to ascertain which are key to the proposed action (40CFR 1501.7(3)). A key issue is one that meets all of the following criteria: 1. Issue is within the scope of the analysis, 2. Issue is not decided by law, regulation or policy, 3. Issue is related to the decision, 4. Issue is amendable to scientific analysis rather than conjecture, and 5. Issue is not limited in extent, duration, nor intensity. The public scoping comments and/or questions were reviewed and grouped into the following categories/topics identified in the table.Table 26. Comments received during 2007 scoping period, responses/discussion, and topic analysis Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • We hope the analysis will thoroughly describe any habitat values on the parcel to be conveyed, and on each of the parcels to be acquired by the public. • The 344 acres of National Forest land located within the boundaries of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside  Analysis of effects on Threatened and Endangered species is required by the Endangered Species Act. A Biological Assessment will be prepared for TE species and consultation, if necessary, will be initiated with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests Plan requires analysis of Sensitive and Management Indicator Species and compliance with standards and guidelines related to the wildlife resource. Effects of the alternatives on the wildlife resource will be considered in the analysis. This issue is covered by existing laws and regulations. The EA will include a description of the habitat values during the analysis.  Natural Resources  • What does the public gain? • The Forest Service gains valuable land in far away communities for habitat and recreational usage.  The public would acquire numerous private inholdings scattered among four National Forests in Arizona, the total acreage of undeveloped forest lands in the State of Arizona that would be available for wildlife habitat and outdoor recreation would increase by 13 7 5 acres, there would be an increase in the total number of acres of floodplain under federal management, the amount of resources needed to annually inspect and maintain property boundaries shared with adjoining private lands would be reduced, and a parcel of National Forest land would be conveyed into private ownership for uses in a expanding community. It is expected that the two youth camps would continue to operate with the remainder of the property available for other local uses and future development. It is also likely that the Rim Trail would come under local management. The EA will discuss public benefits (why the exchange is in the public interest) during the analysis.  Natural Resources  • In conclusion, I think this proposed land exchange would be a net loss for the residents and tourists in this region, as well as the wildlife.  Comment noted. Effects to wildlife will be analyzed in the EA.  Natural Resources  • Please provide a discussion on how each parcel would be managed, especially parcels that have riparian habitat or special attributes.  Parcels that are acquired would be incorporated into the adjacent Management Area(s) as identified in each Forest LMP. Any additional site specific management criteria (such as for riparian or a special designation) would be determined through future project analysis once the lands have moved into federal ownership.  Natural Resources  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • The residents living in the area surrounding the 344 acres in question have a wonderful opportunity to use and enjoy the National Forest and a great many of them do. • Our home faces the area in question and we enjoy the wildlife and open view of our forest.  Direct access to the existing National Forest land from the adjacent/surrounding private property would be lost. The EA will discuss the effect on public recreation that is currently associated with the Federal parcel during the analysis.  Outdoor Recreation and Forest Access  • Also, the rim overlook trail is visited each year by thousands of people and it is accessible for the handicapped. • The local people would no longer have access to this land for hiking, jogging, exercising their pets, enjoying the forest as well as catching glimpses of the wildlife that still inhabits this parcel of forest land that abuts the reservation forest land. • If you do proceed with this exchange, please require the new owners to maintain public access to this trail (Rim Trail) so that this wonderful asset will not be taken away from us. • In conclusion, I think this proposed land exchange would be a net loss for the residents and tourists in this region, as well as the wildlife.  The Forest Service is working with the non-Federal party to find a way to maintain public access to and use of the Rim Trail. The EA will discuss the effect on public recreation that is currently associated with the Federal parcel during the analysis.  Outdoor Recreation and Forest Access  • There is no benefit to this community in the exchange this beautiful forest land for remote forest lands far from this community but will instead deny the local residents the outdoor recreation the 344 acres of forest land provide on a daily basis. • The Forest Service gains valuable land in far away communities for habitat and recreational usage. • To trade our own little "Central Park" in Pinetop-Lakeside for remote-unreachable forest lands all over the State of Arizona would be a disservice to the residents of Pinetop-Lakeside and Show Low as well.  Direct access to National Forest lands from the adjacent/surrounding private property would be lost. The Sitgreaves National Forest will continue to be readily accessible to the residents in the Pinetop-Lakeside area. The EA will discuss public benefits (why the exchange is in the public interest) during the analysis.  Outdoor Recreation and Forest Access  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • What are adjacent uses and their potential impacts on what would become federal land?  The use adjacent to the west side of the Carlisle parcel is rural residential and National Forest lands on the three other sides. The Tonto Creek parcels share common boundaries with private lands along their west sides. The private land is occupied by single family residences, RV parks or is undeveloped. As the non-Federal lands are almost entirely in the Tonto Creek drainage there is little likelihood that there would be any additional impacts to the land. The remaining parcels are either surrounded by National Forest lands or share common boundary with private lands that are undeveloped or minimally developed due to their remote locations. The EA will discuss the use of the adjacent lands and any known potential impacts during the analysis.  Future Development  • Are there long-term plans for acquisition of all the other private parcels adjacent to these that would be acquired?  Future acquisition of other private parcels adjacent to the identified non-Federal parcels would be determined by the availability of desirable properties and the direction in each National Forest Land Management Plan (LMP).  Future Development  • Please also discuss the proposed use(s) of the federal land being traded and the potential impacts of such use.  Currently, the Federal parcel adjoins residential properties along the north and south boundaries, State Highway 260 along its east boundary, and the White Mountain Apache Reservation along the west boundary. The foreseeable future uses on the federal land would be the continuation of the two existing youth camps and possibly the development of the remaining property as legally permitted and approved by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. The EA will discuss the foreseeable future uses on the Federal land and any known potential impacts during the analysis.  Future Development  • Most assuredly, the environment of the community in proximity to the 344 acres of forest land in question will not be improved by the commercial development that will, no doubt, immediately follow the proposed land exchange.  The foreseeable future uses on the Federal land will be discussed during the analysis. Future uses on the conveyed Federal land would be regulated by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Uses would need to comply with the local zoning ordinances. Determination of the need for and the type of future development as well as the process is the responsibility of the non-Federal party and Town of Pinetop-Lakeside once application is made. Existing laws and regulations cover this issue.  Future Development  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • Since we have no idea what the Lions Club plans to do with the land that is not part of Camp Tatiyee, we believe it would be a terrible mistake to make this exchange. • It is well established that the Lakeside area needs more land for development (should the Lions at some point develop the acreage not used by Camp Tatiyee) and such an exchange would protect Camp Tatiyee for future use. • Our concerns would be if part of the parcel would be sold off for development and the zoning that would be applied to the adjoining property to the north of us. We would want the same zoning as it is in our neighborhood along Vallery Lane, one acre or more. • The City of Pinetop/Lakeside wants commercial industry on this land in my front yard for tax benefits. • Camp Tatiyee would benefit financially by keeping its little parcel and selling off the remaining acreage o commercial entities at substantially inflated prices. • It is much more valuable to the community as a forest than as yet another commercial development. • While we realize the need for the Forest Service to acquire tracts for forest and wildlife management, we feel that the areas such as this should be protected for the benefit and use of people in neighborhoods that are quickly becoming more dense and busy. • It is a beautiful area and we'd hate to see it ruined with any kind of development as I'm sure this land swap is designed to do.  The foreseeable future uses on the Federal land will be discussed in the EA during the analysis. Future uses on the conveyed Federal land would be approved by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside and regulated by local zoning ordinances.    • I personally welcome the opportunity for development in the area and appreciate all that the US Forest Service does for our enjoyment.  Comment noted.  Future Development  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • Additionally, property values would plummet due to monstrous commercial buildings (reference Lowe's and Home Depot) with vast parking lots sitting in our front yards.  The value of land is market driven and it can either go up or down. Over time the land values in the White Mountain area have increased and there is no reason to believe that would not continue into the future. Future uses on the conveyed Federal land would be approved by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside and regulated by local zoning ordinances. There has not been a proposal for monstrous commercial buildings to be built on the property. The demand for land for primary and second homes is expected to continue in this area. Potential effects to land values will be discussed during the analysis.    • We are concerned about the effect on our lives if this area becomes another development, along with the inevitable increase in traffic and noise.  The foreseeable fature use on the Federal land will be discussed during the analysis. Zoning, including the regulation and management of associated building densities, uses and traffic control provides the mechanism for the management of quality of life and future development. Future uses on the conveyed federal land would be regulated by the State of Arizona and Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances. Management of the existing state highway is the responsibility of ADOT and for any future roads it would be the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. Traffic control is not a component of the proposed land exchange. Any projected increase in traffic numbers from future development would need to be approved by the Town and ADOT. Prior to the approval and permitting of future development the local P&Z Commission would also have to be make a determination if specific mitigation measures would be required at accommodate the existing neighborhoods for any increases in traffic and noise.  Future Development  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • A couple of the parcels the public would get include mines. What, if any, are the implications of this in terms of split estate, liability, hazardous waste, etc?  None of the offered non-Federal parcels contain a split estate. All parcels to be acquired must comply with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Environmental Site Assessments for the Babcock and Red Rover parcels concluded there were no hazardous wastes on the properties. Approximately 2 acres of the Mansfield parcel contain waste rock from previous mining activities. CERCLA was amended by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act which included a provision known as The Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser exemption to CERCLA. The provision provides that a purchaser of real property, which can include a Federal agency, an exemption from CERCLA liability if it satisfies certain conditions prior to acquisition. If remediation cannot satisfy the conditions necessary for acquisition the parcel or that portion of the property containing the waste rock would be dropped from farther consideration.  Hazardous Waste  • The residents of Wagon Wheel Park are very interested in this proposal and request that a public hearing be held in order for interested parties to express their opposition and concerns of this community personally.  The responsible official (Forest Supervisor) will decide whether to hold a public meeting(s) to discuss the proposed exchange.  Procedural  • t would be helpful to be given a rationale for the acquisition of each of the non-federal parcels.  Overall, the public would acquire numerous private inholdings scattered among four National Forests in Arizona, the total acreage of undeveloped forest lands in the State of Arizona that would be available for wildlife habitat and outdoor recreation would increase by 13 7 5 acres, there would be an increase in the total number of acres of floodplain under federal management, and the amount of resources needed to annually inspect and maintain property boundaries shared with adjoining private lands would be reduced. The EA will discuss the rationale for individual parcel acquisition during the analysis.  Procedural  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • I, a property owner in Wagon Wheel Park, have never heard of this information from the association (Wagon Wheel Park Homeowners Association).  Comment noted. The required public scoping process was followed. This included publication of the Notice of Land Exchange in the newspapers that serve the counties that contain lands proposed for exchange (both Federal and non-Federal), a scoping letter sent to all known potentially interested individuals (a mailing list of known addresses was compiled that included individuals believed to have an interest that included the Wagon Wh.eel Park Homeowners Association) and the letter, a copy of the published legal notice and a scoping report were posted on the Apache-Sitgreaves NFs' internet web site.  Procedural  • It appears more as a predetermined decision with an attempt at pacifying the public  The environmental analysis focuses on the future use and management of the lands acquired and conveyed and the potential effects, if any, of the exchange on the lands that adjoin them. The EA will discuss the process that is used by the parties when negotiating on the lands proposed for exchange.  Procedural  • Pinetop/Lakeside, the U.S. Forest Service, and Camp Tatiyee are attempting to sugar-coat this proposal as a beneficial exchange, but unfortunately the only beneficiaries will be them and only them.  The EA will include a discussion on public benefits (why the exchange is in the public interest) during the analysis.  Procedural  • We are told that by the time such transactions become common lmowledge, the transactions are done deals.  There has not been any political influence involved with a decision. The EA will include a discussion regarding the process followed by the parties for agreeing to the lands proposed for exchange. The process for a land exchange is an administrative process. The Responsible Official will make a decision after the NEPA process has been completed regarding whether the exchange is in the public interest.  Procedural  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • ... it is important to value the forest land appropriately. Please assign adequate economic values to the various services which a natural forest provides, such as watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and urban open space.  The exchange must comply with the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended, (43 U.S.C. 1716). The non-Federal and Federal parties to an exchange must comply with the appraisal standards as set forth in 36 CFR 254.9 and to the extent appropriate, with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions: /nteragency Land Acquisition Conference 1992 when appraising the values of the properties involved in an exchange. The process for land appraisals is directed by policy and regulations and overseen by the Director of Lands and Minerals in the Forest Service Southwestern Region Office. The Southwestern Region 's procedures were reviewed by an independent organization "The Appraisal Foundation" in 1999 and found to be thorough and professional. The appraisal process is governed by an exacting standard process based on comparability valuation. The law requires equal land values or the use of cash equalization, after making reasonable efforts to equalize values by adding or deleting lands for an exchange to occur.  Procedural  • Should the exchange be approved, only those with the physical and/or financial resources would benefit from visiting the remote forest lands to be exchanged ...  The Federal land conveyed would no longer be National Forest and the non-Federal lands being offered/or exchange are located throughout Arizona and would not be readily accessible to the private property owners that currently adjoin the Federal land. A direct benefit to the public would be an additional 1375 acres of National Forest System lands available for use in Arizona. The EA will discuss public benefits (why the exchange is in the public interest) during the analysis.  Social/Economic  • Having read the description of the land exchange and knowing the areas on the Coronado National Forest, party involved in the exchange, I'd say this looks like a good deal!  Comment noted.  Social/Economic  • It seems to me that such an exchange would be extremely beneficial to the White Mountain area as well as the many physically challenged individuals in Arizona.  Comment noted. If the National Forest land is conveyed into private ownership it is anticipated that the two youth camps and the Rim Trail would continue as uses on the area with the remainder of the property becoming available for other local uses and development.  Social/Economic  • For the record we are not opposed the proposed land exchange. We think Camp Tatiyee is an asset to our community and support their efforts to acquire this parcel.  Comment noted.  Social/Economic  Comments and/or questions  Disposition discussion  Category/Topic  • I hope . this is not the case and that the Forest Service will consider the residents near the proposed exchange and the affect it will have on our community.  The foreseeable future use on the Federal land will be discussed during the analysis. Future use on the conveyed Federal land would eventually be regulated by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside zoning ordinances. The EA will discuss public benefits (why the exchange is in the public interest) during the analysis.  Social/Economic  • First, from the viewpoint of an area resident, the 344-acre National Forest land with the two children's camps is a gem of a nearby, accessible forest.  Comment noted. The proposed exchange would result in a change in ownership for the Federal land. Future use on the conveyed Federal land would eventually need to be approved by the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside and regulated by local zoning ordinances.  Social/Economic  • Please explain what is meant by "acquired" federal land, as shown on several of the maps.  The land desigrzated as Acquired Federal Land on a couple of the maps is land that was previously acquired by the Forest Service in a previous land ownership adjustment action. The base maps containing the land ownership status layer for the for the Coronado National Forest and the Tonto National Forest have not been corrected to reflect these changes in ownership. Future maps should include these lands in the Federal Land desigrzation.  Miscellaneous  Summary of Issue Determination The ID Team identified two key issues after the analysis of public scoping comments associated with the proposed Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange. Issue 1: Loss of opportunity for the continued use of the adjacent National Forest by wildlife and for outdoor recreation by residents living in the area surrounding the Federal parcel.  Issue 2. Effect of possible future development on Federal parcel. EIS Scoping Period Comments received during the EIS scoping period were reviewed and used in development of the DEIS with information intended to address the questions, comments, and concerns during this period. Comments received follow. Table 27. Comments received and reviewed during the 2010 scoping period Name  Comment  Charles Kermes  Thank you for the information. Looks like a reasonable process.  Jim Anderson/ White Mountains Land Trust  Thank you for taking the time to meet with the White Mountains Land Trust (WMLT) board of directors to discuss the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange and the public scoping that is being accomplished for the Environmental Impact Statement for the exchange. We were impressed with the complexity of the land exchange and its various associated issues involving four Arizona national forests. The WMLT would like to comment on one of the key issues associated with the 344-acre Forest Service Camp Tatiyee property: the future disposition of the Mogollon Rim Trail. The WMLT is dedicated to working to conserve and steward open spaces and natural areas, to promote responsible use of land and water resources, and to enhance and improve the quality of life in the White Mountains region of Arizona. We are an IRS-approved 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that actively works to conserve land through a variety of means ranging from direct land transactions to conservation easements that restrict certain types of development. We work closely with local governments and private entities to facilitate land acquisitions, researching open space needs and priorities, and assisting communities in developing open space and urban trail strategies. As you are well aware, the Mogollon Rim Trail that crosses the Camp Tatiyee parcel is one of the most heavily used public trails in the area, and sits at the entrance to the Town of Pinetop- Lakeside and what many people consider to the “gateway to the White Mountains.” The WMLT has adopted the trailhead maintenance for this trail and understands firsthand how popular it is with the public. The public has a very keen interest in the long-term future of this trail, particularly as the land exchange progresses and development of portions of the parcel ultimately occurs. Failure to proactively address this trail’s future and to provide for continued public use and enjoyment could lead to considerable public outcry and controversy. The WMLT stands committed to playing a positive and proactive role in facilitating the longterm preservation of the Mogollon Rim Trail. We believe that this role could yield benefit to the ultimate success of the land exchange, as well as helping retain a vital amenity to Camps Tatiyee and Grace and future development that would occur on the parcel. We are willing to pursue a partnership with the Lions Foundation Arizona, Forest Service, the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside and other entities to develop and implement strategies to secure and maintain this valuable trail. Securing continued public use of the Mogollon Rim Trail following the exchange and achieving integration with future development could increase property values while promoting healthy lifestyles, as detailed in the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside’s Linking Our Landscape open space and trails assessment, available online at the Town’s website. This assessment details the positive economic impact associated with urban trails, as well as developer/landowner immunity from liability claims associated with the provision of public trail access. The WMLT is eager to help play an integral role in preserving and managing the Mogollon Rim Trail in the future. We appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments and look forward to continued involvement in the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange as it progresses. Please don’t hesitate to let us know what assistance we may offer in the environmental analysis process.  Kenneth A. Patterson/ City of Show Low  The City of Show Low has an irrigation water line on the property that we need to retain an easement for and the irrigation company has an irrigation ditch on the property that the City of Show Low and the irrigation company need an easement for. In addition, the City of Show Low would like to see the Mogollon Rim Overlook Trail preserved.  Name  Comment  Shirly L. Dawnson, Tommie C. Martin, & Michael A. Pastor/ Gila County Board of Supervisors  The undersigned members of the Board of Supervisors of Gila County, Arizona, would like to provide the following comments on the proposed land exchange between the Lions Foundation of Arizona (LF A), BC2 LLC, and the Apache-Sitgreaves, Coronado, Prescott and Tonto National Forests.  We support, on its face, the process of exchanging private land for federally owned land. Certainly the purposes of this particular proposal - conveyance into private ownership of the Lions Club Camp Tatiyee for youth - are worthy of favorable consideration.  What we find objectionable, however, is the notion of 1,719.32 privately owned acres being removed from the tax rolls. For the Forest Service to bring only 344.06 acres - an untenable 6-1 ratio -- to the table for its part of the "exchange" is no less than a predatory and opportunistic growing of its own acreage on the backs of small, rural counties who, like the rest of the United States, is experiencing the worst economic recession in our history.  We would like to suggest that now and in the future, exchanging private land for Forest land be a net neutral change in private land within Gila County, given that 95% of the non-tribal land within Gila County is already United States Forest Service Land. Further, this exchange will be a continuance of the loss of Gila County's cultural and historic identity by obliterating homestead parcels and their structures.  Name  Comment  Janine Blaeloch/ Western Lands Project  This letter includes our previous comments as well as new questions and issues to be addressed in the EIS. First, thank you for including clear maps that actually show the land ownership configuration surrounding the various parcels--this is extremely helpful! We hope the analysis will thoroughly describe any habitat values on the parcel to be conveyed, and on each of the parcels to be acquired by the public. In addition, it would be helpful to be given a rationale for the acquisition of each of the nonfederal parcels. While ownership consolidation is nominally a good thing, and the scoping letter states that the parcels would add wildlife habitat, recreation value, etc., in many cases the lands acquired for the public would not result in substantial consolidation of public land (e.g., Tonto Creek; Red Rover; Babcock; Rucker; Carlisle). In some cases, the public would be gaining just a tiny piece of private land amidst other private land (Babcock, Carlisle). In these cases, our questions would be: (1)What does the public gain? (2)What are adjacent uses and their potential impacts on what would become federal land? (3) Are there long-term plans for acquisition of all the other private parcels adjacent to these that would be acquired? A couple of the parcels the public would get include mines. What, if any, are the implications of this is terms of split estate, liability, hazardous waste, etc? In the original scoping report where 2 the Mansfield Tract is described, there is a reference to the “Mansfield Canyon Mines Site removal action.” Please explain this. Please explain what is meant by "acquired" federal land, as shown on several of the maps. Is this land acquired under the Weeks Act? By purchase? Exchange? When was the acquired land brought into public ownership--i.e., has there been a long-term, ongoing program to acquire these lands for particular values? This would be very helpful to know. Please provide some discussion of how each parcel would be managed, especially parcels that have riparian habitat or other special attributes. We are especially concerned about whether livestock grazing would be permitted on the three Tonto parcels that would be acquired” to benefit riparian dependent resources.” Please also discuss the proposed use(s) of the federal land being traded and the potential impacts of such use. Finally, has the Forest Service established a priority-ranking that establishes in what order the non-federal parcels would be dropped out of the exchange if the non-federal land values exceed the federal land values? Thank you for allowing us to participate in the scoping process for this proposal; we look forward to seeing the analysis.  Vinca Holland  My concerns are the current irrigation that flows through this parcel flows through my property also. I would want the irrigation to continue. The other concern is future development of houses being put on the Rim Trail. I would like to preserve the Rim Trail.  Scott White  Very concerned about the private owned LLC and what developing would occur in 5 years to 10 years, etc. Would like to see a way Lions Club partners with non-development interests. Let’s make this permanent nature area. Condos—not in my front yard  Name  Comment  Yvonne L. Moore  Once again, I am writing to convey my dissenting opinion regarding the above proposed land transfer.  The detriment to our community (Pinetop/Lakeside) far out ways any potential benefit to the forest service. The forest service desires to eliminate one of the last isolated parcels in town by allowing Camp Tatiyee to absorb a large portion of the land with the remainder to be developed by Pinetop/Lakeside in accordance with local zoning ordinances. Thereby, the forest service would gain additional acreage in Prescott, Safford, etc and the City of Pinetop/Lakeside would gam commercial property taxes. They would be the sole benefactors of any such land transfer.  The local property owners adjacent to this land would experience a tremendous drop in their property values for which we all paid a premium for the benefit of bordering forest land. Moreover, we would have to endure commercial properties abutting our homes, and we would suffer from the increased traffic as well as all the lighting that accompanies commercial properties.  Additionally, the community would lose public access to these lands for hiking, jogging, horseback riding, and exercising our pets. Wildlife still inhabits this land as it is adjacent to the reservation land. This proposal would choke the wildlife out and erase any opportunity of viewing wildlife.  In summary, the land that the forest service would gain would provide recreational enjoyment for those residing in other counties at the expense of recreational opportunities of those of us residing, and paying taxes, in Pinetop/Lakeside.  Therefore, I strongly support the "no-action alternative" to retain the current pattern of land ownership and the benefits coinciding.  Charles E. Briggs  This letter responds you notice to Arizona Water company (the “Company”) concerning a land exchange between the Lions Foundation of Arizona, BC2 LLC, and the United States Forest Service. The Company currently holds a valid USFS permit, LAK496, for water related facilities located in various areas of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Specifically, the Company has water related facilities located within the area of the proposed land exchange with the Forest Service and seeks to preserve the right for those facilities when the exchange takes place. I would appreciate the contact information of the person in charge at Lawyers Title Company with whom I can begin the process of preparing the necessary easements to cover the company’s water related facilities located in the exchange area. The company also requests that I be placed on the project mailing list so that it can be kept informed of the progress of the exchange. Please use the P.O. box listed on this letter for all correspondence, attention Charles Briggs. Certainly if you have questions or concerns regarding my request, please don’t hesitate to contact me at your convenience.  DEIS Comment Period A 45-day comment period was conducted from 5 June – 20 July 2015 to gather input from interested individuals and organizations on the Camp Tatiyee Land Exchange Draft Environmental Impact Statement.

Various concerns were identified that will be addressed by the forthcoming resource assessments and environmental analysis document and other documents that will be included in the project record. Several supportive comments were provided. Table 29. Comments received during the 2015 comment period, responses, and analysis of comments Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Fredrick Schneifder/ Arizona Water Company  Arizona Water Company (“Company”) currently holds a valid USFS permit, LAK496, for water related facilities located in various areas of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. Specifically, the company has water related facilities located within the area of proposed land exchange with the Forest Service and seeks to preserve the right for those facilities when the exchange takes place.  Enclosed is a copy of our standard easement form to be used to cover the water related facilities with the legal description to follow this letter once a topographic survey has been completed.  The USFS is aware of this permit and all existing special use permits for utilities on the federal parcel would be converted to easements or provided appropriate authorization at the time of exchange to allow for continued use as currently occurs. Thank you for your comment and provision of your standard form.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Kathleen Goforth/ USEPA Region IX  Though supportive of this exchange, given the valuable lands that would be brought under Forest Service stewardship if it is completed, we recommend that the FEIS include additional information on the potential for the exchange to induce growth on the parcel that would be transferred into private ownership.  Information on possible development of the federal parcel was clarified in the FEIS to address this comment. Population growth in the county is expected to continue to grow regardless of the project. Immediate development of the parcel is not expected as the parcel would be zoned for “open space,” a designation that precludes development, and any development must go through a town zoning process, which allows for public input. Exchanging the parcel may focus some growth to part of the parcel, but it is expected to be gradual in occurrence and similar to the low-density development of the surrounding areas, particularly as there are several other local areas also available for development. Overall, exchange of the parcel is not expected to induce growth but instead be responsive to growth expected to occur.   3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Kathleen Goforth/ USEPA Region IX  We also recommend that the Forest Service provide additional information on the tribal consultation that has been conducted for this proposed exchange. The DEIS states the Forest Service contacted nine Native American tribes and one chapter in the region concerning the proposed land exchange and the eight eligible historic properties located on the federal parcel. The DEIS does not describe the responses received from the tribes, if any, nor how this outreach may have informed the avoidance and mitigation measures proposed to address potential adverse effects to historic properties. We recommend that the Forest Service provide an update, in the FEIS, on consultation between the Forest Service and the tribal governments contacted to date. Discuss issues that were raised, how those issues were addressed in relation to the proposed land exchange, and how impacts to tribal or cultural resources would be avoided or mitigated consistent with Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Ac, and Executive Order 13007, Indian Sacred Sites.  We have updated the tribal consultation section in the FEIS to provide more thorough information as requested, added information to the issues section on the issues identified with cultural resources and how they would be addressed, and throughout the document have added further information on coordinating with tribes to mitigate adverse effects to cultural resources. The cultural resources section in Chapter 3 was also updated with more information. The MOA and treatment plan referred to and other documentation of consultation outlined in the FEIS is also included in the project record.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Patricia Port/ US Department of the Interior  The Department of the Interior has received and reviewed the subject document and has no comments to offer.  Thank you for taking the time to provide this statement.  6. Neutral comment  Chuck Moore/ Navopache Electric Cooperative (NEC)  NEC has an electrical distribution substation, electrical distribution lines and 69kV sub-transmission lines located within the area of the land exchange. NEC wants to make sure to maintain the existing rights we have for these electrical facilities to remain so that NEC can continue to provide electrical service to the Lakeside and Show Low areas.  The USFS is aware of these lines and all existing special use permits for utilities on the federal parcel would be converted to easements or provided appropriate authorization at the time of exchange to allow for continued use. Thank you for taking the time to comment.  3.a.

I commend the Forest Service for the excellent documentation contained in the DEIS which provides a compelling case for the land exchange.  2. The federal lands to be exchanged have significant recreational value to local residents and visitors. However, because the proposed action will assure continued access for public use of the Mogollon Interpretive Trail after the exchange is completed, I believe the loss of these lands will be significantly mitigated. I commend the Lakeside Ranger District for supporting the public’s need for continued access and use of this trail.   Thank you for your supportive comment and mention of the Mogollon Rim Trail.  5.

Supportive comment  Angie Cathemer  What are the 10 additional permits indicated?  The ten permits you reference are special use permits the Forest Service currently must oversee on the federal parcel to allow certain uses; these include seven utility uses, Camp Tatiyee, Camp Grace, and the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside municipal sign. See EIS page 48.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Angie Cathemer  Forest land that may not be used for camps be sold to developers? My concern is that our house faces the forest.  Youth camps have been operating on the parcel since 1958; the stated intention of the private parties is to maintain and continue camp operations. Upon transfer, the parcel would be subject to municipal zoning, which is currently “Open Space” with limited development potential. Any subsequent rezoning process to allow development on any part of the federal parcel would be subject to public review consistent with the planning and zoning ordinances and processes of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. If rezoned and development was allowed, it is expected to be similar to the low density development of the surrounding areas.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Angie Cathemer  The homes on Wagon Wheel Road be allowed to purchase land across the street so there will be no development?  Any subdivision and sale of the Camp Tatiyee parcel would be at the discretion of the private landowner.  2.a. Outside the scope of the proposed activity   Angie Cathemer  Will the trail and rim remain open to the public?  The Mogollon Rim Trail would transfer to non-federal ownership, but the paved portion of this trail and a buffered area extending 25 feet from all sides of the trail, the trailhead, parking area, and access road would be preserved from any future building sites and available to the public.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Angie Cathemer  Who has the water rights to the pond? Or is it not part of the trade?   Three different special use permits (SUPs) for the storage and conveyance of water exist on the Camp Tatiyee parcel. These are held by Show Low/Pinetop-Woodland Irrigation Company, Inc, City of Show Low (formerly Phelps Dodge Corporation), and Arizona Water Company. These SUPs would convert to easements or be given appropriate authorization for continued use upon exchange so they would continue as currently used.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Angie Cathemer  What is the timeframe when trade will take place and how will this really affect our neighborhood?   If decided upon, the exchange is anticipated to be completed in 2017. Anticipated impacts on various resources have been analyzed in further detail in the EIS, but Camp Tatiyee is intended to continue in use, Camp Grace has been extended the offer to purchase the land for Camp Grace to continue operation, and the rest of the parcel would be incorporated into the municipal zoning of “Open Space,” with limited development potential. Any subsequent rezoning process to allow development on any part of the federal parcel would be subject to public review consistent with the planning and zoning ordinances and processes of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside. If rezoned, any development would be expected to be low density similar to that of the surrounding areas.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Angie Cathemer  Will we still be allowed to walk through the forest from our homes or will we have to drive to the trail parking lot?  Use of the parcel for walking would be at the discretion of the private landowner. The paved portion of the Mogollon Rim Trail, trailhead, parking area, and access road would be maintained for public access and use. Easements including Highway 260, Vallery Lane, and Wagon Wheel Road would also be maintained as part of the exchange allowing continued use.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Barbara W  Will the rim road still be open on Wagon Wheel Road? What effects will this have on homes on Wagon Wheel Road?  The section of Wagon Wheel Road on the parcel has been closed for many years and would transfer with the parcel to the private landowner. Adjacent sections to the north and south of the parcel were transferred in the past and have been under other ownership for years. Easements including SR 260, Vallery Lane, and Wagon Wheel Road would be maintained as part of the exchange. Effects on home values is difficult to determine. Effects of open space on nearby property values have been shown to be mixed but, overall, beneficial to prices, particularly for permanent open space. The exchange could have some detrimental effects on home values, but effects are expected to be mixed as the parcel would be zoned “open space” initially, any rezoning and development would be expected to be gradual and similar to the low density surrounding area, a large section of the parcel is expected to continue with operation of the camps, The popular Mogollon Rim Trail would continue to remain open to the public, NFS land and open space on the Fort Apache Reservation is not far away, and other similar and different factors all affect housing values, some to a greater extent.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Janine Blaeloch/ Western Lands Project  The draft EIS does a fair job of describing the rationale for and impacts of the land exchange. However, while trading away the Camp Tatiyee parcel appears to be in the public interest, the need and desirability to acquire some of the non-federal parcels is less clear. The DEIS states on page v of the Executive Summary that the nonfederal lands are “available for future development that could diminish the value [of the resources present],” but the document does not analyze the varying potential for development on the 18 parcels. Some of the parcels, such as Happy Valley East and Harshaw, appear to have steep topography that might limit potential for development. None of the non- federal parcels have a high potential for mineral resources, so mining and extraction appear not be a threat.  Thank you for this comment. Information was adjusted and added to the FEIS and Executive Summary to clarify the purposes for acquiring the non-federal parcels. Part of the purpose involves reducing possibility of development, but the parcels also contain special features such as critical habitat that is beneficial for wildlife, perennial waters, and on some parcels access roads; these would receive more permanent protection into the far future from federal ownership. While not all the parcels are completely surrounded by NFS land, overall acquisition of the parcels would reduce shared boundary lines and establish more contiguous land ownership that can make management of land in those areas easier and more efficient. Some of the areas are also used for some recreational activities as allowed by the landowners and acquisition would help ensure recreation is allowed to continue further into the future in those areas.    Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Janine Blaeloch/ Western Lands Project  Admittedly, consolidation of ownership is a worthy overall goal, whether or not there is any imminent threat of development of those parcels. However, consolidation of federal land ownership is not complete in 13 of the 18 acquisitions, so the potential impacts upon newly-acquired federal lands of uses on remaining private adjacent lands should also be described. We posed this question for analysis in our April 2010 scoping comments. In those same comments we asked about long-term plans for acquisition of the remaining private parcels adjacent to these that would be acquired, and this should be addressed.  Thank you for this comment and mentioning the prior comment in scoping. The Forest Service intends to continue with consolidation of lands through acquisition of any private parcels that would help consolidate land ownership patterns; this includes acquisition of any of the remaining adjacent private parcels that fit land characteristic for inclusion in NFS land and that would not be precluded from inclusion due to developments, hazardous sites, etc. In consolidating land ownership, the Forest Service focuses particularly on acquiring lands completely surrounded by NFS land that are not developed, do not contain sites the Forest Service cannot acquire, are characteristic of NFS land, and contain resources that would benefit from long-term protection or federal management. However, provision of private land for inclusion in a land exchange is at the voluntary choice of the landowner. Because of this, the Forest Service can only acquire what is made available over time for acquisition. Effects on nearby private lands weren’t gone into.    Ed Muder/ City of Show Low  The City of Show Low has irrigation (water) lines through the property. We need to make sure the easements are transferred when the exchange is complete.  Thank you for your comment. The Forest Service would ensure that all existing special use permits for utilities on the federal parcel are converted to easements or provided appropriate authorization at the time of exchange.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Audrey Owens/ Game and Fish Department  The Department would like to reiterate our support of this proposed land exchange, based on the overall benefit to wildlife resources, the long-term conservation of these habitats for wildlife, and the public’s continued ability to pursue wildlife recreational opportunities.  We have reviewed and noted this comment. Thank you for taking the time to comment and express your support of this project.  4. Supportive comment  Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Bob Benne  I am unable to locate a map showing the isolated private parcels that are to be exchanged for USFS land. Can you please provide that to me.  Several maps of the isolated private parcels are available online at http://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=5004 in the figures provided there and the document titled “2015.05.29_CampTatiyeeDEIS.” Just click on the name of the document to download it. A copy of that document or the maps can also be provided at the Lakeside Ranger District Office.  3.c. Interest in documents and/or continued correspondence  Jean Public  I do not think the taxpayers citizens of this country want to turn this open space land into a children camp.   No new youth camps are proposed. Two current youth camps have been operating on the parcel since 1958; one of the stated intentions of the private parties is to maintain and continue operations of Camp Tatiyee. The other camp, Camp Grace, would be offered for purchase to continue running that camp as well. Upon transfer, the parcel would be subject to municipal zoning, which is currently “Open Space” with limited development potential. Any subsequent rezoning process to allow development on any part of the federal parcel would be subject to public review consistent with the planning and zoning ordinances and processes of the Town of Pinetop-Lakeside, and if authorized, any development is expected to be low-density similar to that of the surrounding areas.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Jean Public  I do not think the compensation for using our open space is adequate to allow this taking to continue.  The Federal Land Policy Management Act has strict rules to determine appropriate valuation of properties proposed in land exchanges. The exchange can only be completed if the value of the federal parcel is approximately equal to that of the private land parcels being offered in exchange or cash equalization, provision of funds, to supplement the lands to be exchanged may occur to equal the value of the lands, but the value must be equal and a professional appraisal of the lands is used to determine valuation. Upon exchange, the land will remain open space under the town zoning. The parcel may be rezoned following zoning ordinances and processes, which provide for public input.  3.a. Comment addressed by comment response and/or analysis or correspondence.  Name/ Organization/ Agency  Comment(s)  USFS Response  Comment Type  Jean Public  I think this is illegal immigrant use too and i do not favor that at all. Illegal immigrants should be sent right back to their own country when they turn up at our border. I very much oppose this taking of land and believe this is a sneaky deal trying to get away with stealing the peoples land. This comment is for the public record. Please receipt.  Your comment has been noted for the record. This project does not have anything to do with illegal immigrants or programs, laws, regulations, policy, or anything else related to illegal immigrants.  2.a.

Thank you for taking the time to comment and express your support of this project.    4. Supportive comment  Nick Lund/ TRACKS  TRACKS, a 350+ member volunteer organization, supports the proposed land exchange between the USFS and Lions Foundation of Arizona.  In our opinion, this exchange will benefit the National Forests, the Lions Foundation, and communities in Arizona.  We have reviewed and noted this comment.

Supportive comment  Greg Glassco  We don’t have any comments at this time on the Draft EIS. Please keep us informed as the project moves forward.  Your comment has been noted for the record. We will keep you informed as we move forward on the project.  3.c. Interest in documents and/or continued correspondence  Steve Saway  3. Because the federal lands to be exchanged have a long history of recreational use, I believe it is important that the non-federal lands that will transfer to forest service ownership be managed to the maximum extent possible for the public’s recreational use and enjoyment. Otherwise, the proposed land exchange would result in a net loss of outdoor recreational opportunities for the public.  4. As a longtime resident of southeast Arizona, I have enjoyed hiking, camping, and exploring various destinations within the Coronado National Forest. Thus, I have a special interest in the non-federal parcels that will transfer to the Coronado National Forest. In my view, Table 3-3, Anticipated Future Management Area Designations for Non-federal Parcels (pages 52 and 53), does not adequately reflect the recreational values of certain parcels. Specifically, Table 3-3 should include “dispersed recreation” in the column “Future MA Designation” for the following parcels: Happy Valley East, Happy Valley West, Happy Valley 40, Harshaw Creek, and Mansfield. (Table 3-3 is correctly including “recreation” for the parcels Rucker East, Rucker West, Stronghold, and Stronghold Well Site.) As rationale, the Happy Valley parcels are located in a popular corridor for dispersed recreation. The Arizona National Scenic Trail is located nearby as well as hiking opportunities in the Little Rincon Mountains and Paige Creek. The Happy Valley corridor is also popular for dispersed camping. The location of the Happy Valley parcels should significantly boost opportunities for public access and recreation in that area. The Harshaw Creek parcel is located near some popular hikes south of the town of Patagonia and is a good location for dispersed camping. The Mansfield parcel is located between forest road 72A and Mansfield Canyon, which is a favorite hiking destination of the Huachuca Hiking Club. This area has high scenic and recreational values.  Thank you for your comment regarding recreation on the non-federal parcels. As outlined in the Recreation and Public Access Section of the FEIS, all of the non-federal parcels are expected to provide a benefit to dispersed recreation, as you discuss, for activities such as camping, hiking, hunting, wildlife viewing, and vehicular access. Recreation is encouraged on many of the parcels, including most of those you mention, and is allowed on others following forest plan management. We appreciate your rationale on making these areas available for recreation under the proposed action and expect recreation like you describe to be available on the parcels acquired. Thank you for your comment.  3.a.
