Algonquin requests authorization to expand its existing pipeline system from an interconnection at Ramapo, New York to deliver up to 342,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas transportation service to the Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts markets. The final EIS assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the AIM Project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental PolicyAct (NEPA).  The FERC staff concludes that approval of the proposed project would result insome adverse environmental impacts; however, most of these impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels with the implementation of Algonquin’s proposed mitigation and the additional measures recommended in the final EIS. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the EIS.  Cooperating agencies have jurisdiction bylaw or special expertise with respect to resources potentiallyaffected by the proposal and participate in the NEPA analysis. Although the cooperating agencies provided input to the conclusions and recommendations presented in the final EIS, the agencies will present their own conclusions and recommendations in their respective records of decision or determinations for the AIM Project. The final EIS addresses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of about 37.4 miles of pipeline composed of the following facilities:  replacement of 26.3 miles of existing pipeline with a 16- and 42-inchdiameter pipeline; -2  extension of an existing loop 1 pipeline with about 3.3 miles of additional 12- and 36-inch-diameter pipeline within Algonquin’s existing right-ofway; and  installation of about 7.8 miles of new 16-, 24-, and 42-inch-diameter pipeline. The AIM Project’s proposed aboveground facilities consist of modifications to six existing compressor stations, to add a total 81,620 horsepower, in New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.  Algonquin also proposes to abandon four existing compressor units for a total of 10,800 horsepower at one compressor station in New York.  The FERC staff mailed copies of the final EIS to federal, state, and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; potentially affected landowners and other interested individuals and groups; newspapers and libraries in the area of the project; and parties to this proceeding.  Paper copy versions of this final EIS were mailed to those specifically requesting them; all others received a CD version.  However, we note that due to its voluminous size, the comment responses are provided as an electronic-only volume (Volume II) on a CD that was mailed to the entire mailing list. In addition, the final EIS is available for public viewing on the FERC’s website (www.ferc.gov) using the eLibrarylink. A limited number of copies are available for distribution and public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Public Reference Room 888 First Street NE, Room 2A Washington, DC  20426 (202) 502-8371 In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) regulations implementing the NEPA, no agencydecision on a proposed action maybe made until 30 days after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publishes a notice of availability of a final EIS.  However, the CEQ regulations provide an exception to this rule when an agency decision is subject to a formal internal appeal process that allows other agencies or the public to make their views known.  In such cases, an agencydecision maybe made at the same time the notice of the final EIS is published, allowing both periods to run concurrently.  The Commission decision for this proposed action is subject to a 30-day rehearing period. Additional information about the proposed project is available from the Commission’s Office of External Affairs, at (866) 208-FERC, or on the FERC website A pipeline loop is a segment of pipe constructed parallel to an existing pipeline to increase capacity. -3 (www.ferc.gov) using the eLibrary link.

On February 28, 2014, Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC (Algonquin) filed an application with FERC under sections 7(b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, and Part 157 of the Commission’s regulations to construct, abandon, install, own, operate, and maintain expansions of its existing interstate natural gas pipeline systems in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. This project is referred to as the Algonquin Incremental Market Project (AIM Project or Project). The purpose of this document is to inform the public and federal and state agencies about the potential environmental impacts of the Project and its alternatives, and to recommend appropriate mitigation that would avoid or reduce adverse impacts. The FERC is the federal agency responsible for authorizing interstate natural gas transmission facilities under the Natural Gas Act, and is the lead federal agency for the preparation of this EIS in compliance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, participated as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the EIS. A cooperating agency has jurisdiction by law or has special expertise with respect to environmental resource issues associated with a project. PROPOSED ACTION The Project would involve the construction and operation of about 37.4 miles of natural gas pipeline and associated equipment and facilities in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. The majority of the pipeline facilities (about 26.3 miles or 70 percent of the total 37.4 miles) would replace existing Algonquin pipelines, while the remainder of the pipeline facilities (about 11.1 miles or 30 percent) consists of new mainline pipeline, new loop pipeline, and one new lateral pipeline.  In addition to the pipeline facilities, Algonquin would modify 6 existing compressor stations and 24 existing metering and regulating (M&R) stations; construct 3 new M&R stations; and remove an existing M&R station. Modifications to the six existing compressor stations include the installation of 81,620 total horsepower (hp) in New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. Algonquin also proposes to abandon four existing compressor units for a total of 10,800 hp at one compressor station in New York. Algonquin would also modify three existing mainline valve (MLV) sites and five existing pig1 launcher/receiver sites, construct five new launcher/receiver sites, construct new MLV cross over piping at two locations, and construct a new MLV. Mainline regulation facilities would also be added at the terminus of one of the pipeline segments in New York.  According to Algonquin, the purpose of the AIM Project is to expand its existing pipeline system from an interconnection at Ramapo, New York to deliver up to 342,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas transportation service to the Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts markets. Algonquin’s stated objectives for the Project are:  to provide the pipeline capacity necessary to transport additional natural gas supplies to meet the immediate and future load growth demands of local gas utilities in southern New England; A pipeline “pig” is a device to clean or inspect the pipeline. A pig launcher/receiver is an aboveground facility where pigs are inserted or retrieved fromthepipeline. ES-1  eliminate capacity constraints on existing pipeline systems in New York State and southern New England;  provide access to growing natural gas supply areas in the Northeast region to increase competition and reduce volatility in natural gas pricing in southern New England;and  improve existing compressor station emissions through the replacement of existing compressor units with new, efficient units.  PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT On June 18, 2013, Algonquin filed a request with the FERC to implement the Commission’s prefiling process for its Project. At that time, Algonquin was in the preliminary design stage of its Project and no formal application had been filed. The purpose of the pre-filing process is to encourage the early involvement of interested stakeholders, facilitate interagency cooperation, and identify and resolve issues before an application is filed with the FERC. On June 28, 2013, the FERC granted Algonquin’s request and established a pre-filing docket number (PF13-16-000) to place information related to the Project into the public record. The cooperating agencies agreed to conduct their environmental reviews of the Project in conjunction with the Commission’s environmentalprocess. On September 13, 2013, the FERC issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Planned Algonquin Incremental Market Project, Request for Comments on Environmental Issues, and Notice of Public Scoping Meetings (NOI). The NOI was published in the Federal Register on September 19, 2013, and copies were mailed to over 1,800 parties, including representatives of federal, state, and local agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; potentially affected landowners; other interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. The FERC staff continued to receive and consider comments during the entire pre-filing period and throughout the development of this EIS. We2 held four public scoping meetings in the AIM Project area to solicit and receive comments on environmental issues associated with this Project. The meetings were held September 30, 2013 through October 3, 2013 in the Town of Cortlandt, New York; Danburyand Norwich, Connecticut;and the Town of Dedham, Massachusetts.   Additionally, we participated in Algonquin’s open houses, interagency meetings, conference calls, and site visits for the AIM Project to identify issues to be addressed in this EIS. The meetings, conference calls, and site visits provided a forum for the exchange of information and supported the FERC’s responsibility to coordinate federal authorizations and associated environmental review of the AIM Project.  On August 6, 2014, we issued a Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Algonquin Incremental Market Project. This notice, which was published in the Federal Register, listed the dates and locations of public comment meetings and established a closing date of September 29, 2014 for receiving comments on the draft EIS.  Copies ofthe draft EIS were mailed to over 2,740 stakeholders. The EPA noticed receipt of the draft EIS in the Federal Register on August 15, 2014. We held five public comment meetings in the AIM Project area to solicit and receive comments on the draft EIS. The meetings were held between September 8 and 16, 2014 in the Town of Dedham, Massachusetts; Norwich, Connecticut; Danbury, Connecticut; the Town of Cortlandt, New York; and the Town of Mapleville, Rhode Island. The meetings provided the public an opportunity to present oral The pronouns “we,” “us,”and “our” refer to the environmental staffofthe FERC's Office ofEnergyProjects. ES-2 comments on the analysis of environmental impacts described in the draft EIS. This final EIS addresses all substantive comments submitted to the FERC or received at the open houses, scoping meetings, interagency meetings, and comment meetings on the draft EIS.  PROJECT IMPACTS AND MITIGATION Construction and operation of the Project could result in numerous impacts on the environment.  We evaluated the impacts of the Project, taking into consideration Algonquin’s proposed mitigation measures, on geology, soils, groundwater, surface water, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife, fisheries, special status species, land use, recreation, visual resources, socioeconomics, culturalresources, air quality, noise, and safety and reliability. Where necessary, we are recommending additional mitigation to minimize or avoid these impacts. Cumulative impacts of this Project with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions in the Project area were also assessed. In section 3 of this EIS, we summarize the evaluation of alternatives to the Project, including the No Action Alternative, energy alternatives, system alternatives, facility design and siting alternatives, route alternatives and variations, and aboveground facility siting alternatives. Based on scoping comments, comments on the draft EIS, agency consultations, and our independent evaluation of resource impacts, the major issues identified in our analysis are in regard to blasting impacts, waterbody crossings, wetlands, special status species, land use and recreation, traffic impacts, safety, and alternatives. Our analysis of these issues is summarized below and is discussed in detail in the appropriate resource sections in sections 3 and 4 of this EIS. Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of this EIS contain our conclusions and a compilation of ourrecommended mitigation measures, respectively. The potential for geologic hazards, including seismic events, to significantly affect construction or operation of the proposed Project facilities is low. The U.S. Geological Survey has extensively studied the Ramapo Fault system and the level of seismicity in the region. The U.S. Geological Survey’s review of data indicates that there is no clear association between the fault and small earthquakes that do occur in the region. Further, there is insufficient geologic evidence to indicate the existence of a tectonic fault or Holocene-age slip or deformation associated with the fault. In any case, the design of the pipeline takes into consideration site-specific conditions, including earthquakes. The recorded magnitude of earthquakes in the Project area is relatively low and the ground vibration would not pose a problem for a modern welded-steel pipeline. The pipeline segments would traverse about 7.2 miles of shallow bedrock that may require blasting. In order to minimize potential impacts from blasting, Algonquin would comply with all federal, state, and local regulations for blasting and has developed an acceptable Rock Removal Plan to be used during construction. Existing soil contamination could be encountered during construction. Algonquin has developed an Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures to address the measures it would implement if contaminated soils are crossed during construction. To-date, Algonquin has also determined that field sampling would be required at two locations (one in Connecticut and one in Massachusetts). However, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) also identified a concern at a third site.  We are recommending thatpriorto construction, Algonquin develop a Field Sampling Plan forthese and any other potential contaminated sites that could be encountered during construction. The Project would cross 102 waterbodies, including 36 perennial streams, 62 intermittent streams, 3 ephemeral streams, and a ponded area. Algonquin proposes to use a dry crossing method (i.e., flume or dam-and-pump) to install all but two of the waterbody crossings. The other two waterbodies would be crossed using the horizontal directional drill (HDD) method (Hudson and Still Rivers). Dry ES-3 The Project would cross the Hudson River in New York and the Still River in Connecticut using the HDD method. Algonquin performed geotechnical feasibility studies at the proposed HDD sites and developed site-specific crossing plans for both of the crossings. Algonquin has also developed a Best Drilling Practices, Monitoring, and Clean-up of Horizontal Directional Drilling Inadvertent Returns Plan (BDP Plan) that describes the measures that would be taken to minimize the potential for inadvertent returns and releases at these two locations. Algonquin’s implementation of the HDD method at the Hudson and Still Rivers would avoid in-stream disturbance of these waterbodies. Several comments were received about the Project’s potential to impact the watersheds that supply water to the New York City metropolitan area, including the Croton, the Catskill, and the Delaware Water Supply Systems. At the Catskill Aqueduct crossing, Algonquin would remove its existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline and casing, but not disturb the existing protective concrete slab, pending concurrence from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Algonquin would build the proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline above the aqueduct at a 50-foot offset from the existing line. This offset would provide sufficient vertical clearance between the new pipeline and the Catskill Aqueduct. Algonquin is consulting with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection to develop a final crossing plan for the Catskill Aqueduct. Construction activities would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (E&SCP), Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan, Unexpected Contamination Encounters Procedures, Rock Removal Plan, BDP Plan, and construction stormwater plans and permits. With these protection measures in place, construction and operation of the Project would not result in significant impacts on surface water resources, including the Croton, Catskill, and Delaware water supply systems. Construction of the Project would impact 52.5 acres of wetlands, about 23.9 acres in New York and 28.6 in Connecticut. Of the total wetland acreage, about 35.5 acres (67 percent) would involve herbaceous and shrub-scrub wetlands, and the remaining 17.0 acres (33 percent) would involve forested wetlands. About 2.4 acres of the forested wetlands would be permanently converted to non-forested wetlands during operation of the pipeline facilities. The remaining 14.6 acres of forested wetlands would eventually revert to preconstruction conditions following construction. The Project would not result in any permanent loss of wetlands. In addition, two vernal pools would be located within the temporary construction area for the Project facilitiesin New York. Construction and operation-related impacts on wetlands and vernal pools would be mitigated by implementing the wetland protection and restoration measures contained in Algonquin’s E&SCP, Invasive Plant Species Control Plan, and any additional conditions of the wetland permits that could be issued by the USACE, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), and CTDEEP. Algonquin proposes to provide compensatory mitigation for the permanent conversion of forested wetlands to a non-forested wetland type. Algonquin’s implementation of a final, agency-approved Wetland Mitigation Plan would further offset any adverse impacts on wetland functions that would result from the permanent conversion of these wetlands. The USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP would review and incorporate the final plan into Project permits. We are recommending that Algonquin identify any additional avoidance or mitigation measures for the two vernal pools through the permit review process with the applicable agencies, priorto construction. Impacts on vegetation from the proposed Project would range from short-term to permanent due to the varied amount of time required to reestablish certain community types, as well as the maintenance of grassy vegetation within the permanent right-of-way and the conversion of aboveground facility locations to non-vegetated areas. Construction of the proposed Project facilities would temporarily ES-4 disturb about 352.4 acres of vegetation (160.9 acres of open land and 191.5 acres of forested vegetation) and permanently affect 34.7 acres (7.7 acres of open land and 27.0 acres of forested vegetation). The Project would also affect vegetation communities of special concern, including chestnut oak forests. Algonquin would limit the amount of disturbance to chestnut oak forests by utilizing the existing pipeline right-of-way during construction to the extent possible. Overall, the Project would not contribute significantly to new forest fragmentation because the proposed pipeline routes are located along existing rights-of-way and in areas that are already developed and highly fragmented. The Project would affect wildlife and wildlife habitats, including migratory birds, along the pipeline route and at the aboveground facilities. Algonquin has minimized potential effects on significant or sensitive wildlife habitats by locating the majority of pipeline facilities within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way to the maximum extent possible. Algonquin would also use the HDD crossing method at the Hudson River crossing to avoid direct effects to the Hudson River Important Bird Area, aquatic habitats, and adjacent riparian habitats. Algonquin would implement its E&SCP and any permit conditions developed through consultation with the applicable federal and state agencies to minimize the effects of the Project on wildlife and their habitats. We find that these measures would minimize the effects of the Project on wildlife, including birds of conservation concern and other migratory birds. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) confirmed that Algonquin’s proposed measures are sufficient for minimizing impacts on migratory birds, and consultation for migratory birds protected under the MigratoryBird TreatyActis complete. Thirty of the Project waterbody crossings support fisheries of special concern. Eight waterbodies are waters with naturally occurring spawning populations of trout. One waterbody (the Hudson River) contains threatened and endangered species and anadromous fisheries. Implementation of Algonquin's construction, restoration, and mitigation procedures would result in only limited, short-term impacts on fishery resources, and the aquatic habitats upon which these fishery resources depend. Invertebrate populations would recolonize the crossing area and all temporary construction workspace areas would revert to their original condition, including re-establishment of riparian cover. Furthermore, operation and routine maintenance of the pipeline rights-of-way are not expected to have any noticeable impact on fishery resources in the Project area. Through consultation with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries), we have determined that the only waterbody crossing where essential fish habitat species could potentially occur is the Hudson River. Given the proposed use of the HDD construction method and the fact that no water would be withdrawn from the Hudson River to support Project construction, we conclude that the Project would have minimal, if any, adverse effects on essential fish habitat or managed species. NOAA Fisheries has concurred with this assessment. We have also determined that the Project would have no effect on marine mammals protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act because they are not anticipated to occur within the Project area of the Hudson River.  Based on Algonquin’s consultations with NOAA Fisheries and the FWS and our review of existing records, nine federally listed threatened or endangered species are potentially present in the vicinity of the Project (as well as one candidate species and one species proposed for listing as endangered). Based on these consultations, we determined that the AIM Project would have no effect on the shortnose sturgeon, Atlantic sturgeon, piping plover, roseate tern, Puritan tiger beetle, northern red-bellied cooter, and small whorled pogonia; may affect, but would not likely adversely affect the bog turtle and Indiana bat; would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the northern long-eared bat; and would not contribute to a trend toward federal listing of the New England cottontail. NOAA Fisheries concurred with this determination for the Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon and consultation is complete for these species. The FWS has concurred with this determination for the piping plover, roseate tern, Puritan ES-5 tiger beetle, northern red-bellied cooter, small whorled pogonia, bog turtle, Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and the New England cottontail, and consultation is complete for these species as well. Algonquin is also continuing to consult with the NYSDEC and CTDEEP regarding impacts on state-listed species. No state-listed species would be affected in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. Algonquin conducted bald eagle surveys for the Hudson River crossing area and identified wintering eagles. No bald eagle nests were observed in the Project area or within 0.5 mile of the Project. We have concluded, and the FWS concurs, that the Project would not result in harm to bald eagles. Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSDEC to discuss survey results and state-level concerns for bald eagles, and develop and implement any state-level avoidance and mitigation measures, including timing restrictions, as necessary, to avoid impacts on bald eagles. Construction of the Project would impact about 575.6 acres. About 78 percent of this acreage would be utilized for the pipeline facilities. The remaining acreage impacted during construction would be associated with aboveground facilities (16 percent), pipe and contractor ware yards (5 percent), and access roads (less than 1 percent). The primary land use types impacted during construction would be forest/woodland (33 percent), open land (28 percent), industrial/commercial land (26 percent), and residential land (9 percent). Agricultural land and open water would make up the remaining 4 percent of land types impacted duringconstruction of the proposed Project. Following construction, about 42.4 acres of new land outside of Algonquin’s existing permanent right-of-way would be permanently encumbered by operation of the Project. About 80 percent of this acreage would be for the new pipeline right-of-way, 16 percent for aboveground facilities, and 4 percent for new permanent access roads. The primary land use types that would be permanently encumbered by new easements would be forest/woodland (64 percent), open land (18 percent), industrial/commercial land (7 percent), and agricultural land (7 percent). Open water and residential land would make up the remaining 4 percent of newpermanentimpacts. Algonquin’s proposed construction work areas would be located within 50 feet of 332 residential structures (i.e., houses and apartment buildings) and 94 non-residential structures (i.e., commercial or industrial facilities, sheds, garages). To address impacts on residences, Algonquin developed Residential Construction Plans to inform affected landowners of proposed measures to minimize disruption and to maintain access to the residences during construction. We have reviewed the revised Residential Construction Plans submitted on September 29, 2014. We conclude that Algonquin’s revised Residential Construction Plans are sufficient to minimize, to the extent possible, potential impacts on residences within 10 feet of the construction workspace and are acceptable overall. However, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a revised set of Residential Construction Plans that incorporate and address any comments Algonquin received from affected landowners, priorto construction.  In general, Project impacts on recreational and special interest areas would be temporary and limited to the period of active construction, which typically lasts several weeks or months in any one area. These impacts would be minimized by implementing the measures in Algonquin’s E&SCP, traffic management plans, Fugitive Dust Control Plan, as well as measures to ensure that noise is mitigated. Algonquin developed site-specific measures to further minimize impacts on the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School in New York; Dodd Stadium in Norwich, Connecticut; the Norfolk Golf Club in Westwood, Massachusetts; Gonzalez Field in Dedham, Massachusetts; and St. Theresa of Avila School in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, all of which would sufficiently minimize impacts on these areas. Algonquin also developed site-specific measures to minimize impacts on St. Patrick’s Church in Verplanck, New York; however, we are recommending that a revised site-specific plan be developed incorporating additional mitigation measures.  ES-6 To address traffic impacts related to road crossings and in-street construction in densely populated areas, Algonquin has prepared separate Traffic Management Plans for the West Roxbury Lateral in Massachusetts and pipeline segments in New York. The plans include measures to address motor vehicles, parking, and considerations for pedestrians, bicycles, and construction workers. We have reviewed these plans and found them acceptable with the exception of a portion of the Traffic Management Plan for the New York pipeline segments. Therefore, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a revised plan that includes the site-specific details for several road crossings prior to construction. Impacts on traffic during construction along the West Roxbury Lateral would result in localized, unavoidable significant adverse impacts, particularly at the Spring Street/Centre Street intersection. However, with the implementation of Algonquin’s Traffic Management Plan for the West Roxbury Lateral, impacts resulting from in-street construction would be minimized to the extent possible and would be reduced to less than significant levels atallother locations along the West Roxbury Lateral.   Construction of the Project would result in minor beneficial socioeconomic impacts due to increases in construction jobs, payroll taxes, purchases made by the workforce, and expenses associated with the acquisition of material goods and equipment. Operation of the Project would have a minor to moderate positive effect on the local governments’ tax revenues due to the increase in property taxes that would be collected from Algonquin. Algonquin conducted archival research and walkover surveys of the proposed Project area to identify historic aboveground properties and locations for additional subsurface testing in areas with potential for prehistoric and historic archaeological sites. Algonquin then conducted field surveys for aboveground properties and archaeological sites. Algonquin identified a total of 43 archaeological sites within the Project’s area of potential effect. Of these, 28 require additional testing to determine eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP); 13 are not eligible; 1 is eligible for listing but would be avoided by the Project; and 1 is listed on the NRHP but would also be avoided by the Project. In addition, 388 historic aboveground resources were identified within the area of potential effect, the majority of which (359) are not eligible for listing on the NRHP and no further work is recommended. The Project would not result in any significant or adverse effects on the remaining 29 identified historic aboveground resources. To ensure that our responsibilities under section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act are met, we are recommending that Algonquin not begin construction until any additional required surveys are completed, remaining survey reports and treatment plans (if necessary) have been reviewed bythe appropriate parties, and we provide written notifications to proceed. We consulted with nine tribes to provide an opportunity to identify any concerns about properties of traditional religious or cultural significance that may be affected by this undertaking. Eight of the tribes have contacted FERC staff to express an interest in the Project, request additional information, request to be kept apprised of the Project, and/or to accompany the archaeological field crews. Consultations with several other governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, non-federally recognized tribes, and municipal historic preservation commissions in New York and Massachusetts were also conducted to provide them an opportunity to comment on the Project.  Air quality impacts associated with construction of the Project would include emissions from fossil-fueled construction equipment and fugitive dust. Such air quality impacts would generally be temporary and localized, and are not expected to cause or contribute to a violation of applicable air quality standards. Algonquin has prepared a Fugitive Dust Control Plan that describes the mitigation measures that would be implemented to control fugitive dust during Project construction, especially in sensitive areas such as road crossings, residences, and nonattainment areas. We have reviewed the Fugitive Dust Control Plan and find it acceptable.  ES-7 Due to modifications on existing equipment and/or removal of existingcompressors, the potential emissions of most pollutants at the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations would be reduced fromtheir currentpotentiallevels. Further, based on the identified estimated emissions fromoperation of the proposed Project facilities and review of the modeling analysis for all compressor stations, the Project would result in continued compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are protective ofhuman health,includingchildren, the elderly, and sensitive populations. Therefore, with the mitigation measures proposed by Algonquin, we do not anticipate that construction and operation of the proposed Project facilities would have a significant impact on air quality in the Project area or in the region itself.  Noise would be generated during construction of the pipeline and aboveground facilities. Noise impacts during construction would be highly localized and attenuate quickly as the distance from the noise source increases. The one exception to this would be certain HDD activities at the Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River crossings. Algonquin would implement mitigation at all proposed HDD entrance locations to reduce the predicted noise generated by the HDD operations below the FERC noise requirement of 55 decibels on an A-weighted scale – day/night average at the closest noise sensitive areas. In response to traffic concerns raised by municipalities due to the proposed construction along portions of the West Roxbury Lateral, Algonquin has committed to nighttime construction along Providence Highway and the High Street/East Street intersection to minimize traffic impacts on this roadway. Nighttime construction in these residential areas would result in a temporary impact on noise levels to the nearby noise sensitive areas. However, we note that Project construction would be similar to other road construction activities, which would also likely occur at night to avoid similartraffic impacts.  The modified compressor stations would generate noise on a continuous basis (i.e., 24 hours per day) once operating. Some noise would also be generated by the operation of M&R stations and the proposed mainline regulators. We reviewed the compressor station noise analyses and agree that, if properly implemented, the noise control measures would ensure that noise attributable to the modified compressor stations would be less than the FERC noise requirement at nearby noise sensitive areas. However, where the noise currently attributable to the compressor station is greater than our noise requirement, the noise attributable to the station modifications would cause no perceptible change to station noise levels. To ensure that the actual noise levels produced at the aboveground facilities are not significant, we are recommending that Algonquin submit operational noise surveys and add noise mitigation, as necessary, until noiselevels are below our acceptable thresholds.  The pipeline and aboveground facilities associated with the AIM Project would be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to meet or exceed the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s Minimum Federal Safety Standards in 49 CFR 192 and other applicable federal and state regulations. The regulations include specifications for material selection and qualifications; minimum design requirements; and protection of the pipeline from internal, external, and atmospheric corrosion. By designing and operating the Project in accordance with the applicable standards, the Project would not result in significantincreased public safety risk. We received several scoping comments concerning the safety of the Project and its proximity to the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC), a nuclear facility on the east bank of the Hudson River in Westchester County, New York. Because of the distance of the proposed Project from the IPEC generating facilities and the avoidance and mitigation measures that it would implement, the proposed route would not pose any new safety hazards to the IPEC facility. On August 21, 2014, after consultations between Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (Entergy) and Algonquin, Entergy filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission its Safety Evaluation for the AIM Project. In its Safety Evaluation, Entergy concluded that the AIM Project poses no increased risks to the IPEC facility. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviewed the site hazards analysis performed by Entergy and performed an ES-8 independent confirmatory analysis of the blast analysis as well. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission concluded that a breach and explosion of the proposed 42-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline would not adversely impact the safe operation ofthe IPEC facility.  We also received several comments expressing safety concerns about potential interactions between Algonquin’s proposed pipeline facilities and the West Point Partners’ transmission line. Algonquin has committed to conduct an alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) interference study and incorporate field surveys and comprehensive modeling to identify potential adverse effects on the pipeline from stray currents. Although pipelines are routinely sited adjacent to electric transmission lines, we are recommending additional information to ensure that safety concerns about potential AC/DC interactions are adequately addressed.  This includes receiving Algonquin’s AC/DC interference study associated with the West Point Transmission Project and documentation of all consultations with West Point Partners, as well as any additional mitigation measures addressing safety-related issues or conflicts identified in the study. We received numerous comments during scoping and on the draft EIS for the Project about cumulative impacts associated with development of natural gas reserves (including hydraulic fracturing) in the Marcellus shale region. Activities associated with Marcellus shale development would occur outside of the Project area’s region of influence. As a result, the local resources that may be affected by Marcellus shale development would not be affected by the Project, and local resources affected by the Project would not be affected by development in the Marcellus shale region. Impacts associated with the proposed Project in combination with other projects identified within the region of influence would be relatively minor overall. We have included recommendations in the EIS to further reduce the environmental impacts associated with the AIM Project, as summarized in section 5.2. Additionally, Algonquin selected a route that collocates with existing rights-of-way where feasible. Therefore, we conclude that the cumulative impacts associated with the AIM Project, when combined with other known or reasonably foreseeable projects, would be effectively limited. We also received numerous comments about cumulative impacts of the proposed Atlantic Bridge Project. Preliminary details about the Atlantic Bridge Project have been provided by Algonquin but no application has been filed. If this project moves forward as currently planned, it would impact resources in many of the same areas as the AIM Project and the level of impacts would be similar to those of the AIM Project. The AIM Project would be constructed in 2015 and 2016, and the disturbed areas would be restored prior to any start of the Atlantic Bridge Project, which at its earliest would be constructed in 2017. Another planned Algonquin project is the Access Northeast Project. Spectra Energy’s website indicates that the company hoped to secure expression of interest from potential customers by the end of 2014, but it does not provide any information about the size or location of the proposed facilities. Spectra Energy indicates that, if they receive adequate market support, they would begin seeking regulatory approvals in 2015 with a goal of constructing and placing the facilities in service by the end of 2018.  The Access Northeast Project would not occur at the same time as the AIM Project, and project details are not known at this time. ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED The No Action Alternative was considered for the Project. While the No Action Alternative would eliminate or delay the short and long-term environmental impacts identified in this EIS, Algonquin would be unable to supply an additional 342,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas to its existing mainline system; increase deliveries to the Project shippers at existing delivery points in southern New England; or provide three new delivery points for the Project shippers. We also considered the use of alternative energy sources and the potential effects of energy conservation, but these measures similarly would not satisfy the objectives of the Project, provide an equivalent supply of energy, or meet the ES-9 demands of the Project shippers. We concluded that the No Action Alternative, alternative energy sources, and energy conservation were not viable alternatives to the proposed Project in the required timeframe. Our analysis of system alternatives included an evaluation of the existing Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Iroquois Gas Transmission systems as well as the planned Connecticut Expansion and Northeast Energy Direct Projects. None of the existing, proposed, or planned natural gas pipelines reach the delivery points required by the Project shippers in southern New England. To provide service to these delivery points, the existing and planned systems would need to be modified by constructing hundreds of miles of new pipeline, much of which would duplicate the existing Algonquin system. This would result in greater environmental impacts than the Project. Consequently, none of the system alternatives provide an environmental advantage over the proposed Project. We evaluated Algonquin’s proposed design for the Project to determine if any alternative designs would be feasible and environmentally preferable to the Project. We determined that alternative designs would result in operational inefficiencies associated with flow characteristics of natural gas within the system, and would shift, but not avoid, environmental impacts from one location to another. For these reasons, we concluded that alternative designs would not be practical or provide an environmental advantage over the proposed Project. We also considered the feasibility of electric-driven compressor units in lieu of gas-fired units at each of the existing compressor station sites. We concluded that use of electric-driven compressor units would result in additional environmental impacts due to the installation of non-jurisdictional facilities such as electric transmission lines and substations. Although electric-driven units would result in lower operating emissions, Algonquin would be required to comply with its existing air permits at each site. For these reasons, electric-driven compressors would not be preferable to or provide a significant environmental advantage over the proposed Project. Prior to the issuance of the draft EIS, we evaluated route alternatives for the Hudson River crossing and for the West Roxbury Lateral, several minor route variations along different segments of the Project, and site alternatives for M&R stations at the new delivery points in Connecticut and Massachusetts. We determined that none of the route or site alternatives or variations would offer significant environmental advantages over the Project. Following issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin evaluated several route variations it incorporated into its proposed route and we received comments requesting that we evaluate other alternatives and variations to the newly proposed route. This final EIS includes a more detailed analysis of these nine route alternatives/variations. Seven of them were determined to be advantageous to the original proposed route and were incorporated into the Project. Algonquin also evaluated 23 minor pipeline shifts, workspace adjustments, and/or design modifications. We conducted a more detailed review of these proposed changes and determined that 19 of them were advantageous and were incorporated into the Project design. We also evaluated alternative construction methods for several waterbody and wetland crossings; however, none were found to be feasible or preferable to the proposed construction methods. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS We determined that construction and operation of the Project would result in some adverse environmental impacts but most impacts would be reduced to less-than-significant levels. This determination is based on a review of the information provided by Algonquin and further developed from environmental information requests; site visits; scoping; literature research; alternatives analyses; and contacts with federal, state, and local agencies, and other stakeholders.  ES-10 Although many factors were considered in this determination, the principal reasons are:  About 35.0 miles (93 percent) of the 37.4 miles of AIM Project pipeline facilities would be within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way, consisting of Algonquin pipeline rightsof-way, public roadways, railways, and electric transmission line corridors.   The majority of the pipeline facilities (70 percent) would replace existing Algonquin pipelines within existing rights-of-way.   Algonquin would minimize impacts on natural and cultural resources during construction and operation of the Project by implementing its E&SCP; Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan; Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures; Invasive Plant Species Control Plan; BDP Plan; Compensatory Mitigation Plan; Residential Construction Plans; Traffic Management Plans for New York and the West Roxbury Lateral; Procedures Guiding the Discovery of Unanticipated Cultural Resources and Human Remains; and Fugitive Dust Control Plan.  Algonquin would utilize the HDD method to cross the Hudson and Still Rivers, which would avoid any direct impacts on these resources.   We would complete the process with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and implementing the regulations at 36 CFR 800 prior to allowing any construction to begin.  We would ensure compliance with all mitigation measures that become conditions of the FERC authorizations and other approvals during our oversight of an environmental inspection and mitigation monitoring program. In addition, we developed site-specific mitigation measures that Algonquin would implement to further reduce the environmental impacts that would otherwise result from construction and operation of its Project. We determined that these measures are necessary to reduce adverse impacts associated with the Project, and in part, are basing our conclusions on implementation of these measures. Therefore, we are recommending that these mitigation measures be attached as conditions to any authorization issued by the Commission.  These recommended mitigation measuresare presented in section 5.2 ofthe EIS. ES-11 1.0 INTRODUCTION On February 28, 2014, Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC (Algonquin), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Spectra Energy Corporation (Spectra), filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission or FERC) under sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and Part 157 of the Commission’s regulations. The application was assigned Docket No. CP1496-000 and a Notice of Application was issued on March 18, 20141 and noticed in the Federal Register on March 24, 2014. Algonquin is seeking a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (Certificate) from the FERC to construct, abandon, install, own, operate, and maintain expansions of its existing interstate natural gas pipeline systems in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. We2 prepared this environmental impact statement (EIS) to assess the environmental impacts associated with construction and operation of the facilities proposed by Algonquin in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended. The U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and U.S.Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) are cooperating agencies assisting in the preparation of the EIS because they have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to environmental impacts associated with Algonquin’s proposal. The roles of the FERC and the cooperating agencies in the project review process are described in section 1.2. The vertical line in the margin identifies text that is new or modified in the final EIS and differs materially from corresponding text in the draft EIS. Changes were made to address comments from cooperating agencies and other stakeholders on the draft EIS; incorporate modifications to the Project proposed by Algonquin after publication of the draft EIS; and incorporate information filed byAlgonquin in response to our recommendations in the draft EIS. As a result of the changes, 15 of the recommendations identified in the draft EIS are no longer applicable to the Project and do not appear in the final EIS. Additionally, three recommendations identified in the draft EIS have been substantively modified in the final EIS, and five new recommendations have been added in the final EIS. Algonquin’s proposal, referred to as the Algonquin Incremental Market Project (AIM Project or Project), involves the construction and operation of about 37.4 miles of natural gas pipeline and associated equipment and facilities in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. The majority of the pipeline facilities (about 26.3 miles or 70 percent of the total 37.6 miles) would replace existing Algonquin pipelines, while the remainder of the pipeline facilities (about 11.1 miles or 30 percent) consists ofnew mainline pipeline, new loop pipeline,and one new lateral pipeline. In addition to the pipeline facilities, Algonquin would modify 6 existing compressor stations and 24 existing metering and regulating (M&R) stations; construct 3 new M&R stations; and remove one existing M&R Station. Modifications to the six existing compressor stations include the installation of 81,620 total horsepower (hp) in Rockland and Putnam Counties, New York; New Haven, Middlesex, and Windham Counties, Connecticut; and Providence County, Rhode Island. Algonquin also proposes to abandon four existing compressor units for a total of 10,800 hp at one compressor station in Rockland County, New York. The 24 existing M&R station modifications include 3 in New York, 13 in Connecticut, and 8 in Massachusetts to accept the new gas flows associated with the proposed Project. The three new M&R stations to be constructed would be in Suffolk and Bristol Counties, Massachusetts 1 An errata notice was issued on March 19, 2014 to clarify that the Commission staff is preparing an environmental impact statement for the AlgonquinIncremental Market Project. 2 Thepronouns “we,” “us,” and “our”refer totheenvironmental staffoftheFERC's OfficeofEnergyProjects. 1-1 and New London County, Connecticut. One M&R station would be decommissioned and removed in New London County, Connecticut.  As part ofthe AIM Project, Algonquin would also modify facilities at three existing mainline valve (MLV) sites and five existing pig3 launcher/receiver sites, and construct five new launcher/receiver sites, construct new MLV cross over piping at two locations, and construct a new MLV. Mainline regulation facilities would also be added at the terminus of one of the pipeline segments in New York. 1.1 PROJECT PURPOSE AND NEED According to Algonquin, the purpose of the AIM Project is to expand its existing pipeline system from an interconnection at Ramapo, New York to deliver up to 342,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of natural gas transportation service to the Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts markets. Algonquin’s stated objectives for the Projectare:  to provide the pipeline capacity necessary to transport additional natural gas supplies to meet the immediate and future load growth demands of local gas utilities in southern New England;  eliminate capacity constraints on existing pipeline systems in New York State and southern New England;  provide access to growing natural gas supply areas in the Northeast region to increase competition and reduce volatility in natural gas pricing in southern New England;  improve existing compressor station emissions through the replacement of existing compressor units with new, efficient units; and  provide the additional service by November 2016. Under section 7(c) of the NGA, the Commission determines whether interstate natural gas transportation facilities are in the public convenience and necessity and, if so, grants a Certificate to construct and operate them. The FERC’s Certificate Policy Statement4 provides guidance as to how the Commission evaluates proposals for new construction, and establishes criteria for determining whether there is a need for a proposed project and whether it would serve the public interest. Decisions are based on technical competence, financing, rates, market demand, gas supply, environmental impact, long-term feasibility, and other issues concerning a proposed project. The Commission’s goal is to give appropriate consideration to the enhancement of competitive transportation alternatives, the possibility of overbuilding, subsidization by existing customers, the applicant’s responsibility for unsubscribed capacity, the avoidance of unnecessary disruptions of the environment, and the unneeded exercise of eminent domain in evaluating new pipeline construction The Commission does not direct the development of the gas industry’s infrastructure regionally or on a project-by-project basis, or redefine an applicant’s stated purpose. 3 A pipeline “pig” is a device to clean or inspect the pipeline.

The precedent agreements with the Project Shippers account for the entire Project capacity of 342,000 Dth/d. The 10 Project Shippers include:  Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas);  NSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR);  Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation(Connecticut Natural Gas);  The Southern ConnecticutGas Company (Southern Connecticut);  The Narragansett Electric Company d/b/a National Grid (Narragansett Electric);  Colonial Gas Company d/b/a National Grid(ColonialGas);  Boston Gas Company d/b/a National Grid (Boston Gas);  Bay State Gas Company d/b/a Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, Inc. (Bay State);  Norwich Public Utilities (NPU); and  Middleborough Gasand Electric. Noting the growing need for additional natural gas capacity in New England to help ensure electric generation system reliability, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) and New England States Committee on Electricity commented that the FERC should modify the scope of its NEPA analysis to include the Project both at its current size and for an alternative project of larger size such as the 433,000 Dth/d originally conceived by Algonquin. Algonquin reduced the scope of the AIM Project as a result of an open season. To follow the Certificate Policy Statement, Algonquin appropriately sized its proposal to ensure that there would be no subsidization from its existing shippers.  The Commission analyzes a project as it is filed in an application and does not speculate on potential infrastructure. Additionally, the Commission cannot determine the environmental impacts of the larger version of the AIM Project without significantly more facility and siting information from Algonquin. Furthermore, the Commission has no authority to direct a pipeline company to construct facilities the company has deemed unnecessary for a project’s objectives, which would be inefficient and costly.  Several comments were received during the scoping process and draft EIS comment period expressing concern that the Project would be used to export natural gas. Algonquin is not constructing the AIM Project for the purpose of supporting the export of natural gas from the United States. As discussed above, Algonquin is proposing to transportnatural gas to meet the demand for natural gas in the Northeast U.S. markets. Specifically, Algonquin is proposing to construct the AIM Project based on commitments from the Project Shippers, which include LDCs and two municipal utilities, which have statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual obligations to serve natural gas customers within their respective service areas in New England. Even if precedent agreements were not in place for the entire proposed capacity, to be exported, the natural gas would need to be liquefied for transportation in specialized container ships to overseas markets. The process of liquefying the gas involves specialized equipment at a specific export facility. Currently, no existing operational export facilities or infrastructure exists on the east coast.6 In addition, the timing and need as expressed through the precedent agreements greatly 5 A precedent agreement is a binding contract under which one or both parties has the ability to terminate the agreement if certain conditions such as receipt ofregulatoryapprovals, are not met. 6 On September 29, 2014, FERC issued an order grating authorization to Dominion to convert its existing Cove Point LNG import facility in Maryland to an export facility. However, it is not currently operational. The anticipated in-service date for the liquefied natural gas export terminal is June 2017. We also note that the AIM Project would flow gas in a northeast direction, away fromtheCove Point LNG facility. 1-3 Comments were also received asking whether any of the natural gas would be, or has the potential to be, liquefied and stored at existing or proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. As indicated above, the AIM Projectis designed to transport natural gas to serve the Project Shipper’s load in the Northeast markets. No new LNG storage facilities are proposed, and the Project is not designed for the purpose of the export of natural gas. However, it is unknown whether the natural gas transported on the AIM Project facilities would be liquefied and stored in existing LNG storage facilities after the natural gas is delivered by Algonquin to the Project Shippers. It is possible that the Project Shippers could use existing peak shaving7 LNG facilities, but thosefacilities arenot export terminal facilities. We also received several comments regarding facility design and siting for the proposed replacement, loop, and lateral pipelines and other facilities for the Project and why they need to be located as proposed. Algonquin states that the design and configuration of the proposed facilities is based on flow dynamics and the pressure of natural gas as it moves through the pipeline system relative to the delivery points requested by the Project Shippers. An analysis of the Project’s facility design and siting alternatives is provided in section 3.4. 1.2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE EIS Our principal purposes forpreparingthe EISare to:  identify and assess the potential impacts on the natural and human environment that would result from the implementation ofthe proposed Project;  describe and evaluate reasonable alternatives to the proposed Project that would avoid or minimize adverse effects on the environment;  identify and recommend specific mitigation measures, as necessary, to minimize environmental impacts; and  encourage and facilitate involvement by the public and interested agencies in the environmental review process. The topics addressed in the EIS include alternatives; geology; soils; groundwater; surface waters; wetlands; vegetation; wildlife and aquatic resources; special status species; land use, recreation, special interest areas, and visual resources; socioeconomics (including transportation and traffic); cultural resources; air quality and noise; reliability and safety; and cumulative impacts. The EIS describes the affected environment as it currently exists, addresses the environmental consequences of the AIM Project, and compares the Project’s potential impacts to those of the alternatives. The EIS also presents our conclusions and recommended mitigation measures for the Project. We received comments that Marcellus shale production activity should be included in the scope of the proposed Project. The Project does not include the production of natural gas. The scope of this EIS focuses on the natural gas transmission facilities that Algonquin would construct and operate. Our authority under the NGA and NEPA review requirements relates only to natural gas facilities that are involved in interstate commerce. Thus, the facilities associated with the production of natural gas are not under FERCjurisdiction.  7 Peak shaving facilities store surplus natural gas to meet demand during high-use (“peak”) consumption timeframes (e.g., winter cold snaps and summer heat waves). 1-4 Commentors also noted that the EIS should address the indirect impacts of induced Marcellus shale development. Impacts that may result from additional shale gas development are not “reasonably foreseeable” as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations. Nor is such additional development, or any correlative potential impacts, an “effect” of the Project, as contemplated by the CEQ regulations, for purposes of a cumulative impact analysis. The development of the Marcellus shale, which is regulated by the states, continues to drive the need for takeaway interstate pipeline capacity to allow the gas to reach markets. Therefore, companies are planning and building interstate transmission facilities in response to this new source of gas supply. In addition, many production facilities have already been permitted and/or constructed in the region, creating a network through which natural gas may flow along various pathways to local users or the interstate pipeline system, including Algonquin’s existing system. Algonquin would receive natural gas through its interconnection with other natural gas pipelines. These interconnecting pipeline systems span multiple states with shale formations in the northeast, as well as conventional gas formations. We cannot estimate how much of the Project volumes would come from current/existing shale gas production and how much, if any, would be new production “attributable”to the Project.  We also note that the EPA and the states have imposed regulations within the past 2 to 3 years on natural gas production to minimize leaks and methane emissions. Therefore, past studies on production leaks and methane emissions cannot be used to appropriately predict future methane emissions. Predicting methane emissions and associated climate impacts is speculative given the newly required minimization efforts. The Project does not depend on additional shale gas production that may occur for reasons unrelated to the Project and over which the Commission has no control, such as state permitting for additional gas wells. An overall increase in production of shale gas may occur for a variety of reasons, but the location and subsequent production activity is unknown and too speculative to assume based on the interconnected interstate natural gas pipeline system. Accordingly, the factors necessary for a meaningful analysis of when, where, and how shale gas development would occur are unknown at this time. It is simply impractical for this EIS to consider impacts associated with additional shale gas development in separate geographic areas than the proposed Project because cumulative impacts resulting from the Project must, under CEQ regulations, be meaningfully analyzed by this Commission.  We also received comments about cumulative impacts associated with development ofnatural gas reserves (including hydraulic fracturing) in the Marcellus shale region. Marcellus shale production and development of gasreserves are discussedin section 4.13. Comments were also received regarding the AIM Project’s potential relationship to the Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast Projects and possible improper project segmentation. Improper segmentation is usually concerned with projects that have reached the proposal stage, which is not the case here. Algonquin has not filed an application with the Commission for the Atlantic Bridge or Access Northeast Projects. Rather, Algonquin is still evaluating the potential Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast Projects based on interest for additional natural gas supplies in New England and/or the Canadian Maritime provinces. The Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast Projects are still in the development phase and precedent agreements are under consideration. Even so, the AIM Project is an unconnected single action that has independent utility irrespective of any other projects, including the Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast Projects. As discussed in section 1.1, Algonquin has executed precedent agreements with 10 shippers who account for the entire AIM Project capacity of 342,000 Dth/d. These are firm commitments needed to meet a discrete market in southern New England beginning in November 2016. Therefore, the scope of this EIS is limited to the AIM Project. However, section 4.13 of this EIS does address cumulative impacts of the Atlantic Bridge and Access Northeast Projects. 1-5 1.2.1 Federal Energy Regulatory CommissionPurpose and Role The FERC is an independent federal agency responsible for evaluating applications for authorization to construct and operate interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. If the Commission determines that a project is required by the public convenience and necessity, Certificates are issued under sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the NGA and Part 157 of the Commission’s regulations. As such, the FERC is the lead federal agency for the preparation of the EIS in compliance with the requirements of NEPA, the CEQ regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 1500-1508 [40 CFR 1500-1508]), and the FERC’s regulations implementing NEPA (18 CFR 380). This EIS presents our review of potential environmental impacts and reasonable recommendations to avoid or mitigate impacts. This EIS will be used as an element in the Commission’s review of the Project to determine whether a Certificate would be issued. The FERC will also consider non-environmental issues in its review of Algonquin’s application. A Certificate will be granted if the Commission finds that the evidence produced on financing, rates, market demand, gas supply, existing facilities and service, environmental impacts, long-term feasibility, and other issues demonstrates that the Project is required by the public convenience and necessity. Environmental impact assessment and mitigation development are important factors in the overall public interest determination. 1.2.2 U.S. EnvironmentalProtection AgencyPurpose and Role The EPA is an independent federal agency responsible for protecting human health and safeguarding the natural environment. The EPA has delegated water quality certification, under section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), to the jurisdiction of individual state agencies. The EPA may assume section 401 authority if no state programexists, if the state programis not functioning adequately, or at the request of the state. The EPA also oversees the issuance of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit by the state agency, under section 402 of the CWA, for point-source discharge of water used for hydrostatic testing of pipelines into waterbodies. The EPA also has the authority to review and veto permits issued by the USACE under section 404 of the CWA. In addition to its authority under the CWA, the EPA also has jurisdictional authority under the Clean Air Act (CAA) to control air pollution by developing and enforcing rules and regulations for all entities that emit toxic substances into the air. Under this authority, the EPA has developed regulations for major sources of air pollution, and has delegated the authority to implement these regulations to state and localagencies.  State and local agencies are allowed to develop and implement their own regulations for non-major sources of air pollutants. The EPA also establishes general conformity applicability thresholds that a federal agency can utilize to determine whether a specific action requires a general conformity assessment. In addition to its permitting responsibilities, the EPA is required under section 309 of the CAA to review and publicly comment on the environmental impacts of major federal actions including actions that are the subject of draft and final EISs, and is responsible for implementing certain procedural provisions of NEPA (e.g., publishing Notices of Availability of the draft and final EISs in the Federal Register)to establish statutory timeframes for the environmental review process. 1.2.3 U.S. Army Corps of EngineersPurpose and Role The USACE is a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Defense with jurisdictional authority pursuant to section 404 of the CWA (Title 33 of the United States Code [USC], Section 1344 [33 USC 1344]), which governs the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act (RHA) (33 USC 403), which regulates any work or structures that potentially affect the navigable capacity of a waterbody. Because the USACE would need to evaluate and approve several aspects of the Project and must comply with the requirements of NEPA before issuing permits under the above statutes, it has elected to participate as a cooperating agency in the 1-6 preparation of this EIS. The USACE would adopt the EIS per 40 CFR 1506.3 if, after an independent review of the document, it concludes that the EIS satisfies the USACE’s comments and recommendations. The Project occurs within the New York and New England Districts ofthe USACE.  The primary decisions to be addressed by the USACE include:  issuance of a section 404 permit for aquatic resource impacts associated with construction of the Project; and  issuance of section 10 permit for construction activities within navigable waters of the United States. This EIS contains information needed by the USACEto reach decisions on these issues.  Through the coordination of this document, the USACE would obtain the views of the public and natural resource agencies priorto reaching decisions on the Project. Algonquin submitted applications for section 404/10 permits to the New York and New England Districts on March 21 and March 25, 2014, respectively. The USACE published public notices for Algonquin’s applications in the Federal Register on August 14, 2014 (New York) and August 19, 2014 (New England), concurrent with the draft EIS and the FERC public comment period.  As an element ofits review, the USACE must consider whether a proposed project avoids, minimizes, and compensates for impacts on existing aquatic resources, including wetlands, to strive to achieve a goal of no overall net loss of values and functions. Based on its participation as a cooperating agency and its consideration of the final EIS (including responses to public comments), the USACE would issue a Record of Decision to formally document its decision on the proposed action, including section 404 (b)(1) analysis and required environmental mitigation commitments. 1.2.4 U.S. Department of Transportation – Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration PHMSA is the federal agency responsible for administering the national regulatory program to ensure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum, and other hazardous materials by pipeline under 49 USC Chapter 601. PHMSA’s Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to ensure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities. The OPS is responsible for ensuring that Algonquin’s proposed facilities are designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with the safety standards that the agency hasestablished for natural gas pipeline facilities. 1.3 PERMITS, APPROVALS, AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS As the lead federal agency for the AIM Project, the FERC is required to comply with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976 (MSA), the RHA, the CWA, the CAA, section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA). These and other statutes have been taken into account in the preparation ofthe EIS. Table 1.3-1 lists the major federal, state, and local permits, approvals, and consultations for construction and operation of the Project. The table also provides each status. The FERC encourages cooperation between applicants and state and local authorities, but this does not mean that state and local agencies, through applications of state and local laws, may prohibit or unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by the FERC. Any state or local permits issued with respect to jurisdictional facilities must be consistent with the conditions of any authorization issued by the FERC. 1-7 TABLE 1.3-1 a Major Permits, Approvals, and Consultations for the AIM Project  Permit/Approval/ Agency Consultation Agency Action  Status  Federal FERC Certificate Consider issuance of a Certificate under sections 7(b) and (c) of the NGA.

The FERC, or Algonquin as a non-federal party, is required to consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) to determine whether any federally listed or proposed endangered or threatened species or their designated critical habitat occur in the vicinity of the Project. If the FERC determines that these species or habitats may be impacted by the Project, the FERC is required to prepare a biological assessment (BA) to identify the nature and extent of adverse impact, and to recommend measures to avoid or reduce potential impacts on habitat and/or species. If, however, the FERC determines that no federally listed or proposed endangered or threatened species or their designated critical habitat would be impacted by the Project, no further action is necessary under the ESA. See section 4.7.1 of this EIS for the status of our compliance with section 7 of the ESA. 1.3.2 Migratory Bird Treaty Act Migratory birds are species that nest in the United States and Canada during the summer and then migrate south to the tropical regions of Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean for the non-breeding season. Migratory birds are protected under the MBTA (16 USC 703–711; MBTA). Executive Order (EO) 13186 (66 Federal Register 3853) directs federal agencies to identify where unintentional take is likely to have a measurable negative effect on migratory bird populations and to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on migratory birds through enhanced collaboration with the FWS.  EO 13186 states that emphasis should be placed on species of concern, priority habitats, and key risk factors, and that particular focus should be given to addressing population-level impacts. On March 30, 2011, the FWS and the Commission entered into a Memorandum of Understanding Between the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Department of the Interior United States Fish and Wildlife Service Regarding Implementation of Executive Order 13186, “Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds” (MBTA MOU) that focuses on avoiding or minimizing adverse impacts on migratory birds and strengthening migratory bird conservation through enhanced collaboration between the two agencies. See section 4.7.2 of this EIS for the status of our compliance with the MBTA. 1-12 1.3.3 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Management Act The MSA, as amended by the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-267), established procedures designed to identify, conserve, and enhance essential fish habitat (EFH) for those species regulated under a federal fisheries management plan. The MSA requires federal agencies to consult with NOAA Fisheries on all actions or proposed actions authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency that may adversely impact EFH (MSA section 305(b)(2)). Although absolute criteria have not been established for conducting EFH consultations, NOAA Fisheries recommends consolidating EFH consultations with interagency coordination procedures required by other statutes such as NEPA, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, or the ESA (50 CFR 600.920(e)) in order to reduce duplication and improve efficiency. As part of the consultation process, we have prepared an EFH Assessment included in section 4.6.2.4. 1.3.4 Rivers and Harbors Act The RHA pertains to activities in navigable waters as well as harbor and river improvements. Section 10 of the RHA prohibits the unauthorized obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the United States. Construction of any structure or the accomplishment of any other work affecting course, location, condition, or physical capacity of waters of the United States must be authorized by the USACE.  The only section 10 river crossed by the Project is the Hudson River. The Hudson River crossing is discussed in detail in section 4.3.2. 1.3.5 Clean Water Act The CWA, as amended, regulates the discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States and regulates quality standards for surface waters. To enact this goal both the EPA and the USACE have regulatory authority under this statute. The EPA has implemented pollution control programs including setting wastewater standards for industry and creating water quality standards for all contaminants in surface waters. Under the CWA, it is unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into waters of the United States without a permit. The EPA operates the NPDES permit program that regulates discharges by industrial, municipal, and other facilities, if discharges directly enter surface waters. Section 404 of the CWA regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States and is under jurisdiction of the USACE. The status of NPDES and section 404 permitting requirements are further addressed in sections 4.3.2 and 4.4.3 of this EIS. Section 401 of the CWA requires that an applicant for a federal permit who conducts any activity that may result in a discharge to waters of the United States must provide the federal regulatory agency with a section 401 certification. Section 401 certifications are made by the state in which the discharge originates and declares that the discharge would comply with applicable provisions of the act, including the state water quality standards. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), CTDEEP, and Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) are the applicable regulatory authorities delegated with section 401 certification for the states of New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. A section 401 certification is not required for the modifications proposed in RhodeIsland. 1.3.6 Clean Air Act The CAA, as amended, defines the EPA’s responsibilities for protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and the stratospheric ozone layer. Under the CAA, the EPA sets limits on certain air pollutants and grants them the authority to limit emissions of air pollutants coming from sources such as industrial facilities.  The EPA has delegated the authority to implement these regulations to state and local agencies. In New York, the NYSDEC is responsible for enforcement of air quality standards at a state level as well as enforcement of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) required under the CAA.  In 1-13 Connecticut, the CTDEEP is responsible for enforcement of air quality standards at a state level as well as enforcement of the SIP required under the CAA. In Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) is responsible for enforcement of air quality standards at a state level as well as enforcement of the SIP required under the CAA. In Massachusetts, the MADEP is responsible for enforcement of air quality standards at a state level as well as enforcement of the SIP required under the CAA. The EPA issued a rule in 2010 finalizing greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting requirements for the petroleum and natural gas industry (40 CFR 98). New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts have each modified their respective SIPs to regulate GHGs and issue permits for GHGs for large and modified sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program.  See section 4.11.1 of this EIS for additional information regarding our compliance with the CAA and SIPs. 1.3.7 NationalHistoric Preservation Act Section 106 of the NHPA, as amended, requires the FERC to take into account the impacts of its undertakings on historic properties, and afford the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) an opportunity to comment. Historic properties include prehistoric or historic sites, districts, buildings, structures, objects, or properties of traditional religious or cultural importance listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In accordance with the ACHP’s regulations for implementingsection 106, at 36 CFR 800.2(a)(3), the FERC is using the services of Algonquin and its consultants to prepare information, analyses, and recommendations. However, we remain responsible for all findings and determinations. We will follow the process of complying with Section 106 outlined in Part 800 by consulting with each state’s State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), identifying historic properties in the area of potential effect (APE), and assessing potential project effects. Section 4.10.4 of this EIS summarizes the status of our compliance with the NHPA. 1.3.8 Coastal Zone Management Act The CZMA calls for the “effective management, beneficial use, protection, and development” of the nation’s coastal zone and promotes active state involvement in achieving those goals. As a means to reach those goals, the CZMA requires participating states to develop management programs that demonstrate how these states would meet their obligations and responsibilities in managing their coastal areas. In New York, the New York State Department of State (NYSDOS), Office of Communities and Waterfronts is the agency responsible for administering its Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP). In Massachusetts, the responsible agency is the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (MAEOEEA), Office of Coastal Zone Management (MACZM). The coastal zone would not be affected by the Project in Connecticut or Rhode Island. Because section 307 of the CZMA requires federal agency activities to be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of a management program, the FERC has requested that Algonquin seek a determination of consistency with New York’s and Massachusetts’s CZMPs. On February 6, 2014, MACZM determined that due to the limited nature of the work in Massachusetts, the Project falls belowthe threshold requiring federal consistency. On September 2, 2014, Algonquin received its consistency certification from NYSDOS.  Section 4.8.4 of this EIS summarizes ourcompliance with the CZMA. 1.4 PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT On June 18, 2013, Algonquin filed a request with the FERC to implement the Commission’s NEPA pre-filing process for the AIM Project. The purpose of the pre-filing process is to encourage early involvement of interested stakeholders, facilitate interagency cooperation, and identify and resolve issues before an application is filed with the Commission. On June 28, 2013, the FERC granted Algonquin’s request and established a pre-filing Docket Number (PF13-16-000) to place information related to the Project into the public record. 1-14 Prior to entering the pre-filing process, Algonquin began conducting outreach activities with governmental stakeholders in the fall of 2012 and landowners in early 2013. In April and May 2013, Algonquin held six landowner informational meetings in New York, four in Connecticut, and two in Rhode Island to acquaint landowners and public officials with the Project and to gather input. After entering the pre-filing process, Algonquin held one additional landowner informational meeting in Connecticut and twoinMassachusetts in July 2013. In conjunction with the pre-filing process, Algonquin implemented a Public and Agency Participation Plan to identify stakeholders, share information regarding the Project, seek input on environmental and other issues, and provide opportunities for public comment. As part of its plan, Algonquin communicated with landowners; elected officials and staff; community leaders; federal, state, and local agencies; non-governmental organizations; local businesses; nearby residents; civic organizations; and other interested individuals and organizations. Algonquin used direct mail to provide information on the AIM Project to stakeholders and established a toll-free Project hotline and targeted Project page on the Spectra website. The website includes a Project description and overview map, information on the FERC’s environmental review process, and contact information forthe AIM Project.  In May 2013, Algonquin wrote to nine federally recognized Indian tribes (the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma, Delaware Tribe of Indians, Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribal Nation, Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribe, Mohegan Indian Tribe, Narragansett Indian Tribe, Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, and Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah)) to provide an opportunity to identify any concerns about properties of traditional religious or cultural significance that may be affected by this undertaking. In November 2013, the FERC wrote letters to the federally recognized tribes to request their comments on the proposed Project. Additional information on outreach to tribesis provided in section 4.10.1.3. Algonquin held 10 public open house meetings in August and September 2013, including 4 in New York, 3 in Connecticut, 2 in Rhode Island, and 1 in Massachusetts, to provide information on the AIM Project and solicit feedback from stakeholders on environmental issues and other concerns. We participated in these open house meetings, provided information on the Commission’s environmental review process for the AIM Project, and took comments about the Project and the alternatives.  We participated in interagency meetings, conference calls, and site visits for the AIM Project to identify issues to be addressed in this draft EIS. The meetings, conference calls, and site visits provided a forum for the exchange of information and supported the FERC’s responsibility to coordinate federal authorizations and associated environmental review of the AIM Project. Additionally, we hosted 20 regular conference calls with Algonquin and other agencies to discuss AIM Project status and issues.  We also hosted regular (mostly weekly) conference calls with tribes, Algonquin, and Algonquin’s cultural resources consultant to discuss schedule and coordination for pending cultural resources field investigations. Summaries of the meetings and calls are available for viewing on the FERC’s eLibrary website (www.ferc.gov).8 Public meetingtranscripts andcomment lettersareavailable for viewingontheFERC website (http://www.ferc.gov). Using the “eLibrary” link, select “General Search” from the eLibrary menu, enter the selected date range and “Docket No.” excluding the last three digits (i.e., PF13-16 or CP14-96), and follow the instructions. For assistance, call 1-866-208-3676, or e-mail FERCOnlineSupport@ferc.gov. Because scoping was conducted during the pre-filing review (i.e., before Algonquin filed a formal application with the FERC), PF13-16 must be entered in the Docket No. field to view the public scoping transcripts and comment letters. To view information available after Algonquin’s application was filed, including the transcripts ofthe comment meetings on the draft EIS,CP14-96must be entered in the Docket No. field. 1-15 On September 13, 2013, the FERC issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Planned Algonquin Incremental Market Project, Request for Comments on Environmental Issues, and Notice of Public Scoping Meetings (NOI). The NOI was published in the Federal Register on September 19, 2013, and copies were mailed to over 1,800 parties, including representatives of federal, state, and local agencies; elected officials; environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; potentially affected landowners; other interested parties; and local libraries and newspapers. The NOI described the FERC’s environmental review process for the AIM Project; provided a preliminary list of issues for review in this draft EIS; requested written comments from the public on the scope of the draft EIS; announced the time and location of public scoping meetings; and invited other federal, state, and local agencies to participate as cooperating agencies in the preparation of the EIS. The NOI opened the public scoping period and established a closing date of October 15, 2013 forreceiving scoping comments.  The FERC held four public scoping meetings in the AIM Project area to solicit and receive comments on environmental issues associated with this Project. The meetings were held September 30, 2013 through October 3, 2013 in the Town of Cortlandt, New York; Danbury, Connecticut; Norwich, Connecticut; and the Town of Dedham, Massachusetts. The scoping meetings provided an opportunity for the public to learn more about the proposed AIM Project and to provide comments on environmental issues to be addressedin this draftEIS. Acombined totalof31 individuals provided verbal comments at the scoping meetings. Transcripts of the meetings, as well as 579 unique written comment letters, were entered into the public record and are available for viewing on the FERC’s eLibrary website (www.ferc.gov). On August 6, 2014, we issued a Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Algonquin Incremental Market Project. This notice, which was published in the Federal Register, listed the dates and locations of public comment meetings and established a closing date of September 29, 2014 for receiving comments on the draft EIS.  Copies ofthe draft EIS were mailed to over 2,740 stakeholders. The EPA noticed receipt of the draft EIS in the Federal Register on August 15, 2014. We held five public comment meetings in the AIM Project area to solicit and receive comments on the draft EIS. The meetings were held between September 8 and September 16, 2014 in the Town of Dedham, Massachusetts; Norwich, Connecticut; Danbury, Connecticut; the Town of Cortlandt, New York; and the Town of Mapleville, Rhode Island. The meetings provided the public an opportunity to present oral comments on the analysis of environmental impacts described in the draft EIS. A combined total of approximately 692 individuals attended these comment meetings, including 143 who provided oral comments. We also received 352 individual comment letters from federal, state, and local agencies; companies/organizations; and individuals in response to the draft EIS prior to the close of the comment period on September 29, 2014. Eleven of the comment letters are form letters or petitions submitted or signed bymultiple individuals.  We also continued to accept comment letters for 2 weeks past the close of the comment period. Those letters received through October 10, 2014 included an additional 132 individual comment letters from federal, state, and local agencies; companies/organizations; and individuals and are included in our comment responses contained in Volume II.9 Letters received after October 10, 2014 continued to be posted to the eLibrary site and were reviewed by staff for additional new substantive concerns, but are not included in Volume II because no new issues were raised that were not already addressed in previous comment letters. Transcripts from the public comment meetings, as Each comment letter received through October 10, 2014 has been scanned and sorted by commentor type (i.e., federal agencies, Native American tribes, state agencies, local agencies, companies and organizations, form letters, individuals, public meetings, and applicant).

As of October 23, 2014, Algonquin had hosted and/or attended 20 meetings with various agencies, landowner groups, stakeholders, and/or the public, including:  5 meetings in New York between September 5 and October 6, 2014 with the public and/or various representatives of the Town of Cortlandt, the Village of Buchanan, and the Hendrick Hudson school district;  2 meetings in Connecticut, including an October 6, 2014 meeting with the Town Manager and Mayor of the Town of Cromwell, and an October 23, 2014 meeting with Mohegan Tribal representatives; and  13 meetings in Massachusetts between July 8 and October 23, 2014 with the public and/or various representatives from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Town of Dedham, Dedham Town Hall, Dedham Parks and Recreation Department, Town of Dedham Board of Selectman, Legacy Place Shopping Center and National Amusement, Town of Westwood, City of Boston, Boston City Council, West Roxbury Community, West Roxbury Saves Energy Steering Committee, and Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). This EIS addresses all substantive comments submitted to the FERC or made at the open houses, scoping meetings, interagency meetings, and comment meetings on the draft EIS. Table 1.4-1 lists the environmental issues and concerns identified by commentors during the scoping and comment process and identifies the section of the EIS where the issue is addressed.  Numerous commentors expressed support for the AIM Project, primarily due to the potential local employment opportunities that would be generated by the Project. However, many commentors expressed opposition to the Project. Health and safety concerns, the Project’s purpose and need, impacts on air quality, and a preference for conservation and renewable energy sources were common objections. Other concerns included cumulative environmental impacts; concerns about the environmental review process; emergency response infrastructure capacity; and impacts on water resources, wetlands, vegetation, and wildlife. Copies of this final EIS have been mailed to the agencies, individuals, organizations, and other parties identified in the distribution list provided as appendix A.  Additionally, the final EIS has been filed with the EPA for issuance of a formal Notice of Availability in the Federal Register. In accordance with the CEQ’s regulations implementing NEPA, no agency decision on the proposed actions may be made until 30 days after the EPA publishes the Notice of Availability in the Federal Register. However, the CEQ regulations provide an exception to this rule when an agency decision is subject to a formal internal appeal process that allows other agencies or the public to make their views known. This is the case at the FERC, where any Commission decision on the proposed action would be subject to a 30-day rehearing period.  Therefore, the FERC decision may be made and recorded concurrently with the publication of the final EIS or any time thereafter. 1-17 TABLE 1.4-1 Issues Identified and Comments Received for the AIM

others that are not subject to the FERC jurisdiction. There are no known non-jurisdictional facilitiesassociated with the Project.   1-19 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION 2.1 PROPOSEDFACILITIES Algonquin proposes to expand its existing natural gas transmission pipeline system in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The AIM Project involves construction and operation of about 37.4 miles of replacement, loop, and lateral pipeline facilities; modifications to 6 existing compressor stations; modifications to 24 existing M&R stations; the removal of an existing M&R station; and the construction of 3 new M&R stations as described below. The Project would also involve the abandonment of two segments of existing mainline and four compressor units at one existing compressor station. An overview map of the Project locations and facilities is provided on figure 2.1-1. Detailed maps showing the pipeline routes, aboveground facilities, and pipe and contractor ware yards are contained inappendix B.  2.1.1 Pipeline Facilities The AIM Project includes about 37.4 miles of pipeline composed ofthe following facilities:  replacement of 20.1 miles (in three segments) of existing 26-inch-diameter mainline pipeline with a new 42-inch-diameter pipeline (take-up and relay1), including 2.9 miles of new pipeline associated with crossing the Hudson River;  extension of existing loop2 pipeline with about 2.0 miles of additional 36-inch-diameter pipeline withinAlgonquin’s existing pipeline right-of-way (Line-36A Loop Extension);  replacement of about 9.1 miles of existing 6-inch-diameter pipeline with a new 16-inchdiameterpipeline (E-1 System LateralTake-up and Relay);  extension of an existing lateral loop pipeline with about 1.3 miles of additional 12-inchdiameter lateral loop pipeline within Algonquin’s existing pipeline right-of-way (E-1 System Lateral Loop);and  installation of about 4.9 miles of new lateral3 pipeline off of Algonquin’s existing I-4 System Lateral (West Roxbury Lateral). Table 2.1.1-1 summarizes the proposed pipeline facilitiesassociated with the Project. The majority of the pipeline facilities (about 26.3 miles or 70 percent of the total 37.4 miles) would replace existing Algonquin pipelines, while the remainder of the pipeline facilities (about 11.1 miles or 30 percent) consist of new mainline pipeline (Hudson River crossing, new loop pipeline, and one new lateral pipeline).  1 Take-up and relay refers to a construction method by which an existing pipeline is removed and replaced with a new pipeline in the same location andditch. 2 Apipelineloopis asegment ofpipeconstructedparallel toanexistingpipelineto increasecapacity. 3 Apipelinelateral branches offofamainlinepipelinetoconnect withorserveaspecific customer or groupofcustomers. 2-1 FAigure 2.1-1IM Project Project Overview Map TABLE 2.1.1-1 Summary of Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  New/ Existing Replacement Diameter Diameter Begin End Length b Facility County, State a (inches) (inches) Milepost Milepost (miles)  Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point Rockland, NY 26 42 0.0 3.3 3.3 Take-up and Relay Stony Point to Yorktown Rockland, NY 26 42 0.0 3.5 3.5 Take-up and Relay c Westchester, NY 26 42 3.5 12.3 8.8 Southeast to MLV 19 Putnam, NY 26 42 0.0 0.1 0.1 Take-up and Relay Fairfield, CT 26 42 0.1 4.5 4.4 E-1 System Lateral Take-New London, CT 6 16 0.0 9.1 9.1 up and Relay Loop Extension Line-36A Loop Extension Middlesex, CT NA 36 0.0 1.8 1.8 Hartford, CT NA 36 1.8 2.0 0.2 E-1 System Lateral Loop New London, CT NA 12 0.0 1.3 1.3 Extension New Pipeline West Roxbury Lateral Norfolk, MA NA 16 0.0 3.4 3.4 Suffolk, MA NA 16 3.4 4.2 0.7 Suffolk, MA NA 24 4.2 5.1 0.8 TOTAL 37.4 ____________________ a No pipeline facilities would be located in Rhode Island. b The length of the pipeline does not match the mileposting system. This is because several route modifications were incorporated into the proposed route after the mileposting system was established. This specifically affects the West Roxbury Lateral where the changes resulted in an overall decrease in total pipeline length. The changes to the other segments did not result in an overall change in the segment lengths. c The total pipeline length for the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment includes an approximately 2.9mile-long section of new mainline pipeline and right-of-way associated with the crossing of the Hudson River. NA = Not applicable  About 79 percent of the proposed pipeline facilities involve replacement and looping that occurs within or adjacent to existing Algonquin pipeline rights-of-way. The replacement work involves excavating a trench to remove the old pipe.  Once the old pipe is removed the trench is re-excavated wider and deeper (as appropriate) to accommodate the new, larger diameter pipe. The replacement pipe would be installed at approximately the same location as the old pipe in the existing Algonquin right-of-way. The loop pipeline installation involves constructing a new pipeline adjacent and parallel with other existing Algonquin pipelines. The pipeline loops require new permanent right-of-way adjacent to the existing Algonquin right-of-way. 2.1.1.1 Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-upand Relay Algonquin would replace about 3.3 miles of 26-inch-diameter mainline pipeline located upstream (southwest) of the existing Stony Point Compressor Station in Rockland County, New York with new 42inch-diametermainline pipeline.  The installment ofthe new 42-inch-diameterpipeline would begin atthe existing Algonquin MLV 13B (milepost [MP] 0.0) in the Town of Haverstraw and end at the Stony Point Compressor Station located in the Town of Stony Point (MP 3.3). The current maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of the existing 26-inch-diameter mainline is 674 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and the proposed MAOP of the 42-inch-diameter mainline pipeline is 850 psig.  2-3 2.1.1.2 Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay Downstream (northeast) of the Stony Point Compressor Station, Algonquin would construct about 12.3 miles of 42-inch-diameter mainline pipeline in the Towns of Stony Point and Cortlandt (including the Hamlet of Verplanck and the Village of Buchanan), the City of Peekskill, and the Town of Yorktown. This pipeline section includes two segments of replacement pipeline and one segment of pipeline construction within a new permanentright-of-way across the Hudson River. Algonquin would replace about 2.6 miles of 26-inch-diameter mainline pipeline starting at the Stony Point Compressor Station (MP 0.0) and extending to MP 2.6 in the Town of Stony Point. At MP 2.6, the 42-inch-diameter mainline pipeline installation would deviate fromAlgonquin’s existing right-ofway and would be within a new permanent right-of-way as part of the Hudson River crossing until MP 5.5. Algonquin would not remove or replace any of the three existing pipelines that currently cross the Hudson River within the mainline right-of-way (i.e., two existing 24-inch-diameter pipelines and a 30inch-diameter pipeline). Those existing pipelines across the river do not have sufficient available capacity to accommodate the additional volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers but Algonquin states that it would maintain service on the three existing pipelines across the river to enhance system reliability (see section 3.5.1). Instead, Algonquin would install the pipeline below the Hudson River bed using the horizontal directional drill (HDD) construction method (see section 2.3.1.2). Between MPs 5.5 and 12.3, Algonquin would replace the existing 26-inch-diameter mainline with the new 42-inch-diameter pipeline. The current MAOP of the existing 26-inch-diameter mainline is 674 psig and the proposed MAOP of the 42-inch-diameter mainline pipeline is 850 psig. In addition to the replacement pipeline, about 0.2 mile of 26-inch-diameter pipeline would be abandoned in place upon tie-in of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline at the Route 9 crossing. In this location, the pipeline would be offset about 20 feet from the existing 26-inch-diameter line to facilitate installation of the proposed pipeline. Section 2.3.1.2 describes the abandonment procedures that would be followed in this area. 2.1.1.3 Southeastto MLV 19 Take-up and Relay Algonquin would replace a 26-inch-diameter mainline pipeline segment with 42-inch-diameter pipeline located in Putnam County, New York, and Fairfield County, Connecticut. This 4.5-mile-long replacement segment would begin at the Southeast Compressor Station (MP 0.0) in the Town of Southeast, New York, and extend northeast across the New York/Connecticut state lines into the City of Danbury, Connecticut. Algonquin would install the new 42-inch-diameter pipeline beneath Interstate 84, the Still River, a railroad line, and Mill Plain Road using the HDD construction method (see section 2.3.1.2). The replacement segment would end at Algonquin’s existing MLV-19 site located east of State Route 39 (Clapboard Ridge Road). The current MAOP of the existing 26-inch-diameter mainline is 674 psig and the proposed MAOP of the 42-inch-diameter mainline pipeline is 850 psig. In addition to the replacement pipeline, about 0.7 mile of Algonquin’s existing 26-inch-diameter Southeast to MLV 19 pipeline would be abandoned in place upon tie-in of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline along the Interstate 84/Still River HDD segment. Section 2.3.1.2 describes the abandonment procedures that would be followed in these areas. 2.1.1.4 E-1 System LateralTake-up and Relay Algonquin would replace about 9.1 miles of 6-inch-diameter pipeline with 16-inch-diameter pipeline along its existing E-1 System Lateral in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed 16inch-diameter line would have the same MAOP of 750 psig as the existing 6-inch-diameter line. The replacement would begin at State Route 289 (MP 0.0) in the Town of Lebanon and extend to the southeast through the Town of Franklin, ending approximately 900 feet northwest of Plain Hill Road in the City of Norwich. 2-4 2.1.1.5 Line-36A LoopExtension Algonquin would extend its existing Line-36A loop pipeline with about 2.0 miles of additional 36-inch-diameter pipeline in Middlesex and Hartford County, Connecticut. The proposed line would be designed for an MAOP of 850 psig. This loop extension would begin at Algonquin’s existing Cromwell Compressor Station (MP 0.0) and extend downstream (east) to a termination point located approximately 1,400 feet west of the Connecticut River. The loop extension would be located within the Towns of Cromwell and Rocky Hill. 2.1.1.6 E-1 System LateralLoopExtension Algonquin would extend its existing Line-E-1L pipeline with about 1.3 miles of additional 12inch-diameter loop pipeline along its existing E-1 System Lateral. The loop pipeline would begin at the existing Montville M&R Station (MP 0.0) located on the north side of Fitch Hill Road and end approximately1.3miles to the south, endingabout100feet north ofRaymond HillRoad. The entireloop pipeline would be located within the Town of Montville in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed pipeline would have an MAOP of 750 psig. 2.1.1.7 West Roxbury Lateral Algonquin would install about 4.9 miles of new pipeline lateral off of its existing I-4 System Lateral in Norfolk County and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts to provide Boston Gas with the service it has requested. The West Roxbury Lateral would consist of about 4.1 miles of new 16-inch-diameter pipeline and about 0.8 mile of new 24-inch-diameter pipeline in the Towns of Westwood and Dedham and the West Roxbury section within the City of Boston. The West Roxbury Lateral would have an MAOP of 750 psig. 2.1.2 AbovegroundFacilities The proposed aboveground facilities consist of modifications to six existing compressor stations, to install a total 81,620 hp, in New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island; and abandon 10,800 hp in New York. Algonquin would modify 24 existing M&R stations in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, including the replacement of existing heaters and metering facilities, piping modifications, and facility uprates, depending on facility needs. The AIM Project also includes the construction of three new M&R stations in Massachusetts and Connecticut to deliver gas to NSTAR, BostonGas, and Norwich Public Utilities, and the removal of one existing M&R station in Connecticut. Algonquin would also modify three existing MLV sites and five existing launcher/receiver sites, construct five new launcher/receiver sites, construct new MLV cross over piping at two locations, and construct one new MLV. The Project aboveground facilities are described in table 2.1.2-1. The locations of the aboveground facilities are shown on the maps located in appendix B. In addition to the M&R stations listed in table 2.1.2-1, the AIM Project would also increase gas flow to eight existing Algonquin M&R stations located in Connecticut and Massachusetts. However, the inlet pressure at these facilities would not increase and, therefore, would not result in any station modifications. Two M&R stations are in Hartford County, Connecticut (Bristol M&R Station and Kensington M&R Station) and six stations are in Middlesex, Plymouth, and Norfolk Counties, Massachusetts (Ashland M&R Station, Everett M&R Station, Pine Hills M&R Station, Polaroid M&R Station, Ponkapoag M&R Station, and Weston M&R Station). In addition, there are four M&R stations in Rhode Island and three M&R stations in Massachusetts that are delivery points on the AIM Project. Given that no work is proposed at these 15 existing stations as part of the AIM Project, they have not been included in table 2.1.2-1 or further evaluated in this draft EIS. 2-5 TABLE 2.1.2-1 Proposed New and Modified Aboveground Facilities for the AIM Project  Facility Type/Facility County, State MP a Scope of Work  Existing Compressor Station Modifications b Stony Point Compressor Station Rockland, NY NA Install two new compressor units; restage one existing compressor unit; install gas cooling for one new unit; install two new heaters; install one new emergency generator; remove existing 26inch launcher/receiver barrels and MLV assembly; and install new 42-inch MLV and new suction/discharge connections.

The remaining aboveground facilities would be located at other points along Algonquin’s pipeline system and have been marked as not applicable (NA). b “Restage” describes work internal to an existing compressor unit that is housed inside a compressor building. It involves removing and replacing certain existing compressor equipment to improve operating efficiency without increasing horsepower. c The existing Willimantic M&R Station would be removed at its current location but would be rebuilt on an adjacent new parcel.  2.2 LAND REQUIREMENTS Construction of the Project would impact a total of about 575.6 acres of land, including 450.2 acres for the pipeline facilities, 94.9 acres for the aboveground facilities, 28.6 acres for the pipe and contractor ware yards, and 1.9 acres for access roads. Following construction, about 42.4 acres of new land would be permanently maintained for operation and maintenance of the AIM Project facilities, including about 33.9 acres for the new pipeline right-of-way, 6.6 acres for the aboveground facilities, and 1.9 acresforaccess roads.  Table 2.2-1 summarizes the land requirements for the AIM Project. A detailed description and breakdown of land requirements and use is presented in section 4.8.1.

therefore, these areas are not included in the acreage calculations. d A portion of the West Danbury M&R Station temporary workspace would be located within the pipeline construction workspace (2.6 acres), so the 0.3-acre is the area that would be located outside of the temporary pipeline workspace. e Work at the North Fall River M&R Station would take place within the existing station footprint. f The acres of land affected during construction at these facilities includes staging areas located a short distance away from the actual M&R station site. g This table does not include affected land calculations for MLVs, launcher/receiver facilities, and cross over piping because the land requirements for these facilities are included in the land requirements for the pipeline facilities, compressor stations, or M&R stations above.  2-10 2.2.1 Pipeline Facilities 2.2.1.1 Replacement Construction of the proposed mainline replacement portions of the AIM Project (Haverstraw to Stony Point, Stony Point to Yorktown, and Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay) would generally require a 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way to permit the safe passage of equipment and materials associated with construction of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline. This 100-foot right-of-way width does not include special crossing areas such as wetlands and waterbodies, residential areas, and agricultural areas where other construction right-of-way widths would be employed.  In most areas, the construction right-of-way includes the use of Algonquin’s existing 75-footwide permanent right-of-way. However, there are two segments where Algonquin’s existing 75-footwide right-of-way would not be part of the construction right-of-way. This includes the new segment of 42-inch-diameter pipeline to be constructed in the Towns of Stony Point and Cortlandt between MPs 2.6 and 5.5 across the Hudson River. In addition, the pipeline segment that crosses the Blue Mountain Reservation in the Town of Cortlandt between Washington Street (MP 6.7) and Maple Avenue (MP 8.4) is located within a 6-foot-wide permanent right-of-way.  Between MPs 2.6 and 5.5 of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay, Algonquin would utilize a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way and a 50-foot-wide permanent right-of-way. There would be no construction right-of-way within the Hudson River itself with the use of HDD; however, Algonquin would establish a new 10-foot-wide permanent right-of-way across the river for the 42-inchdiameter pipeline. As stated above, Algonquin would not be removing or abandoning any of the existing pipelines that cross the Hudson River in the existing permanent easement to the north of the proposed crossing location. For the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin would utilize a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way to accommodate construction of the 16-inch-diameter pipeline. The construction right-of-way would include Algonquin’s existing 50-foot-wide permanent right-of-way in these areas and an additional 25 feet of temporary workspace. Algonquin’s existing permanent right-ofway for the rest of the E-1 System Lateral is 60 feet.  As part of the AIM Project,Algonquin would obtain an additional 10 feet of new permanent right-of-way along the portions of this segment where the current right-of-way is only 50 feet to match the rest ofthe system. 2.2.1.2 Loop Extension Algonquin would use an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way to construct the Line-36A Loop to permit the safe passage of equipment and materials associated with construction of the 36-inchdiameter pipeline. The existing permanent right-of-way width along the Line-36A Loop Extension is 75 feet. The proposed construction right-of-way would include the use of the existing permanent right-ofway, to the extent practicable, and an additional 10 to 35 feet of temporary workspace. Algonquin would obtain an additional 20 to 30 feet of new permanent right-of-way for the Line-36A Loop Extension. Algonquin would use a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way for the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension. The construction right-of-way would include the use of Algonquin’s existing 30-foot-wide permanent easement, an additional 20 feet of new permanent right-of-way, and an additional 25 feet of temporary workspace. Algonquin would obtain an additional 20 feet of new permanent right-of-way along the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension segment. 2-11 2.2.1.3 New Pipeline The West Roxbury Lateral would be primarily constructed along and within existing roads and in parking lots of commercial and industrial properties. The construction right-of-way would range between 15 and 75 feet in width. In public roadways, Algonquin would seek to obtain a permit or license agreement for the installation from the City of Boston and the Town of Dedham. The distribution of the construction right-of-way would vary depending on the location. Where there is sufficient room, the distribution of the construction right-of-way would be 25 feet on the spoil side and 50 feet on the working side. In sections where the new pipeline parallels existing road or property lines, the construction rightof-way would vary between 15 and 75 feet to accommodate field conditions at the time of construction. Where the pipeline is within existing streets, the construction right-of-way would be limited to the limits of the street right-of-way. The permanent right-of-way width for the West Roxbury Lateral would be 50 feet, where available. 2.2.1.4 Collocation with Existing Rights-of-Way About 35.0 miles (93 percent) of the 37.4 miles of AIM Project pipeline facilities would be within or adjacent to existing right-of-way, consisting of Algonquin pipeline rights-of-way, public roadways, railways, and electric transmission line corridors. Table 2.2.1-1 provides locations by milepost where the AIM Project pipeline segments would be collocated with existing rights-of-way. The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would be entirely collocated with existing corridors, including Algonquin’s existing 30-inch-diameter loop pipeline and an Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. transmission line corridor.  About 10.4 miles (85 percent) of the 12.3-mile-long Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would also be collocated with existing utility corridors, including Algonquin’s 30-inch-diameter loop pipeline; an Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. transmission line corridor; and a Consolidated Edison, Inc. transmission line corridor. The only exception to this would be a portion of the new permanent right-of-way proposed along the section of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline to be installed in the Town of Stony Point and the Town of Cortlandt. About 1.8 miles (62 percent) of this 2.9-mile new pipeline segment would not be adjacentto existing corridors. The Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay, Line-36A Loop Extension, and E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension segments would be entirely collocated with Algonquin’s existing pipeline easements. The E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay would be collocated with Algonquin’s existing 10inch-diameter E-1 Pipeline, as well as a Connecticut Light & Power transmission line.  About 4.5 miles (92 percent) of the 4.9-mile-long West Roxbury Lateral would be collocated within or adjacent to existing roadways. Primary roads utilized for routing include Providence Highway, Washington Street, Grove Street, and Centre Street. The pipeline would also cross Interstate 95/State Route 128.  2-12 TABLE 2.2.1-1 Summary of Existing Rights-of-Way Adjacent to Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  MP Length Adjacent to or Within Facility County, State/Municipality Range Existing Right-of-Way (miles)  Replacement Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-Rockland, NY/Haverstraw 0.0 to 1.2 1.2 up and Relay Rockland, NY/Stony Point 1.2 to 3.3 2.1 Stony Point to Yorktown Take-Rockland, NY/Stony Point 0.0 to 2.6 2.6 up and Relay 2.7 to 2.8 0.1 3.0 to 3.1 0.1 Westchester, NY/Cortlandt 4.2 to 4.6 0.4 5.0 to 5.4 0.4 5.5 to 11.0 5.5 Westchester, NY/Yorktown 11.0 to 12.3 1.3 Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up Putnam, NY/Southeast 0.0 to 0.1 0.1 and Relay Fairfield, CT/Danbury 0.1 to 4.5 4.4 E-1 System Lateral Take-up and New London, CT/Lebanon 0.0 to 3.9 3.9 Relay New London, CT/Franklin 3.9 to 8.4 4.5 New London, CT/Norwich 8.4 to 9.1 0.7 Loop Extension Line-36A Loop Extension Middlesex, CT/Cromwell 0.0 to 1.8 1.8 Hartford, CT/Rocky Hill 1.8 to 2.0 0.2 E-1 System Lateral Loop New London, CT/Montville 0.0 to 1.3 1.3 Extension New Pipeline West Roxbury Lateral Norfolk, MA/Westwood 0.4 to 0.5 0.1 Norfolk, MA/Dedham 0.6 to 2.4 1.8 2.5 to 3.4 0.9 Suffolk, MA/West Roxbury 3.4 to 4.9 1.5  2.2.1.5 Additional Temporary Workspace In addition to the construction right-of-way configurations described above, Algonquin identified a wider construction workspace in several locations due to:  utility and existing pipeline cross-overs;  wetland and waterbodycrossings;  road crossings;  side slope construction;  topsoilsegregation requirements;  extra trench depth;  shallow bedrockand potentialassociated disposalof excessblast rock; and  parking areas. 2-13 Table C-1 in appendix C identifies the areas where Algonquin would require additional temporary workspace (ATWS), their dimensions, the acreage of impact, the justification for their use, and whether or not they require a modification from the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (E&SCP) (see section 2.3). 2.2.2 AbovegroundFacilities The AIM Project would use about 94.9 acres of temporary workspace for the construction activities associated with the aboveground facilities and about 6.6 acres of land would be permanently maintained for operations (see table 2.2-1). For the compressor stations, Algonquin would use about 79.5 acres of temporary workspace during construction within its existing properties; no new property would be required for the compressor station modifications. Temporary workspace areas include the existing developed station yards and access roads as well as some open land and wooded areas immediately surrounding the developed station site within Algonquin’s property. At the Chaplin, Burrillville, and Southeast Compressor Stations, these wooded temporary workspace areas wouldbe cleared for use during construction and allowed to naturally revegetate following post-construction restoration. No additional areawould be permanentlymaintained. However, at the StonyPoint and CromwellCompressor Stations, a portion of the wooded areas cleared within Algonquin’s existing property lines during construction would be permanently maintained as part of the facility operations. The 1.6-acre permanent impact area at the Stony Point Compressor Station consists of a wooded portion of the site that would be occupied by a portion of the AIM Project compressor building, cooler units, and the suction and discharge pipelines. At the Cromwell Compressor Station, the 1.9-acre wooded area in the northeast corner of the station site would be maintained in a non-forested state following completion of construction associated with the AIM Project to facilitate station operations. Modification work at the existing Oxford Compressor Station would take place entirely within the existing compressor building and would not require any temporary workspaceor new permanent impact. Algonquin would use about15.4 acresoftemporary workspace during construction at the existing M&R stations (11.2 acres), new M&R stations (3.9 acres), and the removal of the Greenville M&R Station (0.3 acre) (see table 2.2-1). For the existing M&R stations, Algonquin would use the developed station yards and in some cases adjacent pipeline rights-of-way and open land for temporary workspace. About 3.1 acres of new land would be permanently affected as part of the operation of the three new M&R stations (2.6 acres) and the rebuild of the Willimantic M&R Station (0.5 acre) on a new property adjacent to the existing station site. None of the other proposed aboveground facilities would require additional land for construction or operation. The acreage for these facilities is included in the acreage associated with the pipeline facilities, compressor stations, orM&R stations. 2.2.3 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards To support construction activities, Algonquin plans to use four pipe yards in Connecticut and New York on a temporary basis. These yards would be used by the contractor and/or Algonquin to stage personnel, equipment, new pipe, and other materials necessary for construction of the facilities, and could include contractor trailers, construction equipment, fuel/lubricant storage, and vehicle parking. Table 2.2.3-1 presents the land requirements for currently identified pipe yards and contractor ware yards proposed for temporary use during construction of the AIM Project facilities. The locations of these pipe yard sites are shown on the maps provided in appendix B. Upon completion of construction, yards would be restored to the extent practicable and allowed to revertto previous land uses. 2-14 TABLE 2.2.3-1 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards for the AIM Project  State/Yard Name  Size Location (acres) Existing Land Use  Dansville-NY Yard Danbury – CT Yard Franklin – CT Yard Project Total  9431 Foster Wheeler Road, 20.0 Industrial storage yard. Dansville, NY 93 Mill Plain Road, 3.0 Construction equipment storage yard. Danbury, CT 32 New Park Road 5.6 Box trailer truck parking lot used previously for an Franklin, CT Algonquin project. 28.6  2.2.4 Access Roads To the extent feasible, Algonquin would use existing public and private road crossings along the proposed Project routes as the primary means of accessing pipeline rights-of-way and aboveground facilities. In addition to the existing access available by the use of public roads, Algonquin has identified a total of 36 access roads for use on the AIM Project, including 28 temporary access roads (TAR) and 8 permanent access roads (PAR). With one exception, the existing roads are comprised of gravel roads, unimproved dirt roads, paved and gravel driveways, private industrial and commercial roads, paved parking lots, and golf course roads. The exception is a new PAR to be constructed for the new Assonet M&R Station. Although Algonquin would be using existing roads for temporary and permanent access, seven of these existing roads would require minor upgrades and/or widening (by about 10 feet) to accommodate use during pipeline construction.  These upgrades would result in about 1.9 acresof new land disturbance. Algonquin would also need to construct one new PAR from the existing North Fall River M&R Station site to the new Assonet M&R Station. This new PAR would permanently disturb less than 0.1 acre (0.03 acre) of land. At the new Oakland Heights M&R Station, Algonquin would utilize Oakland Drive, an existing 25-foot-wide private paved road off of Hunters Road in the City of Norwich, to access the new M&R site for operation. No road upgrades are required for this new PAR. Table 2.2.4-1 identifies the locations of new and existing access roads associated with the AIM Project. 2.3 CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES The AIM Project would be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to conform to, or exceed, the minimum federal safety standard requirements of PHMSA in 49 CFR 192,4 and other applicable federal and state regulations, including U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements. These regulations are intended to ensure adequate protection for the public. Among other design standards, Part 192 specifies pipeline material and qualification, minimum design requirements, and protection from internal, external, and atmospheric corrosion. 4 Pipe design regulations for steel pipe are contained in subpart C, Part 192. Section 192.105 contains a design formula for the pipeline’s design pressure. Sections 192.107 through 192.115 contain the components of the design formula, including yield strength, wall thickness, design factor, longitudinal joint factor, and temperature derating factor, which are adjusted accordingto the project design conditions, such as pipe manufacturing specifications, steel specifications, class location, and operatingconditions.

NA = Not Applicable  To reduce construction impacts, Algonquin would implement the AIM Project-specific E&SCP.5 The E&SCP is based on the mitigation measures contained in the FERC’s Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan (Plan) and FERC’s Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures (Procedures),6aswell as guidelines fromthe USACEand the FWS. Wereviewed the E&SCP, found it to be acceptable, and have determined that Algonquin’s adherence to the requirements in the E&SCP would reduce the impacts of the Project. As indicated in table C-1 in appendix C, the use of several ATWS would require alternative measures from the FERC’s Plan and Procedures. These are discussed in more detail in sections 4.3.2.4 and 4.4.4. The E&SCP is further discussed in sections 4.2.2 and 4.4.3. 5 Algonquin’s E&SCP was included as appendix 1B to Resource Report 1 in its February 28, 2014 application (Accession No. 20140228-5269).

The FERC Plan can be viewed on the FERC Internet website at http://www.ferc.gov/industries/gas/enviro/plan.pdf. The FERC Procedures can be viewed on the FERC Internet website at http://www.ferc.gov/industries/gas/enviro/procedures.pdf. 2-18 To avoid or minimize the potential for harmful spills and leaks during construction, Algonquin developed an acceptable Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan/Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency Plan for the Algonquin Incremental Market Project (SPCC Plan).7 The SPCC Plan describes spill and leak preparedness and prevention practices, procedures for emergency preparedness and incident response, and training requirements. Additional discussion of the SPCC Plan is presented in sections 4.2.2.6, 4.3.1.7, and 4.3.2.6. Other resource-specific plans that have been developed for the proposed Project are discussed in more detail in section4.0. 2.3.1 Pipeline Facilities The AIM Project pipeline facilities would be located in a wide variety of land use settings. For example, the mainline replacement segments in New York and Connecticut include areas of undeveloped woodlands, steep rocky slopes, suburban residential neighborhoods, and moderately populated urban areas. In contrast, the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay and E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension segments would be located in rural areas with low-density residential population and abundant agricultural land. The proposed West Roxbury Lateral would be located in a densely developed urban area. Given the wide mix in land use types in the Project construction areas, several construction techniques would be utilized forthe Project as described in the following sections. Table 2.3.1-1 provides a summary of Algonquin’s proposed construction methods for the Project. The construction methods are further described in sections 2.3.1.1 and 2.3.1.2. Table D-1 in appendix D providesa comprehensive listing of proposed construction techniques by milepost. TABLE 2.3.1-1 Approximate Mileage by Construction Method for the AIM Project  Construction Method Length (miles)  Standard 21.5 Drag-section 10.1 a In-street 4.1 Bore 0.3 HDD 1.4 Total 37.4 ____________________ a In-street construction may involve a variety of construction methods including stove-pipe, drag-section, or open cut.  Algonquin’s SPCC Plan was provided as part ofits responses to the April 10, 2014 FERC Environmental Data Request filed on April 30, 2014 (Accession No. 20140430-5528).

The required construction activities include the following:  surveying and staking  clearing operations, where required;  right-of-way and temporary construction workspace grading;  trench excavation;  blasting, where required;  pipe stringing, bending, and welding;  lowering-in, tie-ins, and backfilling;  cleaning and hydrostatic testing; and  cleanup and restoration. Surveying and Staking Algonquin would notify affected landowners before initiating preconstruction surveys. A crew would then survey and stake the outside limits of the construction work areas, centerline location of the pipeline, road crossings, and any ATWS, such as lay down areas or at stream crossings. The “One Call” system of each state would be contacted and underground utilities (e.g., cables, conduits, and pipelines) would be located and flagged. Clearing Operations Clearing would be minimized for construction of the Project because existing pipeline rights-ofway, roadways, utility rights-of-way, and other industrial and commercial sites would be used for a significant portion of the construction right-of-way. The primary clearing work for the Project would occur in the temporary construction workspace beyond Algonquin’s existing maintained right-of-way.  Initial clearing operations would include the removal of vegetation within the pipeline right-of-way and the temporary construction workspace either by mechanical or hand cutting methods. The limits of clearing would be identified and flagged in the field before beginning any clearing operations. In wetlands, trees and brush would either be cut with rubber-tired and/or tracked equipment, or hand-cut. Unless grading is required for safety reasons, wetland vegetation would be cut off at ground level, leaving existing root systems intact, and the aboveground vegetation removed from the wetlands for chipping or disposal. In uplands, tree stumps and rootstock would be left in the temporary workspace, wherever possible, to encourage naturalrevegetation.  Stumps would be removed from the right-of-way to approved disposal locations. Brush and tree limbs would be chipped and removed from the right-of-way for approved disposal. The cleared width within the right-of-way and temporary construction workspace would be kept to the minimum that would allow for spoil storage, staging, assembly of materials and all other activities required to safely construct the pipeline. Following clearing and before grading activities, erosion controls would be installed at the required locations as outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP, and maintained throughout the construction process. 2-20 1. Survey and Staking 11.

Typically, the grading of the right-of-way would be completed with bulldozers. Backhoes would be used in conjunction with bulldozers in areas where boulders and tree stumps require removal. A travel lane or traffic control would be maintained to allow forthe passage of daily traffic. The mainline replacement pipeline facilities cross numerous residential properties. At these locations, topsoil would be stripped and stockpiled separately from the subsoil during grading. There may be some areas where the construction right-of-way is limited and topsoil would need to be stockpiled offsite. Topsoil would be replaced with appropriate imported material as required. The mixing of topsoil with subsoil would be minimized by using topsoil segregation construction methods in active agricultural lands and wetlands (except when standing wateror saturated soils are present). Trench Excavation A trench would be excavated by a backhoe to the proper depth to allow for the burial of the pipe. The trench would be deep enough (about 7 feet deep for the 42-inch-diameter mainline pipeline and 36inch-diameter loop extension pipeline and 6 feet deep for the 24-, 16-, and 12-inch-diameter loops and laterals) to provide for a minimum of 3 feet of cover over the pipe after backfilling; however, the smaller diameter pipelines could be installed with less than 3 feet of cover in areas of shallow bedrock. Deeper burial may be required in specific areas. The excavated material would be placed next to the trench or in approved ATWSortrucked offsite so asto avoid unnecessary movement of machinery acrossthe terrain.  Dewatering of the pipeline trench may be required in areas with a high water table or after a heavy rain. All trench water would be discharged into well-vegetated upland areas or properly constructed dewatering structures to allow the water to infiltrate back into the ground. If trench dewatering is necessary in or near a waterbody, the removed trench water would be discharged into an energy dissipation/sediment filtration device, such as a geotextile filter bag or straw bale structure located away from the water’s edge to prevent heavily silt-laden water from flowing into nearby waterbodies in accordance with the AIM Project’s E&SCP and all applicable permits.  A discussion on contaminated groundwater or soil that could be encountered during construction of the AIM Project is provided in sections 4.2.1.5 and 4.3.1.6.  Rock Removal andBlasting Given the presence of surface rock in large portions of the Project area, blasting for rock removal would be required during construction of the AIM Project. Rock encountered during trenching would be removed using one of the techniques listed below. The technique selected is dependent on the relative hardness, fracture susceptibility, and expected volume of the material.  Techniques include:  conventional excavation with a backhoe;  ripping with a bulldozer followed by backhoe excavation;  hammering with a pointed backhoe attachment followed by backhoe excavation; or  a combination of drilling holes to weaken the rock and hammering or ripping to fragment the rock.  blasting followed by backhoe excavation; or  blasting surfacerock priorto excavation. 2-22 If blasting is required for the Project, it would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E) as well as applicable state blasting codes and any local blasting requirements. All blasting activity would be performed by state-licensed professionals according to strict guidelines designed to control energy release. Proper safeguards would be taken to protect personnel and property in the area. This includes conducting preconstruction surveys of homes and businesses, as approved by the landowner. Blasting mats or soil cover would be used as necessary to prevent the scattering of loose rock. Blasting would be conducted during daylight hours and would not begin until occupants of nearby buildings, stores, residences, and places of business have been notified. Algonquin would comply with applicable regulations that apply to blasting and blast vibration limits with regard to structures and underground utilities. Rock removal and blasting are further discussed in section 4.1.6 and in Algonquin’s Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E). We have reviewed the Rock Removal Plan and find it to be acceptable. Pipe Stringing, Bending, and Welding Once the trench is excavated, the next process in standard pipeline construction is stringing the pipe along the trench. Stringing involves initially hauling the pipe by tractor-trailer, generally in 40-foot lengths from the pipe storage yard, onto the right-of-way. The pipe would be off-loaded from trucks and placed nextto the trench using a side-boom tractor.  The pipe joints would belined up end-to-end to allow for welding into continuous lengths known as strings. For pipe construction in urban areas, Algonquin would likely utilize mini-crews where the pipe would be hauled to the work site daily. Some pipe may be stockpiled on the right-of-wayand would be fenced and stabilized ifleft over night. Once the sections of pipe have been placed on the right-of-way, the pipe is bent as necessary so the pipe fits the horizontal and vertical contours of the excavated trench. Pipe is usually bent with a hydraulic pipe-bending machine.  Professional welders qualified according to applicable industry standards and Algonquin’s requirements would weld the joints of pipe together in two steps. The front-end welding crew would clean and align the pipe bevels in preparation for welding and place at least the first two passes in the welding process. The back-end welders would complete the welds started by the front-end welders. The pipe is welded into long strings to minimize the number of welds that have to be made in the trench (tie-in welds).  Each weld is inspected by an independent certified Non Destruction Test technician to ensure its structural integrity is consistent with 49 CFR 192 of PHMSA’s regulations. X-ray or ultrasonic images are taken and processed on site for virtually instantaneous results. Those welds that do not meet the Algonquin’s specifications would be repaired or replaced and re-inspected. The pipeline is coated to prevent corrosion. The pipe lengths would be coated (usually with a heat-applied epoxy) at a coating mill prior to being delivered to the Project. The ends of each piece are left bare to allow for welding. After welding, the weld area is field coated by the coating crew. Because pipeline coatings are electrically insulating, the coating is inspected using equipment that emits an electric charge to ensure there are no locations on the pipeline with a defect in the coating. 2-23 After a pipe string has been coated and inspected, the trench is prepared for the installation of the pipeline.  The trench is cleared of loose rock and debris.  If water exists in the trench, the water is pumped out into a well-vegetated upland area and/or into an approved filter with the exception of wetland areas where the “push pull” installation may be required. In sandy soils, the trench is shaped to support the pipe. In areas where the trench contains bedrock, a sand bedding is placed on the bottom of the trench, and/or pads made of sandbags and/or clay are placed at regular intervals along the trench bottom to supportthe pipe. The lowering-in crew places the pipeline in the trench, usually with side-boom tractors. Once the sections of pipe are lowered-in, the tie-in crew makes any final welds in the trench. Additional excavations as needed, lowering-in, lining up, welding, weld nondestructive inspection, and coating the final welds are accomplished by this crew. All suitable material excavated during trenching would be redeposited into the trench. Where excavated material is unsuitable for backfilling, then additional select fill may be required. If the soil is rocky, the pipe would be padded with relatively rock-free material placed immediately around the pipe. This material may be obtained from commercial areas in the region. Where suitable, the subsoil may be mechanically screened to produce suitable padding material. Padding of the pipe is usually performed with backhoes. If padding is obtained from an offsite source, it is normally placed in the trench by front-end loaders. Topsoil would not be used as padding material. Once the pipe is padded, the trench is then backfilled with suitable excavated subsoil material. Before the completion of backfilling 12-inches below natural grade, 24-inch-wide bright yellow warning tape would be installed designating the location of the pipeline below. The yellow tape would have a warning notice indicating the presence of a high-pressure natural gas pipeline and provide Algonquin’s toll free number for contact. The top of the trench may be slightly crowned to compensate for settling except for paved areas, where standard compaction methods would be employed. The topsoil is then spread across the graded construction right-of-way when applicable. The soilwould be inspected for compaction, and scarified as necessary. Cleaning andHydrostatic Testing Once the pipeline tie-ins are completed, it is internally cleaned with pipeline “pigs.” A manifold is installed on one end of the long pipeline section and a pig is propelled by compressed air through the pipeline into an open pig catcher to remove any dirt, water, or debris that was inadvertently collected within the pipeline during installation. After cleaning, the pipeline segments would be pressure tested in accordance with Algonquin’s requirements to ensure that they are capable of operating safely at the intended design pressure. Hydrostatic testing would be conducted in accordance with applicable permits, and no chemicals would be added to the test water. The pipeline is hydrostatically tested with water that is normally obtained from water sources crossed by the pipeline, including available municipal supply lines. See section 4.3.2.5 for a discussion on water source(s) and quantities that would be required to hydrostatically test each of the AIM Project facilities. The water propels a pig through the pipeline in a manner that fills the pipeline with water. Test pressure is obtained by adding water to the test section of the pipeline with a high-pressure pump. At the completion of the hydrostatic test, the pressure is removed from the section and the water is released from the test section by propelling the pig with air, which forces the water from the pipeline. Additional “drying” pig runs are made, if necessary, to remove any residual water from the pipeline. All hydrostatic test water would be discharged within suitable vegetated upland areas in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP. 2-24 Final cleanup (including final grading) and installation of permanent erosion control measures would be completed within 20 days after the trench is backfilled, weather and soil conditions permitting.  In conjunction with backfilling operations, any woody material and construction debris would be removed from the right-of-way. The right-of-way would be fine-graded to prepare for restoration. Permanent slope breakers or diversion berms would be constructed and maintained in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP. Fences, sidewalks, driveways, stone walls, and other structures would be restored or repaired as necessary. Revegetation would be completed in accordance with state and municipal requirements (where applicable) and written recommendations on seeding mixes, rates, and dates obtained from the local soil conservation authorityorotherdulyauthorized agencyand inaccordancewith Algonquin’s E&SCP.  The right-of-way would be seeded within 6 working days following final grading, weather and soil conditions permitting. Alternative seed mixes specifically requested by the landowner or required by agencies may be used. Any soil disturbance that occurs outside the permanent seeding season or any bare soil left unstabilized by vegetation would be mulched in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP.   2.3.1.2 Special Construction Procedures In addition to the standard pipeline construction methods described above, Algonquin would implement special construction procedures due to site-specific conditions and to reducer overall Project impacts. Same Ditch ReplacementConstruction Method About 26.3 miles of the Project would involve replacing existing pipeline with a larger diameter pipeline within the same ditch as the existing pipeline. This involves excavating a trench to remove the existing pipe; followed by the removal of the pipe. The removed pipe would then be transported away from the construction work area and properly disposed. Once the existing pipe is removed, the trench would be re-excavated wider and deeper (as appropriate) to accommodate the new, larger diameter pipeline, and the replacement pipe would be installed at approximately the same location as the existing pipe using standard construction methods (see section 2.3.1.1).  Where the existing pipeline crosses major roadways and is cased, and the crossing method is bore or HDD, the carrier pipe would be removed and the casing pipe would be abandoned in place by capping and filling with appropriate material. Where casing pipe is not present, the carrier pipe would be abandoned in place. In these instances, the new pipeline would be installed with a 10-foot offset from the abandoned pipe or directly under the existing pipe, depending on the locations and depths of existing foreign utilities in the roadway. Where the pipeline to be removed or abandoned is in the proposed construction right-of-way for the new pipeline, the defined construction right-of-way would notbe exceeded during removal.  Abandonment Construction Method For the sections of pipe that would be abandoned at the Route 9 and Interstate 84 crossings, the pipe would first be inspected for free flowing liquids and if present all free flowing liquids would be removed and disposed ofin accordance with all federal and state requirements.  Wipe sampleswould then be taken at each end of the 0.2-mile-long segment at Route 9 and the 0.7-mile-long segment at Interstate 84 to check for residual polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (see section 4.8.6.2). Each end would then be capped using a steel plate with a threaded fitting. The pipe would then be filled with 2-25 cement grout and each end would be permanently closed using threaded plugs. Considering the 26-inchdiameter mainline would be in the same right-of-way as the existing 30-inch-diameter pipeline, Algonquin would continue to maintain the right-of-way. Road and Railroad Crossing Construction Methods The AIM Project would require 100 public road crossings and 5 railroad crossings. These roads and railroads are listed in table F-1 in appendix F. Constructing the AIM Project across public and private roadways and railroads, using either conventional open cut or road bore methods, would be based on site conditions and road opening permit requirements. Roadway opening permits would be obtained from applicable state and local agencies. Permit conditions would ultimately dictate the day-to-day construction activities at road crossings.  Construction would be scheduled for work within roadways and specific crossings so as to minimize impacts on commuter traffic. Appropriate traffic management and signage would be set up and necessary safety measures would be developed in compliance with applicable permits for work in the public roadway. Arrangements would be made with local officials to have traffic safety personnel or qualified and trained flaggers on hand during periods of construction. Provisions would be made for detours or otherwise to permit traffic flow if needed. Crossings of private roadways would be coordinated with landowners to minimize access impacts. In those areas where the excavation of a longer length of trench would not pose a safety problem, the pipeline would be installed using the standard open trench method. Open trenches would either be backfilled or covered with steel plates during all non-working hours. Steel plates would be kept on site at each crossing so that a temporary crossing could be made across the trench as required (e.g., emergency vehicles). Roadway crossing construction wouldoccur using one of the methods described below. Open-cut Crossing This method is used on driveways, parking lots, and roads with low traffic densities where pipeline installation activities would not adversely impact the general public. The first step is to install the proper traffic control devices. Traffic would be detoured around the open trench during the installation process. The pipeline crossing would be installed one lane at a time. As the pipe is installed, successive lanes are alternately taken out of servicefor pipe installation until the crossing is completed. Another option is to detour traffic around the work area through the use of adjacent roadways. If the roadway surface is paved, pavement over the proposed trench is cut, removed, and properly disposed. The trench would be excavated using a combination of a backhoe and hand shoveling around existing utilities once the ditch is completed and the pipe is installed (welded, inspected, and coated). All existing utilities exposed during excavation would be supported at their existing elevation to avoid damage.  Support would be maintained until backfill of the pipeline ditch and the exposed utility are completed. The trench is then backfilled. A 15:1 sand to concrete mix called flowable fill, or Controlled Density Fill, may be used as backfill material to 1 foot over the pipeline.  The additional backfill must be compacted to reduce stresses on the pipeline and to ensure the roadway supports the traffic load without settling. The existing trench subsoil may be used in the backfill if it can be compacted and is authorized by the permitting agency. In those cases where existing trench material is not used, backfill material would be obtained from an outside source and hauled in. The material used and methods of placement would comply with the requirements of the permitting agency.  2-26 Once the ditch line is backfilled, the contractor would install and maintain a temporary patch in the excavated areas. Final paving of existing roadways would be completed in accordance with applicable state and municipal requirements. With appropriate approvals, final paving may be accomplished the year following pipeline construction to allow for potential settlement of the ditch line in the road surface. Roadway markings and striping would be added as necessary. As required by PHMSA, pipeline markers would be placed adjacent to local roadways and decals would be placed on paved areas identifying the presence of a pipeline belowthe surface of the pavement. Bore Crossing On roads with higher traffic densities and for railroads where service must be maintained, the pipeline may be installed by boring a hole under the road or railway. The soil and/or rock are bored by a drill that contains a cutting head which cuts through the soil. Dummy casing, which is slightly larger in diameter than the pipeline, may be installed immediately behind the cutting head. An auger is placed inside the pipe to remove the cuttings. Once the bore is completed, the pipeline section is welded to the boring pipe and pulled into place as the boring pipe is removed. Any voids between the pipeline and the subsoil are filled with grout (a sand-cement mix) to prevent settlement of the roadway surface or railroad track. This method allows the road or railroad to remain in service while the installation process takes place and minimizes the potential fortrench settlement.  Cased Crossing The procedure for a cased crossing is similarto a bored crossing with one exception.  A section of steel casing pipe, which is several inches in diameter greater than the pipeline, is bored into place.  Casing sections are welded together to ensure the casing length is sufficient to cross the entire roadway. Once the casing pipe has been installed, the pipeline is pulled through the casing. To prevent potential corrosion of the pipeline due to contact between the pipeline and the casing, the pipeline is insulated from the casing pipe; usually the pipeline is coated with a layer of concrete. To prevent water from entering the casing, the ends of the casing are sealed with rubber or polyethylene seals. The space between the casing and the pipeline is vented to the atmosphere through the use of sections of small diameter pipe (vent pipe), which are welded to the casing ends and run from the casing to several feet above the surface of the ground. Casing pipe would be installed when required by permit or when there is a likelihood of encountering rock during the boring. Generally, crossings of major federal and state highways and certain railroads are installed using casings. Hammer Technique In addition to the boring techniques described above, one additional technique consists of driving casing pipe that is slightly larger in diameter than the proposed pipeline under the roadway with a horizontal air-operated reciprocating hammer. The casing pipe is placed against the end of the trench near the edge of the roadway and driven under the paved road. Once in place, the material inside the casing is augured out and the pipe is installed through the casing. The casing pipe is then removed while grout is placed around the pipeline.  In-street Construction Methods In addition to road crossings, portions of the West Roxbury Lateral would be constructed within or along existing roadways. Algonquin would need to obtain road opening permits from the City of Boston and the Town of Dedham before conducting work in these roadways. For in-street construction, traffic control devices would first be installed. Traffic would be detoured around the construction area duringthe installation process.  The workingarea alonganystreet wouldbe limited to areas designated in 2-27 applicable road opening permits. All in-street construction activities would be limited to this section, and this work area would move along the street as construction advances. Pavement over the proposed trench is cut, removed, and properly disposed. The trench is excavated using a backhoe and the pipe is installed (welded, radiographed, and coated). Excavation of the trench would proceed ahead of pipe installation to provide the contractor information regarding the existing utilities that would have to be crossed and to make vertical or horizontaladjustments in the alignment ofthe pipeline. The trench is then backfilled.  No trench would be left unprotected overnight because the trench would be backfilled or plated to ensure public safety. A 15:1 sand to concrete mix called flowable fill, or Controlled Density Fill, may be used. The backfill must be compacted to reduce stresses on the pipeline and to ensure the roadway supports the traffic load without settling. The existing trench subsoil may be used in the backfill if it can be compacted and is authorized by the permitting agency. In most cases, backfill material would be obtained from an outside source and hauled in. The material used and methods of placement would comply with the requirements of the permitting agency. Any excess spoils from the trench would be transported to a designated staging area(s) or workspace along the route where it would be temporarily stockpiled on an impervious surface and kept covered while soil management options are assessed. Stockpiled soil would be sampled and evaluated to determine the proper receiving facility for the material. The material would be transported to the receiving facility with proper documentation in accordance with federal and state regulations.  As with road crossings, once the ditch line is backfilled, the contractor would install and maintain a temporary patch in the excavated areas. Final paving of existing roadways would be completed in accordance with applicable state and municipal requirements. With appropriate approvals, final paving may be accomplished the year following pipeline construction to allow for potential settlement of the ditch line in the road surface. Algonquin would repave from curb-to-curb the Town of Dedham’s roadways affected by the pipeline. Roadway markings and striping would be added as necessary. As required by PHMSA, pipeline markers would be placed adjacent to local roadways and decals would be placed on paved areas identifying the presence ofa pipeline belowthe surface of the pavement. Algonquin has developed acceptable traffic management plans for the New York and Massachusetts portions of the AIM Project. These plans are provided in appendix G and discussed in more detail in section 4.9.5. Drag-Section and Stove-Pipe Specialized Construction Methods Construction in commercial/industrial areas and high-density urban areas would be accomplished by conventional construction methods, or by implementing specialized construction methods such as the drag-section or stove-pipe methods. These specialized methods are used to reduce the amount of workspace and duration of construction activity in the immediate vicinity of commercial and other high-density urban areas. The pipeline trench would be excavated as the pipeline section is fabricated, inspected, and made ready forinstallation. For the drag-section method, several sections of pipe are prefabricated, the trench is dug to accommodate only the distance that can be installed and backfilled, the prefabricated pipeline segments (or drag sections) are placed into the trench and backfilled. For the stove-pipe method, one short section of trench is dug, a section of pipe is laid in the trench and welded into place, and that section of the trench is backfilled. Both specialized construction methods minimize the amount of land required for construction and the time the trench is left open. 2-28 Residential properties and other structures within 50 feet of construction work areas are identified in table H-1 in appendix H. Algonquin would undertake efforts in residential areas to minimize neighborhood and traffic disruption and to control noise and dustto the extent practicable. The following measures would be taken on residential properties:  notify localresidents via U.S. mail 7 to 14 days in advance of construction activities;  fence the boundary to the construction work area to ensure construction equipment, materials, and spoil remain in the construction right-of-way;  preserve all mature trees and landscaping where practical;  ensure piping is welded and installed as quickly asreasonably possible;  backfill the trench as soon as the pipe is laid ortemporarily steel plate the trench; and  complete final cleanup (including final grading) and installation of permanent erosion control measures within 10 days after the trench is backfilled, weather conditions permitting. For residences within 50 feet of the construction workspace, Algonquin has developed individual Residential Construction Plans noting special construction techniques and mitigation measures. These plans show the typical construction area to be disturbed and safety measures that would be implemented, such as construction fencing, access provisions, and use of steel plates. We reviewed the Residential Construction Plans, found them to be acceptable, and have determined that Algonquin’s adherence to the requirements in the plans and our additional recommendations would reduce the potential impacts of construction on nearby residences. These plans are provided in appendix H. Additional analysis of the impacts on residential areas and residencesis provided in section 4.8.3. Rugged Topography Both temporary and permanent erosion controls would be necessary to adequately minimize erosion and sedimentation during construction activities in steep and rugged terrain. Temporary slope breakers are intended to reduce the runoff velocity and divert water off of the right-of-way. Temporary trench breakers may be used in conjunction with the temporary slope breakers to adequately channel the surface flow off of the right-of-way. In terrain with slopes too steep to safely and adequately construct the temporary slope breakers and temporary trench plugs, they may be placed where practicable, at the discretion of the Environmental Inspector (EI). Section 2.5 further describes the role and responsibilities of the EI. Permanent trench breakers consisting of sandbags, gravel, cement, or cement-filled sacks would be installed when the trench is backfilled in ditches over and around the pipe in areas of slope with erosion potential. Temporary trench plugs, usually composed of compacted earth or other suitable low-permeable material, would be used to isolate waterbodies and wet areas to minimize channeling of groundwater along the ditch line during construction. 2-29 The following special construction techniques would be used during construction along side slopes. During grading, the upslope side of the pipeline right-of-way would be cut. The material removed from the cut would be used to fill the downslope edge of the right-of-way in order to provide a safe and level surface from which to operate the heavy equipment. Side hills may require ATWS downslope in order to accommodate the fill material. During grade restoration, the spoil would be placed back in the cut and compacted. Any springs or seeps found in the cut would be carried downslope through polyvinyl chloridepipe and/or gravel French drains installed as part ofthe cut restoration.  Permanent slope breakers would be constructed in coordination with the placement of the trench breakers in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP. During restoration, seed would be applied at an increased application rate to increase the probability of establishment and rapid stabilization. In rugged terrain, additional types of temporary erosion controls such as super silt fence, erosion control matting, and hydro-mulching may be used during construction and restoration activities. Active Agricultural Land Topsoil would be segregated in agriculturally cultivated or rotated croplands, pastures, and hayfields. In these areas, topsoil would be stripped and placed separate from subsoil when excavating the trench. Excess rock would be removed from at least the top 12 inches of soil to the extent practical. The size, density, and distribution of rock left in construction work areas should be similar to adjacent areas not disturbed by construction, unless otherwise approved in writing by the landowner. ATWS may be required when topsoil segregation is required. After the pipe has been lowered into the ditch, subsoil is used for backfilling and topsoil is then spread across the graded right-of-way.  Equipment traffic would be controlled within agricultural land to minimize rutting or compaction. Soil compaction would be treated, as necessary, in conjunction with the Algonquin's E&SCP. See section 4.8.1 for additional discussion on agricultural land. Waterbody Construction Methods Construction of the AIM Project would cross 39 waterbodies in New York, 62 in Connecticut, and 1 in Massachusetts (see table I-1 in appendix I). The waterbody crossings would be constructed in accordance with the methods and timing restrictions described in Algonquin’s E&SCP and state and federal permit requirements. To minimize potential impacts, waterbodies, streams, and rivers would be crossed as quickly and as safely as possible. Adherence to the construction procedures would ensure stream flow would be maintained throughout construction. Flowing waterbodies would be crossed by the pipeline facilities using conventional backhoe type equipment and dry crossing techniques to isolate the work area.  Unless dry at the time of crossing, minor streams (those less than 10 feet wide) would be crossed using a dry crossing method. The dry crossing method would involve installation of a flume pipe(s) and/or dam and pump before trenching to divert the stream flow over the construction area and allow trenching of the stream crossing in drier conditions isolated from the stream flow (see figures 2.3.1-2 and 2.3.1-3). Spoil removed during the trenching would be stored away from the water's edge and protected by sediment containment structures. Pipe strings would be fabricated on one bank and either pulled across the stream bottom to the opposite bank or carried into place and lowered into the trench. Where these methods are employed, ATWS areas would be required for assembly of the pipe strings and spoil storage areas. 2-30 LIMIT OF CONSTRUCTION ROW SPOIL PROPOSED TRENCH DOWNSTREAM DAM ENERGY DISSIPATOR 50' EXTRA WORKSPACE  PUMP UPSTREAM BALES LINED WITH DAM IMPERMEABLE LINER SPOIL STANDBY PUMP CULVERT PLACE SEDIMENT BARRIERS ACROSS TEMPORARY BRIDGE WORKING SIDE OF ROW AT THE END OF (IF NEEDED) EACH DAY SILT FENCE, DOUBLE STAKED STRAW BALES, OR BOTH AS NECESSARY LIMIT OF CONSTRUCTION ROW 50' EXTRA WORKSPACE For environmental review purposes only.  Figure 2.3.1-3 AIM Project Typical Dam and Pump Method Waterbody Crossing  The open-cut crossing method would involve excavation of the pipeline trench across the waterbody, installation of the pipeline, and backfilling of the trench with no effort to isolate flow from construction activities. This method would only be used at stream crossings where there is no perceptible waterflow at the time of construction.  Use ofthe open-cut crossing method on any waterbodies would be confirmed during the federal and state permitting processes. Excavation and backfilling of the trench would be accomplished using backhoes or other excavation equipment working from the banks of the waterbody. Trench spoil would be stored at least 10 feet from the banks (topographic conditions permitting). A section of pipe long enough to span the entire crossing would be fabricated on one bank and either pulled across the bottom to the opposite bank, floated across the stream, or carried into place and submerged into the trench. The trench would then be backfilled and the bottom of the watercourse and banks restored and stabilized. Sediment barriers, such as silt fencing, staked straw bales, or trench plugs would be installed to prevent spoil and sediment-laden water from entering the waterbody from adjacent upland areas. Except where reasonable alternative access is available, temporary construction equipment crossings would be installed across all waterbodies to gain access along the right-of-way for construction operations. Equipment crossings would be installed after clearing to minimize streambed disturbance and downstream siltation.  Only clearing equipment and equipment necessary for the installation of equipment bridges would cross waterbodies prior to bridge installation. Where culverts are used, devices would also be placed at the outlet to prevent scouring of the stream bottom. After such equipment crossings are established, construction equipment would not be permitted to drive through the waterbody for access, and the equipment crossings would be removed once access in the area is no longer needed. After clearing activities, construction equipment must cross waterbodies on bridges consisting of one of the following devices:  clean rock fill and culverts;  equipment pads, wooden mats, and/orculverts; or  flexi-float or portable bridge. To facilitate pipeline construction across waterbodies, ATWS may be needed adjacent to the waterbody to assemble and fabricate the length of pipe necessary to complete the crossing. This work area is in addition to the standard construction right-of-way and would be located at least 50 feet away from the stream banks in cleared areas. If topographic conditions do not permit a 50-foot setback, then these areas would be located atleast10 feetawayfromthe water's edge. If setbacks wouldnotbe ableto be maintained due to construction limitations, such as slope and road crossing requirements, Algonquin would request modifications to the FERC Procedures (see section 4.3.2.4). Vegetation would not be cleared, except over the pipeline trench, in the area within 10 feet of the waterbody. The work area would be limited in size to the minimum area necessary to safely construct the waterbody crossing and accommodate any stockpile of excavated material from the trench and the prefabricated pipeline crossing section. Proposed waterbody crossing methods for each waterbody crossed by the proposed pipeline segments are provided in section 4.3.2.3 and are described in more detail in Algonquin’s E&SCP.  Horizontal Directional Drill Algonquin proposes to utilize the HDD method at two locations along the mainline replacement segments. The HDD method would be used to cross the Hudson River along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment in the Town of Stony Point and Town of Cortlandt, New York.  The second HDD would be used to cross Interstate 84 and the Still River along the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment in the City of Danbury, Connecticut.  2-33 The HDD method involves establishing land-based staging areas along both sides of the proposed crossing (see figure 2.3.1-4). The process commences with the boring of a pilot hole beneath the waterbody or road and then enlarging the hole with one or more passes of a reamer until the hole is the necessary diameter to facilitate the pull-back (installation) of the pipeline. Once the reaming passes are completed, a prefabricated pipe segment is then pulled through the hole to complete the crossing. As is discussed further in section 4.3.2.3, the Hudson River HDD would be completed in soft soils and the Interstate 84/Still River HDD would occur in rock. Algonquin anticipates utilizing the intersect method to compete the pilot hole for both HDDs. The intersect method involves drilling from both sides of the HDD and intersecting in the middle. This method is preferred as it is less time-consuming and the exact entry and exit locations can be predetermined by utilizing this method. This process also enables the drilling sequence to have an instant hydraulic connection once the intersect is complete providing for a cleaner pilot hole. Algonquin has prepared site-specific crossing plans for the Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River HDD crossings. These plans are provided in appendix J and discussed in more detailin section 4.3.2.3. While the HDD method is a proven technology, there are certain impacts that could occur as a result of the drilling such as the inadvertent release of drilling fluid, which is a non-hazardous fluid comprised primarily of water, inert solids, and bentonite, a naturally occurring clay mineral. Drilling fluids that are released typically contain a lower concentration of bentonite when they surface because the bentonite is filtered out as it passes through sandy soils.  Algonquin would implement preventive measures so that the HDDs are performed in a manner that prevents, to the extent reasonably practicable, an inadvertent release, such as monitoring the down-hole mud pressures and continually swabbing the hole to keep the annulus free of cuttings. Should an inadvertent release occur, Algonquin's contractor would stop the drilling process and secure the area with straw bales, silt fence, sand bags, or other means to stop the spread of the inadvertent release and secure a 50-foot perimeter. Typically, a pump is installed in the secured area and the bentonite/water mixture is pumped back to the mud rig. Algonquin would contain, control, and clean up any release of drilling fluid during the HDD operations. Should the release of drilling fluids occur in a waterbody, then Algonquin may utilize inert, non-toxic loss circulation materials such as mica, wood fibers, and other types of cellulous-like cotton dust to attempt to plug the fracture by pumping these products down hole through the drill string as part of the drilling fluid mixture. Impacts of a drilling mud release into a waterbody generally would be less than those associated with any drilling mud recovery operation and less than potentialimpacts associated with an open-cut crossing that would otherwise be required. Should an inadvertent release occur, Algonquin would implement the following to minimize potentialimpacts:  monitor mud pressures down-hole to ensure they do not get too high for the materials and depthof cover being penetrated;  conduct frequent visual inspections of the drill path on the surface so that timely detection of a release can be achieved;  stop the mud pumps once an inadvertent release has been detected so that the release does not spread and secure the perimeter with straw bales, silt fence, sand bags, or other means; and  notify Algonquin's environmental monitors to ensure efforts are being undertaken to protect the waterbody and any associated wetlands. 2-34 Algonquin has developed a Best Drilling Practices, Monitoring, and Clean-up of Horizontal Directional Drilling Inadvertent Returns Plan (BDP Plan) for monitoring the HDD program for the AIM Project (see appendix J). We reviewed the BDP Plan, found it to be acceptable, and have determined that Algonquin’s adherence to the requirements in the BDP Plan would reduce the potential impacts of the HDDs, including an inadvertent release ofdrilling fluid.   To date, Algonquin has not provided a contingency plan that incorporates another location or another construction methodology for each HDD crossing. Therefore, if an HDD in its proposed location proves unsuccessful, Algonquin would be required to identify a new location for the crossing or new methodology, and request approval for the new location or methodology with all applicable agencies (see section 4.3.2.3). Algonquin evaluated the feasibility of crossing other waterbodies using the HDD method in lieu of the conventional dry crossing methods described above. Factors in HDD design include the availability of a straight and relatively low relief laydown area for the pullback pipe section; the availability of large work areas at the HDD entry and exit points; surrounding terrain; land use; and operation concerns. In addition, for the larger diameter pipeline segments (i.e., 42-and 36-inch), the minimum drill length is quite long (around 2,000 feet or more). Some of the other major limiting factors in the more densely populated areas of the Project included new temporary impacts on nearby residences, direct impacts on residential homes, and the need to acquire new easement rights for the permanent rightof-way for operation and maintenance of the pipeline. Based on information from Algonquin, our review of Project mapping, and information we obtained during visits to the Project area, we conclude that the use of the HDD method at all waterbody crossings would be either technically infeasible, impractical, or would not result in a clear environmentaladvantage tothe proposed dry crossingmethods. Wetland Construction Methods Construction of the Project would result in 160 wetland crossings, including 76 in New York and 84 in Connecticut. In some cases the Project facilities would include multiple crossings of the same wetland. There would be no wetland impacts in Rhode Island or Massachusetts (see table K-1 in appendix K). Wetland crossings would be accomplished in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP, which is consistent with the FERC Procedures, with one exception. In instances where wetlands are dry enough to support skids and pipe, Algonquin's E&SCP proposes to excavate the trench prior to the pipeline assembly. Otherwise, after the pipeline is assembled, equipment would not be able to access the area where trenching would occur nor would there be sufficient construction workspace to safely excavate the trench.  See section 4.4.4 for additional discussion. Construction methods would minimize the extent and time that construction equipment operates in wetland areas. When wetland soils are inundated or saturated to the surface, the pipeline trench would be excavated across the wetland by equipment supported on wooden swamp mats to minimize the disturbance to wetland soils. In wetlands that have firm substrates, and are unsaturated and not frozen, the top 12 inches of wetland soil over the trench line would be segregated. Trench spoil would be temporarily piled in a ridge along the pipeline trench. Gaps in the spoil pile would be left at appropriate intervals to provide for natural circulation or drainage of water. While the trench is excavated, where practicable, the pipeline would be assembled in a staging area located in an upland area. If dry conditions exist within the wetland, the pipe fabrication would occur in the wetland. For inundated or saturated wetland conditions, pipe strings would be fabricated on one bank and either pulled across the excavated trench in the wetland, floated across the wetland, or carried into place and submerged into the trench. After the pipeline is lowered into the trench, wide trackbulldozers or backhoes supported on swamp mats would be used for backfill, grading, and final cleanup. This method would minimize the amount of equipment and travel in wetland areas. If conditions allow, such as low flow or unsaturated soils, normal 2-36 cross-country construction practices would be used in wetlands. A complete description of construction methods can be found in Algonquin’s E&SCP. The E&SCP also includes measures to mitigate unavoidable construction-related impacts on wetlands (e.g., cutting vegetation above ground level, returning wetland contours and drainage patterns to preconstruction configurations, installing sediment barriers immediately after initial ground disturbance, segregating topsoil from the trenchline, using low ground weight equipment or operating equipment on mats, etc.). These construction methods and mitigation measures are part of the proposed action and included in the environmental analysis in section 4.4. ATWS may be needed adjacent to specific wetlands to facilitate the pipeline crossing. The staging areas are in addition to the typical construction right-of-way and may be used for the assembly and fabrication of the pipe section that would cross the wetland area. These work areas would be located at least 50 feet away from the wetland edge, topographic and other site-specific conditions permitting. If topographic conditions do not permit a 50-foot setback, these areas would be located at least 10 feet away fromthe wetland. In some instances, the setbacks would notbe able to be maintained due to construction limitations, such as slope and road crossing requirements. In those cases, Algonquin has requested modifications to the FERC Procedures. A list of ATWS within 50 feet of a wetland and its purpose is provided in section4.4.4.  2.3.2 AbovegroundFacility Construction Procedures The AIM Project aboveground facilities would be constructed in compliance with the same federal regulations and guidelines as the pipeline facilities, and in accordance with the specific requirements of applicable federal and state approvals. Construction activities associated with these facilities would include clearing, grading, installing concrete foundations, erecting metal buildings, and installing piping, metering facilities, and appurtenances. Initial work at the new M&R stations would focus on preparing the sites for equipment staging, fabrication, and construction. Following foundation work, station equipment and structures would be brought to the site and installed, using any necessary trailers or cranes for delivery and installation. Equipment testing and start-up activities would occur on a concurrent basis. The construction and restoration methods and procedures in Algonquin’s E&SCP would be followed, as applicable, for the aboveground facilities as well.  2.4 CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE AND WORK FORCE Construction of the Project pipeline facilities, new M&R stations, and modifications to Algonquin’s existing compressor stations and M&R stations would occur over a 1.5-year period to accommodate multiple work locations and the need for scheduled system outages for the numerous tie-ins along Algonquin’s system. Construction would begin in the 1st Quarter of 2015 with a projected in-service date of November 2016. Table 2.4-1 provides a preliminary construction schedule by year and construction spread.  While the overall schedule for the AIM Project is about 1.5 years of construction, pipeline construction generally proceeds at rates ranging from several hundred feet to 1 mile per day. Due to the assembly-line method of construction, construction activities in any one area would last from several weeks to several months on an intermittent basis. 2-37 TABLE 2.4-1 Preliminary Construction Schedule for the AIM Project  Approximate Approximate Length AIM Project Facilities MP Range Start Finish (miles)  Estimated Number of Construction Personnel a  EI b Responsibility  PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION SPREADS 2015 Pipeline Construction Spreads Construction Spread 1 – Hudson 2.6 to 5.5 March Oct. 2.9 River HDD and mainline pipeline 2015 2015 segments within new permanent easement in New York Construction Spread 2 – I-84/Still 1.4 to 2.1 March Oct. 0.7 River HDD 2015 2015 Construction Spread 3 – 0.0 to 2.0 April Oct. 2.0 Cromwell Discharge (Line-36A 2015 2015 Loop Extension) Construction Spread 4 – E-1 0.0 to 9.1/ April Oct. 9.1/1.3 System Take-up and Relay/ 0.0 to 1.3 2015 2015 E-1 System Loop 2016 Pipeline Construction Spreads Construction Spread 1 c – 0.0 to 3.3/ March Oct. 5.9 Haverstraw to Stony Point/Stony 0.0 to 2.6 2016 2016 Point to the Tomkins Cove Construction Spread 2 c – 5.5 to 12.3 March Oct. 6.8 Mainline Take-up and Relay 2016 2016 (East of the Hudson River to Yorktown) 2015 Construction Spread 3 c – 0.0 to 4.4 March Oct. 4.4 Southeast to MLV Take-up and 2016 2016 Relay 2015 to 2016 Pipeline Construction Spread West Roxbury Lateral 0.0 to 5.1 May Oct 4.9 2015 2016 TOTAL ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES Existing Compressor Station NA Modifications New York Stony Point Compressor March Oct.

NA = Not applicable  2.5 ENVIRONMENTAL TRAINING AND INSPECTIONFOR CONSTRUCTION In preparing construction drawings and specifications for the Project, Algonquin would incorporate all mitigation measures identified in its permit applications, as wellas additional requirements of federal, state, and local agencies. Algonquin would provide the construction contractors with copies of applicable environmental permits as well as copies of “approved for construction” environmental construction alignment sheets and construction drawings and specifications. Consistent with the FERC guidelines, Algonquin would conduct environmental training for its construction personnel, including EIs, contractors, and their employees, regarding proper field implementation of its E&SCP, SPCC Plan, and other project-specific plans and mitigation measures. The training would be given before the start of construction and throughout the construction process, as needed. The EIs and all other construction personnel are expected to play an important role in maintaining strict compliance with all permit conditions to protect the environment during construction. As outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP, full time EIs would be designated by Algonquin during active construction or restoration. Table 2.4-1 indicates the number of EIs proposed by year and 2-40 construction spread as well as the facilities under each EIs responsibility. The EIs would have peer status with all other activity inspectors and would report directly to the Resident Engineer/Chief Inspector who has overall authority on the construction spread. The EIs would have the authority to stop activities that violate the environmental conditions of the FERC certificate (if applicable), other federal and state permits, or landowner requirements, and to order corrective action.  Although Algonquin has stated that sufficient qualified EIs would be available to implement their environmental inspection program, it has agreed to participate in a third-party Environmental Compliance Monitoring Program for sensitive environmental areas of the AIM Project. Under this program, Algonquin would fund a contractor, to be selected and managed by the FERC staff, to provide environmental compliance monitoring services. The FERC Third-party Compliance Monitor would provide daily reports to the FERC staff on compliance issues and make recommendations to the FERC Project Manager on how to deal with compliance issues and construction changes, should they arise. FERC staff would also conduct periodic inspections. As discussed in section 4.0, use of a third-party Environmental Compliance Monitoring Program would be particularly appropriate along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay, Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay, Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay, and West Roxbury Lateral segments and related aboveground facilities due to concerns about construction in residential and commercial areas, the Hudson River crossing, and potential blasting.  Development of the program would occurprior to construction. After construction, Algonquin would conduct follow-up inspections of all disturbed upland areas after the first and second growing seasons to determine the success of restoration and would monitor the success of wetland revegetation annually for the first 3 years (or as required by permits) after construction, or longer, until wetland revegetation is successful. To ensure the restoration of all areas affected by the Project, we would continue to conduct oversight inspection and monitoring following construction. If it is determined that any of the proposed monitoring timeframes are not adequate to assess the success of restoration, Algonquin would be required to extend its post-construction monitoring programs. Additionally, as discussed further in section 4.12.1, PHMSA is mandated to provide pipeline safety under 49 USC 601. PHMSA administers the national regulatory program to ensure the safe transportation of natural gas and other hazardous materials by pipeline. PHMSA develops safety regulations and other approaches to risk management that ensure safety in the design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities. Many of the regulations are written as performance standards that set the level of safety to be attained and allow the pipeline operator to use various technologies to achieve safety.  2.6 OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, AND SAFETYCONTROLS Algonquin would operate and maintain the newly constructed pipeline facilities in the same manner as they currently operate and maintain their existing systems in compliance with PHMSA regulations provided in 49 CFR 192, the FERC guidance at 18 CFR 380.15, and the maintenance provisions in Algonquin’s E&SCP. Algonquin would add three full-time permanent workers for operation of the proposed and modified facilities.  2.6.1 Pipeline Facilities The pipeline would be patrolled on a routine basis and personnel well qualified to perform both emergency and routine maintenance on interstate pipeline facilities would handle emergencies and maintenance related to:  erosion and wash-outs along the right-of-way;  settling, undermining, or degradation of repaired ditch line in streets orparking lots;  performance of water control devices such as diversions;  condition of banks at stream and river crossings;  third-party activity along the pipeline right-of-way; and  any otherconditions that could threaten the integrity of the pipeline. 2-41 The applicable local operations supervisors would be notified of any conditions that need attention. Significant conditions would be reported to the pipeline owners. Corrective measures would be performed as needed. The pipeline cathodic protection system would also be monitored and inspected periodically to ensure proper and adequate corrosion protection. The pipeline would be designed to allow the use of internal inspection technology. Algonquin would take appropriate responses to conditions observed during internal inspections as necessary. The pipeline facilities would be clearly marked at line-of-sight intervals and at crossings of roads, railroads, and other key points. Markers would clearly indicate the presence of the pipeline and provide a telephone number where a company representative can be reached in the event of an emergency or prior to any excavation in the area of the pipeline by a third party. As part of its effort to prevent any third-party damage on the pipeline, Algonquin currently participates in the One Call system in all states where Algonquin has operationalfacilities. During operation, the pipeline would be internally inspected and cleaned using “pigs” inserted and retrieved from the pipeline ataboveground pig launcher/receiver facilities.  As a cleaning device, pigs can also be used to remove debris that accumulates in the pipeline. We received comments concerning the potential buildup of decay products within the pipeline and the risk of releasing these products to the environment during pipeline maintenance and pigging activities. Algonquin conducts annual inspections and regular cleaning of its operational pipelines. The pig receivers have a collection basin or trap that catches the liquids and solids that are removed from the pipe during the pig run. Any liquids or solids removed during these cleanings would be collected and treated as hazardous material that would be disposed of at a licensed facility in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations (see section 4.11.1.3). 2.6.2 Compressor Stations Algonquin would continue to operate and maintain the modified compressor stations in accordance with PHMSA requirements and standard procedures designed to ensure the integrity and safe operation of the facilities and to maintain firm natural gas transportation service. Standard operations at compressor stations include such activities as the calibration, maintenance, and inspection of equipment, as well as the monitoring of pressure, temperature, and vibration data, and traditional landscape maintenance such as mowing and the application of fertilizer. Standard operations also include the periodic checking of safety and emergency equipmentand cathodic protection systems. 2.6.3 M&R Station Sites and other AbovegroundFacilities Algonquin personnel would perform routine checks of the new and modified facilities, including calibration of equipment and instrumentation, inspection of critical components, and scheduled and preventative maintenance of equipment. Safety equipment, such as pressure-relief devices, would be tested forproper operation.  Corrective actions would be taken for any identified problem. 2-42 3.0 ALTERNATIVES As required by NEPA, FERC policy, and CWA 404(b)(1) Alternative Analysis, we evaluated alternatives to the Project to determine whether an alternative would be environmentally preferable and/or technically and economically feasible to the proposed action. We evaluated the no action alternative, energy alternatives, system alternatives, route alternatives and variations, and aboveground facility alternatives.  We compared each alternative to the Project usingthree key criteria. 1. Does the alternative have the ability to meet the objectivesof the proposed action? 2. Is the alternative technicallyand economically feasible and practical? 3. Does the alternative offer a significant environmental advantage over the Project? With regard to the first criterion and for the purposes of NEPA, Algonquin’s stated objectives for the Project are:  provide an additional 342,000 Dth/d of additional natural gas supplies in southern New England and satisfy Algonquin's precedent agreements to deliver natural gas to the Project Shippers by November 20161;  eliminate capacity constraints on existing pipeline systems in New York State and southern New England;and  provide access to growing natural gas supply areas in the Northeast region to increase competition and reduce volatility in natural gas pricing in southern New England. It is important to note that not all conceivable alternatives are technically feasible or practical. Some alternatives may be incapable of being implemented due to limits on existing technologies, constraints of system capacities, or logistical considerations, while others may be impractical because sites are unavailable or cannot be developed for the proposed use. Additionally, it is necessary to recognize the environmental advantages and disadvantages of the proposed action in order to focus the analysis on reasonable alternatives with the potential to provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project. Some alternatives may reduce impacts on resources that are not relevant to the analysis or do not provide a significant environmental advantage over the proposed action.  Other alternatives may reduce impacts on one resourcebut increaseimpacts on others. Our analysis of each alternative as described in the subsections below is based on information provided by Algonquin and reviewed by FERC staff; our review of aerial photographs, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, and other publicly available information; input from cooperating and other agencies; and our site visits, including a flyover of the Project area. Unless otherwise noted, we used the same desktop sources of information to standardize comparisons between the Project and each alternative.  As a result, some of the information presented in this section relative to the Project may differ from information presented in section 4.0, which is based on Project-specific data derived from field surveys and engineered drawings. Algonquin participated in our pre-filing process during the preliminary design stage for the Project (see section 1.4). This process emphasized identification of potential stakeholder issues, as well as identification and evaluation of alternatives that could avoid or minimize impacts. During this process, For the purposes of CWA permitting and section 404(b)(1) guidelines, the Project purpose has been defined as “expansion of the existing pipeline system from an interconnection at Ramapo, New York to deliver up to 342,000 Dth/d of natural gas transportation service to the Connecticut,RhodeIsland,andMassachusetts markets.” 3-1 Algonquin made several modifications to its proposed pipeline route to address stakeholder concerns. The majority of route changes were made to avoid conflicts with existing land uses or to increase the distance of the pipeline from residences and commercial business, recreation areas, or otherinfrastructure. These changes were subsequently made part of Algonquin's proposed route when it filed its FERC application, and are presented in this EIS.  Route variations that were incorporated into the proposed route are identified in section 3.5.4. Through the application of evaluation criteria and subsequent environmental comparisons, each alternative was considered until it was clear that the alternative was not reasonable or would result in greater environmental impacts that could not be readily mitigated. Those alternatives that appeared to be viable with less than or similar levels of environmental impact are reviewed in the text below. 3.1 NO-ACTION ALTERNATIVE The Commission has two courses of action in processing applications under section 7 of the NGA: 1) deny the requesting action (the no-action alternative), or 2) grant a Certificate, with or without conditions. Under the no-action alternative, the short-and long-term environmental impacts described in this EIS would not occur, but the objectives of the Project would not be met. The Project would create an additional 342,000 Dth/d of natural gas delivery from growing supply areas in the Northeast region to local distribution companies and municipal utilities (i.e., the Project Shippers) in southern New England. This would help meet existing and future demand for natural gas in the Project area, eliminate supply constraints on existing systems, and increase competition in regional energy markets. The Project additionally would provide new delivery points for local gas utilities in Connecticut and Massachusetts, which would provide natural gas in areas where it is needed and enhance the reliability of local distribution systems, particularly in Boston. If Algonquin’s proposed facilities are not constructed, the Project Shippers may need to obtain an equivalent supply of natural gas from new or existing pipeline systems. In response, Algonquin or another natural gas transmission company would likely develop a new project or projects to provide the volume of natural gas contracted through the Project’s binding precedent agreements with the Project Shippers. Alternatively, customers of the Project Shippers could seek to use alternative fuel or renewable energy sources, which could require new facilities. In either case, construction of new pipelines or other energy infrastructure would result in environmental impacts that could be equal to or greater than those of the Project. For these reasons, the no-action alternative would not be preferable to or provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project. 3.2  ENERGY ALTERNATIVES  3.2.1  Energy Conservation  Energy conservation measures, as encouraged or required by federal and state law, have and will  likely continue to play an important role in reducing energy demand in the United States. At the federal level, for example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) contained provisions for diversifying America’s energy supply, reducing dependence on foreign sources of energy, increasing residential and business energy efficiency and conservation, improving vehicular energy efficiency, and modernizing domestic energy infrastructure. EPAct additionally directed the U.S. Secretary of Energy to conduct research and developprograms for energy efficient commercial applications (U.S. Congress, 2005). Several laws enacted since EPAct have enhanced the federal role in energy conservation and efficiency.  The U.S. Congress passed the EnergyIndependence and Security Act of 2007, for example, to increase the efficiency of products, buildings, and vehicles; protect consumers; and improve federal energy performance by establishing new incentive programs and expanding certain programs created 3-2 under EPAct (U.S. Congress, 2007). According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), key highlights of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 include improved corporate fuel efficiency, a renewable fuels standard, and new energy efficiency standards for lighting and other appliances, such as lamps, dishwashers, dehumidifiers, and clothes washers (Congressional ResearchService, 2007). Two bills containing energy provisions were passed by the U.S. Congress between October 2008 and February 2009 in response to the economic downturn in the United States: the Energy Improvement and Extension Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The Energy Improvement and Extension Act included provisions to extend tax credits for energy-efficient residential properties and appliances, bicycle commuting, and renewable and alternative fuels usage, to limit consumption and increase efficiency (U.S. Congress, 2008). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided more than $16 billion for the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for the Weatherization Assistance Program, Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grants, Energy Efficient Appliance Rebate and ENERGY STAR® programs, and various alternative fuel programs for both transportation and energy production (U.S. Congress, 2009). In addition to the federal programs, state-led initiatives have contributed to or encouraged energy conservation and efficiency in the Project area. One of the goals identified in the 2013 Connecticut Comprehensive Energy Strategy (CES), for example, is an expanded commitment to reducing energy consumption through “all cost-effective” energy efficiency programs (CTDEEP, 2013a). Other objectives promote new financing mechanisms for energy conservation and efficiency, performance-based rates of return for Connecticut utilities, and efficiency standards for new building construction or retrofits. The CES notes that a reduction in energy consumption through conservation and efficiency is one ofthe most cost-effective ways to lower Connecticut’s contribution to air pollution. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York State similarly have implemented energy conservation plans which include efficiency initiatives. Each of the plans enumerates a series of policy objectives or actions designed to reduce energy consumption. The Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020, for example, promotes all cost-effective energy efficiencies, advanced building energy codes, and an expanded renewable portfolio standard for electricity (MAEOEEA, 2010). It also includes a Building Energy Rating and Labeling program designed to facilitate “apples-to-apples” comparisons of energy efficiency among and between buildings. Rhode Island’s Comprehensive Energy, Conservation, and Affordability Act of 2006 requires local utilities to invest in all cost-effective energy efficiencies, prepare long-and short-term energy efficient procurement plans, and purchase least cost-supply and demand resources (Rhode Island General Assembly, 2006). The 2009 New York State Energy Plan encourages energy efficiency through a variety of policies and objectives, including the coordination of end-use efficiency programs, improved energy efficiency in public buildings, and improved training and compliance initiatives (New York State Energy Planning Board, 2009). EPAct and the other federal and state programs collectively promote increased energy efficiency and conservation by supporting new technologies and increasing funds for research and conservation. However, while these initiatives may minimize energy use, they are not expected to eliminate the increased demand for energy or natural gas in the Project area. The implementation and success of energy conservation and efficiency programs in curtailing energy use is a long-term goal requiring large-scale public education efforts, significant incentives, and government intervention extending well beyond the timeframe of the proposed Project. We also note that each of the states in the Project area recognizes energy conservation as one component of a larger portfolio of solutions, including increased use of natural gas, to provide clean, secure, reliable, and less expensive energy. Therefore, while energy conservation and efficiency would reduce demand for new energy supplies to some degree, we conclude it would not eliminate the need for additional natural gas supplies in southern New England. 3-3 3.2.2 Renewable Energy Renewable energy sources, including wind, hydropower, biomass, solar, and tidal and wave energy, are another long-term fuel source alternative to natural gas that have the advantage over fossil fuels of reducing or eliminating the emissions, including GHG emissions, associated with the burning of natural gas and other fossil fuels. The DOE’s Energy Information Administration (DOE/EIA) (2013) projects rapid growth in renewable fuel consumption due primarily to the implementation of a federal renewable fuels standard for transportation fuels and state renewable portfolio standard programs for electricity generation. Nationally, the share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable energy is projected to increase from 13 percent in 2011 to 16 percent in 2040, with wind, solar, and biomass accounting for most of the growth. We received several comments on the draft EIS citing studies by researchers at Stanford University and the University of California at Davis that concluded that the world can meet all of its energy needs with renewables—chiefly wind, water, and solar power—as early as 2030 and, as a consequence, there is no need for natural gas. Authors Jacobson, Delucchi, and others have published papers that have identified a path for replacing fossil fuel-based energy with wind, water, and solar power. In a paper in 2011, Jacobson and Delucchi did not conclude that the world could run solely on renewables by 2030.  Instead, this paper identified a path for replacing fossil fuel-based energy with wind, water, and solar power using a two-step process by the year 2050. Specifically, the authors indicate that the obstacles to achieving this worldwide energy transformation are primarily social and political, not technological, and further note that “[w]ith broad-based policies and social changes, it may be possible to convert 25 percent of the current energy system to [wind, water, and solar power] in 10–15 years and 85 percent in 20–30 years, and 100 percent by 2050.” A paper by Jacobson et al. (2013) concluded that all of New York State’s energy infrastructure could be converted to renewable power by the year 2030. The study examined the technical and economic feasibility, and the public policies needed, to convert New York State’s energy infrastructure in all sectors to one powered by wind, water, and sunlight by the year2050.  The authors expected thatthe fraction ofnew electric power generation fromwind, water, and solar power would increase starting in 2013 such that all new electric generation would come from wind, water, and solar power sources by 2020. Existing conventional generation would be phased out gradually, but no later than 2050. Similarly, the authors expect that new heating and cooling technologies would be wind, water, and solar power-based by 2020, and existing heating and cooling technologies would be replaced over time, but no later than 2050. Jacobson et al. (2013) did not conclude that New York State could run solely on renewables by 2030.  Implicit in the conclusions of the papers by Jacobson and others is a need to continue operating the existing mix of fossil fuel-based energy use through the year 2050.  An analysis of renewable energy sources as an alternative to the proposed Project, as well as our conclusions, is provided below. Wind Wind power is a proven technology that has experienced significant advances in recent years, including reduced installation costs, improved turbine performance, and reduced maintenance costs. Although wind projects have no emissions, such developments can affect wildlife, such as birds, as well as other resources. Additionally, many of the windiest sites in the Project region tend to be located along shorelinesthat are challenging to access, densely populated, and highly valued for other uses. Current wind generation capacities in the Project area by state are 0 megawatts (MW) for Connecticut, 9 MW for Rhode Island, 103 MW for Massachusetts, and 1,638 MW for New York State (American Wind Energy Association, 2013). In southern New England, most of the existing wind farms are small operations that individually generate less than 15,000 kilowatts (kW) of power. In New York 3-4 State, there are several large operating wind farms in upstate areas, such as the Maple Ridge Wind Farm (320 MW) in Lewis County and Noble Clinton Windpark in Franklin County (NYSDEC, 2014g). In general, the major wind farms in New York are located in the northern and western portions of the state farfrom major downstate load areas. Several new wind farm projects have been permitted or proposed in the Project area, particularly offshore. Cape Wind Associates, for example, plans to install 130 turbines off the coast of Cape Cod in Nantucket Sound.  This project, which has been approved by federal and state regulatory agencies, will be capable of generating up to 468 MW of power. Financing of the project is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014. Construction of the project is expected to begin in 2015 and completed in 2016 (CapeWind, 2014; Mohl, 2014). Deepwater Wind proposes to construct two offshore facilities, the Block Island Wind Farm and the Deepwater Wind Energy Center, each of which would provide power to the Project area. The Block Island Wind Farm is a proposed 30 MW facility that would be built about 3 miles southeast of Block Island in Rhode Island state waters. The wind farm would connect to onshore electric transmission facilities in Narragansett, Rhode Island via a 21-mile submarine cable. Construction of the Block Island Wind Farmis planned to begin in 2015(Deepwater Wind, 2014a).  Deepwater ONE, if approved and constructed, would be the first, 1,000 MW-scale offshore regional energy center to be built in the United States. In 2013, Deepwater Wind won an exclusive right from the U.S. Department of the Interior to develop wind facilities within a 256-square-mile area on the outer continental shelf in the Atlantic Ocean. As currently envisioned, the project would consist of 150 to 200 turbines to be built about 30 miles east of Montauk, New York between Block Island and Martha’s Vineyard.  The facility would connectto the LongIsland Power Authority’s existing transmission grid via a 98-mile subsea cable, which would make landfall on Long Island. Deepwater ONE would produce between 900 and 1,200 MW of power for sale in Long Island and southeastern New England. Construction of the project could begin as early as 2017 with operations beginning as early as 2018 (Deepwater Wind, 2014b;Marcacci, 2013). Further south in New York State, the New York Power Authority, Long Island Power Authority, and Consolidated Edison are developing a proposal to build a wind farm about 13 miles offshore of the western end of the Rockaway Peninsula in the New York Bight. The Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management currently is evaluating a lease application from the project proponents for lands on the outer continental shelf, and may proceed with a competitive lease auction for these lands. If approved and constructed, the wind farm would generate 350 MW of electricity (with the potential to expand to 700 MW in later phases) for use in the New York City and Long Island markets (Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management, 2014; Long Island–New York City Wind Farm Project, 2014). Although this project has demonstrated continued interest, its development is still in its early stages and its future is uncertain. Additional site-specific engineering and environmental studies need to be completed, agencies need to release a request for proposal to select a private developer to build and operate the wind farm, the filing of permit applications needs to be made, and environmentalreviews need to be conducted. It is likely that wind projects will continue to be pursued in the Northeast region assuming continued financial incentives, state and public support, improvements in technology, and available transmission capacity for new electricity. In the long-term, wind energy may be able to replace some of the demand in the Project area for electricity generation from fossil-fuel sources. However, in the short-term, sufficient wind energy is not available in the Project vicinity that could provide the 342,000 Dth/d (100,205 MWh or 8,350 MW per 12-hour day) of energy that would be provided by the proposed Project. Increased wind energy would not meet the objectives of the Project, which would provide additional natural gas supplies to local distribution companies and municipal utilities for residential and commercial 3-5 uses, eliminate capacity constraints on existing natural gas transmission systems, and provide access to new natural gas supplies. The Project additionally would leverage existing delivery points on the Algonquin system and create new delivery points in southern New England at points where natural gas supplies are needed. In contrast, new wind facilities could require upgrades to or construction of new electric transmission facilities to transport power to market. It is unlikely that the environmental impacts associated with construction of these facilities would be significantly less than those ofthe Project.  For all the reasons discussed above, the use of wind energy would not meet the Project objectives or provide a significant environmental advantage overthe Project. Hydroelectric Hydroelectric generation is fully commercialized, including run-of-river and large impoundment facilitiesrangingin electricitygeneration capacityfromless than one tohundreds ofMWs.  Hydroelectric generation in the Project area in 2012 was 4 gigawatt (GW) hours (GWh) in Rhode Island, 312 GWh in Connecticut, 912 GWh in Massachusetts, and 24,652 GWh in New York State (National Hydropower Association, 2014).  The DOE/EIA (2013) projects that hydropower will continue as a leading source of renewable electricity generation in the U.S. through 2040, but little new hydroelectric capacity is expected to be developed in this period. Nevertheless, several recent, small-scale hydroelectric projects have been licensed or proposed in southern New England and New York State. New England Hydropower Company, LLC, for example, has been granted five preliminary permits from the FERC to develop new, small-scale, renewable electricity generation facilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. If all five projects are constructed, the peak capacities of the new facilities would range from 30 to 300 kW (New England Hydropower Company, LLC, 2013). In addition to small-scale projects, there have been several recent proposals to construct high-voltage transmission lines to transport hydroelectric power produced in Canada to New England and New York State. The Northern Pass Transmission Line Project is a proposal to construct 153 miles of high voltage, direct current, 1,200 MW transmission line from the U.S./Canadian border to Franklin, New Hampshire. From there, about 34 miles of alternating current transmission line would be built to interconnect with existing grid facilities in Deerfield, New Hampshire. Northern Pass submitted an application to DOE in October 2010 and filed an amended application in June 2013 (Northern Pass Transmission, LLC, 2014). The New England Clean Power Link Project is a recently announced proposal to construct about 150 miles of high voltage, direct current, 1,000 MW transmission line from the U.S./Canadian Borderto a location in Ludlow, Vermont.  The transmission line would interconnect with the Vermont Electric Power Company’s existing transmission grid for delivery service in Vermont and throughout the New England market. TDI New England has applied for permit applications and construction is planned to begin in 2016, with a projected completion date of 2019(TDINew England, 2014).  Several large-scale projects have been announced to transport hydroelectric power from Canada to New York State. These include the West Point Transmission and Champlain Hudson Power Express Projects. The West Point Transmission Project is a proposal to construct an 80-mile-long, 1,000 MW transmission line between Athens and Buchanan, New York. West Point Partners, LLC (WPP) is in the process of submitting federal and state permit applications and is expecting to file an amendment to its Article VII application in early 2015 (WPP, 2014). The Champlain Hudson Power Express Project is a proposal to construct over 330 miles of 1,000 MW subterranean transmission line from Quebec to Astoria, New York.  Key permits have been obtained and construction is planned to begin in 2015 with an in service date of 2018 (Transmission Developers, Inc., 2014). The projects would service downstate 3-6 Hydroelectric power may be able to replace some of the demand in the Project area for new electricity generation. However, regulatory review of these new projects is ongoing and therefore, their future is uncertain. Also, as is the case with wind, hydroelectric power would not meet the objectives of the Project. For example, new or expanded hydroelectric facilities would not provide additional natural gas supplies to southern New England, provide access to new source areas, utilize existing infrastructure, or provide new delivery points where natural gas supplies are needed. We additionally note that new hydroelectric facilities would require upgrades to or construction of new transmission facilities to bring power to market. It is unlikely that the environmental impacts associated with construction of these transmission facilities would be significantly less than those of the Project. For all these reasons, the use of hydroelectric energy would not be practical or provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project. Biomass Combustion of biomass (e.g., wood, crops, landfill gas, or solid wastes) is a proven technology using biomass feedstock. Each of the states in the Project area is a participant in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap-and-trade emissions reduction program, and each incentivizes energy retailers to derive a certain amount of the energy they sell from biomass. Recent studies, however, have called into question previously held views of biomass as a “carbon-neutral” fuel source. As a result, in 2012, Massachusetts suspended consideration of applications for certain biomass generation units pending a rulemaking. By state, current net electricity generation from biomass in the Project area is 22 GW in Rhode Island, 62 GW in Connecticut, 99 GW in Massachusetts, and 201 GW in New York State (DOE/EIA, 2014). A recently completed project in Dartmouth, Massachusetts includes a digester to convert food and other organic wastes into about 650 megawatt hours (MWh) per year (Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 2014). In addition, a proposed wood burning facility in Plainfield, Connecticut would convert clean wood waste from construction sites into 37.5 MWh ofpower per year(Enova Energy Group, 2014).  Biomass fuels used to generate electricity may be able to replace some of the demand in the Project area for new electricity generation, but this would not meet the objectives of the Project. Certain types of biomass fuels, such as landfill or digester waste gas, could potentially replace some of additional natural gas supply that would be provided by the Project. However, there currently is a lack of adequate infrastructure to convert biomass to power and transport the energy to market on a large scale. As a result, additional use of biomass fuels as a substitute for natural gas would require the construction of new facilities, including pipelines, which could result in impacts similar to or greater than those of the Project. For all these reasons, the use of biomass energy would not be practical or provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project. Solar/Photovoltaic Solar or photovoltaic power systems convert sunlight directly into electricity. While each of the states in the Project area has implemented policies or incentives to encourage development of solar resources, solar energyrepresents a small fraction of energy production and consumption in the Northeast region.  Net generation from solar sources is 10 GW combined for all of New England and 2 GW for New YorkState (DOE/EIA, 2014). Several recent solar energy projects have been proposed or announced in the Project area. HelioSage Energy is planning to construct a 20 MW, alternating current, photovoltaic system on a 1453-7 acre site in Sprague and Lisbon Counties, Connecticut (HelioSage, 2014; Howard, 2013). Massachusetts Electric Construction Company (MECC) is in the process of constructing several ground-mounted solar arrays ranging in capacity from 1.5 to 5.9 MW at 12 sites in Connecticut and Massachusetts (MECC, 2014). RS Energy is planning to develop solar farms at four sites in Massachusetts with a combined generating capacity of 3.5 MW (AZoCleanTech.com; 2014). The HelioSage Energy and RS Energy projects are still in early development stages and theirfuture is uncertain. While solar initiatives could potentially bring additional energy to the Project area, solar energy is least available during winter months when demand for natural gas is highest. Additionally, the scale at which customers would choose to install solar panels based on existing or future incentives is unclear. These systems generally are not well suited for use as large-scale generation in the Northeast region due to relatively low direct insolation, lower efficiencies, and higher capital costs. Further, solar power generation on an industrial/commercial scale would require cooperation or agreements with the owners of existing infrastructure to use existing buildings or other structures for mounting the solar arrays, or large areas of land with impervious cover and no shading, which would need to be rededicated to permanent solar collection facilities, to allow for the photovoltaic panels to gather energy.  In contrast, the permanent right-of-way of the proposed Project area would be restored to pre-construction contours and maintained as herbaceous cover. Therefore, a large, industrial/commercial scale, solar power generation facility would result in greater visual, vegetation, and habitat impacts than the proposed Project. Impacts of new electric transmission lines associated with solar power generation facilities would be similar to or greater than the impacts from the proposed Project because Algonquin would primarily use its existing right-ofway whereas a new electric transmission line would need to acquire and disturb new land. Like other renewable energy fuels, solar power may be able to replace some of the demand in the Project area for new electricity generation. However, solar energy would not meet the objectives of the Project. Additionally, construction of commercial-scale solar facilities would require development of large sites and construction of new electric transmission facilities, which could result in impacts similar to or greater than those of the Project.  For all these reasons, solar energywould not be practical or provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project. Tidal and Wave Wave energy technology is in the early stages of development and not commercially available.  Additionally, the high cost of construction and potential for environmental impacts on marine resources may limit development of this resource. In contrast, capture of tidal power is a proven technology, but criteria for suitable site selection limit the areas available for development. Suitable sites require large water flows through a narrow channel into a substantial tidal basin.  The Muskeget Tidal Energy Project in Edgartown, Massachusetts is an example of a recent tidal energy project in southern New England. The Town of Edgartown, in conjunction with nearby towns, universities, and government agencies, is developing a proposal to construct a 5 MW pilot project in the Muskeget Channel. The project would deploy new marine hydrokinetic technologies to produce electricity from incoming and outgoing tides in the channel (New England Marine Renewable Center, 2014). Like the other renewable fuels, tidal and wave energy may be able to replace some of the demand in the Project area for new electricity generation. However, tidal and wave energy would not meet the objectives of Project. Additionally, it is unlikely that the environmental impacts associated with construction and operation of large-scale hydrokinetic facilities, including any electric transmission lines needed to bring the power to market, would be significantly less than those of the Project. This is due to the potential construction and operational impacts on the marine environment associated with a 3-8 Summary of Renewable Energies While the renewable energy projects that have been and will be proposed in the Project area will help diversify the electricity market and decrease the need for traditional fossil fuel energy sources, there still would be issues associated with the siting and development of renewable energy facilities. Other issues would include high costs and the time required to develop new energy infrastructure, including electricity generation and transmission facilities. Construction of new facilities would result in impacts on air, water, wildlife, and other resources, which could be similar to or greater than those for natural gas pipelines. We also note that renewable energy is not 100 percent interchangeable with natural gas. Most renewable energy sources are used to generate electricity. While natural gas is used to generate electricity, it is also used for heating and cooking. These uses could be served by electricity instead of natural gas, but existing natural gas-based heating and cooking systems in the Project area would need to be converted to electric-based systems, which could be prohibitively expensive for many consumers. In contrast, the Project would provide additional natural gas supplies for direct residential and commercial uses, including heating and cooking. Therefore, renewable energy alternatives were eliminated from further consideration. 3.2.2.1 Nuclear Energy Another traditional, non-renewable fuel source alternative to natural gas for electricity generation is nuclear power. There currently are four active nuclear power plants in New England and four in New York State, though one of these facilities, Vermont Yankee in Vernon, Vermont, is scheduled to close in 2014. By state, current net generation from nuclear facilities in the Project area are 0 GWh in Rhode Island, 1,565 GWh in Connecticut, 441 GWh in Massachusetts, and 3,765 GWh in New York State (DOE/EIA, 2014). No substantive increase in the use of nuclear power in New England or the Mid-Atlantic region is expected to occur between 2012 and 2040 based on projections by the DOE/EIA (2013).  Because the subject of nuclear power remains controversial, any future proposals to construct new or expand existing facilities in the region would likely involve prolonged regulatory review and public opposition. Furthermore, there is a regulatory process addressing safety and environmental issues (including reviews in the areas of nuclear safety and security, the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, and alterations to hydrological and biological systems) that would have to be completed before any new plants could be constructed and operated. Even if this regulatory review process was completed, a new plant would not likely be operational for many years. For these reasons, new sources of nuclear power could not meet the schedule ofthe Project and are not currently a practicable alternative to the proposed Project. 3.2.2.2 FossilFuels Coal potentially could be used to provide additional electrical generation in the Project area, but this would not meet the objectives of or provide the same benefits as the Project. We also note that life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions for coal-fired electricity generation range from 36 to 47 percent higher than fornatural gas-fired electricity (ICF International, 2012). Additional use of oil by existing facilities, development of new oil-fired generating plants, or conversion of natural gas home heating systems to oil burning furnaces could provide additional electricity and heat during peak winter demand periods. However, an increase in the use of petroleum 3-9 and oil-fired energy or heat sources would produce greater quantities of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), GHGs, and airborne mercury than natural gas heating units and boilers (EPA, 1995). This would reduce regional air quality and would be in conflict with the state energy plans and the Policy Statement of the New England Governors, each of which identify natural gas as a key component of sustainable energy.   For all the reasons stated above, the use of other fossil fuels would not be practical or provide a significant environmental advantage over the Project.  3.3 SYSTEM ALTERNATIVES System alternatives would utilize existing, modified, or proposed natural gas pipeline systems to meet the objectives of the Project. Implementation of a system alternative would make it unnecessary to construct all or part of the Project, although modifications or additions to existing or proposed systems could be required. These modifications or additions would result in environmental impacts that could be less than, similar to, or greater than those associated with construction and operation of the Project. The purpose of identifying and evaluating system alternatives is to determine whether the environmental impacts associated with construction and operation of the Project could be avoided or reduced by using another pipeline system, while still meeting the objectives of the proposed action. A viable system alternative to the Project would have to provide the pipeline capacity necessary to transport an additional 342,000 Dth/d of natural gas at the contracted volumes and to the delivery points required by the precedent agreements signed by Algonquin and the Project Shippers. A viable system alternative additionally would need to eliminate capacity constraints on existing pipeline systems in New York State and southern New England, and provide access to the growing supply areas in the Northeast region. A viable system alternative would need to provide these services within a timeframe reasonably similar to the Project. Our analysis of system alternatives includes an examination of existing and proposed natural gas transportation systems that currently or eventually would serve the markets targeted by the Project, and considers whether those systems would meet the Project’s objectives while providing an environmental advantage over the proposed action. A brief assessment of each of the existing and proposed systems is providedin the subsectionsbelow. 3.3.1 Status ofExisting Systems In addition to the existing Algonquin system, two other existing interstate pipelines provide natural gas transmission service into southern New England: Tennessee Gas Pipeline (Tennessee) and Iroquois Gas Transmission (Iroquois) (see figure 3.3.1-1). Like the Algonquin system, each of these pipelines currently are at or near capacity. Consequently, use of either of these systems would require modifications, including the construction of new pipelines, to transport the volume of gas to the delivery points required by the Project Shippers. Figure 3.3.1-1 depicts the location of the Tennessee and Iroquois systems relative to Algonquin’s existing system in southern New England. 3-10 Algonquin Tennessee Iroquois Figure 3.3.1-1AIM Project System Alternatives The existing Tennessee pipeline reaches western Connecticut, northern Rhode Island, and central Massachusetts. As currently configured, the system cannot service eastern Connecticut, southern Massachusetts, or southern Rhode Island. The existing Iroquois pipeline services southwestern Connecticut and Long Island, New York, but does not reach eastern Connecticut, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts. As a result, significant expansion of the Tennessee or Iroquois systems would be necessary to provide service to the delivery points required by the Project Shippers. Expansion of these systems would require construction of hundreds of miles of new pipeline, much of which would duplicate the existing Algonquin system, to reach the delivery points required by the Project Shippers. This would result in much greater environmental impact than the Project, which would use a combination of pipeline replacements, loops, and a lateral, as well as additional compression, to deliver the additional volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers. Therefore, expansion of the Tennessee or Iroquois systems would not be a reasonable alternative to or provide an environmentaladvantage over the Project. 3.3.2 Proposed Systems We identified two planned projects in southern New England which, if modified, could provide additional volumes of natural gas to the Project Shippers in southern New England. These are Tennessee’s Connecticut Expansion Project in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, and Tennessee’s Northeast Energy Direct Project in New York and Massachusetts. Connecticut Expansion Project As currently planned, the Connecticut Expansion Project would provide about 72,000 Dth/d of additional transportation capacity on the existing Tennessee system for delivery to customers in Connecticut. The project would require the construction of about 13 miles of pipeline loops at various points along Tennessee’s existing Line 200 pipeline in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut (Dubay, 2013; Santa Maria, 2013; Hamilton, 2014). To meet the objectives of the Project, the Connecticut Expansion Project would need to be expanded to provide additional capacity and reach the delivery points required by the Project Shippers. This would require the construction of hundreds of miles of additional pipeline, much of which would duplicate the existing Algonquin system. The additional pipeline construction would result in much greater environmental impact than the proposed modifications to the Algonquin system. Therefore, the Connecticut Expansion Project would not be preferable to or provide a significantenvironmental advantage over the Project. Northeast Energy DirectProject The Northeast Energy Direct Project, as currently envisioned, would provide up to 2.2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to southern New England. The project would require the construction of about 344 miles of pipeline in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts (Tennessee, 2014). To meet the objectives of the Project, the Northeast Energy Direct Project would need to be modified to reach the delivery points required by the AIM Project Shippers. This would require the construction of hundreds of miles of additional pipeline, much of which would duplicate the existing Algonquin system. The additional pipeline construction would result in greater environmental impact than the Project.  Moreover, if the project is proposed before the Commission in the future and subsequently approved and constructed, the Northeast Energy Direct Project would be in-service no sooner than November 2018, so it would not meet the objectives of the Project within a reasonable timeframe. For all these reasons, the Northeast Energy Direct Project would not be preferable or provide a significant environmental advantage overthe Project. 3-12 3.4 FACILITY DESIGN AND SITING ALTERNATIVES Algonquin states that its existing mainline system does not have adequate unsubscribed capacity to accommodate the additional volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers. Algonquin’s system has a capacity of 2.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) along its 1,127-mile length between Lambertville, New Jersey and the Boston area in Massachusetts. The new and modified facilities would create an additional 342,000 Dth/d of natural gas transportation capacity on Algonquin’s system for delivery to the Project Shippers at various points in southern New England (see figure 3.4-1). We received several comments from stakeholders regarding facility design and siting for the proposed replacement, loop, and lateral pipelines and other facilities for the Project. Algonquin’s design for the proposed facilities is based on the flow dynamics and pressure of natural gas as it moves through the pipeline system. Natural gas is pressurized at compressor stations to create flow within the mainline and lateral pipelines within the system. As the gas exits a compressor station and moves along a pipeline, the pressure of the gas decreases due to turbulence and friction. The pressure continues to drop until the gas is re-compressed at the next compressor station along the system. In general, the pressure of gas in a pipeline must be equal to or greater than 450 psig where it enters a compressor station to ensure efficient operation of the system; the pressure is greater, up to the MAOP of the pipeline, where the gas leaves the compressor station. Algonquin states that it designed and sited the proposed Project facilities to increase capacity and maintain the required pressure profiles along each pipeline segment between the existing compressor stations along the system. We independently verified Algonquin’s mainline system expansion and the flow dynamics of its existing system. In some of the segments on Algonquin’s mainline pipelines, the additional volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers would be provided by increased compression without the need for a larger diameter pipeline or a new pipeline loop. For example, this is the case of the mainline segments at points downstream of the Chaplain Compressor Station in Windham County, Connecticut and the Burrillville Compressor Station in Providence County, Rhode Island. In these pipeline segments, the existing flow rates and pressures in the mainline pipelines are lower than at upstream segments due to customer deliveries of natural gas out of the system. As a result, these segments can accommodate additional volumes of natural gas with increased compression alone. In other segments along the system, there is little or no capacity to transport additional volumes of natural gas because of higher flow rates and pressures within the pipelines. In these areas, a combination of new pipeline construction and increased compression would be necessary to create additional capacity to transport the volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers. This is the case, for example, of the mainline segment between the existing Stony Point Compressor Station in Rockland County, New York and the existing Southeast Compressor Station in Putnam County, New York (i.e., the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment). For this segment, Algonquin proposes to increase compression at the Stony Point Compressor Station and replace about 12.3 miles of 26-inch-diameter pipeline downstream of the compressor station with a new, 42-inch-diameter pipeline. The larger diameter pipeline is necessary to increase capacity and maintain the required pressure profile of the pipeline segment downstream of the Stony Point Compressor Station until the gas in the pipeline can bere-compressed at the Southeast Compressor Station. Because the locations of the proposed pipeline replacements and loops are based on flow dynamics within the system, alternative locations or configurations would not be practical. Shifting the proposed facilities upstream or downstream of their current proposed locations would fail to create the additional capacity or pressure profiles within each pipeline segment to provide capacity for the additional volumes of natural gas and operate the system efficiently.  3-13 FAigure 3.4-1IM Project Algonquin System Receipt and Delivery Points As an example, Algonquin is proposing to replace about 4.5 miles of 26-inch-diameter pipeline with a new, 42-inch-diameter pipeline in Putnam County, New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut downstream of the existing Southeast Compressor Station (i.e., the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment). The pipeline replacement would create the additional capacity and flow characteristics necessary to operate the Project downstream of the Southeast Compressor Station. Shifting the pipeline replacement segment upstream of the compressor station would increase capacity on that segment, but create a bottleneck for delivery in areas downstream of the compressor station. This is because Algonquin would be unable to deliver additional volumes of natural gas downstream of the Southeast Compressor Station without a larger diameter pipe.  Additional information on facility design and siting is provided by Project component in the subsections below. The location of each facility component is described in section 2.1 and depicted on figure 2.1-1. 3.4.1 Take-up and Relay At three locations (i.e., the Haverstraw to Stony Point, Stony Point to Yorktown, and Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segments), Algonquin proposes to replace the existing 26-inch-diameter mainline with a new 42-inch-diameter pipeline. In conjunction with increased compression, the larger diameter pipeline in these segments would increase the carrying capacity of the mainline system, allowing Algonquin to meet its contractual obligations to existing customers and also provide the additional volumes of natural gas required by the Project Shippers. In each of these locations, replacement of the existing pipeline would maximize the use of existing right-of-way, which would minimize impacts on the environment during construction. While new pipeline loops in these same areas could similarly create additional capacity on the system, these are not considered feasible alternatives due to urbanization in the vicinity of the mainline and encroachment on the existing right-of-way. Relative to pipeline replacements, pipeline loops would require a wider construction corridor in areas where available space is limited and existing land uses preclude expanding thewidth ofthe existingright-of-way. In another location (i.e., the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment), the existing 6-inchdiameter pipeline cannot support the proposed incremental capacity of the Project. A larger, 16-inchdiameter pipeline is necessary to increase capacity to facilitate the transportation of additional natural gas volumes to an existing delivery point on the system. As with the other take-up and relay segments, replacement of the existing pipeline would maximize use of the existing right-of-way and minimize impacts on the environment during construction. 3.4.2 Loop Extension At two locations (i.e., the Line-36A Loop Extension and E-1 System Lateral Loop), Algonquin proposes to extend existing pipeline loops to increase the transmission capacity of the system. In each of these areas, Algonquin’s engineers have determined that extension of existing pipeline loops would be preferable to pipeline replacements to create the required pressure profiles to operate the system efficiently. There is less urbanization along the existing pipeline right-of-way in these areas to preclude expansion of the existing right-of-way width. Additionally, extending the existing loops would minimize the duration of outages on Algonquin’s system during construction, which would minimize service disruptions to downstream customers. For each of the pipeline loops, outages would be limited to a short period of several hours during tie-in operations. In contrast, outages of several weeks would be required to remove and replacethe existing pipelines in these areas. 3-15 3.4.3 New Pipeline We received a number of comments on the draft EIS asking how the West Roxbury Lateral and delivery point were selected and why the deliveries to Boston Gas cannot be served by another part of Algonquin’s system. According to Algonquin, Boston Gas has requested a new delivery point in the West Roxbury section of the City of Boston to enhance and reinforce the existing Boston Gas delivery system, reliability during outage situations, and support long-term growth in the area. The proposed delivery point would be located at an interconnection with the Boston Gas delivery system in an area where additionalsupplies of natural gas are needed.  The site forthe new delivery pointcannot bereached by the existing Algonquin pipeline system. As a result, Algonquin proposes to construct about 4.9 miles of new pipeline lateral (West Roxbury Lateral) and a new M&R facility to provide Boston Gas with the service it has requested. Currently, about 25 percent of peak day supplies are delivered to Boston Gas on the Algonquin J-System Lateral and about 15 percent of the peak requirements for Boston Gas are supplied from the CommercialPointLNG PeakShaving Facility. Algonquin’s J-SystemLateralprimarilysupplies the City of Boston through six existing meter stations. The J-System Lateral is also connected to the Commercial Point LNG Facility. In the past, the Commercial Point peak shaving facility would deliver gas into the J-System Lateral for redelivery to customers served by Algonquin. These volumes provided an operational benefit to Algonquin’s customers (Boston Gas and Colonial Gas) by supporting pipeline pressures on the east end of the system. However, deliveries from Commercial Point into the J-System Lateral have decreased dramatically over the last few years such that, if there were of an outage on the J-System Lateral on a cold day (i.e., 15 degrees), Algonquin anticipates widespread system outages would occur, affecting thousands of customers.  Given that the West Roxbury Lateral would be supplied from Algonquin’s I-System Lateral, Boston Gas customers’ exposure to the reliability risk described above would be greatly reduced. In the event of an outage on the J-System Lateral, the anticipated number of outages would be reduced by about two-thirds. In addition to the reliability and reinforcement benefits to existing gas customers, construction of the West Roxbury Lateral would also support anticipated long-term growth in the Boston region. Historically, West Roxbury has been one of the low pressure points on the Boston Gas intermediate pressure system. By connecting a new supply point to this portion of the Boston Gas system, the West Roxbury Lateral would help enable growth in the Boston area and minimize the need for on-system distribution projects.  The West Roxbury Lateral would deliver gas into a constrained area of the Boston Gas intermediate pressure system, which is also the location where the Boston Gas intermediate pressure system comes closest to Algonquin’s I-System Lateral. It may be possible to begin the West Roxbury Lateral at a different location along Algonquin’s existing I-System Lateral but this would increase the length and therefore the impact of the new lateral. Additionally, we have not identified an alternate starting point for the West Roxbury Lateral that would be preferable to the proposed route. The proposed West Roxbury M&R Station is located at a point on the intermediate pressure system that is capable of receiving sufficient volumes of gas to provide the benefits noted above.  Without the new lateral, many of these new potential customers could not be served without the need for significant system reinforcement. According to Algonquin, it has reviewed gas capacity requests for loads totaling 72.9 million metric British thermal units (MMBtu) (about 27 percent of the current total 3-16 Another identified advantage of the proposed new delivery point is that it would facilitate ongoing planned maintenance activities by Boston Gas, such as pipeline inspections and the replacement of sections of transmission main, without the risk of customer outages or the need to supplement supplies with portable LNG operations. Information on specific route and site alternatives for the proposed lateral and M&R station are provided in sections 3.5 and 3.6 below. 3.4.4 Compressor Station Modifications In addition to the pipeline facilities described above, the Project would require additional compression to transport the additional volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers. To provide the additional compression, Algonquin proposes to install two new gas-fired compressor units at the existing Stony Point Compressor Station, install one new gas-fired compressor unit at each of the existing Southeast, Cromwell, Chaplin, and Burrillville Compressor Stations, and restage one existing compressorunitatthe existingOxford CompressorStation. Nonew compressor stations are proposedfor the Project. In conjunction with the new pipeline facilities, the additional compression provided by the new/restaged compressor units would increase the maximum design capacity of Algonquin’s mainline system fromabout 2.6to 2.9 bcf/d. One of the new units to be installed at the Stony Point Compressor Station would replace four existing reciprocating units on Algonquin’s existing 26-inch-diameter mainline. The new unit would be rated to replace the capacity of the existing reciprocating units while also providing the additional horsepower needed to operate the Project. The Mars 100 is the preferred unit model for the replacement because it would meet the horsepower requirements of the mainline system as well as the air emissions thresholds required in the existing air permits for the Stony Point Compressor Station. Other potential models, such as the Mars 90 or Taurus 70, were dismissed because they would not provide the required horsepowerto operate the systemand/or do not provide sufficient air emission reductions. 3.4.5 Conclusions Regarding Facility Design and Siting We evaluated information filed by Algonquin and conducted our own engineering analysis to assess the facility design and locations proposed by Algonquin for the Project. We conclude that Algonquin designed the Project to maximize the efficient transportation of additional natural gas supplies through its mainline system. Additionally, the new and modified facilities would maximize the use of existing pipeline rights-of-way and aboveground facility sites, which would minimize environmental impacts during construction.  Alternative facility designs or locations potentially could increase capacity on certain segments of the system, but would result in operational inefficiencies that would inhibit the delivery of additional natural gas supplies to the Project Shippers. Moving the locations of pipeline replacement segments, for example, would fail to create additional transportation capacity at locations where it is needed to transport additional volumes of natural gas on the system. Moreover, we note that alternative designs or locations would not avoid environmental impacts, but shift them from one location to another. Therefore, for all the reasons discussed above, the alternative designs or locations considered would not be practicable or provide an environmental advantage over the Project. 3-17 3.4.6 Compressor Units At the request of FERC staff, Algonquin evaluated the feasibility of installing electric-driven compressor units in lieu of gas-fired units at each of the compressor station sites. Algonquin states that it considered several factors in evaluating the type of unit to install at each site, including: proximity to existing electric power sources; the need for new or modified electric power sources or transmission facilities; the need for additional ancillary facilities, such as substations; the ability of power companies to design, permit, and construct new facilities in a timeframe reasonably close to the Project; additional environmental impacts associated with construction of new facilities; and the ability to comply with emissions standards during operations at each site.  Algonquin consulted with regional power providers in the vicinity of each compressor station to determine the need for new electric distribution facilities to provide power for electric-driven compressor units at each of the compressor station sites. Based on these consultations, between 1.5 and 8.0 miles of new electric distribution line would need to be constructed to each compressor station site to provide a primary, dedicated power source for new electric-driven compressor units. Additionally, upgrades to existing electric substations would be required at three locations, and new substations would need to be built at each existing compressor station site. It is estimated that a minimum of 2 years would be required to design, permit, and construct these new facilities. As shown in table 3.4.6-1, construction of the new electric distribution facilities and substations would collectively affect a total of about 58.0 acres of residential, rural, and commercial lands. This would result in visual impacts on existing homes as well as impacts on wetlands, waterbodies, trees, and habitat for state-listed sensitive species. The new electric distribution line to the Chaplin Compressor Station would additionallycross the Mansfield Hollow State Park in Mansfield, Connecticut. Another issue with the installation of electric-driven compressor units in lieu of gas-fired units is availability of backup power to each site (i.e., access to a secondary substation in the event of an outage at the primary substation). No backup power would be available to the Stony Point, Southeast, and Burrillville Compressor Stations. Backup power would be available to the Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations, but would require the construction of an additional 16 miles and 10.7 miles, respectively, of new electric distribution lines. Construction of these lines would result in additional impacts on residential and rural areas as wellas environmental resources. We evaluated Algonquin’s proposal to install gas-fired compressor units rather than electric-driven units at the existing compressor station sites along the mainline. The use of electric-driven compressor units would result in additional environmental impacts during construction due to installation of non-jurisdictional facilities such as electric transmission lines and substations. Also, installation of electric-driven compressors would limit the Algonquin's ability to satisfy the Project's schedule due to the time needed to permit, design, and constructthese non-jurisdictional facilities.  While electric-driven units would result in lower operating emissions, this advantage would be offset by the other impacts described above. In consideration of all these factors, we conclude that use of electric-driven compressor units would not be preferable to or provide a significantenvironmental advantage over the proposed Project. 3-18 TABLE 3.4.6-1 Additional Power Facilities Required to Install Electric-Driven Compressor Units at Compressor Station Sites for the AIM Project  Minimum Time Additional Area to Permit, Affected by Design, and New Electric Transmission Facilities Construction Land Uses Construct Potential Issues  Stony Point Compressor Station – Rockland County, New York 2.0 miles of buried 138 kilovolt 14 acres Residential – 87 2 years Would require installation within (kV) distribution cable in or percent the existing right-of-way for New along streets; upgrades to an York State Highway 210; if this Commercial – 13 existing substation; construction is not feasible, the transmission percent of a new substation cable would be longer; no backup power available Southeast Compressor Station – Putnam County, New York 2.0 miles of aboveground 46 kV 4 acres Residential – 21 2 years Visual impacts in residential and distribution line in or along percent rural areas associated with the highways and roads; upgrades installation of new power poles; Rural – 79 percent to an existing substation; no backup power available construction of a new substation Cromwell Compressor Station – Middlesex County, Connecticut 1.5 miles of aboveground 23 kV 11 acres Rural – 100 2 years Up to 6 acres of tree clearing distribution line, including 1 mile percent and visual impacts due to the of greenfield corridor; installation of new power poles; construction of a new substation the route would cross 4 wetlands and 1 stream; the route would affect habitat for state-listed species; a second distribution line measuring 16 miles in length would be needed for backup power Chaplin Compressor Station – Windham County, Connecticut 6.0 miles of aboveground 13.8 17 acres Residential – 57 2 years Visual impacts in residential and kV distribution line, mostly in or percent rural areas; the route would along existing roads or rights-ofcross Mansfield Hollow State Rural – 43 percent way; construction of a new Park; the route would 12 substation streams and 2 wetlands; the route would affect habitat for state-listed species; a second distribution line measuring up to 10.7 miles in length would be needed for backup power Burrillville Compressor Station – Providence County, Rhode Island 8.0 miles of aboveground 34 kV 12 acres Residential – 82 2 years Visual impacts in residential and distribution line in or along percent rural areas due to installation of roads; upgrades to an existing new power poles; the route Rural – 18 percent substation; construction of a would cross 9 streams and 9 new substation wetlands; no backup power available  3-19 3.4.7 Waste Heat Generation A recent paper by the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (2008) considers the potential for energy efficiency at natural gas compression facilities via recovery of waste heat. The paper identifies threshold criteria for determining whether waste heat cogeneration is feasible at these facilities. The criteria include a total of 15,000 hp of compression provided by gas turbine units operating for at least 5,250 hours per yearwith a 60 percentload factor. The potential to install waste heat cogeneration facilities was evaluated at Algonquin’s compressor stations that would meet the horsepower and load factor thresholds identified in the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America paper. Because there are no existing facilities in the vicinity of the compressor stations to utilize waste heat, such as heat recovery steam generators or steam turbines, it was determined that waste heat recovery is notcurrently a viable option for the compressor stations. 3.5  ROUTE ALTERNATIVES AND VARIATIONS  3.5.1  Route Alternatives and Variations Evaluated Prior to Issuance of the Draft EIS  We evaluated a route alternative at the Hudson River crossing of the Stony Point to Yorktown  Take-up and Relay segment to address geological and constructability issues along Algonquin’s existing mainline We evaluated two route alternatives along the proposed West Roxbury Lateral to address impacts on existing land uses, primarily residential and commercial areas. We additionally evaluated a number of minor route variations along different components ofthe Project to resolve or address localized resource issues or stakeholder concerns. Each of the route alternatives and the minor route variations are discussed in the subsections below.  3.5.1.1 Hudson RiverNorthern Route Alternative Algonquin’s mainline system includes two existing 24-inch-diameter pipelines and one existing 30-inch-diameter pipeline across the Hudson River between the Town of Stony Point, Rockland County, New York, and the Village of Buchanan in the Town of Cortlandt, Westchester County, New York. As part of the Project, Algonquin proposes to install a new 42-inch-diameter pipeline across the river in conjunction with the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment. The proposed river crossing would be located about 0.5 mile south of Algonquin’s existing mainline right-of-way. The three existing pipelines and the proposed pipeline would provide transportation service across the river. We received a comment from the NYSDEC questioning the need for an additional 42-inchdiameter pipeline across the Hudson River when the three existing pipelines would continue to remain in service. Based on information filed by Algonquin, the three existing pipelines across the river do not have sufficient available capacity to accommodate the additional volume of natural gas required by the Project Shippers. The two existing 24-inch-diameter pipelines each have an MAOP of 674 psig, and the 30-inch-diameter pipeline has an MAOP of 750 psig. None of the three existing pipelines can be upgraded to a higher MAOP to accommodate additional volumes of natural gas. Therefore, either a new pipeline or the replacement of one of the existing pipelines with a new, higher capacity pipeline would be necessary to carry the additional volumes of natural gas. The removal of an existing pipeline and replacement of it with a new pipeline using the HDD method would result in greater impact than the installation of a new pipeline by HDD while leaving the existing pipelinesin place. Algonquin additionally states that it would maintain service on the three existing pipelines across the river to enhance system reliability.  In the event ofan outage on the existing 30-inch-diameter pipeline or the proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline across the river (e.g., due to upstream maintenance activities), 3-20 the two existing 24-inch-diameter pipelines could continue to provide service (at lower operating pressures) to minimize the interruption of service or reduction of flows to downstream points on the system. Without the two existing 24-inch-diameter pipelines across the river, an outage of either the existing 30-inch-diameter pipeline or proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline could result in significant natural gas losses in the system, which would impact power producers and industrial, commercial, and residential consumers in southern New England. We evaluated two potential crossings of the Hudson River: the proposed route, which deviates from the existing Algonquin right-of-way, and an alternative route that follows the existing right-of-way (Hudson River Northern Route Alternative). As shown in figure 3.5.1-1, each route originates at MP 2.6 and terminates atMP 5.5 oftheStonyPointtoYorktown Take-up and Relay. Fromthe startingpoint,the proposed route initially heads south/southeast for about 0.5 mile away from the existing mainline right-ofway. It then heads east/southeast for about 1.0 mile crossing from the west to the east bank of the river. It then heads northeastfor about1.3 miles, terminating at the existing mainline right-of-way. The Hudson River Northern Route Alternative is parallel to and on the north side of the existing mainline right-of-way across the river. Both routes cross portions of the existing Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) nuclear facility on the east bank of the river in Westchester County, New York. We assumed use of an HDD construction method for theriver crossing along eitherthe proposed oralternative routes to avoid in-water impacts within the Hudson River.2 Table 3.5.1-1 compares engineering and select environmental data for each route. The Hudson River Northern Route Alternative is about 0.6 mile shorter and would cross less wetland than the proposed route. The alternative route, however, would pass near more houses than the proposed route, though the total number ofhouses potentially affected by either route would be small.  TABLE 3.5.1-1 Comparison of the Hudson River Northern Route Alternative to the Corresponding Segment of the Proposed Route for the AIM Project  Proposed Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Route  Alternative Route  Length (mileposts 2.6 to 5.5) miles 2.9 Length adjacent to the existing right-of-way miles 0.0 Length of the horizontal directional drill feet 3,800 Number of residences within 50 feet a number 2 Number of residences within 100 feet a number 3 Wetland crossings linear feet 842 Wetland impacts acres 1.9 Waterbody crossings number 2 –––––––––––––––––––– a Includes residential housing complexes. Each contiguous building was counted as a single residence.  2.3 2.3 6,550 3 7 376 0.7 2  The existing 24-inch-diameter pipelines and 30-inch-diameter pipeline across the river were installed in the late 1950s and early1960s using theopen-cutconstruction method. 3-21 Figure 3.5.1-1AIM Project Hudson River Northern Route Alternative The proposed route would also cross close to St Patrick’s Church and the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. Algonquin has agreed to additional design and installation enhancements for construction and operation near the IPEC facility, which it would also apply to the portion of the proposed pipeline near the school. A discussion of impacts on St. Patrick’s Church and Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School is provided in section 4.8.5.    A major difference between the two routes would be the length of the HDD crossing. Due to differences in the width of the river at each crossing, the HDD for the alternative route would be 2,750 feet longer than the proposed route. The differences in the length of the HDD would be compounded by bedrock conditions along the alternative route, which are unfavorable to a successful HDD crossing, and by land use conflicts within the IPEC nuclear facility, which would provide limited workspacefor the HDD on the east side of the crossing. The depth of the hard bedrock at the river crossing on the alternative route is a significant issue. Based on publicly available geotechnical information, the bedrock profile near the middle of the Hudson River in the area of the HDD drill path is up to 300 feet below river bottom. A shallower drill profile in these conditions would require passing into and out of bedrock in several places and into the glacial till, sand, and clay deposits. This would increase the risk of inadvertent returns of drilling fluid or complications during construction, potentially including failure of the drill. A deeper drill profile entirely within bedrock would require extreme pull loads during pullback, resulting in the risk of structural failure of the pipeline. The difficulties of an HDD crossing of the Hudson River on the alternative route would be compounded by the length of the HDD, which would be about 6,550 feet long. A successful HDD of this length and in these geological conditions would be technically challenging and unprecedented. We are not aware of any previous HDDs of the same diameter and length that have been attempted in similar bedrock conditions in North America. Additionally, the time required to complete a drill at this crossing would exceed 12 months. The existing geological conditions along the proposed route are more favorable for a successful HDD crossing of the Hudson River. As discussed in detail in sections 4.1.7 and 4.3.2.3, geotechnical studies conducted by Algonquin indicate that an HDD along the proposed route could be completed within soft clay by passing over the bedrock and glacial till deposits beneath the river. Moreover, the shorter length of the HDD along the proposed route (3,800 feet) is less technically challenging for a 42inch-diameter pipe, and would reduce the time required to complete the HDD across the river (relative to the alternative route) by 9 to 10 months. We also note that several previous HDD crossings at this length and in these conditions have been completed in North America, including a recent crossing of the Hudson River. Spectra Energy completed an HDD of the Hudson River between Jersey City, New Jersey and lower Manhattan as part of the New Jersey-New York Expansion Project in geological conditions similar to thosealong the proposed route.  In addition to complications resulting from the drill profile, hard bedrock at the surface on the west of side of the Hudson River crossing along the alternative route would make it difficult to install a steel casing at the drill entry site, which is necessary to maintain and control drilling fluid during the HDD operation. The softer surface sediments on the west side of the river crossing along the proposed route would make it easier to install a steel casing at this location. This, along with the shorter time required to complete the HDD along the proposed route, would help reduce the potential for inadvertent returnsof drilling fluid during construction.  3-23 Another disadvantage of the Hudson River Northern Route Alternative is the limited amount of space available for pullback operations within the IPEC facility on the east side of the crossing.3 Algonquin would be limited to about 500 feet of workspace to assemble the pipe string for the HDD. As a result, Algonquin would need to assemble the pipe string (i.e., position, weld, x-ray, and coat individual pipe joints) in 13 sections. This would increase the risk of the pipeline becoming stuck in the drill hole during the pullback operation because the pipeline would be idle as each section of the pipe string is assembled. Algonquin estimates that pullback operations for the Hudson River Northern Route Alternative crossing would require one week or more to complete. Two existing access roads within a security zone at the IPEC facility would need to be closed forthis entire period.  In contrast, there is more available workspace for pullback operations on the east side of the Hudson River along the proposed route. As a result, only three pipe string sections would be required, which would reduce the time needed to complete pullback operations and the risk of the pipeline becoming stuck in the drill hole. Additionally, although the workspace for the pullback operation would be within the IPEC facility, it would be outside the securityzone and would not require the closure of any exiting access roads. Another issue and difference between the proposed route and the alternative pertains to the potential for operational conflicts with the IPEC facility. We received a comment from the New York State Attorney General’s Office noting the proximity of Algonquin’s existing pipelines to a potential location for a closed-cycle cooling system for Indian Point Unit 3, and citing concerns that a new pipeline in this area, immediately south ofthe IPEC security zone, could impede the construction ofsuch a cooling system. The proposed route would be located about 0.5 mile south of the IPEC security barrier, and would not impact construction of a closed-cycle cooling tower. There is also a difference between the two routes regarding their potential safety risks. Entergy, the operator of the IPEC, stated in a letter to FERC on September 29, 2014, that it is currently opposed to the Northern Route Alternative because it would put the pipeline closer to the IPEC facilities. It also said that, based on currently available information, the Northern Route Alternative could reduce the margin of safety when compared to the proposed route. In contrast, Entergy indicated that “based on the proposed routing of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline further from safety related equipment at IPEC, and accounting for the substantial design and installation enhancements agreed to by [Algonquin], the proposed AIM Project poses no increased risks to IPEC and there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.” The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has concurred with these findings during its own, independent analysis (see section 4.12.3). While the alternative route crossing for the Hudson River provides certain environmental advantages over the proposed crossing, including its greater distance from St Patrick’s Church and Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School, and its reduction in land disturbance and wetland impacts, the Hudson River Northern Route Alternative would not be technically feasible. The probability of drill failure is significantly higher for the alternative route.  If this were to occur, multiple attempts at the HDD or an alternative crossing method (such as the open cut method) could be required, which would increase the time required to complete the crossing and/or result in additional impacts on the environment. We also received many comments concerning the location of the pipeline in relation to the IPEC facilities and potentialsafetyrisks. The alternative is currentlyopposed byEntergydue to its closerproximityto IPEC There is insufficient available space on the west side of the Hudson River in the vicinityof Algonquin’s existing mainline to assemble the HDD pipeline for pullback operations. The existing mainline passes through residential areas on the west side ofthe river. 3-24 3.5.1.2 West Roxbury Lateral Alternative Route As shown in figure 3.5.1-2, the West Roxbury Lateral Alternative Route originates at about MP3.0 ofthe proposed route in the Town ofDedham, NorfolkCounty, Massachusetts. Fromthis point, the alternate route extends to the northwest for about 0.7 mile, paralleling Incinerator Road and crossing several parking lots and driveways. It then heads north for about 0.5 mile, parallel to and on the east side of State Route 1, crossing into West Roxbury in the City of Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The alternative route then follows an abandoned right-of-way for about 0.5 mile to the north before intersecting Belle Avenue. From there, the alternative route continues to the north for about 1.0 mile following a number of roads through residential and commercial areas, including Belle Avenue and Baker, Spring, and Alaric Streets.  It intersects the proposed route at aboutMP 5.0. Table 3.5.1-2 compares crossings of select environmental and other features along the West Roxbury Lateral Alternative Route to the corresponding segment of the proposed route. As shown in the table, the alternative route is about 0.1 mile longer, but would require 0.5 mile less construction within roadways and cross five fewer roads. The alternative route would pass within 50 and 100 feet of fewer residences than the proposed route, but more of the alternative route would pass through residential neighborhoods.  Both routes would avoid wetlands and cross the same number ofwaterbodies. TABLE 3.5.1-2 Comparison of the West Roxbury Lateral Alternative Route to the Corresponding Segment of the Proposed Route for the AIM Project  Proposed Alternative Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Route Route  Length (MPs 3.0 to 5.0) miles 2.0 2.1 Construction within roadway miles 1.8 1.3 Number of residences within 50 feet a number 161 83 Number of residences within 100 feet a number 185 132 Wetland crossings feet 0 0 Waterbody crossings number 1 1 Road crossings number 24 19 –––––––––––––––––––– a Includes residential housing complexes. Each contiguous building was counted as a single residence.  During the initial stakeholder outreach, public officials representing the City of Boston expressed concern to Algonquin regarding the alternative route because of its proximity to residential neighborhoods. The alternative route would cross through the backyards of houses, impact residential streets, and cause significant disruption to the surrounding neighborhoods, particularly along Belle Avenue in West Roxbury. Construction along the alternative route would require the complete closure of streets within these areas. Although the proposed route would pass near more residences, it primarily would be constructed along and within more established roadways (e.g., Washington, Grove, and Centre Streets) and in parking lots of commercial and industrial properties. Additionally, the proposed route would avoid the residential area along Belle Avenue and result in fewer impacts on homes and neighborhoods. For this reason, the West Roxbury Lateral Alternative Route would not be preferable to or provide a significant environmental advantage overthe proposed route. 3-25 3.5.1.3 West Roxbury Lateral South EndAlternative Route As shown in figure 3.5.1-3, the West Roxbury Lateral South End Alternative Route originates just north of Interstate 95 at about MP 0.5 of the proposed route in the Town of Westwood, Norfolk County, Massachusetts. From this point, the alternate route extends to the east/northeast for about 0.5 mile, parallel to and on the north side of Interstate 95, including an off ramp connecting to the Boston Providence Turnpike.  The alternative route then heads north for about 0.2 mile, parallel to and east of the Boston ProvidenceTurnpike.  It intersects the proposed route at aboutMP 1.2. Table 3.5.1-3 compares the West Roxbury Lateral South End Alternative Route to the corresponding segment of the proposed route. While both routes measure about 0.7 mile in length, the alternative route would require 0.5 mile less of construction within roads, pass near fewer residences, and cross two fewer roads than the proposed route. Both routes would avoid wetland and waterbody crossings. TABLE 3.5.1-3 Comparison of the West Roxbury Lateral South End Alternative Route to the Corresponding Segment of the Proposed Route for the AIM Project  Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Proposed Route  Alternative Route  Length (MPs 0.5 to 1.2) miles 0.7 Construction within roadway miles 0.6 Number of residences within 50 feet a number 11 Number of residences within 100 feet a number 13 Road crossings number 5 Railroad crossings numbers 1 –––––––––––––––––––– a Includes residential housing complexes.

The primary disadvantages of the alternative route are that it would parallel Interstate 95, which would result in limited construction workspace; require the removal of existing sound abatement walls along the highway; and result in impacts on several houses. Moreover, installation of the pipeline lateral adjacent to Interstate 95 would be inconsistent with MassDOT’s “Policy on the Accommodation of Utilities Longitudinally, Along Controlled-Access Highways,” which precludes the placement of utility infrastructure parallel to the interstate highway system absent extenuating circumstances. Several commentors believe that MassDOT's policy should not be considered over local preferences and believe that the Project poses "extenuating circumstances" warranting a waiver of MassDOT's policy. Impacts on the public for the proposed route are addressed throughout section 4. We do not find that the Project, as proposed with Algonquin's mitigation measures, would result in significant impacts along the southern portion of the West Roxbury Lateral, including traffic impacts at the intersection of Elm Street and Providence Highway. Therefore, we disagree that requesting a waiver of MassDOT's policy is warranted simply for local convenience. Additional considerations of local impacts forthe alternative route are discussed below. 3-27 The West Roxbury Lateral South End Alternative Route would result in direct impacts on two residences adjacent to the off ramp connecting Interstate 95 with State Route 1A, near Robinwood Road. The residences are located about 10 and 20 feet from the sound abatement wall for the highway. Installing the pipeline through this area would require the temporary removal of the sound abatement wall resulting in highway traffic noise for several months at the residences untilthe wall could be replaced.  The alternative route would also impact three commercial properties and two motel properties. Due to the existing elevated slope along Interstate 95, extensive grading would be required to install the pipeline adjacent to the highway. This would require ATWS and additional tree clearing along the highway. The additional tree clearing would result in the permanent removal of privacy/nuisance screening between the commercial and motel properties along the Interstate 95 corridor. Another disadvantage of the alternative route would be traffic impacts on the Legacy Place shopping area in the Town of Dedham. The focus of Legacy Place’s concern at the shopping mall is the ability to manage traffic impacts during construction. The West Roxbury Lateral South End Alternative Route would affect traffic at two of the three ingress/egress points for Legacy Place. Additionally, the crossing of the intersection of Elm Street and the Providence Highway could disrupt traffic entering and exiting Legacy Place along Elm Street. See section 4.9.5 for a discussion of traffic impacts that would resultfrom construction ofthe proposed route. In consideration of the potential impacts on residences and businesses, as well as constraints associated with installation of the pipeline adjacent to an interstate highway, as documented in our analysis, the West Roxbury Lateral South End Alternative Route would not be preferable to or provide an environmental advantage over the proposed route. 3.5.1.4 Minor Route Variations Algonquin incorporated six minor route variations along different segments of the proposed pipeline facilities to avoid or reduce impacts on environmental or other resources, resolve engineering issues, or address stakeholder concerns (e.g., to minimize impacts on a golf course). Each of these route variations was incorporated into the Project design by Algonquin prior to issuance of the draft EIS as part of the proposed action. Information on the six route variations, including their purpose and primary advantages and disadvantages relative to the original route, is provided in table 3.5.1-4. We have reviewed the information filed by Algonquin on these six route variations and our analysis of the proposed route in section 4.0 of this EIS includes these variations as part of the proposed action except wherechangedbymodificationsmade following issuanceof thedraftEIS (see section 3.5.2). At thetime of the draft EIS, we concurred with theseroute variations. At the time of the draft EIS, we had also evaluated an additional route variation, the Catskill Aqueduct Variation, between MPs 10.2 and 10.3 of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment in Westchester County, New York. However, the results of soil investigations and geotechnical work were pending at the time. Additional information is now available and a revised evaluation has been conducted (see section 3.5.2.1). 3.5.2 Route Alternatives and Variations Evaluated AfterIssuance of the Draft EIS Following issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin evaluated several route variations it incorporated into its proposed route and we received comments requesting that we evaluate additional alternatives and variations to the proposed route.  Our assessment ofthese alternatives and variations is included below. 3-29 TABLE 3.5.1-4  Milepost Start End  Minor Route Variations Incorporated into the AIM Project Prior to Issuance of the Draft EIS County/ Length Primary Primary State (feet) Description Advantages Disadvantages  Haverstraw to StonyPoint Take-up and Relay – Stacey Court Variation 1.7 1.9 Rockland, NY 1,000 The route variation is offset about 40 feet to the south of the existing pipeline. StonyPoint to Yorktown Take-up and Relay – Route 9 Route Variation 5.8 5.9 Westchester, NY 528 The route variation is offset between about 20 and 50 feet to the north of the existing pipeline. West RoxburyLateral – Norfolk Golf Club Variation 0.0 0.1 Norfolk, MA 370 The route variation is offset about 175 feet to the southwest of the original route. West RoxburyLateral – Soccer Field Variation 2.4 2.6 Norfolk, MA 792 The route variation is offset about 175 feet to the east of the original route. West RoxburyLateral – Mother Brook Variation 3.0 3.2 Norfolk, MA 845 The route variation is offset up to about 250 feet to the northwest of the original route. West RoxburyLateral – Centre Street Variation 5.1 5.1 Suffolk, MA 422 The route variation extends the northern terminus of the West Roxbury Lateral to facilitate a tie-in with existing Boston Gas facilities. The route variation would reduce impacts on existing and planned future residences. The route variation would provide a better alignment for a trenchless crossing of Route 9. The route variation would avoid a compost area at the Norfolk Golf Club, which was requested by the landowner. The route variation would avoid placement of the pipeline within a roadway entrance to Staples; the route variation additionally would avoid land use conflicts with planned future expansions of the Harris Street Bridge and Boston Providence Turnpike by MassDOT. The route variation would allow for a crossing of Mother Brook without the need to close Washington Street, which would minimize traffic impacts. The route alternative would avoid construction activities at the intersection of Centre and Spring Streets, which would minimize traffic impacts. The route variation would require an additional 0.8 acre of tree clearing. The route variation would require an additional 0.1 acre of temporary workspace and 0.1 acre of permanent easement. The route variation would cross a tee box, fairway, and water hazard on the golf course. A new route variation in this area was analyzed following issuance of the draft EIS (see section 3.5.2). The route variation would result in an additional 0.3 acre of impact within a soccer field at Gonzalez Field. A new route variation in this area was analyzed following issuance of the draft EIS (see section 3.5.2). The route variation would result in temporary construction impacts on businesses and homes along Eastbrook Road and Post Lane. A new route variation in this area was analyzed following issuance of the draft EIS (see section 3.5.2). The route variation would require construction adjacent to St. Theresa of Avila Parish and School. A new route variation in this area was analyzed following issuance of the draft EIS (see section 3.5.2). 3-30 3.5.2.1 Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay Segment Alternativesand Variations Hudson River HDD Variation Algonquin has continued to finalize the design details of the Hudson River HDD. This included evaluating possible engineering options to safely penetrate the existing sheet pile wall at the current entry/exit side on the west side of the river. According to Algonquin, as the detailed design progressed, Algonquin was notified by the landowner, NRG Lovett, LLC, that the location of the proposed HDD entry/exit location on the west side of the river within the former NRG Lovett, LLC power plant property is now occupied by contractors responsible for the construction of the new Tappan Zee Bridge. Following additional engineering evaluation, Algonquin also recognized that constructing the pipe penetration through the existing sheet pile wall would pose significant challenges and that in-water work within the Hudson River would be required to complete this aspect of the construction. To mitigate the effects of these challenges, Algonquin evaluated relocating the western HDD entry/exit point about 850 feet northwest of the previously proposed location. The new length of the Hudson River HDD would be 5,090 feet. As shown on figure 3.5.2-1, the new entry/exit location would be located close to the previously proposed alignment on property also owned by NRG Lovett, LLC. A new temporary access road would be required to access the new HDD entry/exit location on the west side of the river. This new access road, which is about 50 feet long, is an existing unimproved road that extends from West Shore Drive, which is currently used to provide access to the existing overhead power lines. This new access road would not require any permanent improvements. An environmental comparison of the Hudson River HDD Alignment Variation (MPs 3.0 to 4.0) to the previously proposed route is presented in table 3.5.2-1.  Overallthe length of the variation would be slightly shorter, but the length of the HDD segment of the variation would increase from 4,452 feet to 5,090 feet. The substrate crossed by the adjusted Hudson River HDD alignment would not change (i.e., like the previously proposed HDD alignment, the new HDD alignment would remain within the soft sediments beneath the river). The potential noise impact due to HDD construction activities at the surrounding noise-sensitive areas (NSA) would not be significantly different between the two routes. Moreover, the variation would reduce wetland impacts by about 0.1 acre, and while there is a small isolated Phragmites-dominated wetland within the proposed workspace for the HDD variation, this wetland would be enclosed with silt fence and not directly impacted by construction.  The variation would also have the following advantages overthe previously proposed route.  Specifically, it would:  reduce the overallconstruction workspacerequired from4.7 to 3.0 acres;  avoid the logistical concerns associated with the Tappan Zee Bridge construction activities on the former NRG Lovett, LLC power plant property;  eliminate the required in-water construction activities necessary to support construction through the existing sheet pile wall along the perimeter of the former NRG Lovett, LLC power plant property;  avoid what Algonquin has termed the complex construction associated with penetrating the existing sheet pile wall with casing pipe; and  eliminate the need for crossing the existing railroad tracks to access the construction site with equipment, materials, and personnelon a daily basis. 3-31 Legend Mileposts Previously Proposed Route Hudson River HDD Variation Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat NHD Stream/River NWI Wetlands 0 840 1,680 t Figure 3.5.2-1AIM Project Stony Point to YorktownTake-up and RelayHudson River HDDVariation TABLE 3.5.2-1 Comparison of the Hudson River HDD Alignment Variation to the Corresponding Segment of the Previously Filed Route for the AIM Project  Previously Filed Variation Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Route (Currently Proposed Route)  Length (MPs 3.0 to 4.0) miles 0.99 0.96 Land temporarily affected during construction acres 4.7 3.0 New land permanently affected for operation acres 1.3 0.2 Number of residences within 50 feet number 0 0 Wetlands affected acres 0.1 0 Waterbody crossings number 0 0 Road crossings number 1 1 Railroad crossings number 1 1  Because this HDD alignment shift avoids conflicts with the construction laydown area for the Tappan Zee Bridge contractors, avoids in-water construction work related to penetrating the sheet pile wall at the current entry/exit site, and results in an overall reduction in construction workspace, we find it is preferable to the corresponding segment of the previously proposed alignment and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate it and the proposed workspace modification into the proposed route and Project design. Blue Mountain Reservation Variation We evaluated a potential pipeline variation to the north of the current pipeline right-of-way in the Blue Mountain Reservation in response to a comment we received about the proximity of the pipeline to a pond located south of the alignment between MPs 7.97 and 8.01 and concerns about the potential impact of construction in this area on amphibians. The proposed pipeline route and construction workspace in this area would be located in uplands between 20 and 65 feet north of the wetland bordering the pond. Algonquin would replace the existing pipeline with the new pipeline in the same trench as the existing pipeline to be removed. The variation would shift the pipeline alignment about 100 feet to the north. Because there is another utility corridor abutting the north side of Algonquin’s existing right-of-way at this location, the variation would need to cross this utility corridor twice, once to put the proposed pipeline north of the corridor and then a second time to return to the proposed alignment after passing by the pond.  These crossings of the existing utility corridor and the new right-of-way resulting from the shift would increase the amount of temporary and permanent workspace and land disturbance as well as the amount of temporary and permanent forest clearing that would be needed to install the pipeline. Although we recognize the proximity of the proposed route to the pond may increase the potential to encounter amphibians, we do not believe this outweighs the impact of the extra right-of-way and tree clearing that would be required for the alternative, especially because the impacts of the proposed route would be minimized by Algonquin’s implementation of its E&SCP. Therefore, we do not find the Blue Mountain Reservation Variation should be incorporated into the proposed route. Catskill Aqueduct Variation At the time of the draft EIS, we had conducted a preliminary evaluation of the Catskill Aqueduct Variation, between MPs 10.2 and 10.3 of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment in Westchester County, New York, and found it acceptable but not preferable to the previously proposed route. However, soil investigations and geotechnical work was pending at the time. The existing mainline pipelines at this location cross the Catskill Aqueduct near its intersection with Croton Avenue. 3-33 Algonquin’s previously proposed action was to replace the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline with a 42inch-diameter pipeline along the samealignment.  Based on the additional geotechnical work, engineering studies, and information obtained from the NYCDEP, Algonquin is now proposing to incorporate the Catskill Aqueduct Variation into its Project design. The variation would move the pipeline route about 50 feet south of the current alignment to achieve sufficient vertical clearance between the new pipeline and the Catskill Aqueduct. The variation would also provide improved alignment and workspace to complete thecrossingofCroton Avenue and theaqueduct.  The variation would diverge fromthe existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline for about 500 feet, about 280 feet before Croton Avenue and then continuing across Croton Avenue to about 150 feet past the aqueduct. Algonquin has indicated that the variation could be accommodated without any change in the proposed workspace. Algonquin would also remove the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline and casing, but would not disturb the existing protective concrete slab, pending concurrence from NYCDEP. Environmental impacts associated with the corresponding segment of the previously proposed action and the Catskill Aqueduct Variation would be similar, though the route variation would require more tree clearing than the previously proposed alignment. However, this would be offset by the more preferable alignment across Croton Avenue and the Catskill Aqueduct. Algonquin would also implement several measures to minimize impacts on the aqueduct, including installation of an 8-inch-thick concrete slab about 2 feet above the aqueduct and installation of steel casing pipe around the pipeline. Based on the advantages of a more preferable alignment across Croton Avenue and the aqueduct, we find the Catskill Aqueduct Variation to be preferable and agree with its incorporation into the proposed Stony Pointto Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment. 3.5.2.2 West Roxbury Lateral Alternatives and Variations Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook State Reservation Alternative A commentor suggested an alternative that would cross the Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook Reservation, with the goal of reducing residential impacts and safety risks. We identified and evaluated a route that would begin at the same location as the proposed route then cross the Norfolk Golf Club before entering Canton Street and proceeding southeast to Blue Hill Drive. The alternative would be installed within these roads and would cross Interstate 95, after which it would enter Neponset River State Park. From there it would proceed northeast across the length of the park crossing wetlands and streams and the Neponset River twice before joining up with and following the east side ofMeadow Road still within the park. Upon reaching Neponset Valley Parkway, the alternative would turn and proceed north and west within the parkway to River Street where, after a short distance, it would cross Mother Brook Pond. On the north side of the pond it would follow Turtle Pond Parkway within the road northwest to Enneking Parkway. From there it would follow the west side of Enneking Parkway across the Stony Brook State Reservoir. Near the north end of the state reservoir property, the alternative would turn to the northwest and follow Maplewood Street to St. Theresa Avenue and then St. Theresa Avenue until it joins the end of the proposed lateral and the proposed West Roxbury M&R Station site. Figure 3.5.2-1 shows the location of the alternative considered. 3-34 Legend Project Line Route Alternative Ð MassDEP AUL Sites . Certified Vernal Pools .

However, a greater percentage of the in-street work associated with the alternative would be in residential areas versus commercial areas, such that the alternative would increase the crossing of residential neighborhoods by 0.9 mile. The alternative would also increase the crossing of public lands associated with Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook Reservation and would include four more waterbody crossings than the proposed route. Both routes would cross Mother Brook, but the crossing area ofMother Brook along the alternative would be at a point where the brook is ponded due to a nearby downstream dam. A pipeline crossing at this location would be very challenging due to workspace constraints but we were not able to find a more suitable crossing site. The alternative would also result in more tree clearing and would impact about 13.9 acres of wetlands, including 7.4 acres of woody wetlands, mostly within the Neponset River State Park, that would be completely avoided by the proposed route. The alternative would also preclude Algonquin’s adoption and the resulting benefits of the St. Theresa Parish Variation. This variation, which was proposed after the draft EIS was issued, would eliminate about 375 feet of the previously proposed route along St. Theresa Avenue, which serves as the primary entrance road for both St. Theresa Parish and School and The Roxbury Latin School (see a discussion of this variation below). For these reasons, we do not believe the Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook State Reservation Alternative would be preferable to the proposed West Roxbury Lateral Route; therefore, it was eliminated from further consideration. TABLE 3.5.2-2 Comparison of the Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook State Reservation Alternative to the Corresponding Segment of the Proposed Route for the AIM Project  Proposed Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Route Alternative  Length (MPs 0.0 to 5.1) miles 5.1 7.1 In-street construction miles 4.7 3.7 Total wetlands affected acres 0.0 13.9 Woody wetlands affected acres 0.0 7.4 Waterbody crossings number 1 5 Residential neighborhoods crossed a miles 2.1 3.0 b Commercial areas crossed miles 2.6 0.7 ____________________ a Reflects miles of in-street construction that would be within primarily residential neighborhood streets b Reflects miles of in-street construction that would within primarily commercial areas  Norfolk Golf Club Variation Through its consultations with and at the request of the Norfolk Golf Club in Westwood, Massachusetts, Algonquin evaluated a route variation across the golf course between MPs 0.0 and 0.2 (see figure 3.5.2-3). At its furthest point, this variation would be about 197 feet west of the previously proposed route. As shown in table 3.5.2-3, the variation is shorter and would require less temporary and permanent right-of-way. It would also affect less playable area of the golf course and avoid the existing tee box for the 5th hole. To further reduce impacts on use of and business operation at the golf course, Algonquin has committed to complete construction across the golf course in the fall or winter months, which would allow for full restoration of the golf course features by the following season. Based on the advantages of minimizing impacts on the golf course and the fact that the area of impact of the new route alignment would be less than that of the corresponding segment of the previously proposed route, we find the Norfolk Golf Club Variation to be preferable and agree with its incorporation into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. 3-36 Legend Mileposts Previously Proposed Route Norfolk Golf Club Variation .

The shift, as shown in figure 3.5.2-4, would also move the pipeline in Rustcraft Road and Elm Street to the side away from Legacy Place and reduce potential impact on a planned “kiss and ride” parking area that will be built on Rustcraft Road. According to Algonquin, both Legacy Place and National Amusements have acknowledged that the proposed shift in alignment would be preferable to the previously proposed route because it shifts the construction away from the three exit and entrance points into Legacy Place that were crossed by the corresponding segment of the previously proposed route. Algonquin has also agreed to maintain at all times one paved lane for each turning movement during construction of the pipeline and would complete the installation of the pipeline within Providence Highway at night between 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. Based on the advantages of minimizing impacts on access to Legacy Place, we find the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority Variation to be preferable and agree with its incorporation into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. GonzalezField Variation Algonquin evaluated the Gonzalez Field Variation based on further discussions with the Dedham Parks and Recreation Department, which requested that Algonquin revisitthe need for the route acrossthe field to avoid a potentialfuture bridge expansion, and the MassDOT.  Algonquin’s original alignment was designed based on the understanding that the MassDOT had plans to expand the Harris Street Bridge. Upon Algonquin's further consultation, the MassDOT indicated that it has no foreseeable plans to expand the bridge. Therefore, MassDOT agreed that Algonquin could revise its alignment across Gonzalez Field by placing the pipeline closer to the Harris Street Bridge but not within the sloped area.  As aresult and as shown in figure 3.5.2-5, Algonquin is proposing a modified route alignment across Gonzalez Field that moves the proposed pipeline closer to Providence Highway. As shown in table 3.5.2-4, the variation would be shorter and would minimize impacts on the recreational field as well as reduce the amount of temporary and permanent right-of-way required.  To further minimize impacts, Algonquin has also agreed to defer construction across Gonzalez Field until after the conclusion of the Town’s soccer program in the fall. Based on the advantages of minimizing impacts on the recreational field and the fact that the environmental impacts of the new route alignment would be less than that of the previously proposed route, we find the Gonzalez Field Variation to be preferable and agree with its incorporation into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. 3-38 Legend Mileposts Previously Proposed Route Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority Variation Ð MassDEP AUL Sites .

Algonquin has had subsequent discussions with MassDOT and obtained the design details of the box culvert under Washington Street as well as other buried utilities. Based on this new information, Algonquin has determined that there is sufficient space above the box culvert to accommodate the pipeline within Washington Street. As a result and as shown in figure 3.5.2-6, Algonquin evaluated a variation to continue the pipeline within Washington Street between MPs 3.0 and 3.2 to avoid both the crossing of Mother Brook and the disturbance to other nearby residences and businesses along Eastbrook Street and Lower East Street. Algonquin is also proposing a shift in the pipeline location within Washington Street, between MPs 3.2 and 3.8, byabout 25 feet from the westbound travel lane to the eastbound travel lane to avoid an existing buried Massachusetts Water Resources Authority water line. Algonquin is not proposing any workspace changes within this section ofthe route shift(i.e., between MPs 3.2 and 3.8).  A comparison of the environmental impacts of the variation versus the corresponding segment of the previously proposed route is provided in table 3.5.2-5. The advantages of the variation and pipeline shift are that they would avoid direct impacts on Mother Brook, avoid temporary construction impacts on businesses and homes along Eastbrook Street and Lower East Street, and avoid impacting the existing Massachusetts Water Resources Authority water line within Washington Street. Based on these advantages, we find the Mother Brook Variation to be preferable and agree with its incorporation into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. TABLE 3.5.2-5 Comparison of the Mother Brook Variation to the Corresponding Segment of the Previously Filed Route for the AIM Project  Previously Filed Variation Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Route (Currently Proposed Route)  Length (MPs 3.0 to 3.8) miles 0.83 0.14 Land temporarily affected during construction acres 1.56 1.38 New land permanently affected for operation acres 0 0 Number of residences within 50 feet a number 50 48 Wetlands affected acres 0 0 Waterbody crossings number 1 0 b Road crossings number 8 8 –––––––––––––––––––– a Includes residential housing complexes.

As a result of discussions with National Grid and several stakeholders along St. Theresa Avenue, Algonquin incorporated a route variation into the proposed route that relocates the end point of the West Roxbury Lateralto the north side of the intersection of Spring Street and Centre Street where the West Roxbury Lateral would connect to the existing National Grid pipeline system. With this change, the West Roxbury Lateral would connect directly to the National Grid pipeline system, and Algonquin would no longer require the buried vault-type of installation initially proposed. As shown in table 3.5.2-6 and on figure 3.5.2-7, the variation would eliminate about 375 feet of the previously proposed route along St. Theresa Avenue, which serves as the primary entrance road for both St. Theresa Parish and School and The Roxbury Latin School, and as a result, no portion of St. Theresa Avenue would be impacted by construction. According to Algonquin, it has discussed this route variation with representatives of both St. Theresa Parish and the Roxbury Latin School and it addresses these organizations’ concerns regarding the potential impacts on their facilities.  The route variation would also reduce the construction workspaceby 0.5 acre.  Because of these advantages, we find the St. Theresa Parish and School Variation to be preferable to the corresponding segment of the previously proposed route and agree with its incorporation into the West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. TABLE 3.5.2-6 Comparison of the St. Theresa Parish Variation to the Corresponding Segment of the Previously Filed Route for the AIM Project  Previously Filed Variation Environmental/Engineering Factor Unit Route (Currently Proposed Route)  Length (MPs 5.06 to 5.10) miles 0.07 0.01 Land temporarily affected during construction acres 0.81 0.31 New land permanently affected for operation acres 0 0 Number of residences within 50 feet a number 0 0 Wetlands affected acres 0 0 Waterbody crossings number 0 0 Road crossings number 2 1 –––––––––––––––––––– a Although no residences are located within 50 feet of the variation or the filed route, the variation would avoid one commercial structure and one church that are located within 50 feet of the filed route.  3.5.2.3 Summary of Route Alternatives and Variations Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS Table 3.5.2-7 summarizes the route alternatives and variations evaluated after issuance of the draft EIS and whether they were incorporated into the proposed route.

Our assessment of these adjustments and modifications is included in table 3.5.3-1 below. For those that have been incorporated into the proposed Project design, the analysis in section 4 of this EIS reflects those modifications. 3.5.4 Alternative Construction Methods Evaluated AfterIssuance of the Draft EIS We received comments asking us to evaluate different construction methods for various waterbody and wetland crossings.  Our evaluation is included below. 3.5.4.1 Hudson River We received comments on the draft EIS asking why we did not analyze alternative crossing methods for the proposed Hudson River crossing but instead limited our review to the HDD crossing method. Other alternatives were not thoroughly evaluated because we do not believe an alternative crossing method would offer any significant environmental advantages. The HDD method is recognized as the environmentally preferred method, and is now becoming industry standard, for crossing large and sensitive waterbodies, if conditions allow, because it installs the pipeline beneath the waterbody without impacting the bed or banks. An alternative to using the HDD method would be an open-cut crossing (other dry crossing methods such as a dam-and-pump or flume would not be practicable due to the size of the river). The impacts of the open-cut construction method would include water quality impacts associated with clearing, grading, and trenching within and adjacent to the river. Sediments would be suspended by in-water construction activities and there would be an increased potential for erosion of cleared river banks and riparian areas. Turbidity resulting from the sediments suspended during in-water trenching and backfilling operations could reduce light penetration and the corresponding photosynthetic oxygen production. The resuspension of deposited organic material and inorganic sediments could also cause an increase in consumption of biological and chemical oxygen, decreasing available dissolved oxygen.  Based on these effects and the potentialto avoid these effects using the HDDmethod, we did not consider an open-cut crossing of the Hudson River preferable.  3-45 TABLE 3.5.3-1 Minor Pipeline Shifts, Workspace Adjustments, and Design Modifications Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS  Incorporated Segment/ Municipality, Type of Into Project Milepost(s) State Modification Description and Evaluation Design  Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay 4.0 to 4.3 Verplanck/ Hudson River As a result of the modifications to the proposed entry/exit Yes Cortlandt, NY HDD pullback location and slightly longer length of the Hudson River HDD workspace described above, Algonquin proposes to add 50 feet of ATWS addition and width along the north side of the previously proposed pullback temporary workspace on the exit side of the HDD. Algonquin says the access road ATWS is necessary to accommodate the fabrication of four adjustment pullback pipe strings that would be necessary to complete the HDD. The ATWS would result in 1.6 acres of additional forest clearing impacts. Algonquin also proposes to reduce the length of TAR 4.4 on the east side of the river by 440 feet. The temporary access would terminate at the HDD pullback workspace and would no longer extend to 11th Street in Verplanck. Because we believe this additional workspace is required to facilitate the successful completion of the HDD, and because the revised temporary access road would reduce impacts, we concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate the proposed changes into the Project design. 5.7 to 5.9 Peekskill/ Pipeline shift Algonquin proposes to abandon in-place about 1,003 feet of Yes Cortlandt, NY the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline where it passes under Route 9 in Peekskill and Cortlandt, New York. The new pipeline and workspace would be offset about 20 feet north of the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline between MPs 5.7 and 5.9. We believe the proposed offset, which would allow the existing pipeline under the roadway to be abandoned in-place, avoiding the roadway impacts that would result if the existing pipeline were removed, is preferable and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate it into the proposed route. 6.6 Cortlandt, NY Workspace Algonquin proposes to reduce the proposed construction Yes adjustment workspace on the north side of the existing right-of-way at MP 6.6 in Cortlandt, New York to minimize impact on a residence. In order to facilitate equipment access to the revised construction area, Algonquin proposes to add an additional 0.22 acre of ATWS, comprising 0.16 acre of forest land and 0.06 acre of residential land, on the south side of the existing right-of-way opposite the residence. Because the proposed workspace adjustments were made to minimize residential impacts, we believe Algonquin’s proposed changes are justified and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate them into the proposed Project design. 8.1 Cortlandt, NY Workspace Algonquin proposes to add an additional 0.22 acre of ATWS Yes addition on the south side of the existing right-of-way at MP 8.1 in Cortlandt, New York to provide access from a temporary access road to the construction right-of-way, and to provide additional area for construction crew parking, and to maintain access to a parking area associated with a residence/home business adjacent to the work area. The ATWS would result in an additional 0.22 acre of impact comprising 0.05 acre of forest land and 0.17 acre of industrial land. We believe Algonquin’s proposed use of the additional workspace is justified and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate it into the proposed Project design.  3-46 TABLE 3.5.3-1 (cont’d) Minor Pipeline Shifts, Workspace Adjustments, and Design Modifications Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS  Incorporated Segment/ Municipality, Type of Into Project Milepost(s) State Modification Description and Evaluation Design  10.4 Cortlandt, NY Workspace Algonquin proposes to add an additional 0.15 acre of ATWS Yes addition along the northern edge of the previously proposed depicted workspace at MP 10.43 in Cortlandt, New York to provide space to safely dismantle an existing deck structure associated with the Cortlandt Farm Market. According to Algonquin, this deck is in poor condition and is a safety hazard. Algonquin plans to replace the deck structure after the pipeline installation is complete. All of the land that would be affected by the ATWS is industrial land consisting of a parking lot. Because the proposed additional workspace would be used to facilitate safe construction of the pipeline, we believe is justified and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate it into the proposed Project design. Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay 2.1 Danbury, CT Relocating The USACE asked that consideration be given to relocating No HDD entry/exit the HDD entry/exit point near MP 2.1 further to the east (in an point upland area) to avoid and minimize wetland impact from temporary workspace (B13-SELR-W10). The potential to relocate the HDD entry point to the east was considered but determined that the upland area to the east is on a hill and use of this area would not accommodate the HDD drill rig and other equipment without significant cut and fill activities. The proposed entry location is in a wetland but the area is flat and would be restored following installation of the pipeline. For these reasons we do not believe moving the HDD entry location to the nearby upland area to the east would be preferable to the proposed location. 2.7 Danbury, CT Workspace At the request of the USACE and CTDEEP, Algonquin Yes addition proposes to reduce the workspace at about MP 2.7 to avoid a vernal pool. Specifically, Algonquin proposes to reduce the temporary construction workspace consisting of forest land by about 0.025 acre. We concur with the rationale for this workspace adjustment and find it acceptable for inclusion into the proposed Project design. Line 36-A Loop Extension 0.8 to 0.9 Cromwell, CT Pipeline shift As a result of site visits with the USACE, Algonquin is Yes and workspace proposing a pipeline and workspace shift between MPs 0.8 adjustment and 0.9 to minimize direct workspace impacts on the main channel of Dividend Brook in Cromwell, Connecticut. The previously proposed workspace was adjacent and parallel to the southern bank of Dividend Brook. This workspace would be relocated about 60 feet to the south to eliminate in-stream construction and workspace impact on Dividend Brook. The proposed modification would increase slightly the amount of construction workspace and temporary wetland impacts (mostly within the existing right-of-way) by 0.13 and 0.14 acre, respectively; however, it would completely avoid direct in-stream impacts on the main channel of Dividend Brook. Because of these advantages, we believe it would be preferable to the previously proposed route and workspace, and, therefore, we concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate this route and workspace adjustment into the proposed route and Project design. 1.3 to 1.4 Cromwell, CT Pipeline shift The USACE suggested that the route parallel with Dividend Yes and workspace Brook (Bl3-CLR-S4) be relocated either south of the 30-inchadjustment diameter pipeline or along the north side of Meadow Road. As a result of site visits with the USACE and in response to a landowner request, Algonquin is proposing a pipeline shift and  3-47 TABLE 3.5.3-1 (cont’d) Minor Pipeline Shifts, Workspace Adjustments, and Design Modifications Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS  Incorporated Segment/ Municipality, Type of Into Project Milepost(s) State Modification Description and Evaluation Design  workspace adjustment between MPs 1.3 and1.4 to avoid multiple crossings of Dividend Brook in Cromwell, Connecticut. The proposed pipeline and corresponding workspace adjustment would relocate the pipeline about 60 feet to the south of its previously proposed location. This shift would eliminate four separate crossings of Dividend Brook and the associated in-stream construction and workspace impacts that would result from these crossings. The pipeline shift and corresponding workspace adjustment would also minimize impact on a residence located north of Dividend Brook. The proposed modifications would increase the overall workspace needed by 0.5 acre and the temporary wetland impacts (mostly within the existing right-of-way) by 0.35 acre, but these effects would be more than offset by the reduction in impacts on Dividend Brook. For these reasons, we believe the proposed pipeline shift and workspace adjustment would be preferable to the previously proposed alignment and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate this pipeline shift and workspace adjustment into the proposed route and Project design. E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay 2.0 to 3.3 Lebanon, CT Pipeline shift The USACE suggested that the pipeline route between No MPs 2.0 and 3.3 be rerouted to the south of Susquetonscut Brook to minimize wetland and waterway impacts and avoid two crossings of tributaries to Susquetonscut Brook (A13ELR-W2 A13-ELR-W6, VP6, VP6A, A13-ELR-W7, VP7, and A13-ELR-W8). Algonquin does not propose to implement a variation that would avoid wetland A13-ELR-W2. However, as discussed below, Algonquin is proposing a workspace adjustment between MPs 2.7 and 2.8 to minimize direct impacts on the main channel of Susquetonscut Brook. 2.7 to 2.8 Lebanon, CT Workspace As a result of site visits with the USACE, Algonquin is Yes adjustment proposing a workspace adjustment between MPs 2.7 and 2.8 to minimize direct impacts on the main channel of Susquetonscut Brook in Lebanon, Connecticut. The previously proposed workspace was located within and adjacent to the southern bank of Susquetonscut Brook. Algonquin plans to reduce the width of the workspace north of the proposed alignment from 50 to 25 feet to eliminate direct workspace impact on Susquetonscut Brook. To offset for the loss of the workspace on the north side, Algonquin would expand the workspace on the south side of the right-of-way by an equal amount (i.e., from 25 to 50 feet). Algonquin also proposes to utilize an additional 25-by 200-foot ATWS that would be located in an upland area to facilitate construction through an adjacent wetland (i.e., wetland A13-ELR-W6). The proposed adjustments would increase the total amount of workspace required by 0.1 acre, but would avoid impacts on Susquetonscut Brook, reduce the clearing of forest land, and decrease the impact on wetlands by 0.1 acre and forested wetlands by 0.3 acre. For these reasons, we believe the proposed workspace adjustments would be preferable to the previously proposed workspaces and concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate these adjustments into the proposed Project design. 4.0 to 4.3 Franklin, CT Pipeline shift The USACE indicated that there appears to be an opportunity No to avoid and minimize impact on the wetland system between MPs 4.0 and 4.3 by relocating the pipeline route to the south (B13-ELR-W16). Any deviation to the south would reduce wetland impact, but would create a new right-of-way corridor  3-48 TABLE 3.5.3-1 (cont’d) Minor Pipeline Shifts, Workspace Adjustments, and Design Modifications Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS  Incorporated Segment/ Municipality, Type of Into Project Milepost(s) State Modification Description and Evaluation Design  and would increase the area of disturbance and forest clearing. Additionally, the area to the south of the proposed route is side-sloped and would require substantial cut and fill and blasting to create a level work surface to install the pipeline. This would further increase the area of impact and the challenge to restoring the right-of-way. For these reasons, we believe the proposed route would be preferable in this area. 6.7 Franklin, CT Eliminating The USACE suggested that either TAR 6.7 be eliminated or No access road relocated to avoid a vernal pool. The area encompassing the road is currently under development as a golf course and residential community and the area where the access road would be located is already cleared. As a result, no tree clearing or only minor grading would be required for its use. Additionally, Algonquin would implement erosion controls to ensure the vernal pool is not impacted. For these reasons, we believe the use of the proposed TAR is appropriate. 6.9 Franklin, CT Workspace At the request of the USACE, Algonquin is proposing to Yes adjustment reduce the workspace at MP 6.9 to avoid a wetland (i.e., wetland A13-ELR-W13) that contains an identified vernal pool. Algonquin would reduce the size of temporary construction workspace, which is forested, by about 0.03 acre. Because the workspace adjustment would avoid a wetland, we believe that it would be preferable to the previously proposed workspace, and concur with Algonquin’s incorporation of it into the proposed Project design. 7.1 Franklin, CT Workspace At the request of the USACE, Algonquin is proposing to Yes adjustment reduce the previously proposed temporary workspace at MP 7.1 to avoid a wetland (i.e., wetland B13-ELR-W23). Algonquin proposes to reduce the size of the temporary construction workspace, which is forested, by about 0.02 acre. Because the workspace adjustment would avoid a wetland, we believe that it would be preferable to the previously proposed workspace, and concur with Algonquin’s incorporation of it into the proposed Project design. 8.5 to 8.6 Norwich, CT Pipeline shift Algonquin proposes to shift the pipeline alignment between Yes MPs 8.5 and 8.6 in Norwich Connecticut near two large box culverts on Wisconsin Avenue. These culverts, which occupy about a 7-square-foot area, were installed as part of a road improvement project to route Elisha Brook under the improved roadway. Algonquin’s existing 10-inch-diameter pipeline is to the south and avoids the culverts. Algonquin has determined that there is adequate space between the openings of the culverts and the existing pipeline to install and operate the proposed 16-inch-diameter pipe. This route adjustment would increase slightly the amount of temporary workspace required (by 0.08 acre) and the forest land and open land impacts by 0.02 acre and 0.06 acre respectively, but would minimize disturbance to the stream bed and provide a suitable location for the equipment to execute a dam-and-pump dry crossing technique. We believe the proposed route adjustment would be preferable to the previously proposed route, and concur with Algonquin’s incorporation of it into the proposed route.  3-49 TABLE 3.5.3-1 (cont’d) Minor Pipeline Shifts, Workspace Adjustments, and Design Modifications Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS  Incorporated Segment/ Municipality, Type of Into Project Milepost(s) State Modification Description and Evaluation Design  West Roxbury Lateral 0.0 to 4.2 Westwood, Permanent Along the West Roxbury Lateral route, the majority of the Yes Dedham, West right-of-way pipeline would be constructed within roadways by permit and, Roxbury, MA width reduction; thus, would not require any permanent easement for 50 to 30 feet operations of the pipeline. In the remaining locations, Algonquin would acquire permanent easement rights from the property owners. As previously proposed, Algonquin reflected a 50-foot-wide permanent easement on its filed alignment sheets. For the proposed 16-inch-diameter pipeline, Algonquin has determined that it would only seek to acquire a 30-foot-wide permanent easement. This change would reduce the amount of permanent right-of-way required for the Project, which we believe would be preferable and, therefore, we agree with its incorporation into the proposed Project design. 0.3 to 0.4 Westwood, MA Pipeline shift During survey activities on the Meditech property in Yes Westwood, Algonquin identified the presence of a drainage outfall between MPs 0.3 and 0.4. To avoid this outfall, Algonquin is proposing to shift the centerline of the pipeline about 10 feet to the south of the previously proposed pipeline alignment. Algonquin is not proposing any change to the construction workspace limits, just the location of the pipeline. Because this pipeline shift avoids existing underground utilities and there are no changes in the environmental impacts as a result of this shift, we concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate this pipeline shift into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. 1.1 Dedham, MA Workspace To facilitate access for emergency vehicles during Yes addition construction as may be necessary, Algonquin proposes to use 0.04 acre of ATWS on the Fox TV property at MP 1.1 in Dedham. This ATWS would be located adjacent to Fox Drive within an existing parking lot, which is an industrial/commercial land use area. We concur with the rationale for this ATWS and find it acceptable for inclusion into the proposed Project design. 1.1 to 2.4 Dedham, MA Pipeline shift in Algonquin identified the MassDOT pipeline shift to address Yes Providence potential traffic impacts, minimize utility crossings, and Highway eliminate direct impacts on the driveways along Providence Highway, which include two entrances off of Providence Highway into Legacy Place, and support a number of businesses. Shifting the pipeline location along Providence Highway, would also enable Algonquin to reduce the amount of temporary construction workspace required by about 2.5 acres. By staying entirely within Providence Highway, the pipeline shift would also enable Algonquin to eliminate the section of the previously proposed route and construction workspace that extended away from Providence Highway at MP 1.4 and crossed Legacy Boulevard and McNeil Way. To further reduce impacts, Algonquin would complete the installation of the pipeline within Providence Highway at night between 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. According to Algonquin, the District Director for MassDOT District 6 and his senior staff preferred the proposed pipeline shift because it would lessen the overall impact on traffic flow along Providence Highway while also minimizing utility crossings. Algonquin says that both Legacy Place and National Amusements have also acknowledged that the proposed shift in alignment would be preferable to the previously proposed route because it reduces the potential impacts on Legacy Place. Based on the  3-50 TABLE 3.5.3-1 (cont’d) Minor Pipeline Shifts, Workspace Adjustments, and Design Modifications Evaluated After Issuance of the Draft EIS  Incorporated Segment/ Municipality, Type of Into Project Milepost(s) State Modification Description and Evaluation Design  advantages of minimizing impacts on access to Legacy Place, we agree that the MassDOT Pipeline Shift would be preferable and should be incorporated into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. 2.6 Dedham, MA Workspace To facilitate staging of equipment and materials needed for Yes addition construction of the West Roxbury Lateral, Algonquin proposes to add 0.5 acre of additional temporary workspace on private property at MP 2.6 in Dedham. This additional workspace would be located at the intersection of East Street and High Street. The property, which could be classified as industrial/commercial land, is current vacant and does not contain any structures. We concur with the rationale for this ATWS and find it acceptable for inclusion into the proposed Project design. 4.1 to 4.3 West Roxbury, Pipeline shift in During survey activities along Grove Street in West Roxbury, Yes MA Grove Street Algonquin identified the presence of a combined sewer line between MPs 4.1 and 4.3. To avoid this feature, Algonquin is proposing to shift the centerline of the pipeline about 5 feet to the north of the previously proposed pipeline alignment. Algonquin is not proposing any change to the construction workspace limits, just the location of the pipeline. Because this pipeline shift avoids existing underground combined sewer line and there are no changes in the environmental impacts as a result of this shift, we concur with Algonquin’s proposal to incorporate this pipeline shift into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route. 4.4 to 5.0 West Roxbury, Pipeline shift in As a result of further consultation with National Grid, Yes MA Centre Street Algonquin has also agreed to shift the pipeline alignment within Centre Street from the intersection of Grove and Centre Streets to the vicinity of the relocated interconnection point with National Grid in order to minimize further the overall impacts on Centre Street. Currently, National Grid is installing a new 12-inch-diameter plastic pipeline within Centre Street in West Roxbury between about MPs 4.4 and 5.0. When this work is completed over the next several weeks, National Grid would abandon its existing 6-inch-diameter cast iron pipeline in place. As a result, National Grid would have two abandoned pipelines in Centre Street, a 6-inch-diameter cast iron pipeline and a 12-inch-diameter steel pipeline. Algonquin has coordinated with National Grid and has agreed to install the proposed 24-inch-diameter pipeline in the location of the abandoned 12-inch-diameter steel pipeline, thereby utilizing the same trench. By utilizing that existing trench, Algonquin would have greater certainty concerning its ability to avoid existing utilities and thereby minimize the overall construction-related impacts on Centre Street. No change in the filed construction workspace is required to accommodate this pipeline alignment shift. Because of the advantages of this pipeline shift, we agree with its incorporation into the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline route.  As discussed in other sections of the EIS, Algonquin has prepared an HDD Contingency Plan that identifies steps to be taken to minimize impacts if there is an inadvertent return of drilling fluid in or near the river. If such an inadvertent return were to occur, the impacts would still be less than an open-cut crossing. If for some reason the HDD effort should fail at the proposed location, Algonquin would be required to identify a new locationfor the crossing or new methodology, and request approval for the new location or methodology with all applicable agencies.  3-51 3.5.4.2 Susquetonscut Brook In its comments on the draft EIS, the USACE indicated that impacts on the Susquetonscut Brook (B13-ELR-S5B) at MP 5.8 on the E-1 SystemLateral Take-up and Relay could be avoided by conducting HDD installation at this location. Algonquin is currently conducting geotechnical surveys to determine the feasibility of an HDD across the brook and New England Central Railroad. We have concluded that the current proposed dry crossing method would not result in any significant impacts (see the analysis in sections 4.3.2 and 4.6.2). However, if an HDD proves feasible, impacts on the waterbody would be further reduced. Upon completion of the geotechnical surveys, and if they demonstrate that an HDD is feasible, Algonquin would be required to request approval for the new methodology with all applicable agencies.  3.5.4.3 Mother Brook In its comments on the draft EIS, the USACE requested that Algonquin consider the feasibility of completing the crossing of Mother Brook (B13-WRL-S3) at MP 3.1 on the West Roxbury Lateral using the HDD method. As discussed in more detail above, Algonquin has determined that there is sufficient space above the box culvert that conveys Mother Brook under Washington Street to install the pipeline above the box culvert. Algonquin has proposed a variation that would relocate the pipeline crossing to this area and would avoid any disturbance to the brook (see section 3.5.2.2). 3.5.4.4 Falls Brook In its comments on the draft EIS, the USACE requested that Algonquin evaluate the use of the HDD method to avoid impacts on Falls Brook around MP 0.8 on the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension. Algonquin evaluated the potential to use the HDD crossing method to cross Falls Brook and determined it would be technically feasible. However, Algonquin does not believe that an HDD is warranted because the proposed dam-and-pump method (which is a dry crossing method) would have minimal impact on the brook. Using the dam-and-pump method, Algonquin estimates it can complete the crossing in 24 to 48 hours. In contrast, an HDD crossing would take 2 to 3 months and would require an equipment move-around, which would prolong construction and delay the restoration of the right-of-way. The USACE agrees that an HDD crossing is not warranted and that the proposed dam-and-pump method would have minimal impact on the brook.  We also agree. 3.5.4.5 WetlandBI3-CLR-W2 The USACE commented that an HDD appears feasible in the area of wetland B13-CLR-W2 between about MPs 0.7 and 0.9 of the Line-36A Loop Extension to avoid new wetland impacts. Alternatively, wetland impacts could be avoided or reduced by adopting a new route to the south of the existing 30-inch-diameter pipeline. Algonquin determined that an HDD would be technically feasible in this area but has concerns about the potential for inadvertent returns of drilling fluids to impact nearby water wells and, given the nature of the impact on the wetland and Algonquin’s plan to mitigate the impacts through implementation of its E&SCP, Algonquin does not believe an HDD is warranted.  However, as discussed in section 3.5.3, Algonquin is proposing to shift the pipeline alignment and workspace about 60 feet to the south between MPs 0.8 and 0.9, which would eliminate in-stream construction and workspace impacts on Dividend Brook. The USACE agrees that this would sufficiently minimize impacts and we also agree. 3-52 3.6  ABOVEGROUND FACILITY SITE ALTERNATIVES  3.6.1  Compressor and M&R Station Modifications  Algonquin proposes to modify six existing compressor stations and 24 existing M&R stations  along its mainline system in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. The modifications at the compressor stations would occur within the existing sites; the modifications at the meter stations would occur within or directly adjacent to the existing sites. Because the proposed modifications would occur at existing facilities along Algonquin’s mainline system, no alternative sites were identified or evaluated. See section 3.4 above for discussions regarding facility design and siting considerations for the Project. 3.6.2 New M&R Stations Algonquin proposes to construct three new M&R stations as part of the Project, one in Connecticut and two in Massachusetts. Information on site alternatives for each of these facilities is provided below. 3.6.2.1 Oakland Heights M&R Station Algonquin proposes to construct the Oakland Heights M&R facility in the City of Norwich, New London County, Connecticut to deliver natural gas to NPU. The proposed station site is located adjacent to Algonquin’s existing E-3 Lateral System along Oakland Heights Road (see figure 3.6.2-1). The site would allow NPU to provide natural gas service to an adjacent trailer park community currently serviced by propane, and provide an alternate feed to its distribution system in the area. The proximity of the site to Algonquin’s existing lateral and the trailer park community would minimize the required length of the interconnecting pipeline needed by NPU to provide new delivery service to the trailer park community.  Algonquin would maintain a 50-foot-wide forested buffer between the proposed facility and the trailer park as a visual screen from nearby houses.  No impacts on wetlands would result from construction at the proposed site.  We evaluated two alternative sites (A and B) upstream of the proposed site for the Oakland Heights M&R Station (see figure 3.6.2-1). Alternative sites downstream of the proposed site were not considered because of flow dynamics on the system: a new site downstream of the trailer park community would require an upgrade of the existingE-3 Lateral from 4-inch-diameter to 12-inch-diameter pipeline to maintain the required pressure profile on the lateral. Alternative Site A is located in a wooded lot just south of Algonquin’s existing E-3 Lateral and about 0.2 mile west of the proposed station site. The primary advantage of this site, like the proposed site, is its proximity to the existing E-3 Lateral. However, this site would require longer interconnecting pipeline to provide delivery service to the trailer park community. The interconnecting pipeline would need to crossthe existing E-3 Lateral as well as a steep draw and a forested wetland. Alternative Site B is located in a wooded lot north of the existing E-3 Lateral and west of the trailer park community, about 0.1 mile west of the proposed station site. The primary advantage of Alternative Site B is its proximity to both the existing lateral and the trailer park community, which would limit the length of the required interconnecting pipeline. The primary disadvantage is that the site is located on a steep slope adjacent to a waterbody and nearby wetlands. Based on the above discussion, the proposed site is strategically situated to interconnect with NPU’s system for delivery service to the trailer park community. Use of the proposed site would avoid impacts on wetlands and eliminate the need to construct across or within steep terrain.  Moreover, we note that Algonquin has stated that representatives of the City of Norwich are opposed to the alternative locations. For all these reasons, the alternative sites would not be preferable to or provide a significant environmental advantage over the proposed site. 3-53 Figure 3.6.2-1AIM Project Oakland Heights Meter Station Alternative Sites 3.6.2.2 AssonetM&R Station Algonquin proposes to construct the new Assonet M&R Station in the Town of Freetown, Bristol County, Massachusetts to deliver natural gas to NSTAR. The new M&R facility would be built adjacent to Algonquin’s existing North Fall River M&R Station, west of South Main Street in Freetown. NSTAR is currently supplied natural gas from the North Fall River M&R Station pursuant to an agreement with Fall River. However, NSTAR now has enough gas deliveries in its service area to warrant a new gate station directly with Algonquin. NSTAR requested that the new meter station be sited as close as possible to the North Fall River M&R Station to minimize the amount of new distribution pipeline that would need to beinstalled. Algonquin sited the proposed M&R facility adjacent to an existing aboveground facility as well as NSTAR’s existing distribution system. The proposed site for the new meter station is located in an existing Algonquin easement that has been modified to include the new facility. No significant environmental features, such as wetlands or waterbodies, would be affected by construction at the proposed site.  As a result, we have notidentified anyspecific alternative sitesfor the proposed facility. The proposed Assonet M&R Station has been strategically sited to leverage existing transmission and distribution systems and minimize impacts on the environment. Any alternative site along or in the vicinity of Algonquin’s system in Bristol County, Massachusetts would require construction of aboveground facilities away from existing, aboveground, pipeline infrastructure. An alternative site additionally would require construction of a longer distribution pipeline by NSTAR, which would result in greater environmental impactthan the proposed action.  3.6.2.3 West Roxbury M&RStation Algonquin proposes to construct the West Roxbury M&R Station at MP 4.2 of the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline to deliver natural gas to Boston Gas (see figure 3.6.2-1). The proposed site for the new facility is located at the intersection of Centre Street and Grove Street on an undeveloped, partially forested tract adjacent to an active quarry operation. No wetlands, waterbodies, or businesses would be affected by construction of the M&R facility at this site.  Numerous commentors requested evaluation of an alternative site for the West Roxbury M&R station due to concerns about blasting impacts and general safety impacts with the proposed location. We evaluated a potential alternative site for the M&R Station at the point where the West Roxbury Lateral Alternative Route intersects the proposed route (i.e., at about MP 5.0 of the proposed route). The alternative site is located on residential land at the intersection of Centre Street and Alaric Street. Use of the site would require the purchase and demolition of an existing residence to provide sufficient space for the M&R facility. Construction at this site would also result in significant traffic impacts along Centre and Alaric Streets due to the limited space available for construction. Further, Algonquin provided an engineering analysis by a third-party geotechnical consultant that evaluated the potential impacts of blasting in the quarry on the West Roxbury Lateral and West Roxbury M&R Station (see more description of the analysis in section 4.1.4 of the EIS). This evaluation concluded that ground vibrations from blasting at the quarry would not be disruptive or damaging to the M&R station or the pipeline. We agree with the findings of this evaluation. For these reasons, we do not consider the alternative site technically feasible or environmental preferable to the proposed site. No other viable alternative sites were identified for the proposed West Roxbury M&R Station. 3-55 4.0 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS The environmental consequences of constructing and operating the proposed AIM Project would vary in duration and significance.  Fourlevels of impact duration were considered:  temporary, shortterm, long term, and permanent. Temporary impacts generally occur during construction with the resource returning to preconstruction condition almost immediately afterward. Short-term impacts could continue for up to 3 years following construction.  Impacts were considered long term if the resource would require more than 3 years to recover. A permanent impact could occur as a result of any activity that modified a resource to the extent that it would not return to preconstruction conditions during the life of the project, such as the construction of an aboveground facility.  We considered an impact to be significant if it would resultin a substantial adverse change in the physical environment. In this section, we discuss the affected environment, general construction and operational impact, and proposed mitigation for each resource. Algonquin, as part of its proposal, agreed to implement certain measures to reduce impacts. We evaluated Algonquin’s proposed mitigation measures to determine whether additional measures are necessary to reduce impacts. These additional measures appear as bulleted, boldfaced paragraphs in the text.  We will recommend that these measures be included as specific conditions to any authorization thatthe Commission may issue Algonquin. Conclusions in this EIS are based on our analysis of the environmental impacts and the following assumptions:  Algonquin would comply with all laws and regulations;  the proposed facilities would be constructed as described in section 2.0 of this document; and  Algonquin would implement the mitigation measures included in its application and supplementalfilings to FERC. 4.1 GEOLOGY 4.1.1 Geologic Setting The proposed Project is located in the New England Upland and Seaboard Lowland sections of the New England physiographic province. Pipeline and aboveground facilities in New York and Connecticut, as well as the Burrillville Compressor Station in Rhode Island, would be located in the New England Upland section, which is characterized by rolling hills with streams located in rounded and well-graded valleys. Relief ranges from 100 to 1,000 feet in the more mountainous regions, including the Ramapo Mountains in New York, and the Bolton and Mohegan ranges in Connecticut(USGS, 1999). The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment begins in the Ramapo Mountains of southeastern New York State in the Mahwah River Valley. The pipeline route starts along gentle slopes and continues to traverse along hills of moderate relief (less than 200 feet) and moderate slope. Elevations along this pipeline segment range from approximately 200 feet above mean sea level (msl) near Cedar Pond Brook to about 660 feetabove msl on a hill near Rider Hill. From Algonquin’s existing Stony Point Compressor Station, the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment extends about 12.3 miles to the Town of Yorktown, traversingareas of moderate to steep relief. The pipeline segment crosses Bensons Point and Buckberg Mountain (about 450 feet of relief) before descending to the western shore of the Hudson River. After crossing the Hudson River, the 4-1 pipeline segment continues eastward along gentle to moderate slopes, passing the Peekskill M&R Station and the Cortlandt M&R Station. Elevations across the segment range from sea level at the Hudson River to about 700 feetabove msl on Buckberg Mountain. From Algonquin’s existing Southeast Compressor Station, the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment traverses rolling hills with moderate slope. The pipeline segment continues along gentle slopes in the area of West Danbury, Connecticut and steep slopes on the east side of Interstate 84. The pipeline segment then crosses gentle to moderate slopes on the north side of a series of drumlins with moderate to steep slopes. Elevations across the segment range from about 300 feet above msl near Interstate 84 to about 720 feet above msl east of Sawmill Road. The E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment starts by crossing Owunnegunset Hill over moderate to steep slopes. The pipeline segment continues across moderate to gentle side slopes along Susquetonscut Brook before crossing moderate to steep slopes over Meeting House Hill and Misery Hill (about 300 feetofrelief).  It then rises about350 feet up Turkey Hill and traversesmoderate slopes before reaching its terminus. Elevations across the segment range from about 220 feet above msl at the Central Vermont Railroad crossing to about 550 feetabove msl on Owunnegunset Hill. The Line 36-A Loop Extension segment crosses about 2.0 miles of flat to gently sloping land west of the Connecticut River. Elevations range from about 20 feet above msl at the Connecticut River to approximately 150 feet above msl near the existing Cromwell Compressor Station. The E-1 System Lateral Loop segment begins at Algonquin’s existing Montville M&R Station in a flat area on the southwestern side of Stony Brook. The pipeline segment crosses moderately sloping terrain with a steeper section on the south side of Cochegan Hill. Elevations along this segment range from about 20 feet above msl near the existing Montville M&R Station to about 320 feet above msl on top of Cochegan Hill. The proposed facilities in Massachusetts would be located in the Seaboard Lowland section of the New England province. The section is lower in elevation and typically less hilly than the New England Upland section and has many small rivers and streams flowing along a land surface that slopes towards the ocean. The area was inundated by the ocean and large proglacial lakes during the last glacial retreat. Local relief is typically less than 200 feet in most places within this section (USGS, 1999). The West Roxbury Lateral traverses gently sloping land in a highly developed area along existing roadways.  Elevations along this segment range between about 15 to 45 feet above msl. Algonquin’s existing and new aboveground facilities are primarily located in areas with gentle to moderate slopes.  Exceptions to this type of topography include:  Bensons Point near the Stony Point Compressor Station and M&R Station;  drumlins near the Southeast Compressor Station and West Danbury M&R Station;  Woodruff Hill near the Oxford Compressor Station;  a hill near Hope River at the Chaplin Compressor Station; and  hills nearthe Oakland Heights, Southbury, and Middletown M&R Stations. Construction and operation of the Project facilities would not materially alter existing geologic conditions in the area. In addition, the overall effect of the Project on topography would be minor. The primary effects would be limited to construction activities and would include temporary disturbance to slopes within the right-of-way resulting from grading and trenching operations. Algonquin would minimize the impacts by returning contours to preconstruction conditions to the maximum extent practicable. This may not be the case at the aboveground facilities, where grading and filling may be required to create a safe and stable land surfaceto supportthe facility.   4-2 4.1.2 Surficial Geology The landscape in the area of the proposed Project consists primarily of glacial till with intermittent bedrock outcrops, sand and gravel deposits, and fine-grained lacustrine and swamp sediment deposits. A review of surficial geology maps provided information regarding the nature of deposits expected in the Project area. Table 4.1.2-1 summarizes surficial geology in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline facilities. The aboveground facilities in New York and Rhode Island are all located on till. The aboveground facilities in Connecticut are located on a variety of surficial geologic surfaces including till, sand and gravel, sand, and alluvium.  The aboveground facilities in Massachusetts are located on a variety of surficial geologic surfaces including till or bedrock, sand and gravel, fine-grained deposits, and coarse glacial stratified deposits. The overall effect of the Project on surface geology would be minor. The effects would mostly be limited to construction activities and would include temporary disturbance to surficial deposits within the right-of-way resulting from grading and trenching operations. Algonquin would minimize the impacts on surface geology by returning contours to preconstruction conditions to the maximum extent practicable immediately after construction. This may not be the case at the aboveground facilities, where grading and filling may be required to create a safe and stable land surfaceto support the facility. 4.1.3 Bedrock Geology Bedrock geology of the AIM Project area is dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks with limited amounts of carbonate rock. A review of bedrock geology maps provided information regarding the nature of units expected in the Project area. Tables L-1 and L-2 in appendix L summarize bedrock geology in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline and aboveground facilities, respectively.  The effect on bedrock geology would be minor. The primary effects would be associated with areas of shallow bedrock where rock would need to be removed during the construction of pipeline facilities. See section 4.1.6 for more information on areas of shallow bedrock and mitigation measures that would be taken during rock removal. 4.1.4 Mineral Resources Mineral resources in the Project area consist mainly of commercial sand and gravel, crushed stone, and a gypsum quarry. Sands and gravels are commercially extracted from widely distributed glacial outwash deposits at locations in the general area of the Project. Upon review of the USGS topographic maps and recent aerial photography, three extraction facilities were found to be located in close proximity to the Project as described below. An unnamed sand and gravel operation is located less than 20 feet from the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay right-of-way in Lebanon, Connecticut at MP 3.1 (USGS, 2013b). This portion of the Project is being constructed within the existing right-of-way, which already precludes the expansion of the sand and gravel operation in direction of the proposed pipeline. As a result, the Project would not affectoperations nor would operations impact the Project. 4-3 TABLE 4.1.2-1 Surficial Geology of the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  Length Facility/Surficial Geology (miles) Description  Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay Till 3.3 A variable texture, usually poorly sorted diamict deposited beneath glacier ice.

Many comments were received regarding the potential effect, if any, that the blasting operations at the West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry would have on the proposed pipeline or West Roxbury M&R Station. Blasting at the Quarry is performed under a permit issued by the City of Boston Fire Department, which specifies a limit on the allowable blast-induced vibration magnitude (e.g., amplitude or peak particle velocity)atany abuttingpropertyof1.0 inchpersecond. Algonquin discussed with the owners of the quarry the anticipated schedule and logistics associated with constructing the West Roxbury Lateral and M&R station, as well as the long-term operations of these facilities. No direct conflicts were identified that would inhibit the construction of the Project or the continued day-to-day operation of the quarry. Algonquin also retained the services of a local third-party geotechnical consultant (GeoEnvironmental, Inc. [GZA]) to analyze the potential effects on the proposed pipeline and M&R station from the blasting operations at the quarry, including ground vibrations, air vibrations, hydrogeologic disturbance, and projectiles (e.g., flying rock). The future extent of quarry expansion is not known at this time (GZA, 2014); however, as discussed below, a hypothetical separation was assumed in GZA’s analysis. Since the proposed pipeline is closer to the West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry than the M&R station, the focus of the analysis performed by GZA (2014) was directed toward the potential for ground vibrations to impact the pipeline. The pipeline would be constructed approximately 5 feet below grade, so the discussion of fly rock was limited to the potential effects on the aboveground structures proposed for the West Roxbury M&R Station. Algonquin states that the pipeline would consist of externally coated high strength steel with welded connections. The pipeline would be installed within an excavation and enveloped in an engineered backfill consisting of either compacted sand or flowable fill (a low density concrete sand mixture) extending a minimum of 8 inches below the pipe, a minimum of 6inches on bothsidesofthe pipe,andaminimumof6 inchesoverthe pipeline. Thisengineeredbackfill is designed to support the pipe evenly while maintaining the integrity of the pipe’s protective coating. The flowable fill layer would also provide a warning barrier to protect the pipe from third-party contractors. GZA’s analysis assumed a hypothetical aggressive set of circumstances where the quarry might extend its operation to within 5 feet of Grove Street. The GZA report determined that the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline would be subject to vibrations well within pipeline design, with a minimum factor of safety of 10 to 20 times for the proposed pipeline (GZA, 2014). Therefore, further blasting at 4-5 the quarrywould notdamage the proposedpipeline. In addition, itshouldbe noted that existingpipelines currently operate in Grove Street between the quarry and the proposed AIM Project facilities. The existing pipelines consist of two water pipelines and a natural gas distribution pipeline. The closest of these three existing utilities to the quarry is a 12-inch-diameter water pipeline, which ranges in distance between approximately 10 and 20 feet from the quarry property line. We have found no evidence that these existing pipelines have been impacted by blasting at the quarry. The GZA report also concluded that the components of the M&R station would not be any more sensitive to vibration disturbance or damage than the underground pipeline and that ground vibrations from blasting at the quarry would not be disruptive or damaging to the M&R station. The M&R station buildings would be engineered pre-fabricated pre-cast concrete structures designed for industrial use and would not contain large exterior glass windows, or finishes susceptible to cracking. The in-line tool receivers/launchers and the heaters would be above-grade, steel construction, and are not considered especially sensitive to vibrations. The M&R station facilities would all be bolted onto foundations and well supported. Fly rock from blasting operations at the quarry was reported to have landed on property located on Centre Lane to the north of the quarry in 2009. As a result, the quarry changed its blasting operations to reduce the potential for fly rock, and since incorporating these changes, fly rock has not been reported from abutting landowners. GZA’s report states that, based on the location of the proposed M&R station relative to the Quarry, the probability of a projectile stemming from a blast operation at the Quarry (i.e., fly-rock) landing on the M&R station site is highly unlikely, potentially in the range of 10,000,000 to 1, with the probability of such a rock inflicting a direct strike on a segment of the limited amount of exposed pipe much lower still. Based on its analysis, the GZA report concludes, and we concur, that fly rock does not pose a concern for interruption of service or the release of natural gas at the M&R station (GZA, 2014).  Hydrogeologic disturbance (i.e., changes in rock fracture and joint opening size and chemical/sediment content) can change water supply well yield and quality; however, the M&R stationwouldnothaveanon-sitewatersupplywell. Comments were received on the draft EIS about the future plans of the quarry and what impact new Massachusetts legislation has on the quarry relative to the AIM Project (Massachusetts Acts of 2014, Chapter 149, Section 7). Section 4.13 has been revised to include a discussion on the future plans of the quarry. Regarding the new legislation, it indicates that any blasting activity associated with a mined product should not be conducted within 500 feet of a natural gas pipeline or M&R station without written approval by the department of public utilities. As indicated above, there is already an existing natural gas pipeline (distribution line) closer to the quarry than the proposed AIM Project facilities. Therefore, any conflict with quarry operations associated with this new legislation already exists. The AIM Project would not create any new conflict thatthe quarry doesnot already have to address. Although not a mining resource, the Buchanan Gypsum Plant is located in the Village of Buchanan, New York, about 0.25 mile northwest of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment on the eastern shore of the Hudson River at MP 4.5 (USGS, 2013a). The plant is owned and operated by Lafarge Corporation. According to the company’s website, the drywall produced at the Buchanan Gypsum Plant is made from 99 percent recycled material and uses synthetic gypsum. The Project is not expected to affect the drywall plant norare plant operations expected to impactthe Project. 4-6 4.1.5 Geologic Hazards Geologic hazards are natural, physical conditions that can result in damage to land and structures or injury to people. Such hazards typically include seismicity (e.g., earthquakes, surface faults, soil liquefaction), landslides, flash flooding, and ground subsidence. Conditions necessary for the development of other geologic hazards, including avalanches and volcanism are not present in the Project area. In general, the potential for geologic hazards to significantly affect construction or operation of the proposed Project facilities is low. 4.1.5.1 Seismicity andFaults The majority of significant earthquakes around the world are associated with tectonic subduction zones, where one crustal plate is overriding another (e.g., the Japanese islands), where tectonic plates are sliding past each other (such as California), or where tectonic plates are converging (e.g., the Indian Sub-Continent). Unlike these highly active tectonic regions, the east coast of the United States is a passive tectonic plate boundary located on the “trailing edge” of the North American continental plate, which is relatively seismically quiet. Earthquakes, however, do occur in the Project area, largely due to trailing edge tectonics and residual stress released from past orogenic (mountain-building) events.  The shaking during an earthquake can be expressed in terms of the acceleration due to gravity (g). The Project would not be located in a region that represents a serious seismic risk to the proposed facilities. Based on USGS seismic hazard mapping, the seismic riskin the areaof the Project facilitiesin New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts is low.  The greatest seismic risk to Project facilities is encountered around the Haverstraw to Stony Point and Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segments in New York, where the Project is located near the Ramapo Seismic Zone. Seismic risk can be quantified by the motions experienced by the ground surface or structures during a given earthquake, expressed in terms of (g). For reference, peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 10 percent of gravity is generally considered the minimum threshold for damage to older structures or structures not made to resist earthquakes. The following summarizes the seismic risk present along these pipeline segments:  PGA with a 2 percent incidence per 50 years (recurrence interval of 1:2,500 years) ranges from 0.20 to 0.06 g (USGS, 2008a); and  PGA with a 10 percent incidence per 50 years (recurrence interval of 1:475 years) ranges from 0.04 to 0.02 g (USGS, 2008b). Many scoping comments, and comments on the draft EIS, were received regarding faults in the Project area, specifically the Ramapo Fault, which extends from Pennsylvania and New Jersey into southern New York. The Ramapo Fault is part of a system of northeast-striking faults that were active approximately 200 million years ago. The fault system is a remnant of an active extensional tectonic boundary that once existed in the area. The USGS has extensively studied the Ramapo Fault system and the level of seismicity in the region. The USGS’s review of data for evidence of Quaternary (Holocene) fault activity (i.e., within the last 1.6 million years) encompassing the eastern United States indicates that there is no clear association between the fault and small earthquakes that occur in the region. Further, there is insufficient geologic evidence to indicate the existence of a tectonic fault or a Holocene-age slip or deformation associated with the fault(Crone andWheeler, 2000; Wheeler, 2006).  Repeat times along the Ramapo Seismic Zone for events of short-period body-wave magnitude (mbLg) 6 and 7 are about 670 and 3,400 years, respectively (Sykes et al., 2008). This magnitude scale is used in the more tectonically stable part of eastern North America (McCalpin, 2009). The largest known 4-7 event in the region was a mbLg 5.1 earthquake centered northwest of New York City in 1783. There have been a total of three earthquakes greater than 5.0 mbLg in the area. Notably, recent earthquakes in the vicinity of the Project include a mbLg 3.3 earthquake in Wappingers Falls, New York in June 1974 and a mbLg 2.9 event near Peekskill, New York in January 1980 (Jacob et al., 2004). During field investigations conducted by Hatch Mott MacDonald for the Project’s HDD Geotechnical Reports, potential faults were noted.  Hatch Mott MacDonald reports the presence of a high-angle normal fault located at the Hudson River HDD between the Manhattan Formation and hornblende granite to the west of the route. Core boring at the Hudson River HDD also noted a possible fault within bore B-27, located within the Hudson River near the eastern shore. The possible fault was noted at a depth of about 260 feet within dolomitic shale. At this location the HDD alignment places the pipeline at a depth of about 90 feet within overburden material. At the Interstate 84/Still River HDD, a thrust fault was noted by Hatch Mott MacDonald north of Mill Plain Road. Core borings at the Interstate 84/Still River HDD noted decomposed bedrock at multiple bore locations in the same general area as this fault. It was noted that the fault may be the cause of the decomposed bedrock. In addition, bore B-2 indicated a possible fault. This bore was taken just west of Interstate 84. The possible fault was noted at a depth of about 103 feet within schistose gneiss. At this location, the HDD alignment places the pipeline at a depth of about 350 feet within bedrock (Hatch Mott MacDonald, 2014a and 2014b). Many comments were received on the draft EIS related to the safety of the pipeline and potential seismic events. Specific site conditions, including earthquakes, are considered in the design of the pipeline. The recorded magnitude of earthquakes in the Project area is relatively low and the ground vibration would not pose a problem for a modern welded-steel pipeline. Even under much higher ground vibrations, the main risk to pipelines would be where the pipeline is buried along a hillside coupled with saturated unstable soils that could become displaced laterally during an earthquake. O’Rourke and Palmer (1996) performed a review of the seismic performance of gas transmission lines in southern California and concluded that modern electric arc-welded gas pipelines perform well in seismically active areas of the United States. The study included 11 earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.8 or greater. Based on the low seismic risk and occurrence assigned to the Project area, we find the risk of damage to pipeline facilities by earthquakes to be low. Secondary seismic effects triggered by strong ground shaking are often more serious than the shaking itself. The most damaging secondary seismic effect is often soil liquefaction, a physical process in which saturated, non-cohesive soils temporarily lose their strength and liquefy (i.e., behave like a viscous liquid). Areas typically susceptible to liquefaction may include soils that are generally sandy or silty and are typically along rivers, streams, lakes, and shorelines, or in areas with shallow groundwater. Soil liquefaction can result in surface settlement in areas where the ground surface is flat, and soil flow or slope instability in areas where the landscape is sloped. Soil conditions necessary for liquefaction to occur would likely be present in the Project area. However, due to the low potential for strong and prolonged ground shaking associated with a seismic event, we find the potential for soil liquefaction to be low.  In addition, no modern occurrences of soilliquefaction due to earthquake shaking in the Project area have been documented (Brankman and Baise, 2008). 4.1.5.2 Landslides Landslides involve the down-slope movement of earth materials under force of gravity due to natural or man-made causes. The proposed Project facilities would be located in an area considered to have a low incidence of landslides (Radbruch-Hall et al., 1982). In addition, the physiography of the Project area is characterized by bedrock overlain with till-covered uplands; lowlands consisting of glacial 4-8 During construction, Algonquin would implement the measures outlined in its E&SCP to minimize potential risks from landslides and soil erosion. Where slopes are encountered along the pipeline alignment, the upslope side of the construction right-of-way would be cut during grading and used to fill the downslope side of the right-of-way, thereby providing a safe and level surface on which to operate heavy equipment. During grade restoration, the spoil would be placed back in the cut, compacted to restore original contours, and reseeded. Once grade and drainage patterns have been reestablished, permanent erosion controls (e.g., slope breakers) would be installed as needed. These activities would minimize the potential for man-induced landslides and erosion in the Project area. The construction techniques described in section 2.3.1 would also minimize the potential for slope failure and erosion. These techniques include the use of erosion control devices (e.g., silt fences, slope breakers) and other best management practices (BMPs) to stabilize soils. Algonquin’s E&SCP includes field procedures associated with the use of slope breakers, temporary and permanent trench plugs, matting, riprap, and other erosion control measures.  Based on the low landslide incidence potential in the Project area and the mitigation and design features discussed above, we find the potential for landslidesto affect the Projectto be low. 4.1.5.3 Flash Flooding Flash floodinghasthe potential to occur in streams within the Project area, particularly in areas of higher relief and narrower stream valleys in Connecticut; however, no such features are located along the Project route or in proximity to aboveground features. Concerns over flash flooding have increased in recent years due to significant rainfall events associated with tropical storms that have passed close to the Projectarea.  Flooding can also be caused by seasonalvariations in precipitation.  No permanent aboveground facilities are located within 100-year floodplains as reported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The only locations where there are aboveground facilities located near mapped 100-year floodplains are the eastern edge of the Cromwell Compressor Station property and the construction workspace for the Stony Point M&R Station. None of the permanent aboveground facilities associated with the Project would add fill orimpervious surfaces that would impact flood storage. Aboveground facilities located in and near floodplains and pipeline stream crossings would be designed to prevent potential impacts from high-velocity flows, largely by controlling erosion, in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP.  Construction of Project pipelines through 100-year floodplains would not result in the loss of floodplain storage as the pipelines are installed below the ground surface and would not displace flow waters. Measures would be implemented to handle waterbody flow increases during pipeline installation activities such as having additional pumps on stand-by for dam-and-pump crossings or appropriately sizing flumes to handle storm flows for flume crossings. Equipment crossings would be designed to handle higher flow volumes that could be anticipated from storm events and flooding situations. After construction is completed, each crossing would be periodically inspected for signs of erosion and remediated, as necessary. For these reasons, impacts on Project facilities from flash flooding are not expected. 4-9 4.1.5.4 Ground Subsidence Ground subsidence is the local downward movement of surface material with little or no horizontal movement. Ground subsidence can affect pipelines and aboveground facilities by causing a loss of support that may bend or even rupture a pipeline or weaken the foundations of the aboveground facilities. Common causes of ground subsidence include the presence of karst terrain, underground mining, and significant groundwater or fluid withdrawal, associated with oil-producing regions. Karst terrain can form by the long-term action of groundwater or surface water on soluble bedrock (e.g., limestone, dolostone, and gypsum). Two mapped calcareous bedrock deposits would be crossed by the AIM Project: the Balmville Limestone in New York and the Stockbridge Marble in Connecticut. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment crosses the Balmville Limestone from about MPs 3.9 to 4.3. The Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment crosses the Stockbridge Marble at about MP 1.6 and again from about MPs 1.9 to 2.0. We conclude that subsidence due to karst conditions is not anticipated to be a concern for the Project due to the minimal occurrence of calcareous bedrock crossed by the Project, and because no mapped karst features have been identified in these areas (National Cave and Karst Research Institute, 1984). Underground mining poses risks to engineered structures due to the potential for the overlying strata to collapse into the void formed by the extraction of minerals. As discussed above, there are no current or former underground mining activities in the vicinity of the Project (Altamura, 1987; USGS, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c).  Therefore, we find that the Project would not be subjectto hazards associated with underground mines. 4.1.6 Rock Removal andBlasting Algonquin anticipates that some rock removal would be required during construction of the pipeline and compressor station facilities. About 7.2 miles of shallow bedrock in the Project area is characterized as lithic and would likely need to be removed via blasting. Algonquin has prepared a Rock Removal Plan, which we reviewed and found acceptable, to be used at each site where solid rock is encountered as either part of the pipeline trench excavation, the grading to prepare a level linear work area, or the excavation for aboveground facilities (see appendix E). The Rock Removal Plan indicates that an experienced contractor would analyze the rock type, and consider all other contributing factors, including location, surrounding environment, nearby facilities, residences, wells and springs, and/or resources before selecting the suitable rock removal technique. Approval by Algonquin would be required for the selection of all rock removal techniques. All blasting operations would be performed according to strict guidelines designed to control energy release and protect personnel and property in the vicinity of the blast zone. These guidelines would be consistent with all federal, state, and local regulations that apply to controlled-blasting and blast vibration limits in the vicinity of structures and underground utilities. 4.1.7 Geotechnical Investigations for the Proposed HDDs Algonquin proposes to cross the Hudson River along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment and the Still River along the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment using the HDD method. Geotechnical feasibility studies were performed to evaluate subsurface conditions at the proposed HDD sites.  The purpose of the geotechnical investigations was threefold:  to understand if the existing condition would be suitable to usethe HDD method;  to help design each HDD crossing, and  to identify the location of a deep historic river channel that was known to exist further to the north ofthe proposed Hudson River HDD. 4-10 Table 4.1.7-1 summarizes the results of the geotechnical investigations that have been conducted to date foreach of the proposed HDD crossings. The investigations indicate that the Hudson River HDD (including the revised alignment) would be located entirely within the overburden material above the bedrock. The majority of the Interstate 84/Still River HDD would be located in bedrock and would only cross overburden material near the HDD entry and exit holes. As indicated in table 4.1.7-1, the overburden material at the Interstate 84/Still River HDD is up to 140 feet thick. This thickness occurs under the wetland on the east side Interstate 84. The HDD alignment would be at a depth of about 150 feet in this location. For additional information on these crossing and feasibility studies, see section 4.3.2.3. TABLE 4.1.7-1 Summary of Geotechnical Investigations for the HDD Crossings Along the AIM Project  MP Maximum Depth Pipe Below Grade Facility/HDD Diameter Begin End (feet) Description  Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay Hudson River HDD 42-inch 3.0 3.9 160 Overburden material 20 to 65 feet thick consisting of unconsolidated soil, very soft clays, and loose sands, underlain by limestone, dolostone, and schist.

Direct effects on paleontological resources could occur during Project construction by activities such as grading or trenching. Indirect effects on fossil beds could result from erosion caused by slope regarding, vegetation clearing, and/or unauthorized collection. The majority of the bedrock units crossed by the proposed Project are either metamorphic or igneous in origin and do not contain fossils. Sedimentary rocks identified underlying the Project include the Balmville Limestone in New York, the Portland Arkose and New Haven Arkose in Connecticut, and the Roxbury Conglomerate in Massachusetts. The Balmville Limestone contains significant amounts of brachiopod and conodont fossils (Zen, 1983). These fossils are frequently found in Paleozoic strata across New York State and are not considered significant paleontological resources. No significant fossils have been identified in the Roxbury Conglomerate. Paleontological resources along the Connecticut portions of the Project have the potential to be of greater significance than those located elsewhere along the Project. The sedimentary rock units underlying the Connecticut portions of the Project are the Portland Arkose and the New Haven Arkose. Both were deposited during the Mesozoic era, also known as the age of the reptiles. Few remains of 4-11 reptile tracks have been found in the New Haven Arkose, dinosaur bones and reptile tracks have been found in the Portland Arkose, and fossil fishes have been found in black shale beds within the two arkoses. Mesozoic fossils of the Connecticut Valley are typically reptile tracks and other imprints in stone with fewer findings of dinosaur bones. Dinosaur tracks are more prominent in Triassic age strata acrossthe region (Colbert, 1970).  The Portland Arkose underlies the Cromwell Compressor Station and the entire Line-36A Loop Extension, whereas the New Haven Arkose underlies the North Haven M&R Station. Glaciofluvial surficial geological deposits have been mapped at each of these locations that overly the sedimentary bedrock. Proposed activities on each of these portions of the Project would only involve the expansion of existingfacilitiesorthe expansion ofthe existingpipeline withinthe right-of-way. Basedon the presence of a mapped surficial layer and the nature of the work proposed, we find that paleontological resources associated with Mesozoic strata in Connecticut wouldnot be affected by the Project. 4.2  SOILS  4.2.1  Existing Soil Resources  The descriptions and characteristics of soils discussed in this section were compiled from a  variety of data sources including soil surveys and website databases published and maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Soil surveys referenced include those for Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam Counties in New York; Fairfield, New Haven, Hartford, Middlesex, New London, and Windham Counties in Connecticut; Providence County in Rhode Island; and Bristol, Plymouth, Suffolk, Norfolk, and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts. Websites used include the NRCS “Official Series Description” website (USDA, 2010) and the NRCS “Web Soil Survey” website (USDA, 2013c). Soils within the Project area were mapped utilizing the NRCS digital Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), which includes geospatially referenced Geographic Information System (GIS) soil map unit polygons at a scale of 1:24,000 (USDA, 2013d). SSURGO data contain the most detailed level of soil mapping performed by the NRCS, and corresponds with or supersedes the original county soil survey mapping. Soils in the vicinity of the proposed Project are primarily developed in glacial till and other glacial deposits. However, in developed residential areas like some of those crossed by the proposed pipeline segments, soils have typically been disturbed in some manner. These disturbances can include grading to create a level landscape for development, filling in areas that are wet or possess other undesirable soil characteristics, or filling areas to dispose of materials such as dredge spoilor coalash. 4.2.1.1 Pipeline Facilities Soils along the proposed pipeline segments were evaluated to identify prime farmland and major soil characteristics that could affect construction or increase the potential for construction-related soil impacts. The soil characteristics evaluated were erosion potential, prime farmland, hydric soils, compaction-prone soils, shallow bedrock, and soils with poor revegetation potential. Additional soil-related impacts due to construction or operation include disruption of agricultural drainage or irrigation systems.  Table 4.2.1-1 provides a summary of the significant soilcharacteristicsthat would be crossed by the proposed pipeline facilities. Tables 4.2.1-2 and 4.2.1-3 provide summaries, in acres, describing the construction and operation impacts, respectively, on significant soil characteristics associated with the pipeline facilities. Individual soil characteristics and the potential mitigation measures that would be employed by Algonquin are discussed in the sections below. 4-12 TABLE 4.2.1-1 Summary of Soil Characteristics Along the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project (miles)  Right-Highly Erodible Soils with of-Way Prime Compact Shallow Revegetation b d f Pipeline Facility Length a Water WindFarmlandc Hydric ProneBedrocke Concern Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point 3.3 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.6 0.1 0.4 2.8 Take-up and Relay Stony Point to Yorktown Take12.3 0.0 0.7 1.8 1.7 1.0 3.3 7.2 up and Relay Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up 4.5 0.0 0.0 1.9 0.9 0.8 0.4 2.2 and Relay E-1 System Lateral Take-up 9.1 0.7 0.4 3.1 2.0 1.5 1.1 5.5 and Relay Loop Extension Line-36A Loop Extension 2.0 <0.1 0.3 1.3 0.3 0.3 0.0 1.7 E-1 System Lateral Loop 1.3 0.6 0.0 0.1 0.2 <0.1 0.6 0.8 Extension New Pipeline West Roxbury Pipeline Lateral 4.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.2 1.1 Total 37.4 1.3 1.4 8.3 5.7 3.7 7.2 21.3 ____________________ a Several soil types have multiple characteristics.

Source: USDA, 2013a, 2013b  Erosion by Waterand Wind Erosion is a continuing natural process that can be accelerated by human disturbance. Factors such as soil texture, structure, slope, vegetative cover, rainfall intensity, and wind intensity can influence the degree of erosion. Soils most susceptible to erosion by water are typified by bare or sparse vegetative cover, non-cohesive soil particles with low infiltration rates, and moderate to steep slopes. Soils typically more resistant to erosion by water include those that occupy low relief areas, are well vegetated, and have high infiltration capacity and internal permeability. Wind erosion processes are less affected by slope angles than water processes. Wind-induced erosion often occurs on dry soil where vegetative cover is sparse and strong winds are prevalent. The potential for soils in the Project area to be eroded by water was evaluated based on the K factor. The K factor represents a relative quantitative index of the susceptibility of bare soil to particle detachment and transport by water. K factor values are primarily based on soil texture, although organic matter content, structure size class, and permeability are also pertinent factors. The higher the K factor value the more susceptible the soil is to water erosion (Multimedia Environmental Pollutant Assessment System, 2010).  4-14 The potential for soils in the Project area to be eroded by water was determined by averaging K factor values for all soil horizons for each soil type. K factors were obtained from the NRCS Web Soil Survey website (USDA, 2013c). Based on the average K factor, each soil type was grouped into a water erosion class of “Low,” “Moderate,” and “High.” Low values ranged from 0.02 to 0.2, moderate values ranged from0.2to 0.4, and high valuesranged from0.4to 0.7. For map units comprised ofa complex of different soil types, the soil type with the most limiting average K factor was used to categorize the map unitinto a low, medium, or high class. Susceptibility to wind erosion was based on the wind erodibility group (WEG) designation, where available.  WEG is a grouping of soils that have similar surface-soil properties affecting their resistance to soil blowing, including texture, organic matter content, and aggregate stability. WEGs may range from 1 to 8, with 1 being the highest potential for wind erosion, and 8 the lowest (USDA, 2014a). A WEG designation and/or K factor is not available for some of the map units consisting of pavement/developed land, some tidal marsh soils, or fill materials (e.g., Udorthents, Urban Land). Pavements and buildings have a low potential for erosion because they consist primarily of impervious surfaces. Soils derived from fill material occur primarily on flat to gently sloping terrain, and have predominantly sandy to loamy sand textured surface horizons, and a low to moderate potential to generate runoff. Map units consisting of fill material and developed land were not assigned a K factor value for the purpose of this EIS as fill materials vary in consistency, even within the same mapping unit.  Where WEG data were not available, a WEG of 8 was assigned to map units comprised entirely or principally of paved areas or tidal marshes, and a WEG of 5 wasassigned to map units comprised of fill materials and naturalsoils.  This is consistent with the WEGs assigned by the NRCS to the othercomparable map units in the Project area. Based on the K factor designations discussed above, approximately 1.3 miles (4 percent) of the soils along the proposed Project pipeline segments are considered highly water erodible. These soils are found entirely along the pipeline segments in Connecticut. About 8.4 acres (2 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 1.2 acres (4 percent) of the soils within the permanent right-of-way are considered highly erodibleby water. Based on the WEG designation discussed above it was determined that about 1.4 miles (4 percent) of the soils along the Project pipeline segments are considered highly wind erodible. About 15.6 acres (4 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 1.8 acres (5 percent) of the soils within the permanent right-of-way are considered highly erodible by wind. Prime Farmland Soils The USDA defines prime farmland as “land that is best suited to food, feed, fiber, and oilseed crops.” This designation includes cultivated land, pasture, woodland, or other lands that are either used for food or fiber crops or are available for these uses. The fact that a particular soil is considered prime farmland does not mean that it is currently in agricultural use, some prime farmland soils may be located in forested, open, or residential areas. Urbanized land and open water are excluded from prime farmland. Prime farmland typically contains few or no rocks, is permeable to water and air, is not excessively erodible or saturated with water forlong periods, and is not subject to frequent, prolonged flooding during the growing season. Soils that do not meet the above criteria may be considered prime farmland if the limiting factor is mitigated (e.g., artificial drainage). The numbers presented in tables 4.2.1-1 through 4.2.1-4 and the paragraph below include Farmland of Statewide Importance and Unique Farmlands. About 8.3 miles (22 percent) of the soils along the proposed pipeline segments are considered prime farmland. About 101.0 acres (22 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 7.4 acres (22 percent) of the soils within the permanent rights-of-way are considered prime farmland. Of 4-15 these acres, about 17.7 acres of the soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 2.6 acres of the soils within the permanent rights-of-way are active agricultural land. The land uses for the remaining 83.3 acres of the soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 4.8 acres of the soils within the permanentrights-of-way consist of forest/woodland, industrial, open land, and residential. Hydric Soils Hydric soils are defined as “soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part” (Federal Register, 1994). Soils that are artificially drained or protected from flooding (e.g., by levees) are still considered hydric if the soil in its undisturbed state would meet the definition of a hydric soil. Generally, hydric soils are those soils that are poorly and very poorly drained. Hydric soils may indicate the presence of wetlands.  Wetland areas containing hydric soils were delineated within the entire Project area as described in section 4.4.1. During Project surveys, some wetlands were delineated in areas that were not mapped as hydric soils in SSURGO data. In these instances, wetland field data was used to supplement the SSURGO hydric data. Due to extended periods of saturation, hydric soils can be prone to compaction and rutting. In addition, high groundwater levels associated with hydric soils could create a buoyancy hazard for the pipeline. Detailed information about the location of wetlands affected by the Project is provided in appendix K table K-1. About 5.7 miles (15 percent) of the soils along the proposed Project pipeline segments are considered hydric. About 57.0 acres (13 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 5.2 acres(15 percent) of the soils within the permanent rights-of-way are considered hydric. Compaction Potential Soil compaction modifies the structure and reduces the porosity and moisture-holding capacity of soils. Construction equipment traveling over wet soils could disrupt the soil structure, reduce pore space, increase runoff potential, or cause rutting. The degree of compaction depends on moisture content and soil texture.  Fine-textured soils with poorinternal drainage that are moist or saturated during construction are most susceptible to compaction and rutting. Many soils along the proposed pipeline segments have likely already been compacted due to past development and some areas being covered by paved surfaces. The degree of compaction was evaluated based on the drainage class of the soils. Very poorly and poorly drained soils were considered to have a high potential for compaction. Somewhat poorly to moderately well drained soils were considered to have a moderate potential for soil compaction. Well drained to excessively drained soils were considered to have alow potential for soilcompaction. Soils with a high potential for compaction and structural damage in the Project area are typically very poorly drained soils located in wetlands with an organic soil component. Special construction procedures within wetlandsare discussed in section 4.4 and Algonquin’s E&SCP. About 3.7 miles (10 percent) of the soils along the proposed Project pipeline segments are soils with a high compaction potential. About 51.0 acres (11 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 4.3 acres (13 percent) of the soils within the permanent rights-of-way are soils with a high compaction potential. 4-16 The ability of soils within the Project area to support successful revegetation was determined by NRCS official series descriptions and county soil surveys. The drainage class, slope class, and erosion potential of each soil type within the Project area was evaluated to determine revegetation potential. Other considerations included whether or not the mapped soils were natural, human transported, or disturbed. Droughty soils that have coarse-textured surface layers and are moderately well to excessively drained may prove difficult to revegetate. The drier soils have less water to aid in the germination and eventual establishment of new vegetation. The coarser textured soils also have a lower water holding capacity following precipitation, which could result in moisture deficiencies in the root zone, creating unfavorable conditions for many plants. Droughty soils along the Project were identified by querying the SSURGO database for component soils series that have a surface texture of sandy loam or coarser, and are moderately well to excessively drained. In addition, steep slopes along the Project may make the reestablishment of vegetation difficult. Soils that occur on slopes greater than 8 percent are also considered areas with a revegetation concern. About 21.3 miles (57 percent) of the soils along the proposed Project pipeline construction segments are soils with a revegetation concern. About 262.6 acres (58 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 18.7 acres (55 percent) of the soils within the permanent right-of-way are soils with a revegetation concern(see tables 4.2.1-1 through 4.2.1-3). ShallowBedrock Introducing stones and other rock fragments to surface soil layers may reduce soil moisture-holding capacity, resulting in a reduction of soil productivity. Additionally, some agricultural equipment may be damaged by contact with large rocks and stones. Rock fragments at the surface and in the surface layer may be encountered during grading, trenching, and backfilling. Construction through soils with shallow bedrock could result in the incorporation of bedrock fragments into surface soils. A large portion of the soils to be affected along the Project pipeline segments are considered stony/rocky soils. The potential to introduce stone and rock into surface soils in those areas could be significant. However, the soils in those areas already contain surface layers with significant quantities of rock fragments.  The potentialforintroducing rock into the topsoil was evaluated based on bedrock depth, and the presence of fill material and disturbed soils. USDA data were used to identify soil map units where depth to bedrock is generally anticipated to be less than 5 feet (60 inches) from the soil surface (USDA, 2010). With regard to fill materials and disturbed soils, soil map units comprised entirely or partially of fill materials and disturbed soils were also considered areas where rock could potentially be introduced into the topsoil, because these areas often contain concrete and other demolition debris. The Official Series Descriptions and county soil survey descriptions were used to identify areas with fill materials and disturbed soils. Within the Project area, the urban land, Udorthents, Pits, and quarry soil series are comprised of fill materials or disturbed soils. Soil complexes including any of these map units may also be partially or entirely comprised of fill materials and disturbed soils. Given the industrial and highly developed nature of most of the proposed West Roxbury Lateralarea, fill materials may also exist in areas that have been mapped by the NRCS as natural soils. 4-17 About 7.2 miles (19 percent) of soils that would be affected along the proposed Project pipeline segments have shallow depth to bedrock. About 89.3 acres (20 percent) of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 6.7 acres (20 percent) of the soils within the permanent right-of-way are soils with shallow depth to bedrock.  Scoping comments were received regarding shallow bedrock and the potential need for blasting within the New York City Watershed. Portions of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay and the Southeast Compressor Station are found within the Croton River Watershed, which is part of the New York City Watershed. No soils along the pipeline segment within the Croton River Watershed were mapped by SSURGO as having shallow bedrock (i.e., bedrock within 60 inches of the soil surface). Approximately 2.1 acres of soil within the Southeast Compressor Station has a shallow depth to bedrock. The eastern portion of the temporary workspace at this compressor station has shallow bedrock that would be used for storage of excess fill, and no excavation is planned. Blasting would also not be needed at the Southeast Compressor Station site. 4.2.1.2 AbovegroundFacilities Table 4.2.1-4 summarizes the soil characteristics affected during construction of the aboveground facilities. None of the soils at the aboveground facility sites have a high potential to be eroded by water. However, some aboveground facility sites have soils considered highly erodible by wind; 5.9 acres at the existing compressor station sites, 2.4 acres at the new M&R station sites, and 4.3 acres at existing M&R stations to be modified orremoved.  About 14.1 acres of the soils mapped at these facilities are considered prime farmland, and about 1.3 of these acres would be permanently impacted by the Project. None of the new proposed aboveground facilities are greater than 5 acres. In addition, the lands associated with the aboveground facility sites are not currently being used for agricultural purposes and are not available for future production; therefore, the Farmland Protection Policy Act would not apply (USDA, 2014b). While there are mapped hydric soils and delineated wetlands at some of the proposed aboveground facilities, no wetlands would be impacted by any of the facilities. 4.2.1.3 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards Algonquin has identified three pipe and contractor ware yards that would be used during construction. These yards would temporarily affect about 28.6 acres of land, all of which is industrial/commercial land. The three pipe and contractor ware yards that would be used during construction of the pipeline facilities are located in existing yards or in industrial/commercial areas. If necessary, rough grading and vegetation clearing of temporary construction yards would be conducted. No significant impacts on soils in the pipe and contractor ware yards are anticipated. 4.2.1.4 Access Roads In addition to existingpublic roads, Algonquin proposes to utilize 28 TARs and 8 PARs to access its facilities. The existing roads are comprised of gravel roads, unimproved dirt roads, paved and gravel driveways, private industrial and commercial roads, paved parking lots, and golf course roads. The one exception is the new PAR to be constructed for the new Assonet M&R Station, which would permanently disturb less than 0.1 acre (0.03 acre) of land. None of the proposed access roads would have a significant impact on soils. 4-18 TABLE 4.2.1-4 Summary of Soil Characteristics Affected During Construction of Aboveground Facilities for the AIM Project (acres)  Highly Erodible Soils with Total Prime Compact Shallow Revegetation b d f Facility Acres a Water Wind Farmland c Hydric Prone Bedrock e Concern  Existing Compressor Station Modifications Stony Point Compressor 20.3 0.0 0.0 0.4 1.3 0.0 0.0 20.3 Station Southeast Compressor 15.9 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.0 <0.1 2.1 15.9 Station Oxford Compressor Station 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Cromwell Compressor Station 14.9 0.0 5.9 5.9 0.4 0.4 0.0 12.8 Chaplin Compressor Station 11.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.2 0.0 11.5 Burrillville Compressor 16.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.4 1.4 0.0 0.0 Station Subtotal 79.5 0.0 5.9 10.3 3.3 2.0 2.1 60.5 Existing M&R Station Modifications Stony Point M&R Station 2.2 g 0.0 0.0 0.3 1.3 1.3 0.0 2.2 Peekskill M&R Station 2.1 g 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.1 0.0 Cortlandt M&R Station 3.8 g 0.0 0.0 2.6 0.0 0.0 1.2 0.9 h West Danbury M&R Station 2.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.0 2.7 Southbury M&R Station 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 Waterbury M&R Station 0.4 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.4 North Haven M&R Station 0.5 0.0 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.2 Guilford M&R Station 0.5 0.0 0.1 0.0 0.5 0.5 <0.1 <0.1 Farmington M&R Station 0.4 0.0 0.2 <0.1 0.0 <0.1 0.0 0.4 Glastonbury M&R Station 0.8 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.8 Middletown M&R Station 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 Salem M&R Station 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Montville M&R Station 1.2 g 0.0 0.7 1.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Willimantic M&R Station 0.9 0.0 0.4 0.0 0.0 <0.1 0.2 0.9 Pomfret M&R Station 0.4 0.0 0.4 0.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 Putnam M&R Station 0.3 0.0 0.3 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 i North Fall River M&R Station 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 New Bedford M&R Station 1.8 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 Middleborough M&R Station 0.6 0.0 0.6 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Brockton M&R Station 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Norwood M&R Station 0.8 0.0 <0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Needham M&R Station 0.4 0.0 0.4 0.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Wellesley M&R Station 0.5 0.0 <0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 <0.1 Mystic M&R Station 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 j Subtotal 13.8 0.0 4.0 3.6 1.0 1.0 0.2 6.6 New M&R Stations Oakland Heights M&R Station 2.4 0.0 2.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 1.4 Assonet M&R Station 1.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 West Roxbury M&R Station 1.0 g 0.0 0.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5 Subtotal 3.9 0.0 2.4 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.1 1.4 Existing M&R Station Removal Greenville M&R Station 0.3 0.0 0.3 0.2 0.0 0.0 <0.1 <0.1 Total 97.5j 0.0 12.6 14.1 4.3 3.0 3.4 68.5  4-19 TABLE 4.2.1-4 (cont’d) Summary of Soil Characteristics Affected During Construction of Aboveground Facilities for the AIM Project (acres)  ____________________ a Includes acres of construction workspace.

Source: USDA, 2013c, 2013d  4.2.1.5 Contaminated Soils Algonquin conducted a corridor database search using Environmental Data Resources, Inc. (EDR) to identify various facilities with potential and/or actual sources of contamination that may impact nearby soils along the existing and proposed pipeline and aboveground facilities in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Rhode Island was not included in the search, because only one facility (Burrillville Compressor Station) would require work and that activity would take place within Algonquin’s existing facility. A corridor database search is not necessary in Rhode Island because Algonquin already owns the property on which the existing Burrillville Compressor Station is located, and this is the only location in Rhode Island where work would occur associated with the Project (i.e., a corridor database search would not identify any sites not already known to Algonquin). In order to identify any known contamination at the Burrillville Compressor Station site, we conducted a search of the RIDEM Office of Waste Management's site inventories, the EPA's Cleanups in My Community database, and the EPA's EnviroFacts database. Based on these sources, no known contaminated soil or groundwater is present at the Burrillville Compressor Station site. A list of databases searched in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts is included in table 4.2.1-5. The review of these sources resulted in the identification of a number of sites with documented soil impacts in the vicinity of Project facilities. Algonquin reviewed the sites located within 500 feet of Project facilities to evaluate their distance from and hydrologic setting relative to Project areas (i.e., whether up-gradient, down-gradient, or cross-gradient) and their current regulatory status (i.e., whether available documentation indicates the continued presence of contamination). The more significant sites identified in the database search are discussed below. Three documented spills or properties where a release of contaminants occurred were identified with a potential to impact soils along the proposed pipeline facilities in New York. Potential contaminants that may be encountered in soils proximate to these facilities include volatile organic compounds (VOC), petroleum hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other industrial chemicals. 4-20 TABLE 4.2.1-5 Databases Used to Identify Potentially Contaminated Sites for the AIM Project  New York  Connecticut  Massachusetts   EPA, National Priorities List  EPA, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System (CERCLIS)  EPA, CERCLIS – No Further Remedial Action Planned  EPA, Resource Conservation and Recovery Information System (RCRIS) – Corrective Action Facilities (CORRACTS)  RCRIS non CORRACTS Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs)  RCRIS – for Hazardous Waste Generators (large and small quantity generators)  RCRIS – for Hazardous Waste Generators (conditionally exempt small quantity generators and non-generators)  EPA, Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS)  EPA, Facility Index System (FINDS)  U.S. Brownfields  Hazardous Substance Waste Disposal Site Inventory  Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites in New York State  Environmental Restoration Program Listing (ERP)  Solid waste facilities/landfill sites Conn(SWF/LF)  Leaking storage tank incident reports (LTANKS)  Leaking underground and aboveground storage tanks (HIST LTANKS)  Facilities that have petroleum storage capacities in excess of 1,100 gallons and less than 400,000 gallons (Underground Storage Tanks (UST) and Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST) Petroleum Bulk Storage (PBS) Database)  Major Oil Storage Facilities Database (MOSF UST and AST) Facilities that have petroleum storage capacities in excess of 400,000 gallons  New York State Hazardous Waste Manifest Database  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) – NonGen/ No Longer Regulated (NLR)  Spills incident database (SPILLS)  Engineering and Institutional Controls (ENG/INST Controls)  Voluntary Cleanup Agreements  Drycleaners  Brownfields  State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System   EPA, National Priorities List  Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS)  EPA, CERCLIS  EPA, CERCLIS – No Further Remedial Action Planned  EPA, RCRIS – CORRACTS)  RCRIS non CORRACTS TSDFs  RCRIS – for Hazardous Waste Generators (large and small quantity generators)  RCRIS – for Hazardous Waste Generators (conditionally exempt small quantity generators and non-generators)  EPA, ERNS  EPA, FINDS  US Brownfields  Inventory of Hazardous Disposal Sites  Site Discovery and Assessment Database (SDADB)  List of Landfills/Transfer Stations (SWF/LF)  Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST)  Connecticut Leachate and Wastewater Discharge Sites (LWDS)  UST Data (UST)  Oil & Chemical Spill Database (SPILLS)  Engineering Control Listing (ENG Controls)  Environmental Land Use Restriction Sites (AUL)  Voluntary Cleanup Agreements  Drycleaners  Brownfields  New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut Hazardous Waste Manifest Database (Manifest)  Connecticut National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  Contaminated or Potentially Contaminated Sites (CPCS)  RCRA TSDF  RCRA – NonGen/NLR  2020 Corrective Action Database (2020 COR ACTION)  Connecticut Property Database (CT Property)  EDR Manufactured Gas Plant (MGP)   EPA, National Priorities List  EPA, CERCLIS  EPA, CERCLIS – No Further Remedial Action Planned  EPA, RCRIS – CORRACTS  RCRIS non CORRACTS TSDFs  RCRIS – for Hazardous Waste Generators (large and small quantity generators)  RCRIS – for Hazardous Waste Generators (conditionally exempt small quantity generators and non-generators)  EPA, ERNS  EPA, FINDS  US Brownfields  State Hazardous Waste Sites  State Landfill or Solid Waste Disposal sites  State Registered UST  State LUST  State Leaking Aboveground Storage Tanks (LAST)  State Registered Aboveground Storage Tanks (AST)  State Release facilities (Release)  State Institutional Control/Engineering Control Registry (INST CONTROL)  State MA Spills  Drycleaners  RCRA – NonGen/NLR  4-21 Numerous underground storage tanks that have had reported releases were historically located along the Connecticut pipeline segments. Therefore, petroleum hydrocarbon-impacted soils may be encountered during pipeline construction activities. Several industrial facilities with documented releases are also located in the vicinity of the Connecticut pipeline segments. Contaminants at these properties may include VOCs, petroleum hydrocarbons, metals, and/or other industrial chemicals. Algonquin identified one site that warrants the potential for field sampling. The site is located about 200 feet north of MP 8.6 along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment and is referred to as the Collins and Jewel site. The facility is listed multiple times in the Manifest database with listings associated with solvents and heavy metals. The CTDEEP also identified a concern about a second site, the Lightolier property, which is crossed by the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment at about the same location. This site was found on multiple database searches and is listed for chlorinated VOCs and heavy metals. Numerous filling stations and commercial properties that currently store or have historically stored petroleum are located along the West Roxbury Lateral in Massachusetts, many of which have had reported releases. The urban nature of the area suggests that fill materials were likely used to level ground surfaces during urban development. Therefore, it is possible that urban fill soils containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and petroleum hydrocarbons and other petroleum-related constituents may be encountered within the pipeline construction workspace due to the urban nature of the pipeline segment. One site was identified that warranted the potential for field sampling. The site is located adjacent to the West Roxbury Lateral at MP 2.2. According to the database search, residual concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons remain in the soil near the limits of the property at concentrations above Method 1 S-1 cleanup standards. Several industrial facilities with documented releases are also located in the vicinity of the existing and proposed M&R stations in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. However, most of these facilities are located far enough away that they would not impact soil conditions at the M&R stations. The one exception is the Mystic M&R Station in Massachusetts, where polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and/or cyanide have been detected in the soils based on past reports. No listed release sites were identified that would impactsoils atthe compressor stations. 4.2.2 GeneralImpacts and Mitigation Construction activities, such as clearing, grading, trench excavation, backfilling, and the movement of construction equipment, along the right-of-waymay affect soil resources.  Clearing removes protective vegetative cover and exposes the soil to the effects of wind and rain, which increases the potential for soil erosion and sedimentation of sensitive areas. Grading, spoil storage, and equipment traffic can compact soil, reducing porosity and increasing runoff potential. Excess rock or fill material brought to the surface during trenching operations could hinderthe restoration of the right-of-way. The majority of the proposed facilities would be located within or along existing utility rights-ofway to the maximum extent feasible. Utilizing existing rights-of-way would limit new soil disturbance by working within previously developed or disturbed soils and minimize land use change. To further reduce the impacts of construction on soils, Algonquin would implement its E&SCP, which incorporates all of the applicable mitigation measures outlined in the FERC Plan (FERC, 2013a) and the majority of the measures outlined in the FERC Procedures (FERC, 2013b). The E&SCP has been designed for use by Algonquin and its contractors as a guidance manual for minimizing soil disturbance and transportation of sediments off the right-of-way or into sensitive resources (wetlands, streams, and residential areas) during natural gas pipeline construction. The procedures presented in Algonquin’s E&SCP represent BMPs and are designed to accommodate varying field conditions while maintaining strict minimum standards forthe protection of soilresources and environmentally sensitive areas. 4-22 4.2.2.1 Soil Erosion Algonquin would implement the measures specified in its E&SCP to avoid or minimize potential impacts due to soil erosion and sedimentation. As outlined in the E&SCP, Algonquin would have an EI monitoring all phases of construction to ensure Project plans are followed and would use erosion control devices and construction practices that would minimize erosion during and after construction. Wetland and waterbody crossings would be designed to minimize erosion. At the end of construction, Algonquin would return surface contours and drainage patterns to as close to original conditions as practicable and reestablish vegetation as soon as possible following final grading. Algonquin would inspect the right-ofway and maintain erosion and sediment controls as necessary until final stabilization is achieved. Once revegetation is satisfactory, temporary erosion control measures would be removed. Significant soil erosion is not expected during or after Project construction. 4.2.2.2 Prime Farmland and Drain Tiles Construction activities such as clearing, grading, and equipment movement can result in soil compaction and an increased susceptibility to erosion. The loss of topsoil due to erosion or the mixing of topsoil with the subsoil during construction could result in a loss of soil fertility and impair revegetation. Drain tiles are subsurface structures used in agricultural areas to improve the productivity of the land by increasing drainage of the soils. Drain tile damage can occur with rutting due to operation of heavy construction equipment in wet soils and excavation of the pipeline trench. Based on field surveys, the proposed Project may cross areas with drain tiles, particularly along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay in New London County, Connecticut, and along the Line-36A Loop Extension in Hartford and Middlesex Counties, Connecticut. These segments cross active agricultural fields. Algonquin would implement the following measures for maintaining soil fertility in active agricultural lands temporarily impacted by construction activities:  segregating up to 12 inches of topsoil to maintain surface horizons with higher organic matter content;  backfilling rock fragments to only the top of the natural bedrock profile. Excess fragments would be disposed of in an approved manner and would not interfere with agricultural activities;  testing topsoil and subsoil for compaction at regular intervals. Severely compacted topsoil would be plowed or a green manure such as alfalfa would be planted and plowed to decrease bulk density and improve soilstructure;and  where drain tiles are crossed, maintaining flow to the drainage system during construction. Drain tile systems would be probed beyond the trenchline to determine if any damage occurred beyond the Project excavation area. Any damage to or temporary manipulation of a drain tile systemwould be repaired to a level of function that meets the original condition. We conclude that with the implementation of these mitigation measures, impacts on prime farmland and drain tiles would not be significant and would be temporary in nature. 4-23 4.2.2.3 Hydric Soils and Compaction Potential As discussed in section 4.2.1.1 above, very poorly and poorly drained soils are prone to compaction and structural damage if disturbed due to permanent or frequent saturation at or near the soil surface. Algonquin’s E&SCP provides detailed descriptions of wetland and waterbody crossing techniques designed to minimize damage to saturated soils, as well as other soils that may be vulnerable to such damage when wet. Wetland and waterbody construction methods and mitigation are also described in sections 4.3.2 and 4.4.2. To the extent practicable, Algonquin would avoid construction during periods of heavy rainfall, snowmelt, or unusual soil saturation. Topsoil would be segregated in wetlands and residential areas and then later returned as the surficial layer. Timber mats and low ground pressure machinery would be used to minimize rutting and compaction within saturated wetland soils. Grading to restore natural site contours and repair rutted areas would be completed before final revegetation, seeding, and mulching, which would initiate natural restoration of soil structure and bulk density. Given these measures, that Project activities would not result in significant adverse soil structural damage or compaction. Any impacts on soil structure would be temporary. 4.2.2.4 Post Construction Revegetation As described in Algonquin’s E&SCP, soils disturbed by the Project would be revegetated using a seed mix composed primarily of grasses, herbaceous plants, and legumes or as specified by landowners. Algonquin would also segregate topsoil, where required, to optimize revegetation potential as described in its E&SCP. The E&SCP guidelines and requirements were developed based on the guidelines and recommendations from the FERC, USACE, FWS, and the NRCS. Appendix B of the E&SCP contains seed mix recommendations. Soils in the Project area typically exhibit characteristics sufficient for successful revegetation, and where limitations exist, they would easily be overcome by implementing construction and BMP procedures. Standard revegetation measures include fertilizer and pH amendments (except in wetlands), seedbed preparation, use of a proven seed mix, consideration of seasonal constraints, and mulch application. Where necessary, erosion control fabric or matting would be used on steep slopes to ensure that soils successfully revegetate. Algonquin would monitor all disturbed areas for two growing seasons after construction to evaluate revegetation success of the Project area in accordance with the E&SCP. Areas that have not revegetated successfully would be corrected to ensure the right-of-way conditions are similar to the surrounding undisturbed areas. Based on previous experience with revegetation of pipeline facilities, Algonquin does not anticipate significant problems with revegetation. With adherence to the protocols outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP, revegetation should be successful. 4.2.2.5 Shallow Bedrock It is anticipated that widespread areas of soils with shallow bedrock would be encountered in the Project area. As a result, Algonquin anticipates that rock excavation and/or rock blasting during construction activities would be necessary. The new West Roxbury Lateral would be located through an areaofshallow bedrock, including an area adjacent to the West Roxbury CrushedStone Quarry. For the segments of the pipeline that would be replaced, a trench was previously excavated to install the existing pipelines so substantial bedrock removal in these locations is not anticipated. However, itis possible that limited bedrock removal may be required with blasting to widen or deepen the trench to accommodate the installation of the larger diameter replacement pipeline. Rock removal activities are discussed in more detail in section 4.1.6 and in the AIM Project Rock Removal Plan provided as appendix E. 4-24 The introduction of subsoil rocks into agricultural topsoil would be minimized by segregating topsoil from trench spoil and replacing topsoil in agricultural areas after cleanup. Algonquin would make diligent efforts to remove excess rock from surficial soils to the extent practicable in cultivated and rotated croplands, hayfields, pastures, residential areas, and at landowner's request in other areas. Algonquin would remove excess rock from surface soils disturbed by construction such that the size, density, and distribution of rock on the construction right-of-way would be similar to adjacent non-rightof-way areas. Algonquin would not remove rocks from backfilled areas, if the rock in the backfill is consistent in size and density with conditions in adjacent undisturbed areas. If bedrock is encountered, Algonquin would take precautions to minimize the mixing of excavated bedrock with backfill and would replace rock in the trench to a level that is not higher than the original bedrock profile. If blasting is required, Algonquin would use the minimum explosive charge necessary to fracture bedrock and minimize shot-rock from leaving the construction right-of-way. Where necessary, excess rock would be hauled off the right-of-way or left on the right-of-way, subject to landowner approval and applicable permit conditions. In the event that bedrock is encountered within the trench depth in residential or agricultural lands crossed by the Project, several measures to prevent incorporation of rock into the topsoil would be implemented. These measures include topsoil segregation and protection along the trench, rock backfill in residential and agricultural areas only to the top of bedrock, and disposal of excess rock fragments in an approved manner so as to not incorporate rock fragments into topsoil layers. Through adherence to these measures, no significant increase in the rock content of topsoil in residential or agricultural areas is anticipated. 4.2.2.6 Contaminated Soils Soil contamination along the proposed Project may result from at least two sources: hazardous material or fuel spills during construction and/or those occurring before construction in pre-existing contaminated areas that are encountered during construction. Contamination from spills or leaks of fuels, lubricants, and coolant from construction equipment could adversely affect soils. The effects of such contamination are typically minor because of the low frequency and volumes of spills and leaks.  Algonquin has developed an acceptable SPCC Plan that specifies cleanup procedures to minimize the potential for soil contamination from spills or leaks of fuel, lubricants, coolants, or solvents. Algonquin and its contractors would use the SPCC Plan to minimize accidental spills of materials that may contaminate soils, and to ensure that inadvertent spills of fuels, lubricants, or solvents are contained, cleaned up, and disposed of as quickly as possible and in an appropriate manner. To-date, Algonquin has determined that field sampling would be required at two locations prior to construction. The first location is along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment near MP 8.6 (Collins and Jewel site) and the other is along the West Roxbury Lateral Pipeline near MP 2.2. However, the CTDEEP also identified a concern about encountering contamination at a third site near the Lightolier property (also near MP 8.6 along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay). Although the Collins and Jewel site is located in this same area, it is unclear whether or not sampling would also occur on the Lightolier property. In addition, Algonquin continues to research other locations where sampling may be necessary and has not yet provided details on the protocols for any sampling. Therefore, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the AIM Project, Algonquin should file with the Secretary of the Commission (Secretary), for review and written approval of the Director of the Office of Energy Projects (OEP), a Field Sampling Plan for potential contaminated sites that could be encountered during construction. The Field Sampling Plan should include the locations of all proposed sampling, the number of 4-25 samples to be taken, how and where the samples will be analyzed, the schedule for when the sampling would occur, and the process for providing the results to the applicable agencies. In the event that contamination is encountered during construction, Algonquin would implement the protocols in its Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures.1 If contaminated soils are encountered during construction, all personnel would stop work, leave the contaminated area, and notify the chief inspector on site. Additional notifications would then be made including outside agencies if required. Algonquin would implement the following measures to transport and manage excavated soil to designated soil staging areas, characterize the soils for waste disposal, and ensure that all soils are managed in accordance with state and federal regulations:  limit personnel working within the contamination area during cleanup operations to individuals with current Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Responsetraining;  stockpile material on impermeable sheeting;  rope offstockpiled area to prevent unauthorized entry; and  place contaminated material in appropriately labeled and stored containers. We have reviewed the Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures and find it acceptable. Contamination may be present within surficial soils at locations where a HDD is proposed. Algonquin conducted a review of each of the planned HDD entry/exit locations, including the modified location on the west side of the river, and found no documented soil contamination. Utilizing the HDD method avoids disturbance to river-bottom sediments because all subsurface materials removed along the drill path during the drilling process are removed from the bore hole and contained within temporary lined mud pits. Contamination is not expected to be encountered during HDD activities; however, due to the historic presence of PCBs in the area, we recommendthat:  All subsurface materials recovered from the Hudson River HDD process should be appropriately sampled for PCBs prior to disposal of the material.  If contamination is found, it should be handled as outlined in the Unanticipated Contamination EncounterProcedures. 4.3 WATER RESOURCES 4.3.1 Groundwater Resources 4.3.1.1 Existing Groundwater Resources Groundwater resources in the Project area are composed of unconsolidated glacial deposits of sand and gravel underlain by consolidated bedrock aquifer systems. The three main consolidated bedrock aquifer types are carbonate rock, crystalline rock, and sandstone (Olcott, 1995). Carbonate rock aquifers are predominately located in the Project area in eastern New York and western Connecticut. Carbonate rock aquifers are composed primarily of limestone, dolomite, and marble, and are characterized by 1 Algonquin’s Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures was provided as part of its responses to the April 10, 2014 FERC Environmental Data Request filed on April 30, 2014 (Accession No. 20140430-5528). The Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures can be viewed on the FERC website at http://www.ferc.gov. Using the “eLibrary” link, select “Advanced Search” from the eLibrary menu and enter 20140430-5528 in the “Numbers: Accession Number” field. 4-26 dissolution by slightly acidic groundwater that enlarges pre-existing openings such as pores, joints, and fractures (Miller, 1999). Water from these aquifers is generally very hard and slightly alkaline (Olcott, 1995).  Wells in carbonate-rock aquifers generally yield 10 to 30 gallons per minute (gpm).  Yields can be larger or smaller, however, depending on the degree of fracturing and the number, size, and interconnection of dissolution features in the rock. For example, yields of as much as 1,000 gpm have been reported in some wells in carbonate-rock aquifers with numerous dissolution openings (Olcott, 1995). All of the existing and proposed Project facilities in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and a majority of the facilities in Connecticut, would be located within crystalline-rock aquifers. Crystalline-rock aquifers are formed of igneous and metamorphic rocks, and water transmission through this type of substrate is very low and the volume of water storage capacity is generally small (Olcott, 1995). As a result, groundwater movement through these rock types is dependent on the presence of secondary openings such as fractures or joints in the rocks (Olcott, 1995; Melvin et al., 1988). Water that is stored in overlying glacial deposits or water in nearby streams or other surface waterbodies is commonly connected hydraulically with the bedrock fracture system and can provide large quantities of water. The common range of well yields is 1 to 25 gpm; however, some wells may exceed 100 to 500 gpm (Olcott, 1995). Groundwater quality in the crystalline-rock aquifer system is generally suitable for most uses because the rock is composed of nearly insoluble minerals, groundwater is in contact with relatively small surface areas within the joints and fractures, and within the upper part of the system water movement through the joints and fractures is generally rapid and along short flow paths (Olcott, 1995). In some areas, excessive concentrations of iron, manganese, and sulfate are present (Olcott, 1995). Elevated concentrations of radon, a radioactive gas, have been reported in water from the crystalline-rock aquifers in all of the New England States except Vermont (Olcott, 1995). Two pipelines segments and some Project facilities are located over sandstone aquifers in New York and Connecticut. The sandstones are productive aquifers with well yields ranging from 50 to 100 gpm. Water in these aquifers generally is confined (Olcott, 1995). The sandstone aquifers in the Project area are characterized by fracture permeability. Water in the upper 200 to 300 feet of the aquifer is moderately hard and slightly alkaline (Olcott, 1995). Surficial aquifers are scattered throughout New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. A majority of the surficial aquifers along the Project area are present from central Connecticut to Massachusetts. The surficial aquifer system consists of glacial deposits of sand and gravel that were deposited during several advances and retreats of continental glaciers. These deposits make up the regional surficial aquifer system, which is the most productive and widely used aquifer in the region (Olcott, 1995). 4.3.1.2 Sole Source Aquifers The EPA defines a sole or principal source aquifer (SSA) area as one that supplies greater than 50 percent of drinking water for an area, where contamination of the aquifer could create a significant hazard to public health, and where there are no alternative water sources that could reasonably be expected to replace the water supplied by the aquifer (EPA, 1992). According to the EPA’s designated SSA maps for the Project area (EPA, 1992), the majority of the Project facilities are not located within a designated SSA. However, one designated SSA (the Ramapo River Basin Aquifer System) would be crossed by the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment in New York. The pipeline segment would cross about 0.5 mile of the Ramapo River Basin Aquifer System near the northern edge of the SSA between MPs 0.0 and 0.5. The Ramapo River Basin Aquifer System is located in Bergen and Passaic Counties, New Jersey and Orange and Rockland Counties, New York. The area is underlain primarily by Precambrian 4-27 metamorphic rocks; Triassic-age sedimentary bedrock; unconsolidated Quaternary-age, glacial outwash deposits; and more recent alluvial deposits. This aquifer system supplies about 57 percent of the population with drinking water within the SSA, including the Towns of Haverstraw and Stony Point (EPA, 1992). 4.3.1.3 State-designated Aquifers In addition to the EPA-designated SSA program, individual states may enact regulations protecting significant aquifer recharge areas, critical areas where excessive use of groundwater poses a threat to the long-term integrity of a water-supply source, or preservation areas to protect natural resources including public water supply sources.  State-designated aquifers are discussed furtherbelow. The NYSDEC designates highly productive aquifers presently being utilized as sources of water supply by municipal water supply systems as Primary Water Supply Aquifers (Primary Aquifer) (1990). The only Primary Aquifer crossed by the Project in New York is the Ramapo River Basin Aquifer System. This aquifer comprises valley-fill deposits consisting of alluvial silt and sand, glacial outwash (sand and gravel), ice-contact sand and gravel, till, and lacustrine silt and clay. The sand and gravel beds have relatively high permeability, whereas the till, silt, and clay deposits have relatively low permeability. Water table conditions prevail in the shallow sand and gravel aquifers in parts of the Mahwah River valley. Confined and semi-confined conditions prevail in sand and gravel buried under silt and clay and till in parts of the Mahwah valley. The aquifer is recharged throughout, where the land surface is most permeable and is greatest along the margin of the valley, where runoff from the hillsides is concentrated (Moore et al., 1982). Connecticut Water Quality Standards provide a groundwater quality classification scheme that differentiates groundwater by designated use and discharge restrictions that are applied across the entire state (CTDEEP, 2013o). The proposed Project is located primarily within groundwater quality class GA. The GA designation indicates groundwater within the designated area is used for existing private and potential public or private supplies of water suitable for drinking without treatment and baseflow for hydraulically connected surface waters (CTDEEP, 2013r). The most productive aquifers in Rhode Island are located in areas of glacial deposits of stratified drift, though the fractured bedrock throughout the state serves as an important aquifer to many public and private wells. RIDEM reports that about 26 percent of the population in Rhode Island relies on groundwater from public and private wells throughout roughly two-thirds of the state’s municipalities (RIDEM, 2013a). The Burrillville Compressor Station in Rhode Island is not located within any significant state aquifer system. The MADEP defines a Potentially Productive Aquifer as any aquifer delineated by the USGS to have either medium or high yield (Massachusetts Office of Geographic Information Systems [MassGIS], 2012). The West Roxbury Lateral crosses a portion of the Charles River Basin, a state-designated aquifer, from MPs 1.8 to 2.9. This portion of the aquifer is designated as a medium yield aquifer. In addition, Algonquin’s existing Wellesley M&R Station is located within the Charles River Basin aquifer where itis designated as a high yield aquifer(MassGIS, 2013a). 4.3.1.4 Wellhead and AquiferProtection Areas Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), each state is required to develop and implement a Wellhead Protection Program in order to identify the land and recharge areas contributing to public supply wells, and prevent the contamination of drinking water supplies.  The SDWA was updated in 1996 with an amendment requiring the development of a broader-based Source Water Assessment Program 4-28 The Wellhead Protection Program in New York is administered by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) as part of the SWAP. The SWAP provides information on potential threat of contamination to both groundwater and surface water sources that supply New York’s public drinking water systems. Algonquin contacted the NYSDOH to obtain information regarding the presence of WHPAs in the Project area in New York (NYSDOH, 2013a). The Project facilities in New York are not located within any state-designated well head protection zones. The CTDEEP refers to WHPAs as Aquifer Protection Areas (APA). The APA Program protects major public water supply wells in sand and gravel aquifers to ensure a plentiful supply of public drinking water for present and future generations (CTDEEP, 2013g). The APAs are delineated by the individual water companies owning the well fields and approved by the CTDEEP. The Project facilities in Connecticut cross three state-designated APAs. Algonquin’s proposed Line-36A Loop Extension in Cromwell crosses one state-designated APA between MPs 1.4 and 2.0. Algonquin’s Southeast to MLV19 Take-up and Relay segment crosses a second state-designated APA between MPs 2.3 and 2.6 in the City of Danbury. Algonquin’s existing Farmington M&R Station is located within a state-designated APA. Groundwater in Rhode Island is generally free of pollutants and over 90 percent of the state is classified as suitable for drinking water use without treatment (RIDEM, 2013a). The state's groundwater resources are considered vulnerable to contamination because of the generally shallow depth to groundwater, aquifer permeability and the absence of subsurface confining layers. RIDEM has designated wellhead protection areas for all 665 public wells in Rhode Island identified as of January 2009 (RIDEM, 2013a). The existing Burrillville Compressor Station in Rhode Island is not located within any state-designatedwellhead protection areas. The MADEP requires public water utilities to protect Zone II recharge areas with municipal bylaws, ordinances, and/or health regulations. If the Zone II area is outside a public water system’s municipality, the municipalities where the Zone II area is located must demonstrate to the MADEP that best efforts are being made to protect the Zone II area (MADEP, 2013a). Algonquin’s existing Brockton M&R Station is the only Project facility located within a state-designated wellhead protection area. 4.3.1.5 Water Supply Wells and Springs To obtain information on water supply wells and springs within the Project area, data were reviewed from the NYSDEC Water Well Information Search Wizard (NYSDEC, 2013c); CTDEEP’s geospatial data for public supply wells in designated APAs (CTDEEP, 2013g); GIS data provided by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (Connecticut Department of Public Health, 2013); and the MADEP’s Water Quality Testing System (MassGIS, 2013b). Additional information was also requested from the NYSDOH regarding the locations of public water supply wells and springs within 150 feet of the Project. Information on the locations of private wells and springs from landowners along the Project route was also collected.  Based on available information, 89 private domestic wells, 1 public well, and no springs were identified within 150 feet of the construction work area for the Project (seetable 4.3.1-1). In addition to these features, the proposed Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment crosses the Catskill Aqueduct near MP 10.3 and the Cortlandt M&R Station. Additional discussion of the crossing ofthis aqueduct is provided in section 4.3.2.1. 4-29 TABLE 4.3.1-1 Water Supply Wells and Springs Within 150 Feet of the Construction Work Area for the AIM Project  Approximate Distance from Approximate Construction Approximate Distance from Work Area Facility/Municipality, State Supply Type MP a Pipeline (feet) (feet)  Direction from Construction Work Area  PIPELINE FACILITIES Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay Haverstraw, NY Public, Community 1.1 125 100 Domestic 1.1 175 150 Stony Point, NY Domestic 1.1 150 125 Domestic 1.4 200 125 Domestic 1.6 100 25 Domestic 1.6 75 25 Domestic 1.7 150 75 Domestic 2.5 150 100 Domestic 2.5 100 150 Domestic 2.6 200 150 Domestic 2.6 200 150 Domestic 2.6 175 125 Domestic 2.7 175 125 Domestic 2.7 100 75 Domestic 2.7 225 150 Domestic 2.8 225 150 Domestic 2.8 225 150 Domestic 2.8 225 150 Domestic 2.9 225 125 Domestic 2.9 225 125 Domestic 2.9 100 25 Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay Stony Point, NY Domestic 0.2 102 67 Domestic 0.4 61 11 Domestic 0.4 102 56 Domestic 0.5 169 144 Domestic 0.5 222 89 Domestic 1.4 144 89 Domestic 1.5 172 122 Domestic 1.7 178 89 Domestic 1.7 64 39 Domestic 2.0 122 72 Domestic 2.2 44 64 Domestic 2.2 125 50 Domestic 2.2 133 158 Domestic 2.3 59 39 Domestic 2.4 72 20 Domestic 2.4 194 150  NW SE NW NW NW NW NW NW NW NW NW NW N N N NW NW NW NW NW NW SE SE NW NW SE SE SE SE NW NW NW S NW N S SE  4-30 TABLE 4.3.1-1 (cont’d) Water Supply Wells and Springs Within 150 Feet of the Construction Work Area for the AIM Project  Approximate Distance from Approximate Construction Approximate Distance from Work Area Facility/Municipality, State Supply Type MP a Pipeline (feet) (feet)  Direction from Construction Work Area  Domestic 2.4 69 44 Domestic 2.4 132 77 Domestic 2.5 >150 150 Domestic 2.5 >125 125 Domestic 2.5 >100 100 Domestic 2.9 >100 100 Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay Danbury, CT Domestic 2.0 160 120 Domestic 2.3 300 160 Domestic 2.4 100 50 Domestic 2.4 110 40 Domestic 2.5 85 65 Domestic 3.2 233 150 Domestic 3.2 110 30 Domestic 3.2 110 33 Domestic 3.4 111 55 Domestic 3.4 28 0 Domestic 3.4 177 122 Domestic 3.4 166 95 Domestic 3.4 100 15 Domestic 3.4 100 20 Domestic 3.4 110 60 Domestic 3.5 118 62 Domestic 3.5 200 150 Domestic 3.5 110 55 Domestic 3.8 160 55 Domestic 3.8 150 88 Domestic 3.9 123 66 Domestic 3.8 125 90 Domestic 3.9 50 5 Domestic 3.9 144 55 Domestic 3.9 172 121 Domestic 4.0 168 150 Domestic 4.0 200 150 Domestic 4.0 134 77 Domestic 4.0 77 28 Domestic 4.2 94 60 Domestic 4.3 150 84 Domestic 4.3 126 111 Domestic 4.3 150 117 Domestic 4.4 117 55  NW S N NE W SW NW NW N N SE NW NW NW NW NW NW NW NW NW SE SE NW NW NW NW NW SE NW SE NW NW NW NW NW SE N SE N S  4-31 TABLE 4.3.1-1 (cont’d) Water Supply Wells and Springs Within 150 Feet of the Construction Work Area for the AIM Project  Approximate Distance from Approximate Construction Approximate Distance from Work Area Facility/Municipality, State Supply Type MP a Pipeline (feet) (feet)  Direction from Construction Work Area  Domestic 4.4 95 55 Domestic 4.4 227 18 Domestic 4.4 194 150 E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay Lebanon, CT Domestic 0.0 165 15 Franklin, CT Domestic 5.9 100 30 Domestic 7.3 80 0 E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension Montville, CT Domestic 0.0 152 100 Domestic 0.0 170 140 Domestic 0.1 30 25 Domestic 0.2 128 98 Domestic 1.3 73 35 Domestic 1.3 182 150 ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES E-1 12-inch Loop Receiver Facility Montville, CT Domestic 0.0 152 100  N N N SW NE SW NE W W W W SW NE  4.3.1.6 Potential ContaminatedGroundwater As discussed in section 4.2.1.5, Algonquin conducted a corridor database search using EDR to identify various facilities with potential and/or actual sources of contamination that may impact nearby groundwater along the existing and proposed pipeline and aboveground facilities in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Rhode Island was not included in the search, because only one facility (Burrillville Compressor Station) would require work and that activity would take place within Algonquin’s existing facility. A list of databases searched is included in table 4.2.1-5. Algonquin reviewed the sites located within 500 feet of Project facilities to evaluate their distance from and hydrologic setting relative to Project areas (i.e., whether up-gradient, down-gradient, or cross-gradient) and their current regulatory status (i.e., whether available documentation indicates the continued presence of contamination). Information on the documented sites that were determined to potentially affect construction of the pipeline segments and aboveground facilities is provided in section 4.2.1.5. To-date, Algonquin has indicated that there are only two sites within the Project area in Connecticut and Massachusetts where groundwater contamination could be encountered during construction (table 4.3.12). 4-32 TABLE 4.3.1-2 Potential Contaminated Groundwater Sites Crossed by the Pipeline Route for the AIM Projecta  Distance/Direction State/Segment/Site Name MP from Right-of-Way Contaminants  PIPELINE FACILITIES Connecticut E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay Collins & Jewel 8.6 ~200 feet north Solvents and heavy metals.

Gasoline in soils. ____________________ a Due to the extensive number of releases in this pipeline corridor, those releases that have achieved permanent regulatory closure without use limitations were not evaluated in this review, unless located in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline. In addition, those listings greater than 1,000 feet from the pipeline were excluded from this review. It should be anticipated that urban fill soils containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and petroleum hydrocarbons would be encountered throughout the corridor due to the urban nature of the pipeline segment.  Numerous residential petroleum storage tanks and commercial filling stations that currently store or have historically stored petroleum are located along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment and have had reported releases.  However, most of the Project facilitiesare located in a presumed down-or cross-gradient direction, or are considered to be located at a great enough distance away from the release sites that those releases are unlikely to impact groundwater beneath the pipeline segments in New York. Based on review of additional site information, there are no sites in New York that would require field sampling investigations.  We received a scoping comment related to existing groundwater contamination at the IPEC. In 2005, Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. (Entergy), the IPEC operator, discovered water leaking from a crack in the exterior of the Unit 2 spent fuel pool. Following the report of the leak to the NYSDEC and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Entergy conducted an investigation, supervised by NYSDEC and NYSDOH staff, to evaluate the leak and assess potential environmental effects. The investigation identified a plume of tritium (radioactive hydrogen) contamination in groundwater coming from the Unit 2 spent fuel pool and a plume of strontium-90 contamination associated with the Unit 1 spent fuel pool complex. In addition to the radioactive hydrogen and strontium-90, three other radionuclides (Nickel-63, Cobalt-60, and Cesium-137) were also sporadically detected during the groundwater monitoring study, but were isolated to specific locations within the IPEC site. Hydrogeological analysis of the plumes and groundwater movement at the site demonstrated that groundwaterfrom the site flows east to west, directly toward and into the Hudson River; groundwater does not flow off site to the north, south, or east (NYSDEC, 2014d, 2014b;NRC, 2014a). The proposed Project facilities near the IPEC would be located south and east of the IPEC site. The closest point of the proposed workspace to the IPEC site would be about 1,560 southeast of the security fence. The proposed workspace would be more than 2,300 feet southeast of the mapped plumes of strontium-90 and radioactive hydrogen contaminated groundwater. As noted above, groundwater flow at the IPEC site moves westward toward and into the Hudson River; there is no flow of contaminated groundwater off site to the south, east, or north. As a result, the proposed Project facilities would not interact with radiologically contaminated groundwaterat the IPEC site. Numerous releases at underground storage tanks or industrial facilities have been reported within 1 mile of the pipeline route and aboveground facilities in Connecticut. However, most of the Project 4-33 facilities are located in a presumed down-or cross-gradient direction, or are located at a great enough distance from the Project, that those releases would be unlikely to impact groundwater beneath the pipeline segments in Connecticut. Based on review of additional site information, Algonquin would undertake field sampling investigations at the Collins and Jewel site at MP 8.6 of the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment in Connecticut. However, the CTDEEP also identified a concern about encounteringcontaminated groundwaternearthe Lightolier property(nearMP8.6).  Althoughthe Collins and Jewel site is located in this same area, it is unclear whether or not sampling would also occur on the Lightolier property itself. Therefore, we have recommended that Algonquin develop a Field Sampling Plan that includes the locations of all proposed sampling as well as proposed sampling protocols (see section 4.2.2.6). Numerous filling stations and commercial properties that currently store, or have historically stored, petroleum are located along the West Roxbury Lateral pipeline. The EDR report indicates that many of these properties have had reported releases. Additionally, the urban nature of the area suggests that fill materials were likely used to level ground surfaces during urban development. Therefore, it is anticipated that groundwater may be impacted by contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and petroleum hydrocarbons throughout the pipeline corridor. However, based on the average depth to groundwater (i.e., 10 to 15 feet below ground surface), groundwater is not expected to be encountered in the majority of the corridor during pipeline construction activities. Therefore, the majority of release sites in the vicinity of the pipeline corridor are not expected to impact pipeline construction with respect to groundwater contamination. Based on review of additional site information, Algonquin has indicated it would undertake field sampling investigations at one site along the proposed West Roxbury Lateral pipeline in Massachusetts (MP 2.2 in Dedham). As discussed above, we have recommended that Algonquin develop a Field Sampling Plan that includes the locations of all proposed sampling as well as proposed sampling protocols (seesection 4.2.2.6). 4.3.1.7 GeneralImpacts and Mitigation Project construction activities with the potential to impact groundwater include trench dewatering, blasting, spills or leaks of hazardous materials, and HDD. Shallow aquifers could sustain minor, indirect impacts from changes in overland sheet flow and recharge caused by clearing and grading of the proposed right-of-way. Near surface soil compaction caused by heavy construction equipment could reduce the ability of soils to absorb water in isolated areas.  Aboveground facilities could add minor impervious surfaces; however, they are unlikely to affect groundwater recharge outside of the facility limits. Local water table elevations could be affected by trenching and backfilling. These minor impacts would be temporary and would not significantly affect groundwater resources. Upon completion of construction, Algonquin would restore the ground surface as closely as practicable to original contours and revegetate the right-of-way to ensure restoration of preconstruction overland flow and recharge patterns. In areas where groundwater is near the surface, trench excavation may intersect the water table in low-lyingareas. Dewateringoftrenchesmayresultin temporaryfluctuations in localgroundwaterlevels.  Trench water would be discharged into well-vegetated upland areas to allow infiltration and to minimize impacts on the water table. These potential impacts would be avoided or further minimized by use of construction techniques described in Algonquin’s E&SCP, such as the use of temporary and permanent trench plugs and interceptor dikes. After installation of the proposed pipeline and aboveground facilities, the ground surface would be restored as close as possible to original contours and any exposed soils would be revegetated to ensure restoration of preconstruction overland flow and recharge patterns. Therefore, these minor, direct, and indirect impacts would be temporary and would not significantly affect groundwater resources. 4-34 Public and private water supply wells within 150 feet of the Project could be impacted by construction activities, includingareaswhere blasting ofbedrockwould be required. These affects would be monitored and would be minimized by following the procedures outlined in Algonquin’s Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E), which we find acceptable.  Two wells are located within the construction workspace. Both would be protected by safety fencing during construction. Algonquin would contact any landowner with water supply wells within 150 feet of the construction workspace and offer to conduct pre-and post-construction monitoring of well yield and water quality. If a water supply well is damaged as a result of Project construction, Algonquin would ensure that a temporary source of water is provided until the damaged water well is restored to its preconstruction capacity and quality, a replacement water source would be provided, or the landowner would be fairly compensated for damages. Given the number of water supply wells within 150 feet of the construction workspace associated with the Project facilities, we recommend that:  Within 30 days of placingthe AIM Project facilities in service, Algonquin should file with the Secretary a report discussing whether any water supply well complaints concerning well yield or quality were received andhow each was resolved. Unconfined aquifers and shallow groundwater areas could be vulnerable to contamination caused by inadvertent surface spills of hazardous materials used during construction. Accidental spills and leaks associated with refueling or storage of fuel, oil, or other fluids pose the greatest risk to groundwater resources. If not cleaned up, contaminated soil could continue to leach and add pollutants to groundwater long after a spill has occurred. Impacts associated with spills or leaks of hazardous liquids would be avoided or minimized by restricting the location of refueling and storage facilities and by requiring cleanup in the event of a spill orleak. Implementation of the measures in Algonquin’s SPCC Plan would minimize the potential for groundwater impacts associated with an inadvertent spill of hazardous materials. The SPCC Plan identifies preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of a spill, such as secondary containment for petroleum products, daily equipment inspections for leaks, and restrictions on the transport of potentially hazardous materials to the construction work areas. The SPCC plan also specifies measures to contain and clean up a spill should one occur. The plan includes measures for employee training regarding the on-site handling of fuels and other hazardous materials; as well as requirements to prevent and minimize the potentialfor spills, including:  Project equipment must be in good operating order and subjectto regular inspection.  Transport offuels would only be conducted on approved accessroads.  All equipment would be parked overnight and/or fueled at least 100 feet from a wetland or waterbody.  Hazardous materials, including chemicals, fuels, and lubricating oils, would not be stored within 100 feet of a wetland or waterbody.  Any concrete coating activities would not be performed within 100 feet of a waterbody or wetland. In the event of a spill, the Project contractor would have sufficient supplies of absorbent and barrier materials on site to allow for the rapid containment and recovery of spilled material. Implementation of Algonquin’s SPCC Plan would adequately address the storage and transfer of 4-35 Impacts associated with unexpected contaminated groundwater would be avoided or minimized by following the procedures outlined in Algonquin’s Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures, which we find to be acceptable. Contractors would be trained to assess any potential contamination by assessing the Project and surrounding area and/or past history of the site. Should contamination be encountered, sampling would be conducted and appropriate cleanup measures would be undertaken.  Work would continue only after appropriate cleanup has occurred. By implementing the measures included in the Unexpected Contamination Encounter Plan, the potential impacts on soils and groundwater due to construction activities would be minimized. Contamination may be present within shallow groundwater at locations where a HDD is proposed. Algonquin conducted a review of each of the planned HDD entry/exit locations and found no documented groundwater contamination. Algonquin also consulted with the landowner of the property where the modified entry/exit hole for the HDD crossing on the west side of the Hudson River is being proposed.  The landowner indicated that they were notaware of any contamination on the site.  Therefore, contamination is not expected to be encountered during HDD activities. However, due to the historic presence of PCBs in the area, we are recommending that all subsurface materials recovered from the Hudson River HDD process be appropriately sampled for PCBs prior to disposal of the material. If contamination is found, it should be handled as outlined in the Unanticipated Contamination Encounter Procedures (see section 4.2.2.6). Algonquin would employ several EIs to ensure compliance with the E&SCP, SPCC Plan, the Unexpected Contamination Encounter Plan, and other Project-specific plans and specifications during construction and restoration. The EI(s) would have the authority to stop work and order corrective actions for activities that violate the environmental conditions of the FERC Certificate and other authorizations. The EI would be required to report such spills to all local, state, and federal agencies and conduct follow-up delineation (if necessary) and cleanup of a spill, as required, including the appropriate characterization and disposal of wastes generated. Comments were received on the draft EIS regarding the Ramapo River Basin Aquifer Systems and potential impacts on the aquifer associated with Project construction. The Ramapo River drainage basin occupies an area of 161 square miles (103,040 acres) covering the Ramapo and Mahwah Rivers in New York and New Jersey. The EPA-designated sole source aquifer coincides with the Ramapo River drainage basin (EPA, 1992). Seventy percent of the basin is in New York and covers portions of Orange and Rockland counties. The valley-fill aquifer itself occupies a much smaller portion of the drainage basin and is associated with the Ramapo and Mahwah River valleys (see figure 4.3.1-1). AIM Project construction within the drainage basin would take place in Rockland County and occupy only 6.4 acres over 0.5 linear mile, or just 0.007 percent of the area covered by the drainage basin. The actual construction footprint that could potentially impact the aquifer itself occupies only 2.4 acres. The construction footprint would be located within the headwaters of the Mahwah River, at the northern margin of the aquifer (see figure 4.3.1-1). The thickness of the valley-fill aquifer in this area is minimal, ranging from 20 to 40 feet (Moore et al., 1982; Plate 1). Based on published data (Hesig, 2010) the closest public water supply wells within the aquifer (United Water, New York) are located about 2.3 miles south of the southern edge of the Project workspace (see figure 4.3.1-1). The closest private wellin the aquifer is located about 2,120 feetsouth ofthe Project workspace (RO-449 on figure 4.3.1-1). 4-36 The proposed construction in this portion of the Project involves replacing the existing 26-inchdiameter pipeline with a new 42-inch-diameter pipe in the same trench. The existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline would be removed, and the existing ditch would be widened and deepened to accommodate the new 42-inch-diameter pipe. Following the installation of the new pipe, the trench would be backfilled, and the land surface would be restored to preconstruction contours. The greatest potential for impacts on groundwater during construction would be an accidental release of a hazardous substance, such as fuel, lubricants, or coolant.  However, the potential for contaminating the aquifer is considered to be low due to the unlikely occurrence of large spills, the small volume of hazardous materials expected to be used during the Project, and the timeframe in which spills would be contained and removed. In the event of a spill during construction, the Project SPCC Plan would be implemented as described above.  Operation of the Project would not be expected to result in impacts on groundwater unless maintenance activities involving pipe excavation and repair are required. For maintenance activities, Algonquin would implement its operational SPCC Plan to contain and clean up spilled materials. As a result, any impacts from maintenance would be short term in nature and similar to those discussed for initial pipeline construction. In summary, construction activities are not likely to significantly impact groundwater resources because the majority of construction would involve shallow, temporary, and localized excavation. Because Project disturbances would generally be temporary and limited to the ground surface and shallow excavation, erosion controls and stormwater management would be implemented, and natural ground contours and vegetation would be restored, we conclude that construction and operation of the Project would not result in significant impacts on groundwater resources or users of groundwater in the Project area. 4.3.1.8 Groundwater Uses During Construction As discussed in sections 2.3.1.2 and 4.3.2.3, Algonquin would use the HDD intersect method at two locations along the proposed pipeline route. This intersect method involves drilling from both sides of the waterbody and intersecting in the middle. This method allows the exact drill entry and exit locations to be predetermined. This process also enables the drilling path to have an instant hydraulic connection once the intersect is complete providing for a cleaner pilot hole. The installation is a multistage process consisting of establishing a small diameter pilot hole followed by enlargement of the pilot hole through successive reaming passes until the hole is large enough to accommodate the pipe. Throughout the process of drilling, a slurry made of non-toxic/non-hazardous bentonite clay, additives, and water, referred to as drilling mud, would be circulated through the drilling tools to lubricate the drill bit, remove drill cuttings, and hold the hole open. Algonquin is proposing to use municipal sources of water for the HDD operations. The estimated requirements for each of the proposed HDDs are listed in table 4.3.1-3. During the HDD installation, the drilling mud returns would be circulated through mud pits to remove the drill cuttings and the bentonite would be recycled for use as the drilling operation continues. After completion of the HDD operations, the recovered drilling mud would be recycled or disposed of at an approved disposal site and would not be expected to impact water resources. As stated in section4.2.2.6, due to the historic presence of PCB contamination, we are recommending that all subsurface materials recovered from the Hudson River HDD process be appropriately sampled for PCBs prior to disposal of the material. If contamination is found it would be handled as outlined in the Unanticipated Contamination Encounter Procedures. 4-38 TABLE 4.3.1-3 Estimated Fresh Water Usage for Horizontal Directional Drills for the AIM Project  Maximum Estimated Volume HDD MP (gallons)  Water Source  New York 42-inch-diameter Hudson River HDD 3.0 to 3.9 800,000 Connecticut 42-inch-diameter Interstate 84/Still 1.4 to 2.1 2,000,000 River HDD TOTAL 2,800,000  Municipal Municipal  4.3.2 Surface Water Resources 4.3.2.1 Existing Surface Water Resources Surface water resources were initially identified using USGS topographic maps and subsequently surveyed during wetland field delineations conducted in 2013. In areas where access was not granted, environmental information was determined using USGS mapping, aerial imagery, and other GIS-based information. Table I-1 in appendix I lists the waterbodies that would be crossed by name, location, crossing width, flow type, FERC classification, fishery type, state water quality classification, and proposed crossing method. A total of 102 waterbody crossings would be required for the Project. These include 36 perennial streams, 62 intermittentstreams, 3 ephemeralstreams, and 1 ponded area. Pipeline Facilities The New York portion of the Project crosses 39 waterbodies within 8 subbasin level watersheds in Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam Counties. Of these 39 waterbodies, 20 are perennial streams and 19 are intermittent streams. The Hudson River is the only major waterbody (greater than 100 feet wide) crossed by the pipeline segments. Six of the proposed crossings are intermediate crossings (between 10 and 100 feet wide), and the remaining 32 crossings are minor crossings (less than 10 feet wide). In addition to these features, the proposed Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment crosses the Catskill Aqueduct near MP 10.3. Several comments were received during scoping about the Project’s potential to impact the watersheds that supply water to the New York City metropolitan area. Water supply to the New York City metropolitan area is provided from three primary sources: the Croton, the Catskill, and the Delaware Water Supply Systems. While the Catskill and Delaware Water Supply Systems are located about 50 miles north and northwest of the AIM Project facilities, portions of the AIM Project facilities would be located within the Croton Water Supply System. The Croton Water Supply System receives its supply of water from the Croton Watershed, which is also part of the New York City East of Hudson Watersheds. The Croton Watershed is generally bordered by the Hudson River to the west, Dutchess County to the north, the Connecticut state border to the east, and Kensico Reservoir to the south. This watershed is part of the system that serves 9 million people in urban areas of New York, as well as the 250,000 people in Westchester and Putnam counties. The Croton Watershed is protected under a long-term management plan by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP). The 2008 New York State section 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies identified phosphorus as a pollutant of concern for eight impaired reservoirs within the watershed (NYSDEC, 2009a). Typical pollutant sources include 4-39 As shown on figure 4.3.2-1, the Croton Watershed would be crossed by the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment between MPs 10.0 and 12.3 in the Town of Cortlandt and by the Southeast to MLV-19 Take-up and Relay segment between MPs 0.0 and 0.1 in the Town of Southeast. Algonquin would sequence construction activities to minimize the amount and duration of an open rightof-way within the watershed. Algonquin would use a separate construction crew to work in the 2.3-milelong stretch within the watershed and has also committed to an environmental inspection and compliance monitoring program to monitor and enforce compliance with all permit conditions to protect the environment during construction (see section 2.5). In addition, Algonquin is working with the NYCDEP to develop a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that addresses NYCDEP’s requirements for constructing within a NewYork City watershed. The Catskill Aqueduct is part of the New York City water supply system. It brings water from the Catskill Mountains to Yonkers where it connects to other parts of the system. During the scoping process and in response to the draft EIS, we received several comments about the Project’s impact on the aqueduct. Algonquin’s existing pipelines currently cross over the aqueduct. As currently proposed, Algonquin would remove its existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline and casing, but not disturb the existing protective concrete slab, pending concurrence from the NYCDEP. Algonquin would build the proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline above the aqueduct at a 50-foot offset from the existing line (see section 3.5.2.1).  This offset would provide sufficient vertical clearance between the new pipeline and the Catskill Aqueduct. Construction across the Catskill Aqueduct would occur using the open-cut method and is expected to take about 1 month to complete. Construction measures that would be used to minimize potential impacts on the aqueduct include installing an 8-inch-thick concrete slab about 2 feet above the aqueduct and installing steel casing around the pipeline. Additional cover over the casing would be required to provide adequate depth of cover between the casing pipe and grade. This cover would be at a gentle 3:1 grade per NYCDEP specifications. NYCDEP would require a Land Use Permit with detailed descriptions of work and additional information regarding impacts on the aqueduct resulting from construction and operation of the Project facilities. Algonquin would prepare final engineering designs to support NYCDEP’s load requirements for vehicles on their right-of-way, and would submit them for review and approval as part of the Land Use Permit application process. As indicated above, Algonquin is also working with the NYCDEP to develop a SWPPP that addresses NYCDEP’s requirements for constructing within a New York City watershed. Because Algonquin is still working with NYCDEP to develop a final crossing plan for the Catskill Aqueduct, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin should file with the Secretary its final site-specific crossing plan for the Catskill Aqueduct developed in consultation with the NYCDEP. The plan should be filed as critical energy infrastructure information in accordance with NYCDEP requirements. 4-40 FiAgure 4.3.2-1IM Project Croton River Watershed The Connecticut portion of the Project crosses 62 waterbodies within 6 subbasin level watersheds. Of these 62 waterbodies, 15 are perennial streams, 43 are intermittent streams, 3 are ephemeral streams, and 1 is a pond. Six of the proposed crossings are intermediate crossings and 56 are minor crossings. The Massachusetts portion of the Project crosses one perennial stream, which is a minor crossing located within one subbasin level watershed. AbovegroundFacilities No waterbodies would be impacted by the work at the existing and proposed aboveground facilities. However, a few aboveground facility sites are located in relatively close proximity to mapped waterbodies as detailed below. The Stony Point M&R Station in New York is located just northeast of Cedar Pond Brook. An unnamed tributary to Cedar Pond Brook is also located adjacent to the north boundary of the Stony Point M&R Station. The Stony Point Compressor Station is located to the east of an unnamed tributary to Cedar Pond Brook. This waterbody flows through a culvert under the permanent access road to the Station and would not be impacted during construction. The Cortlandt M&R Station in New York is located adjacent to an unnamed tributary to Hunter Brook. None of these waterbodies would be directly affected by construction oroperation of these facilities. In Connecticut, Coles Brook flows adjacent to the Cromwell Compressor Station and an unnamed tributary to Mount Hope River flows through a culvert under the permanent access road for the Chaplin Compressor Station. The Putnam M&R Station is about 0.1 mile northeast of the Quinebaug River and the Montville M&R Station is located to the north of an unnamed tributary to Stony Brook. The Farmington M&R Station is located about 0.1 mile north of Scott Swamp Brook. None of these waterbodies would be directly affected by construction and operation ofthesefacilities. The existing permanent access road to the Burrillville Compressor Station in Rhode Island crosses an unnamed stream near the entrance to the facility. The stream flows through a culvert under the access road and no impacts are anticipated during construction asthe station. In Massachusetts, the Norwood M&R Station is about 0.1 mile north of the Neponset River. The Wellesley M&R Station is less than 0.1 mile west of the Charles River. Neither of these waterbodies would be directly affectedby construction and operation ofthese facilities. Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards As described in Section 2.2.3, Algonquin would make use of three locations for pipe and contractor ware yards.  These locations consist ofexisting industrial/commerciallands and would resultin no impacts on waterbodies. Access Roads As described in section 2.2.4, Algonquin would use existing roads in the Project area as temporary and permanent access roads to the extent feasible. One new PAR would be constructed from the existing North Fall River M&R Station site to the new Assonet M&R Station. No waterbodies would be impacted by this new PAR. Five waterbodies would be crossed by the existing access roads. We do not anticipate impacts on any waterbodies asa result of the use ofthese existing access roads. 4-42 4.3.2.2 Sensitive Waterbodies Waterbodies may be considered sensitive to pipeline construction for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:  waters that do not meet state water quality standards associated with the water’s designated beneficial uses;  surface waters that have been designated for intensive water quality management;  waterbodiesthat support fisheries of specialconcern (i.e., EFH);  waterbodiesthat are crossed less than 3 miles upstream of a potable water intake;  waterbodies afforded national or state status forexceptional quality; and  waterbodieslisted on the National Rivers Inventory (NRI).  Other factors that can provide a basis for sensitivity include waterbodies located within a protected watershed, waterbodies and intermittent drainages that have steep banks and other characteristics that might contribute to high risk of erosion impacts, and surface waters that have important riparian areas. Table 4.3.2-1 identifies sensitive waterbodies that would be crossed by the Project. The table also provides details of known contamination, which is addressed in the following section. None of the proposed crossings are designated as EFH, though the proposed Hudson River crossing is located north of a designated EFHarea as described in section 4.6.2.4. Impaired Surface Watersand Contaminated Sediments Algonquin reviewed the EDR Report and the Section 303(d) lists of impaired waterbodies for New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts (NYSDEC, 2013d; CTDEEP, 2013e; RIDEM, 2012; MADEP, 2013b). Table 4.3.2-1 summarizes the waterbodies that were determined to have surface water impairment and/or potential sediment contamination. The proposed aboveground facilities would not affectany waterbodies. TABLE 4.3.2-1 Sensitive Waterbodies Crossed by the AIM Project  Basis for State/Facility/Waterbody I.D.

Listed impaired for E. coli with a designated use as ‘Recreation’ (CTDEEP, 2013e).  4-43 As described in section 2.3.1.2, the Hudson River would be crossed using the HDD method. Algonquin proposes to construct the remaining pipeline crossings using a dry construction technique (i.e., dam and pump, and/or flume) if flowing water is present at the time of the crossing to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation downstream. Waterbodies Containing Threatened or Endangered Species or CriticalHabitat Algonquin consulted with the various federal and state agencies to identify waterbodies that may contain federally or state-listed threatened or endangered or candidate species and their habitat. Additional information regarding specialstatus species is provided in section 4.7. Waterbodies that SupportFisheries of Special Concern Thirty of the Project waterbody crossings support fisheries of special concern. Eight waterbodies are waters with naturally occurring spawning populations of trout. One waterbody (the Hudson River) contains threatened and endangered species and anadromous fisheries. Fisheries of special concern are discussed in greater detail in section 4.6.2.2. National or State Recognized Exceptional Quality Waters The NYSDEC maintains a list of high quality Wild, Scenic and Recreational Rivers, rivers that have excellent scenic, ecological, recreational, historic, and scientific values (NYSDEC, 2013l). No State Recognized Exceptional Quality Waters would be affected by the Projectfacilities. New York State has adopted a Hudson River Estuary Action Agenda 2010-2014 (NYSDEC, 2010a).  Some of the specific goals ofthe Action Agenda are:  signature fisheries;  river and shoreline habitats;  streams and tributaries;  contaminant reduction; and  improvement and protection of the water quality of the Hudson River. Algonquin proposes to cross the Hudson River using the HDD method. Therefore, construction would not result in any adverse impacts on waterquality in the Hudson River (see section 4.3.2.6). The CTDEEP does not have a formal published list of state recognized exceptional or high-quality waters. The state designates surface waters as one of three Inland Surface Water Classifications that include Class AA (suitable for drinking), Class A (habitat and potential drinking water) and Class B (suitable for recreation) (CTDEEP, 2013r).  The proposed Project would cross 10 Class AA waters and 55 Class A waters. The RIDEM has no available list of exceptional quality waters and no waterbodies would be crossed in Rhode Island (RIDEM, 2013b). 4-44 The MADEP Surface Water Quality Standards (314 Code of Massachusetts Regulations [CMR] 4.00) define Outstanding Resource Waters (ORW), which include all Class A Public Water Supplies and their tributaries and any other waters specially designated by the MADEP because of their outstanding socioeconomic, recreational, ecological, and/or aesthetic values. ORWs along the proposed route were identified using the watershed delineations depicted in the MassGIS ORW datalayer (MassGIS, 2013b) and the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards Program publication Designated Outstanding Resource Waters of Massachusetts.  No ORWs would be impacted by the Project(MassGIS, 2013b). Public Water Supply Intakes Based on a review of available information, there are no surface water supply intakes located within 3 miles downstream of any waterbodies affected by the Project facilities in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island (NYSDOH, 2014; Connecticut Department of Public Health, 2013;MassGIS, 2013b). National Rivers Inventory No federal wild and scenic rivers or Natural Heritage Areas would be crossed by the Project (National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, 2013; National Park Service, 2013). However, the Hudson River has been designated by the EPA as an American Heritage River. Pursuant to Executive Order 13061, Federal Support of Community Efforts Along American Heritage Rivers, issued on September 11, 1997, the American Heritage Rivers initiative directs federal agencies to provide effective and efficient federal assistance to river communities, with the goal of enhancing natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation. 4.3.2.3 Waterbody Construction Procedures As described above, the pipeline segments would cross 102 waterbodies consisting of 85 minor crossings, 16 intermediate crossings, and 1 major crossing, the Hudson River. The Hudson River in New York and the Still River in Connecticut would be crossed using the HDD method. The remaining 100 crossings would be completed using a dry crossing method. At the request of the NYSDEC, Algonquin prepared a crossing methods analysis for all protected streams in New York. This information was included in appendix E of the section 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC) Application filed with the NYSDEC. A copy was also filed with the Secretary at the same time it was filed with the NYSDEC. Following the crossing methods analysis, Algonquin determined that using the HDD method would not be feasible at the remaining waterbodies when compared to the dry crossing method. The reasons varied from site to site, but, in general, included new temporary impacts on nearby residences, direct impacts on residential homes, and the need to acquire new easement rights for the permanent right-of-way for operation and maintenance of the pipeline.  Therefore, Algonquin has committed to using the dry crossing method to install the pipeline at all waterbody crossings in New York except the Hudson River. Similarly, HDDs at each of the waterbody crossings in Connecticut and Massachusetts would not be feasible. Factors in HDD design include the availability of a straight and relatively low relief laydown area for the pullback pipe section; the availability of large work areas at the HDD entry and exit points; surrounding terrain; land use; and operation concerns. Based on information from Algonquin, our review of Project mapping, and information we obtained during visits to the Project area, we conclude that the use of the HDD method at all waterbody crossings would be either technically infeasible, impractical, or would not result in a clear environmental advantage to the proposed dry crossing methods. Alternative construction methods evaluated for certain waterbody crossings are discussed in section 3.5.4. 4-45 The dry crossing method would be used to install Project pipeline facilities at all waterbody crossing locations if there is flowing water at the time of construction. Dry crossing methods involve installation of a flume pipe(s) and/or dam and pump prior to trenching to divert the stream flow over or around the construction area and allow trenching of the stream crossing in drier conditions isolated from the stream flow. Spoil removed during the trenching would be stored away from the water’s edge and protected by sediment containment structures. Pipe strings would be fabricated on one bank and either pulled across the stream bottom to the opposite bank or carried into place and lowered into the trench. Where these methods are employed, ATWS areas would be required for assembly of the pipe strings and spoil storage areas. Horizontal Directional Drill Algonquin would use the HDD crossing method at the Hudson River in New York and the Still River in Connecticut. At both crossings, Algonquin anticipates using the intersect method to complete the pilot hole. Additional details of the two HDD installations are provided below. These descriptions are based on the HDD feasibility report for each crossing provided by Algonquin (Hatch Mott MacDonald, 2014c and 2014d). To date, Algonquin has not provided a contingency plan that incorporates another location or another construction methodology for each of these HDD crossings.  If an HDD in its proposed location proves unsuccessful, Algonquin would be required to identify a new location for the crossing or new methodology, and request approval for the new location or methodology with all applicable agencies.  Therefore, we recommend that:  In the event of an unsuccessful HDD at the Hudson or Still Rivers, Algonquin should file with the Secretary a plan for the crossing of the waterbody. This should be a site-specific plan that includes scaled drawings identifying all areas that would be disturbed by construction. Algonquin should file this plan concurrent with the submission of its application to the USACE and other applicable agencies for a permit to construct using this alternative crossing plan. The Director of OEP must review and approve this plan in writing before construction of the alternative crossing. Hudson River HDD For the Hudson River HDD, the proposed entry/exit location on the west side of the river would be located within an abandoned and remediated power plant facility. The exact location on the property has been modified since the issuance of the draft EIS. Since that time, Algonquin has continued to finalize the design details of the Hudson River HDD. This included evaluating possible engineering options to safely penetrate the existing sheet pile wall at the previously proposed entry/exit side on the west side of the river. As a result, Algonquin relocated the western HDD entry/exit point approximately 850 feet northwest of the previously proposed location(see section 3.5.2).  The entry/exit hole location on the east side of the river would be located in a moderately sloping area that is part of an abandoned quarry operation. The east side would also function as the pipe string staging area. The staging area on the east side is limited and would require intermediate welds to fabricate the pipe string during pullback operations.  It is estimated thatthe HDD would take about 5 months to complete. Algonquin conducted an evaluation of the geological and geotechnical conditions of the proposed HDD alignment at the Hudson River.  The exploration program consisted of11 geotechnical bore holes in the vicinity of the Hudson River crossing. Two borings were drilled on the western and eastern shores of 4-46 the Hudson River, respectively. The remaining nine borings were drilled within the limits of the Hudson River. Soil/sediment samples were collected with a standard 2-inch split spoon sampler, and rock coring was conducted within the bedrock utilizing a 2.5-inch-inside diameter core barrel. Bedrock cores were measured for recovery and rock quality designations (RQD), described for lithology, and recorded. In addition to these bore holes, three bedrock probe holes were also drilled to the top of bedrock on the west side ofthe Hudson River to better define the bedrock surface on that side of the river. The locations of the bore holes were selected to provide geotechnical information to support design efforts for the crossing and to identify the location of a deep historic river channel that was known to exist further to the north of the Project area (in the vicinity of the Interstate 84 crossing of the Hudson River). The historic channel was intersected about 825 feet offshore of the west bank of the river where a soil boring encountered soil materials to a depth of about 285 feet below the river surface (about 220 feet below the river bottom). This channel was in-filled with about 40 feet of gravels, cobbles, and boulders. Soil materials above this consisted of a thick (125 feet) deposit of very soft clays, overlain by a layer of unconsolidated soil materials varying in thickness from about 35 to 60 feet. Gravels, cobbles, and boulders were also encountered just above the bedrock surface on the east side of the river, about 100 feet below the bottom of the river. These materials were overlain by up to 90 feet of very soft clay and unconsolidated soils. Bedrock consisting of limestone/dolostone was encountered at the bottom of each boring; however, the bedrock in the westernmost bore hole consisted of schist. Sands, silts, and clays typically present no significant challenge to an HDD installation. These materials are often described as good to excellent materials with regard to the feasibility of an HDD. Soils containing gravels and larger size particles (cobbles and boulders) range from marginally acceptable to unacceptable relative to the feasibility of an HDD, depending on the percentage of gravels by weight. Only those particles that can be suspended within the drilling fluid can be removed from the HDD bore hole. Gravel-sized particles tend to settle out and accumulate along the bottom of the bore hole. Large soil particles cannot be suspended by the drilling fluid. To properly remove the cuttings and support the open bore, the drilling fluid must remain within the bore without excessive loss to the surrounding formations. Deposits of gravel and cobble-sized clasts can allow drilling fluids to escape into the surrounding formations.  As a result, the bore may collapse, making reaming and pipe pullback operations extremely difficult, if not impossible. Algonquin proposes to install the HDD using a drill path in the soft soils above the bedrock and old channel lag deposits. The substrate crossed by the adjusted Hudson River HDD alignment would not change (i.e., like the previously proposed HDD alignment, the new HDD alignment would remain within the soft sediments beneath the river). The intersect HDD installation technique would be required for the Hudson River Crossing. This is primarily due to the required length of the installation, anticipated soil conditions, and requirements for temporary conductor casings on each end of the HDD alignment. This method consists of drilling the pilot hole from both ends of the alignment and meeting at a target location established within the middle section of the HDD bore. The horizontal length of the proposed HDD installation from entry to exit would be 5,090 feet. The depth of cover beneath the Hudson River bottom would range from 20 feet at the western shore to 26 feet at the eastern shore. At its deepest point the pipe would be installed 100 feetbelowthe river bed.  A site-specific crossing plan is provided in appendix J. Prior to initiating the drill at the Hudson River, Algonquin would install telescoping casings of decreasing sizes on both sides of the crossing to a depth of about 90 feet. The largest diameter casing would be a minimum of 60 inches. The casings would not reach the bedrock interface at the Hudson River crossing because they would be installed completely in soft sediments and would not cross the barrier between the upper and lower aquifer at this location. Grouting of the casing annulus would not be necessary as the casing would be driven or vibrated into the sediments and would not require installation 4-47 inside a pre-drilled bore hole, thus there is no annulus outside the casing. The smaller diameter steel casings located on both sides of the crossing would be removed prior to pullback, whereas the larger diameter casings would stay in place during pullback operations. The larger diameter casing located on both sides of the crossing would be removed once the pullback is complete. Algonquin completed a hydraulic fracture evaluation for the Hudson River HDD generally in accordance with the Delft Geotechnics Method outlined in appendix B of the USACE report Installation of Pipelines beneath Levees Using Horizontal Directional Drilling (Staheli et al., 1998). This method is used to estimate the maximum effective pressure (i.e. drilling fluid pressure) that can be induced during an HDD operation within a particular soil horizon. This pressure is then compared with the fluid pressure required to induce slurry flow within the HDD bore to determine the potential for a hydraulic fracture (resulting in the potential for an inadvertent release of drilling fluid) for a given HDD alignment. The required fluid pressure for an HDD installation is governed by the drilling fluid weight (commonly referred to as the mud weight), installation length and depth, and drilling fluid flow properties (plastic viscosity, yield point, etc.). The Delft Geotechnics Method assumes a uniform column of soil above any point of interest along the HDD alignment. Where an increased risk of hydraulic fracture is identified, it does not necessarily mean that a hydraulic fracture would occur. The results of the preliminary hydraulic fracture evaluation suggest a relatively high potential for hydraulic fracture in the soft sediments of the Hudson River HDD alignment. Generally, when hydraulic fracture potential is high or anticipated for a given installation, the bore can be placed within geotechnical materials that are more favorable for an HDD and reduce the hydraulic fracture potential. This typically involves increasing the installation depth, thereby increasing the depth of cover above the drill path and pipeline.  However, for the proposed Hudson River crossing, a deeper drill path option that would provide sufficient resistance to the predicted fluid pressure is not practicable due to the presence of shallow bedrock on either side of the crossing, the extreme depth of the historic river channel on the western side of the crossing, and the presence of gravel and cobble channel lag deposits in portions of the subsurface. An HDD alignment entirely within the bedrock is also not practicable due to the depth of the soil/bedrock interface at the crossing location. The depth and topography of the bedrock profile along the proposed crossing is a result of the historic river channel, particularly on the western side ofthe crossing. The risk of hydraulic fracture and a potential inadvertent release of drilling fluid is highest during completion of the pilot hole. As described above, Algonquin would install the HDD crossing of the Hudson River using the intersect HDD installation technique. This approach essentially reduces the length and duration of completing the pilot hole by 50 percent, since the drill path is advanced from both sides of the crossing and meets near the middle of the drill path. Additionally, installing the HDD crossing in the softer sediments, as proposed, rather than in bedrock would significantly shorten the duration of construction required to complete the HDD operation. As noted above, where model calculations identify an increased risk of hydraulic fracture, it does not necessarily mean that a hydraulic fracture will occur during actual drill operations. With advanced knowledge of the higher potential for hydraulic fracture the drilling contractor can also adjust drill conditions to reduce the risk of fracture. If an inadvertent release is observed in an accessible upland area near shore, proper containment structures would be used to contain the release. If the release cannot be contained, the operator would suspend drilling operations until appropriate containment is in place. It is possible that some drilling fluid would be released into the river during a hydraulic fracture; however, the volume would be minimal and would not accumulate due to the rapid drilling rates. Due to the river current, marine traffic, existing turbidity, and other pollutants that contribute to the discoloration of a major waterbody like the Hudson River, it is unlikely that an inadvertent release would be identifiable. It is also unlikely that the drilling fluid would accumulate in the navigation channel or a major waterbody like the Hudson River. Additional information is presented in the BDP Plan (see appendix J). 4-48 Based on our assessment of the geotechnical conditions at the proposed HDD crossing of the Hudson River, we conclude that the HDD method is an appropriate technique for installing the pipeline at this river crossing, and that the HDD crossing could be completed successfully, despite the risk of hydraulic fracture during completion of the pilot hole. We also find that the BDP Plan and additional measures identified above would minimize the possibility of an inadvertent release to the extent feasible, and that, if an inadvertent release was to occur, appropriate measures would be implemented to minimize any resulting impacts. Interstate 84/Still River HDD The proposed HDD crossing of Interstate 84 and the Still River is located in the City of Danbury, Connecticut. The proposed HDD entry location would be located within a rest area southwest of Interstate 84. The HDD entry location is relatively flat and easily accessed. The entry location would also serve as the preferred pipe string staging area. The staging area is limited and would require intermediate welds to fabricate the pipe string during pull back operations. The proposed exit location would be to the east of Mill Plain Road. The HDD crossing method would be used in this location to avoid impacts on Interstate 84, the Still River, and a large wetland complex associated with the river.  It is estimated that the HDD would take about 7 months to complete. Algonquin conducted an evaluation of the geological and geotechnical conditions of the proposed HDD alignment at the Interstate 84/Still River crossing. The exploration program consisted of nine geotechnical bore holes completed in the vicinity of the crossing. Two borings were drilled to the south of Interstate 84 and one boring was drilled to the north of Mill Plain Road. The remaining six borings were drilled between Interstate 84 and Mill Plain Road in the vicinity of the wetland and auto dealership property. Soil/sediment samples were collected with a standard 2-inch split spoon sampler, and rock coring was conducted within the bedrock utilizing a 2.5-inch-inside diameter core barrel. Bedrock cores were measured for recovery and RQDs, described for lithology, and recorded. The locations of the bore holes were selected to provide geotechnical information to support design efforts for this crossing and to identify areas of increased risk resulting from potentialsubsurface conditions. In general the geotechnical borings indicated the presence of coarse-grained deposits of sand and gravel overlying gneissic bedrock. On the southwest side of the crossing, in the vicinity of the entry location, deposits of dense sand and gravel about 80 feet thick overlying alternating layers of schistose gneiss and granitic gneiss were encountered. As the alignment progresses to the northeast, the bedrock surface becomes much more shallow, rising to between 19 and 37 feet below ground surface, as the alignment approaches the wetland area. The three borings collected within the wetland contained much thicker overburden deposits of sand and gravel overlying decomposed gneissic bedrock materials. The sand and gravel deposits beneath the wetland ranged from 86 to 140 feet thick. At one boring location beneath the wetland, no competent bedrock was encountered and no bedrock core was recovered to the termination depth of the boring at 250 feet below ground surface. Farther northeast, the two cores drilled on the auto dealership property showed that the bedrock surface becomes shallower as the alignment progresses northeast, with bedrock ranging between 121 feet and 52 feet below ground surface. Both borings also encountered extensive deposits of gravel, cobbles, and boulders overlying the bedrock. The last core in the vicinity of the exit location encountered decomposed bedrock at a depth of just 5 feet below ground surface; competent bedrock was not encountered until 47 feet below ground surface in this location. The presence of cobbles and boulders, and zones of poor bedrock quality encountered during the geotechnical investigation would pose significant risks to bore hole stability, steering and guidance of drilling equipment during pilot hole completion, and could potentially result in damage to the pipeline 4-49 during installation. Bedrock can be highly variable and can be classified as being excellent to unacceptable with respect to HDD feasibility. Competent bedrock is well suited for HDD as the bore tends to remain open for extended periods of time. However, heavily weathered, jointed, fractured, or fissured bedrock can present challenges with respect to bore stability and drilling fluid migration away from the HDD bore. Poor quality bedrock can present the same challenges as coarse granular deposits, if fracturing and jointing is extensive, and can present an unacceptable risk in terms of feasibility for an HDD installation. The risk associated with poor quality bedrock stems from the inability to support and maintain stability of the bore hole. This risk increases with RQD ratings below 60 percent, with lower RQD ratings presenting higher risks. A small zone of low RQD within a drill path can often be accommodated and does not present a significant risk to an HDD installation. However, an extensive zone of low RQD can present challenges. For the proposed Interstate 84 crossing, Algonquin has designed the drill to avoid areas containing low RQD ratings to the maximum extent possible; however, there exists a portion of the drill alignment that is located within an area of low RQD and could pose a risk during the drilling of the initial pilot bore hole. This area is located between stations 24+00 and 32+00 (borings B-4, B-7, and B-9) where decomposed bedrock consisting of saprolotoc (highly decomposed) gneiss and RQDs were either mixed or non-existent. To address these risks, Algonquin has designed the crossing to install the pipeline within the highest quality bedrock to the maximum extent practicable. Additionally, Algonquin would install temporary conductor casings at both the entry and exit points. The casings would be installed to bedrock at the entry and exit holes, minimizing the potential for inadvertent returns in these shallower areas of the drill path where the drill would encounter deposits of sands and highly weathered bedrock materials. Algonquin would also use the intersect HDD installation strategy for the Interstate 84 HDD crossing. This method would be used primarily due to the required length ofthe installation, strength of the bedrock materials, and requirement for temporary conductor casings on both sides of the crossing. The true length of the proposed HDD installation would be 3,736 feet (the horizontal length, entry to exit, would be 3,697 feet). The minimum depth of cover would be about 65 feet as the alignment approaches Mill Plain Road. At its deepest point, between the wetland and Interstate 84, the pipe would be installed about 172 feet below ground surface.  A site-specific crossing plan is provided in appendix J. The results of the preliminary hydraulic fracture evaluation for the Interstate 84/Still River HDD indicate that the required bore pressure to facilitate the installation process would be well below the allowable bore pressure along the majority of the installation. This suggests there is little risk of hydraulic fracture along the drill path and a low probability for inadvertent returns of drilling fluid. The risk of hydraulic fracture (resulting in the potential for an inadvertent return of drilling fluid) is highest during completion of the pilot hole, particularly near the entry and exit holes due to the shallow depth of cover. To minimize the potential for inadvertent returns near the entry and exit sides of the drill, and to facilitate HDD operations and drilling fluid recycling, Algonquin would install telescoping casings of decreasing sizes on both sides of the crossing. The casings would be installed to a depth sufficient to intercept the bedrock at each end of the crossing. The largest diameter casing would be a minimum of 60 inches. Grouting of the casing annulus would not be necessary as the casing would be driven/vibrated into overburden sediments and not be installed inside a pre-drilled hole, thus there is no annulus outside the casing. The smaller diameter steel casings located on both sides of the crossing would be removed prior to pullback whereas the larger diametercasings would stay in place duringpullback operations. Based on our initial assessment of the geotechnical conditions at the proposed HDD crossing of Interstate 84 and the Still River, we conclude that the HDD method is an appropriate technique for installing the pipeline at this crossing, and that with the implementation of the mitigation measures Algonquin proposes to employ, the HDD crossing could be completed successfully.  However, Algonquin has indicated that additional investigation would be required to verify the existence, type, and depth of 4-50 any existing bridge foundations where the HDD alignment would cross Ridgebury Road. This investigation could identify additional mitigation measures that are needed to address any existing bridge foundations associated with Ridgebury Road.  Therefore, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the Interstate 84/Still River HDD, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of OEP, a revised site-specific plan for the crossing if additional measures are needed to address any existing bridge foundations associated with the alignment across Ridgebury Road. Drilling andBlasting atWaterbodies Some limited blasting may be required along the Project pipeline segments to increase the depth and width of the existing trenches to accommodate the larger diameter pipeline. Based on a review of the USDA soils data and field surveys, there are nine streams (see table 4.3.2-2) with shallow bedrock that may require blasting during construction (USDA, 2013d). Trench crews would determine if rock is presentand if blasting would be required. TABLE 4.3.2-2 Waterbody Crossings That May Require Blasting During Construction for the AIM Project  Crossing Width State/Facility/Stream Name a Stream I.D.

Susquetonscut Brook crossed by the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment in Connecticut is considered a warmwater fishery, and the Unnamed Tributary to Stony Brook crossed by the E-1 System Lateral Loop segment is considered a coldwater fishery (see section 4.6.2). None of the other waterbodiesthat may require blasting are considered sensitive.  4.3.2.4 Extra Workspaces Within 50 Feet ofWaterbodies The FERC’s Procedures stipulates that all ATWS should be located at least 50 feet from waterbodies except where an alternative measure has been requested by Algonquin and approved by the FERC. Algonquin identified certain areas where they believe site-specific conditions do not allow for a 50-foot setback of ATWS from waterbodies. Table 4.3.2-3 identifies the locations and the reasons why Algonquin believes the ATWS is justified. Based on our review, we concur that all of Algonquin’s requests are justified. 4.3.2.5 Hydrostatic Test Water Algonquin would verify the structural integrity of the piping associated with the Project facilities before placingthemin servicebyconductinghydrostatic testing.  Testingwould be completed bycapping installed pipe segments with test manifolds, filling these segments with water, pressurizing the water, then checking for pressure losses due to pipeline leakage. The integrity of the piping at aboveground facilities would also be hydrostatically tested. Algonquin estimates a need for a total of about 10,082,645 gallons of water to conduct the hydrostatic testing of pipeline segments and aboveground facilities. Of this total, about 9,610,245 gallons would be for testing pipeline segments and 472,400 gallons would be for testing aboveground facilities. The estimated hydrostatic test water requirements for each facility are listed in tables 4.3.2-4 and 4.3.2-5. Following testing, all test water would be discharged into dewatering structures located in upland areas and within the construction work area at a rate of 1,000 to 1,200 gpm in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP and all applicable permits. Samples of the discharge water would be collected and tested in accordance with federaland state permit requirements. The Hudson River HDD and the Interstate 84/Still River HDD pipe segments would be hydrostatically tested before and after the HDD pull back activities are completed. The other pipeline segments would be hydrostatically tested in one section, with the exception of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay and West Roxbury Lateral segments, which would be tested in two sections. Following testing of the pipeline, the water would be discharged into dewatering structures located in upland areas and within the construction work area in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP. The discharge rate would range between 1,000 and 1,200 gpm and would be regulated to maintain proper function of the dewatering structure. The majority of this water would infiltrate the soil and recharge the local groundwater system. NYSDEC requested that Algonquin comply with the hydrostatic testing best management practices provided to them by NYSDEC. Algonquin would follow the procedures outlined in the E&SCP. 4-52 TABLE 4.3.2-3 Requested Modifications for Additional Temporary Workspace Near Waterbodies for the AIM Project  Distance from State/Facility/Waterbody ATWS ATWS Size Resource Area ID MP (acres) (feet) ATWS Justification  NEW YORK Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay B13-RLR-S3D 1.1 0.5 0-30 Extra workspace is required for multiple wetland B13-RLR-S3I and waterbody crossings at Call Hollow Road crossing B13-RLR-S3J B13-RLR-S6 2.2 0.9 0 Extra workspace is required for Palisades Interstate Parkway crossing B13-RLR-S10 3.0 0.1 0 Extra workspace is required for wetland and Highway 210 crossings B13-RLR-S10A 3.0 0.3 0 Extra workspace is required for wetland and Highway 210 crossings Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay A13-SPLR-S1 0.4 0.1 30 Extra workspace is required for waterbody crossing with steep slopes near residential development B13-SPLR-S2 5.9 0.6 0 Extra workspace is required for wetland and waterbody crossings B13-SPLR-S21A 10.3 0.5 0 Extra workspace is required for wetland and B13-SPLR-S21B waterbody crossings at Cortlandt M&R Station CONNECTICUT Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay B13-SELR-S1 3.3 0.1 0 Extra workspace is required for wetland and waterbody crossings near residential development at Westville Road crossing E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay A13-ELR-S1 0.7 0.1 35 Extra workspace is required for wetland and waterbody crossings B13-ELR-S11 4.9 0.2 0 Extra workspace is required for multiple wetland and waterbody crossings B13-ELR-S5B 5.8 0.1 35 Extra workspace is required for railroad, waterbody and wetland crossings B13-ELR-S18 8.5 0.2 0 Extra workspace is required for Wisconsin Avenue road crossing (waterbody flows diagonally under road) B13-ELR-S18 8.5 0.2 30 Extra workspace is required for Wisconsin Avenue road crossing (waterbody flows diagonally under road) B13-ELR-S24 8.9 0.1 35 Extra workspace is required for large wetland complex  4-53 TABLE 4.3.2-4 Potential Hydrostatic Testing Water Sources for Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  Estimated Volume Discharge State, Facility (gallons) Water Source (MP)  New York Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and 1,242,537 Municipal 0.0/3.3 Relay Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay 4,677,562 Municipal/ 0.0/4.1/8.9/12.1 Old Verplanck Quarry Lake Hudson HDD a 284,985 Old Verplanck Quarry Lake 3.2/3.9 Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay 56,997 Municipal 0.0 Connecticut Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay 1,614,918 Municipal 1.5/2.2/4.4 Interstate 84/Still River HDD a 296,385 Municipal 1.5/2.2 Line-36A Loop Extension 558,339 Municipal 0.0/2.0 E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay 501,816 Municipal 0.0/9.1 E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension 40,324 Municipal 0.0/1.3 Massachusetts West Roxbury Lateral 336,382 Municipal 0.0/4.3/5.1 TOTAL PIPELINE FACILITIES 9,610,245 ____________________ a HDD sections would be tested immediately after installation.

Pipeline construction can affect surfacewatersinseveralways, includingmodifying the existing aquatic habitat, increasing runoff and the rate of in-stream sediment loading, and increasing turbidity levels. Clearing and grading of streambanks, in-stream trenching and backfilling, and trench dewatering can introduce sediment directly or indirectly into the water column. Surface water impacts can also result from inadvertent releases of drilling fluids in the water column during HDD operations, hydrostatic test water discharges that erode stream beds and banks, and potential spills of hazardous liquids such asfuels and lubricants. The clearing and grading of the waterbody banks associated with dry crossings (i.e., flume or dam-and-pump crossing methods) would disturb riparian vegetation and soils. Blasting could permanently alter the stream channel. Heavy equipment used during construction could also compact upland and riparian soils, which could reduceinfiltration and cause greaterrunoffto waterbodies. Long-term impacts on water quality can result from alteration of the waterbody banks. If not stabilized and revegetated properly, soil erosion can continue after construction, depositing sediments in the waterbodies. The level of impact of the proposed Project on surface waters would depend on precipitation events, sediment loads, stream area/velocity, channelintegrity, and bed material. Trench Dewatering During construction, the open trench may accumulate water, either from the seepage of groundwater or from precipitation. Where dewatering is necessary, the trench water would be removed and directed into well-vegetated uplands and/or filter bags, as described in Algonquin’s E&SCP to remove sediment or other contaminants and prevent heavily silt-laden water from flowing into any adjacent waterbodies or wetlands. We find these measures acceptable; however, NYSDEC was particularly concerned about trench dewatering and requested that Algonquin commit to isolating shorter portions of trench to reduce the volume of trench water that would need to be handled at one time. Algonquin has provided typical designs for proposed trenchdewatering structures and committed to using an alternative trench dewatering structure that involves a geotextile floor surrounded by a minimum of one row of staked hay bales installed around the perimeter of a filter bag dewatering location.  This would provide additional filtration at specific locations if the EI determines the filter bag dewatering structure alone is not adequate. Algonquin also indicated that the amount of trench dewatering would be minimized by limiting the amount of open trench or by installing soil plugs in the open trench to isolate the trench length in need of dewatering in a specific work area. Dry Crossings Construction-related impacts associated with the dry crossing method would be limited to short periods of increased turbidity before installation of the pipeline during the assembly of the upstream and downstream dams and following installation of the pipeline when the dams are pulled and flow across the restored work area is re-established. Use of the measures identified in the E&SCP would minimize these potential short-and long-term impacts, including minimization of clearing of streamside vegetation, installation and maintenance of temporary and permanent erosion controls, and minimization of the duration ofin-stream construction. Stream bed and bank contours would be re-established and stabilized prior to returning flow to the waterbody channel. Otherwise, completed stream crossings would be stabilized within 24 hours of backfilling. Original stream bed and bank contours would be reestablished and biodegradable material, such as mulch, jute thatching, or bonded fiber matrix blankets, would be installed on the stream banks to 4-55 Long-term impacts associated with pipeline operation and maintenance would be relatively minor. Stream banks would be stabilized and revegetated following installation of the pipeline and post-construction vegetation maintenance would be limited to the permanent right-of-way pursuant to the E&SCP. Algonquin has also incorporated several route and workspace modifications into its proposed Project to reduce the number of waterbody crossings or minimize other impacts on waterbodies. For example, as a result of field visits with the USACE, Algonquin incorporated a route and workspace adjustment to avoid direct in-stream impacts on Dividend Brook. Previously there were five crossings of Dividend Brook and with the route and workspace adjustment, there would be no crossings of this waterbody. In addition, a crossing of Mother Brook along the West Roxbury Lateral would be avoided by placing the new pipeline above a box culvert to accommodate the pipeline within Washington Street. Section 3.5.2 summarizes all of the route alternatives, variations, and Project design modifications evaluated afterthe draft EIS to minimize impacts on various resources, including waterbodies.  Blasting If blasting in waterbodies is required, the primary impact that could occur is a permanent alteration of the stream channel. Algonquin would follow the procedures identified in its E&SCP and Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E) to minimize impacts associated with blasting. We find these procedures to be acceptable. In-stream work in Susquetonscut Brook would occur during the appropriate timing window for warmwater fisheries (June 1 through November 30) and in the Unnamed Tributary to Stony Brook within the appropriate coldwater fisheries timing window (June 1 through September 30) unless expressly permitted or further restricted by the appropriate federal or state agency in writing on a site-specific basis. Additional measures to minimize impacts on fisheries are described in section 4.6.2.3. Also, in accordance with the FERC Procedures, Algonquin would need to file with the Secretary a schedule identifying when blasting would occur within each waterbody greater than 10 feet wide and within any designated coldwater fishery.  Algonquin would restore steam beds following blasting and installation of the pipeline. Prior to backfilling, the trench would be inspected for any significant bedrock cracks or fissures. Any fissures would be filled with bentonite to seal the gap and prevent any infiltration of stream flow into the ground. Restoration of the stream bed would include backfilling the trench with sand to protect the newly installed pipeline and then replacement of appropriately sized trench spoil. Algonquin would replace the native stream bed material on top of the excavated trench-line to restore the original stream bed contours. Impacts would be temporary in nature and would be restored as near as practicable to preconstruction contours. With these measures, we conclude that blasting, if required, would not result in any significant impacts on streams. Algonquin is continuing to consult with CTDEEP during the review of its section 401 WQC application. Algonquin has indicated it would address any impact minimization or mitigation measures for blasting in streams during the review process. Algonquin is also consulting with NYSDEC during the State’s review of the New York section 401 WQC. NYSDEC has requested that Algonquin provide its in-stream blasting procedures and evaluate other methods of construction to avoid blasting in streams. Algonquin has indicated it will continue to discuss the construction method with the NYSDEC as part of the permit process. 4-56 The primary impact that could occur as a result of the HDD method is the inadvertent release of drilling fluid (or drilling mud) directly or indirectly into the waterbody. Drilling fluid may leak through previously unidentified fractures in the material underlying the river bed, in the area of the mud pits or tanks, or along the drill path due to unfavorable ground conditions. Although drilling fluid consists of non-toxic materials, in large quantities the release of drilling fluid into a waterbody could affect fisheries or other aquatic organisms by causing turbidity in a waterbody and/or temporary coating the waterbody bed with a layer of clay. The probability of an inadvertent release is greatest when the drill bit is working nearthe surface. When surface waters are crossed by HDD within bedrock, the most common way for drilling fluids to reach the surfaceofthe river bottomis alongverticalfractures.  This eventis commonlyreferred to as hydro-geologic fracture. The geotechnical borings along the alignment of the proposed Hudson River HDD crossing alignment indicated the presence of a range of soil materials including gravel, cobbles, boulders, bedrock, very soft clays, unconsolidated soil, loose sands, and sand and gravel. The results were used to develop a conceptual profile for the Hudson River HDD alignment that would place the drill path in areas of very soft clays, loose sand, and unconsolidated sediments, avoiding the gravel, cobble, boulders, and bedrock areas identified. Preliminary estimates of the potential for hydraulic fracture at the Hudson River crossing indicated a relatively high potential for fracture (potentially leading to an inadvertent return of drilling fluid), particularly during pilot hole completion.  Drilling through areas of softer sediments as planned for the Hudson River HDD would shorten the amount of time required to complete the HDD operation and, thus, the amount of time inadvertent releases of drilling fluid to the river could occur. Additionally, prior to drilling Algonquin proposes to use telescoping casings on both sides of the Hudson River prior to drilling to a depth of about 90 feet. The smaller diameter steel casings would be removed prior to pullback while the larger casings would remain in place permanently. Presence ofthe casings would further reduceany inadvertent releases into the waterbody.  Preliminary estimates of the potential for hydraulic fracture at the Interstate 84/Still River crossing in Connecticut indicated a very low potential for fracture (potentially leading to an inadvertent return of drilling fluid). To further minimize the potential for inadvertent returns, particularly near the entry and exit locations, Algonquin proposed to install telescoping casings on both sides of the crossing.  The casing would be installed to intersect the bedrock at both sides of the drill path and would minimize the potential for inadvertent returns to the ground surface near the entry and exit sides of the drill and facilitate drilling fluid recycling. Algonquin has developed a BDP Plan (see appendix J) that describes how the HDD operations would be monitored to minimize the potential for inadvertent returns and includes general procedures for cleanup of drilling mud releases at the two HDD locations. We find the BDP Plan to be acceptable. In the event an HDD hole needed to be abandoned during construction, Algonquin would implement measures to seal the abandoned portion of the hole and drill path. Abandonment procedures would include leaving the bore hole full of bentonite slurry and soils/cuttings. The bentonite slurry and soils/cuttings would fill the void and the upper 50 to 100 feet of the bore hole would be grouted with concentrated cement. The drill pipe would be inserted into the hole to a designated distance below ground. The initial grout would be lightweight, expansive, and quick setting. A plug would then be set over a distance of about 30 feet as the volume of the abandoned hole is filled. The drill pipe would then be retracted and the grout would be allowed to set. The drill pipe or a tremie tube would then be reinserted to the top of the plug, and expansive grout would be pumped to fill the hole as the drill pipe is retracted. Algonquin would attempt to salvage a portion of the hole that was not abandoned and drill the balance of the new hole within a few feet of the existing hole, if the near surface area were abandoned. If the near surface area is still suitable for the HDD, then Algonquin would adjust the pilot hole or reaming activities downhole and continue drillingoperations. 4-57 Hydrostatic Test Water Algonquin developed a hydrostatic testing procedure that is included in the E&SCP and describes how the hydrostatic testing would be conducted and how the water would be discharged. During water intake, downstream flow rates would be maintained to protect aquatic life, waterbody uses, and provide downstream withdrawals of water by existing users. Algonquin is not proposing to use any chemicals for testing or for drying the pipeline following hydrostatic testing; therefore, there would be no surface water impacts due to hydrostatic testing activities. Sampling of discharge water would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP to document water quality at the time of discharge in accordance with applicable discharge permits. Additionally, discharge rates would be regulated using energy dissipation devices to prevent erosion, streambed scour, suspension of sediments, flooding, or excessive stream flow. Therefore, we conclude that hydrostatic testing would not significantly affect water resources. Hazardous Material Spills and Contaminated Sediments Accidental spills and leaks of hazardous materials associated with equipment trailers, the refueling or maintenance of vehicles; and the storage of fuel, oil, and other fluids can have immediate effects on aquatic resources and could contaminate a waterbody downstream of the release point.  Impacts associated with the spills or leaks of hazardous liquids would be avoided or minimized by restricting the location of refueling (at least 100 feet from a wetland or waterbody) and storage facilities and by requiring cleanup in the event of a spill or leak. Implementation of the measures in the Algonquin’s SPCC Plan would minimize the potential for surface water impacts associated with an inadvertent spill of hazardous materials. The SPCC Plan identifies preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of a spill, such as secondary containment for petroleum products, daily equipment inspection for leaks, and restrictions on the transport of potentially hazardous materials to the construction work area. The SPCC Plan also specifies measures to contain and clean up a spill should one occur. Implementation of the Applicant’s SPCC Plan would adequately address the storage and transfer of hazardous materials and petroleum products, and the appropriate responsein the event of a spill. Unexpected contamination would be addressed by following the Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures developed by Algonquin, which we find to be acceptable. Sites would be assessed for their historical land use and by evaluating the area. If contamination is encountered, work would be stopped and appropriate cleanup measures would be employed. Work would resume only after cleanup has been completed. By following these procedures, there would be no significant impacts on surface waters if unexpected contamination is encountered. Conclusion Pipeline construction activities would be conducted in accordance with the Algonquin’s E&SCP; SPCC Plan; Unexpected Contamination Encounters Procedures; Rock Removal Plan; BDP Plan; and construction stormwater plans and permits, including the SWPPP being developed in consultation with the NYCDEP to address concerns about crossing New York City watersheds. Applicable construction stormwater BMPs would be implemented to prevent runoff from contaminated and non-contaminated sites to impaired waters. Construction activities would be temporary in nature and consist primarily of shallow excavation for pipeline installation. Waterbody crossings that do not require blasting would be completed within 24 to 48 hours and stream bed and bank contours would be restored and stabilized following construction activities. With these protective measures in place, and our additional 4-58 The operation of the new Project facilities would not result in any impacts on surface water use or quality unless maintenance activities involving pipe excavation and repair in or near streams are required. In such a case, the impacts would be similar to those described for pipeline construction. 4.4 WETLANDS Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions (Environmental Laboratory, 1987). Wetlands are often a source of significant biodiversity and serve a variety of functions including flood control, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and improving water quality.  Wetlands in the Project area are regulated at the federal and state levels. At the federal level, the USACE has authority under section 404 of the CWA to review and issue permits for activities that would result in the discharge ofdredged orfillmaterialinto waters of the United States, includingwetlands. Section 401 of the CWA requires that proposed dredge and fill activities under section 404 be reviewed and certified by the designated state agency so that the proposed Project would meet state water quality standards.  The designated state agencies in the Project area are the NYSDEC, CTDEEP, and MADEP (no wetlands would be affected in Rhode Island). In New York and Connecticut, wetlands are also regulated at the local level. For this Project, activities in New York will be reviewed by Rockland and Westchester Counties; the Towns of Southeast, Yorktown, Cortlandt, Haverstraw, and Stony Point; the City of Peekskill; and the Villages of Buchanan and Pomona, but Algonquin is not required to obtain local wetland permits in New York. Activities in Connecticut will be reviewed by municipal inland wetlands and watercourse agencies (IWWC). The municipal Connecticut agencies that will review Project information are the Cromwell IWWC, Danbury Environmental Impact Commission, Franklin IWWC, Lebanon IWWC, Montville IWWC, Norwich Inland Wetland, Watercourse and Conservation Commission, and Rocky Hill IWWC. Each IWWC will have an opportunity to review Project information and provide comments, but Algonquin is not required to obtain local wetland permits in Connecticut. 4.4.1 Existing Wetland Resources Wetlands within the majority of the Project area were delineated during field surveys conducted in 2013 and are identified in table K-1 in appendix K.  Algonquindelineated wetland boundaries using the methodologies described in the USACE Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory, 1987) and the Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral and Northeast Region (Version 2) (USACE, 2011). Portions of three wetlands located outside the permanent easement in New York and one in Connecticut were delineated using aerial photo interpretation, existing hydric soil data, and an evaluation of local hydrologic conditions and drainage patterns in the area to provide wetland boundaries because the landowner did not grant survey permission.  The proposed pipeline facilities would result in 160 wetland crossings, including 76 in New York and 84 in Connecticut. In some cases the Project facilities would include multiple crossings of the same wetland. There would be no wetland impacts in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. Detailed information about each wetland potentially affected by the Project is provided in table K-1 in appendix K. A summary of the wetland impacts associated with construction and operation of the Project is presented in section 4.4.4.  No wetlandswould be affected atany ofthe aboveground facility sites. 4-59 Algonquin proposes to use three locations for pipe and contractor ware yards. These sites are all existing industrial/commercial facilities with no wetlands present within the area proposed for use. No impacts on wetlands or waterbodies would result from the use of thesesites for the Project. Algonquin would use existing roads for temporary and permanent access along the Project route and would not impact any wetlands. In areas were wetlands are adjacent to an existing access road, construction crews would avoid the wetland. 4.4.1.1 Wetland Types Wetland types were assigned based on the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) classifications as described in Cowardin et al. (1979). Four basic wetland types were delineated in the Project area. Wetlands that are classified as riverine and lacustrine are listed under waterbodies in section 4.3.2. The basic wetland typesthat were delineated in the proposed Project area are discussed below. Palustrine Forested Wetlands The majority of forested wetlands identified in the Project area are classified as palustrine forested (PFO) broad-leaved deciduous wetlands, found in association with streams and seeps or as isolated depressions. These wetlands typically occur in areas where the topography is low and flat or along waterbodies. PFO wetland cover types are dominated by trees and shrubs that have developed a tolerance to a seasonal high water table. In order to be characterized as forested, a wetland must be dominated by trees and shrubs that are at least six meters tall (Cowardin et. al., 1979). PFO wetlands typically have a mature tree canopy which, depending upon the species and density, can have a broad range of understory and groundcover community components. Tree species identified in the Project area include red maple, yellow birch, black birch, green ash, slippery elm, and American elm. Palustrine Scrub-Shrub Wetlands The palustrine scrub-shrub (PSS) wetland cover type includes areas that are dominated by saplings and shrubs that typically form a low and compact structure less than 20 feet tall (Cowardin et. al., 1979). The structure and composition of the vegetation within this cover type may be influenced by the water regime and, where located within existing right-of-ways, by utility maintenance practices. Most of these communities are seasonally flooded and often saturated to the surface. Many of the PSS wetlands along the Project pipeline segments are associated with emergent wetlands as part of large complexes. These PSS wetlands are also the dominant along existing electric transmission right-of-ways. Shrub species identified in the Project area include speckled alder, northern arrowwood, southern arrowwood, silky dogwood, highbush blueberry, spicebush, and sweet pepperbush. Within the utility right-of-way, the invasive multiflora rose is frequently dominant along the Project routes. Palustrine Emergent Wetlands Palustrine emergent wetlands (PEM) are characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes, excluding mosses and lichens (Cowardin et. al., 1979). The PEM wetlands along the route include areas commonly referred to as marshes, wet meadows, and beaver flowage communities. The PEM wetland type exists on its own as well as in conjunction with other wetland types, creating a more heterogeneous wetland system. PEM wetlands are often associated with utility right-of-ways, abandoned agricultural areas, and open waterbodies. Vegetation in these wetlands along the Project route include cattail, tussock sedge, woolgrass, green bulrush, great bulrush, soft rushes, fox sedge, hop sedge, and shallow sedge. Many of the PEM wetlands along the Project routes are dominated by invasive species such as common reed, reed canary grass, and purple loosestrife. 4-60 4.4.1.2 Vernal Pools Vernal pools are a subclass of emergent wetland that consist of intermittently to ephemerally ponded, small, shallow depressions usually located within an upland forest. They are typically flooded in spring or after a heavy rainfall, usually dry during summer, and are frequently filled again in autumn. To identify vernal pools in all states within the Project, including New York, Algonquin evaluated wetlands within the study corridor in 2013 and 2014 based on the field methodology required in the USACE New England District. These evaluations were conducted by qualified biologists who identified areas with the potential to serve as vernal pool habitat based on an evaluation of visible vernal pool indicators. For each wetland evaluation, field scientists relied on direct evidence of amphibian breeding activity, and evidence of seasonal flooding and drying within a topographic depression not connected to a river, stream, or brook. 4.4.2 Wetland Construction Procedures Construction of the pipeline would require 160 wetland crossings, 76 in New York and 84 in Connecticut. One of the proposed crossings located in Connecticut would be conducted using the HDD method. Construction in the remaining wetlands would be conducted in accordance with the wetland construction and mitigation measures contained in Algonquin’s E&SCP. The method of pipeline construction used in wetlands would depend largely on the stability of soils at the time of construction. Where wetland soils are relatively stable, the pipeline would be installed using methods similar to those used in uplands (with addition of certain protective measures that are specific to wetlands (i.e., segregation of topsoil over the trenchline)). Upland construction techniques may include stringing and welding the pipeline within the wetland and using sideboom tractors and trackhoes within the wetland to lower and backfill the pipeline. Where wetland soils are saturated and/or inundated, the pipeline may be installed using the push-pull technique, floating technique, or carried into place and submerged into the trench. The construction right-of-way width in wetlands would generally be 75 feet wide, except in areas where additional width has been requested by Algonquin (see section 4.4.4). Wetland construction procedures are discussed in more detail in section 2.3.1.2. 4.4.3 GeneralImpacts and Mitigation 4.4.3.1 Wetlands Table 4.4.3-1 summarizes the impacts of the proposed Project facilities on wetlands. A detailed listing of the Project impacts on each wetland is included in table K-1 in appendix K. In total, construction of the Project would impact 52.5 acres of wetlands during construction. Of that, about 23.9 acres would be affected in New York and 28.6 acres in Connecticut. No wetlands would be affected in Rhode Island or Massachusetts.  The majority of this acreage (35.5 acres) would involve PEM and PSS wetlands. These impacts would be temporary and short term. The remaining 17.0 acres of impact would be on PFO wetlands. About 2.4 acres of PFO wetland would be permanently converted to non-forested wetland during operation of the pipeline facilities. The remaining 14.6 acres of PFO wetland would be allowed to revert to preconstruction conditions following construction, but would result in long-term impacts. About 1.7 acres of non-forested wetland would be affected by operation of the pipeline facilities. There would be no wetland impacts fromproposed abovegroundfacilitiesoraccessroads.  The Project would not result in any permanent lossof wetlands. 4-61 TABLE 4.4.3-1 Summaryof Wetland Impacts Resulting from Construction and Operation of the AIM Project Total Total Wetland Impacts Forested Wetland Impacts Crossing (acres) (acres) Length Facility/State (feet)a Construction Operation Construction Operation PIPELINE FACILITIES New York Haverstraw to Stony Point 2,373.6 5.1 0.0 1.0 0.0 Take-up and Relay Stony Point to Yorktown Take-10,876.0 18.8 1.0 6.1 0.8 up and Relay New York Subtotal 13,249.6 23.9 1.0 7.1 0.8 Connecticut Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up 5,435.2 8.2 0.0 2.5 0.0 and Relay Line-36A Loop Extension 1,676.2 3.1 0.9 1.1 0.6 E-1 System Lateral Take-up 8,979.2 15.6 1.7 5.2 0.6 and Relay E-1 System Lateral Loop 1,080.5 1.7 0.5 1.1 0.4 Connecticut Subtotal 17,171.2 28.6 3.1 9.9 1.6 ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 PROJECT TOTAL 30,420.8 52.5 4.1 17.0 2.4 a Crossing length of pipeline where the pipeline center crosses the wetland. Numbers are rounded to the tenth decimal place and may not reflect the totals/subtotals presented in appendix table K-1 due to the rounding. Algonquin has incorporated several route and workspace modifications into its proposed Project to minimize impacts on certain wetlands and vernal pools. However, some of these adjustments, including the adjustment to avoid direct in-water impacts on Dividend Brook, caused a total net increase in Project wetland impacts from 52.3 to 52.5 acres while reducing other impacts. Table 4.4.3-1 and appendix table K-1 have been updated to reflect these wetland impact changes. Section 3.5.2 summarizes all of the route alternatives, variations, and Project design modifications evaluated after the draft EIS to minimize impacts on various resources, including waterbodies and wetlands. Pipeline construction in New York would affect about 23.9 acres of wetlands. The majority of the affected wetlands would be PEM and/or PSS wetlands; about 7.1 acres would be PFO wetlands. Of the 7.1 acres of PFO wetlands, about 0.8 acre would be located within the new permanent right-of-way and would be subject to periodic vegetation maintenance during operation of the pipeline. Site-specific impacts on specific wetlands are discussed below. The proposed Project would impact a large wetland system (B13-RLR-W3) between about MPs 0.8 and 1.1 of the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment. This wetland system is associated with tributaries to Minisceongo Creek. The portion of the wetland within the existing maintained right-of-way that would be used for construction is classified as PEM. The portion of the wetland within the proposed temporary construction right-of-way is classified primarily as PFO. Following construction, the PFO portions affected by construction would be restored in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP and allowed to return to their preconstruction condition, and those portions of the existing right-of-way would be maintained as PEM wetland. 4-62 One new wetland (A14-SPLR-W101) would be located within the proposed workspace for the new Hudson River HDD alignment along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment. This wetland is a small Phragmites-dominated wetland. Algonquin would enclose the wetland with a silt fence to protect it during construction, and as shown in table K-1 in appendix K the Project would have no impact on the wetland. NYSDEC requested specific information about how dewatering would be conducted during pipeline installationat wetland B13-SPLR-W26. Thiswetland is currentlyimpounded bybeavers andthe wetland is flooded. The entire area along Lexington Avenue and Route 35 is prone to flooding during excessive precipitation events. As part of its application for section 401 WQC in New York, Algonquin provided a detailed construction plan illustrating pipeline construction staging at this wetland and an associated waterbody. Algonquin would use pumps with secondary containment for dewatering at this wetland. Discharge hoses with energy dissipation devices would be utilized to pump water into dewatering structures. The exact location of pumps, intake hoses, discharge hoses and the dewatering structures would be determined based on site-specific conditions at the time of construction. In addition, Algonquin would implement trench dewatering activities to comply with conditions of the section 401 WQC. Pipeline construction in Connecticut would affect about 28.6 acres of wetlands. The majority of the affected wetlands would be PEM or PSS wetlands and the remaining 9.9 acres would be PFO wetlands. A total of 3.1 acres of wetlands including 1.6 acres of PFO wetlands would be located within in the new permanent right-of-way and would be subject to periodic vegetation maintenance during operation ofthe pipeline.  Allotherwetland areas are locatedwithinthe existing and currentlymaintained pipeline right-of-way. The primary direct impact of pipeline construction and right-of-way maintenance activities on wetlands would be the short and long-term alteration of wetland vegetation. Other direct impacts associated with construction of the pipeline facilities could include changes in wetland hydrology and water quality. Trenching and backfilling activities would also directly impact wetlands. During construction, failure to segregate topsoil over the trenchline could result in the mixing of topsoil with the subsoil. This disturbance could result in altered biological activities and chemical conditions in wetland soils and could affect the re-establishment and natural recruitment of native wetland vegetation after restoration. In addition, inadvertent compaction and rutting of soils during construction could result from the movement of heavy machinery and the transport of pipe sections within the wetland areas. The resulting alteration of the natural hydrologic patterns could inhibit seed germination or increase the potential for siltation in wetlands. The discharge of stormwater, trench water, or hydrostatic test water could result in silt-laden water entering a wetland and cause the release of chemical and nutrient pollutants from sediments. Construction clearing activities and disturbance of wetland vegetation could also affect the wetland’s capacity to buffer flood flows and/or control erosion. Secondary or indirect impacts could include reduced riparian buffers, disturbance to adjacent habitats, and incremental fragmentation of forested wetlands. These effects would be greatest during and immediately following construction. The majority of these effects would be short term in nature and would cease shortly after the wetlands are restored. Following construction, new wetland vegetation would become established and eventually revert to a plant community similar to the one that existed prior to construction. In PEM wetlands, the herbaceous vegetation would regenerate quickly (within 1 to 3 years). Following revegetation, the permanent impact on emergent vegetation in the maintained right-of-way would be minimal because these areas consist of and would remain as open and herbaceouscommunities. 4-63 The duration of the impact on PSS and PFO wetlands would be longer. Woody vegetation may take several years to regenerate and the re-establishment of large woody vegetation would be precluded on a portion of the permanent right-of-way by routine vegetation maintenance activities during pipeline operation.  Thiswould permanentlyconvertpreviouslyPFOwetlandareaswithinthemaintainedright-ofway to non-forested wetlands and PSS wetland areas to PEM wetlands.  In its comments on the draft EIS, the EPA disagreed with our statement that impacts on wetlands from Project construction would not result in the permanent loss of wetlands and that no wetlands would be filled, asserting that backfilling in wetlands would be a permanent impact on wetlands. We maintain that trenching and backfilling in wetlands would be temporary impacts where wetlands are not converted to different wetland types. The conversion from one vegetation cover type to another could result in changes in wetland functions and values. In general, however, it is expected that the affected wetlands would continue to provide important ecological functions such as sediment/toxicant retention, nutrient removal and transformation, flood attenuation, groundwater recharge/discharge, and wildlife habitat. Algonquin proposes to use the HDD method to avoid impacts on one wetland associated with the Interstate 84/Still River crossing in Connecticut. Use of the HDD method would eliminate the need for mechanical clearing, trenching, and the operation of heavy construction equipment within the wetland. Activities between HDD entry and exit points would be limited to foot traffic required for the placement of wire grids needed to guide the drill alignment. Algonquin would mitigate unavoidable construction-related impacts on wetlands by implementing the wetland protection and restoration measures contained in its E&SCP. Specific measuresthat would be implemented, and included in the environmental analysis, include:  locating ATWS at least 50 feet from wetland boundaries except where site-specific conditions warrant otherwise and FERC approval has been obtained;  cutting vegetation above ground level, leaving existing rootsystems in place, and limiting stump removal to directly over the trenchline except where these activities are required outside the trenchline areafor safety reasons;  returning wetland contours and drainage patterns to their preconstruction configurations;  installing sediment barriers immediately after initial ground disturbance within the rightof-way at the edge of the boundary between wetlands and uplands, across the entire rightof-way immediately upslope of the wetland boundary, and along the edge of the right-ofway as necessary to contain spoil within the right-of-way and to protect adjacent off right-of-way wetland areas;  segregating the top 12 inches of topsoil from the trenchline in wetlands, except in areas where standing water is present or soils are saturated or frozen. Immediately after backfilling is completed, the segregated topsoil would be restored to its original location to expedite revegetation;  prohibiting the use of rock, soil imported from outside the wetland, tree stumps, or brush riprap to stabilize the right-of-way;  using low ground weight equipment and operating equipment on timber riprap, prefabricated equipment mats, or terra mats on saturated soils or where standing water is present;  installing trench plugs as necessary to maintain the original wetland hydrology;  prohibiting the use of lime, or fertilizer during the restoration of wetlands; and  seeding freshwater wetlands with a wetland seed mix specified by relevant land management agencies unless standing wateris present. Algonquin would minimize wetland impacts during pipeline operation by:  limiting vegetation maintenance in wetlands to a 10-foot-wide herbaceous corridor centered over the pipeline, and the cutting and removal of trees and shrubs greater than 15 feetin height that are within 15 feet ofthe pipeline centerline; and  prohibiting the use of herbicides or pesticides within 100 feet of wetlands or waterbodies except as specified by the appropriate land management orstate agency. 4-64 As discussed above, secondary or indirect impacts could include reduced riparian buffers, disturbance to adjacent habitats, and incremental fragmentation of forested wetlands. In its comments on the draft EIS, the EPA requested additional detail be provided on the types and amounts of secondary impacts on wetlands. In consultation with the USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP, Algonquin calculated potential secondary impact edge effects on wetlands.  A total of about 0.8 acre of secondary impacts were identified in New York. Also, atotalof1.9 acres of secondaryPEM impacts and 16.3 acres ofsecondary PSS/PFO impacts were identified in Connecticut.  The use of our Procedures, which Algonquin incorporated into its E&SCP, would minimize any secondary impacts associated with construction and operation of the Project. Specifically, the Procedures direct a number of impact minimization measures designed to limit the area of disturbance, limit the construction traffic through wetlands, and protect adjacent wetlands. In addition, the Procedures include post-construction restoration and prescribe monitoring to ensure restoration. With these measures in place, we considerthe potentialforsecondary impacts to be low.  We do acknowledge that fragmentation is a consequence of pipeline construction. The Project would increase the area of affected wetlands and move the location of the edge between fragmented and undisturbed habitat. The loss and/or conversion (including the moving of edges) of wetland habitat could increase the amount of stress, injury, and mortality experienced by wildlife. However, because most of the facilities affecting wetlands would be installed within Algonquin’s existing right-of-way, only incremental fragmentation, for example, would occur within PFO wetlands as a result of expanding the existing right-of-way.  Importantly, the Project would move the edge, but would not create new edge.  Algonquin would also comply with any additional conditions of the wetland permits that could be issued by the USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP. This includes Algonquin committing to provide compensatory mitigation for the permanent conversion of 0.8 acre of PFO wetlands to a non-forested wetland type in New York and 1.6 acres of PFO wetlands to a non-forested wetland type in Connecticut. Details ofthe compensatory mitigation are described in greater detail in section 4.4.5.  4-65 In accordance with its E&SCP and the Conceptual Mitigation Plan (see appendix M), Algonquin would conduct post-construction monitoring. Monitoring efforts would include documenting occurrences of exotic invasive species to compare to preconstruction conditions. In the event that nuisance plant species spread into the new right-of-way areas where not documented prior to construction, Algonquin would implement removal and eradication measures. Additional post-construction wetland monitoring requirements would be included as conditions of the section 404 CWA permits that could be issued by the New York and New England USACE Districts, including an adaptive management plan. Post-construction monitoring would, at minimum, be conducted annually for 3 years for all wetlands affected by construction to assess the condition of revegetation and the success of restoration. According to Algonquin’s Invasive Plant Species Control Plan2, post-construction monitoring of invasive species would be conducted for at least 4 years. Wetland revegetation would be considered successful when the cover of herbaceous and/or woody species is at least 80 percent of the type, density, and distribution of the vegetation in adjacent wetland areas that were not disturbed by construction. The USACE New York District has indicated that a minimum of 5 years of post-construction monitoring for wetlands and invasive species would be required and that an 85 percent revegetation cover would be used to determine successful revegetation. If wetlands were not showing signs of re-establishment of native wetland vegetation, Algonquin would consult with the appropriate federal and state agencies to develop a remedial action plan and produce quarterly monitoring reports. Upon determination of successful revegetation, sediment barriers would be removed and disposed of properly in accordance with the E&SCP. Construction impacts would be mitigated in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP and Invasive Plant Species Control Plan. Wetlands disturbed by construction would be restored and monitored, and appropriate compensatory mitigation would be provided to offset the permanent conversion of PFO wetlands to PEM wetlands. Therefore, we conclude that the Project would not result in adverse impacts on the functionsthat wetlands provide. 4.4.3.2 Vernal Pools Algonquin identified 11 vernal pools in the Project study corridor (300 feet) including 7 in New York, 3 in Connecticut, and 1 in Rhode Island (see table 4.4.3-2). No vernal pools were identified in Massachusetts. Two vernal pools in Cortlandt, New York are located within the temporary construction area for the Project. About 1,948 square feet of vernal pool habitat would be affected by Project construction. The remaining nine vernal pools were identified within the study corridor, but are not located within the proposed construction areaand would not be directly affected by the Project. Algonquin’s Invasive Plant Species Control Plan was included as Appendix 3F to Resource Report 3 in its February 28, 2014 application (Accession No. 20140228-5269). The plan can be viewed on the FERC website at http://www.ferc.gov.

NA = Not applicable  4-67 The primary effects of construction-related activity on vernal pools located in the temporary workspace would be similar to those described for emergent wetlands. However, vernal pools may also be affected by the conversion of adjacent forested habitat to early successional stage habitats. Impacts from pipeline maintenance activities would include the periodic removal of emergent and woody vegetation. To minimize direct and indirect or secondary impacts during construction, all vernal pools would be treated as wetlands and protected by adherence to the measures outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP. Section 4.4.3.1 discusses secondaryimpacts on wetlands and mitigationmeasures thatwould be used to minimize impacts on these features. These measures would also protect vernal pools from siltation and stormwater runoff, and provide a barrier to alert construction workers of the presence of sensitive habitat. Algonquin submitted wetland and water qualitypermit applications to the USACE, CTDEEP, and NYSDEC in March and April 2014. As part the section 401 WQC application to the NYSDEC, Algonquin included site-specific crossing plans for the two vernal pools in New York.  These site-specific plans illustrate the placement of sedimentation and erosion controls. Because the permits are currently underreview with the applicable agencies, we recommend that:  Prior to construction in the vicinity of the two vernal pools in New York, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of the OEP, revised site-specific crossing plans incorporating any additional avoidance or mitigation measures for the two vernal pools as required through the permit review process with the applicable agencies. 4.4.4 Alternative Measures Requiring FERC Approval The E&SCP stipulates that the construction right-of-way width in wetlands be limited to 75 feet and that all ATWS should be located at least 50 feet from wetlands except where an alternative measure has been requested by Algonquin and approved by the FERC. Algonquin identified numerous areas where it believes a 75-foot right-of-way is insufficient to accommodate wetland construction and a wider right-of-way is necessary. Table 4.4.4-1 lists the locations where Algonquin has requested a wider construction right-of-way and the site-specific rationale for the request. Based on our review of the requests for a wider construction right-of-way, we have determined that Algonquin has provided sufficient justification for the use of additional workspace in those wetland areas. Algonquin also identified locations where it believes site-specific conditions do not allow a 50-foot setback of ATWS from wetlands. Table 4.4.4-2 lists the locations where Algonquin requested less than a 50-foot setback from a wetland and the site-specific rationale for the requested modification from our Procedures. Based on ourreview, we have also determined that the requested modifications arejustified. In addition, Algonquin’s E&SCP is not consistent with section VI.B.2.d of the FERC Procedures.  Section VI.B.2.d requires applicants to minimize the length of time that topsoil is segregated and the trench is open. In accordance with section VI.B.2.b of the FERC Procedures, when wetlands are dry enough to support skids and pipe, the pipeline would be assembled in the wetlands. In these instances, Algonquin proposes to excavate the trench prior to the pipeline assembly. Otherwise, after the pipeline is assembled, equipment would not be able to access the area where trenching would occur nor would there be sufficient construction workspace to safely excavate the trench. Excavating the trench prior to stringing and assembling the pipe segments in non-saturated wetlands is generally acceptable; however, a blanket approval for implementing this practice would not provide the site-specific justification required by our Procedures. Therefore, Algonquin completed an evaluation of wetlands and identified those that meet the criterion of non-saturated based on site-specific information collected during field surveys. Appendix K includes information on each wetland crossing, including whether it is considered saturated or non-saturated, and also provides the site-specific justification required by our Procedures. We agree with this assessment and have determined that the requested modification is justified. 4-68 TABLE 4.4.4-1 Locations Where the Construction Right-of-way is Greater Than 75 Feet in a Wetland  State, Facility, Crossing Width ATWS Wetland ID MP (>75 Feet Right-of-Way) Justification a  NEW YORK Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay B13-RLR-W2 0.5 25 A B13-RLR-W3 0.8 10 B B13-RLR-W4 1.6 10 B B13-RLR-W9 3.0 55 B and C B13-RLR-W10 3.0 30 B and D Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay B13-SPLR-W50 4.4 25 B B13-SPLR-W203 4.6 25 B B13-SPLR-W205 4.7 25 B and E B13-SPLR-W202 4.8 25 B B13-SPLR-W16 5.1 25 B B13-SPLR-W16 5.2 25 B B13-SPLR-W16 5.3 25 B B13-SPLR-W17 5.6 25 B B13-SPLR-W2 5.9 35-135 B B13-SPLR-W3 6.0 25 B B13-SPLR-W7 6.7 25 B B13-SPLR-W8 6.8 25 B B13-SPLR-W12 7.3 25 B B13-SPLR-W13 7.6 25 B B13-SPLR-W14 8.2 25 B B13-SPLR-W15 8.4 25 B B13-SPLR-W2 8.5 10 B B13-SPLR-W18 8.8 10 B B13-SPLR-W21 10.3 265 at greatest extent, F necks down to 75 B13-SPLR-W25 10.8 45 B and G B13-SPLR-W41 11.0 25 B B13-SPLR-W26 11.1 25 B B13-SPLR-W27 11.5 25 B B13-SPLR-W28 11.7 25 B B13-SPLR-W29 12.0 25 B  4-69 TABLE 4.4.4-1 (cont’d) Locations Where the Construction Right-of-way is Greater Than 75 Feet in a Wetland  State, Facility, Crossing Width ATWS Wetland ID MP (>75 Feet Right-of-Way) Justification a  CONNECTICUT Southeast to MLV-19 Take-up and Relay B13-SELR-W8 0.2 10 B B13-SELR-W9 0.7 10 B A13-SELR-W1 1.0 10 B A13-SELR-W2 1.2 60 B A13-SELR-W3 1.2 55 B B13-SELR-W10 2.1 10 B A13-SELR-W4 2.6 10 B A13-SELR-W6 3.0 10 B B13-SELR-W3 3.5 10 B B13-SELR-W4 3.7 10 B B13-SELR-W5 3.8 10 B B13-SELR-W7 4.1 10 B Line-36A Loop Extension B13-CCS-W1 0.0 10 B B13-CLR-W2 0.7 10 B B13-CLR-W3 1.2 10 B B13-CLR-W4 1.3 10 H ____________________ a A = Extra workspace required to facilitate wetland topsoil, wetland subsoil segregation through the short length of wetland crossing.

This would involve excavating a trench to remove the existing pipe followed by the removal of the pipe. The removed pipe would then be transported away from the construction work area. The removal activity would be conducted using a distinct construction 4-72 crew separate from the pipeline installation crew. As the assembly-line construction process continues forward, the pipeline installation crew would expand the trench wider and deeper (as appropriate) to accommodate the new, larger diameter pipeline and install the replacement pipe at about the same location as the existing pipe using standard construction methods. In all wetland areas regardless of type, the existing pipeline must be removed first using wetland crossing procedures (e.g., topsoil/subsoil segregation, use of mats, etc.). Therefore, we agree that section VI.B.2.d would not apply to the take-up and relay segments of the Project. However, due to the potential for water quality effects on wetlands from erosion and sedimentation we recommend that:  Prior to construction along the take-up and relay portions of the Project, Algonquin should file with the Secretary a revised E&SCP, for review and written approval of the Director of OEP, adding to the responsibilities of the EI to inspect all erosion control devices and sediment barriers on a daily basis along wetlands for the take-up and relay segments, even when active construction and/or equipment operation is not occurring at a specificwetlandlocation. 4.4.5 Compensatory Mitigation The proposed facilities in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts would not result in the permanent loss of any wetland (i.e., conversion to upland). However, a total of 52.5 acres of wetlands would be impacted in New York and Connecticut by construction of the proposed Project. No wetlands would be impacted by Project facilities in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. The majority of wetland impacts would be on PEM and PSS wetlands, with only 17.0 acres of PFO wetland impacts. In most cases, the PFO wetlands would be allowed to return to their preconstruction condition. About 2.4 acres of PFO wetlands would be permanently converted to non-forested conditions as a result of Project operations. About 0.8 acre of this would be in New York and the remaining 1.6 acres would be in Connecticut. Algonquin would provide mitigation for the permanent conversion of PFO wetlands to non-forested wetlands in New York and Connecticut and the USACE expects that additional compensation may be necessary for temporal loss of aquatic habitat function associated with the discharge of temporary fill and secondary project impacts. Algonquin developed a Final Wetland Mitigation Plan for the Project (see appendix M). As part of that plan, Algonquin proposed to provide compensatory mitigation for both the temporary impacts and permanent conversion of PFO wetlands to another cover type. In Connecticut, wetland impacts that require mitigation at the state level are determined on a case-by-case basis. To satisfy USACE requirements for the New England District, Algonquin proposes to make a contribution to an approved in-lieu fee program in Connecticut. However, the CTDEEP is constrained from formally accepting in-lieu fees as compensatory mitigation for unavoidable wetland impacts.  CTDEEP has agreed that, in addition to the proposed construction-period mitigation measures, an improved invasive species plan would be sufficient to the CTDEEP mitigation package (see section 4.5.4.1). The USACE has agreed to accept the in-lieu payment proposed under their requirements. Algonquin is continuing to coordinate with the USACE and CTDEEP to finalize payment to the in-lieu fee program and managing invasive species in Connecticut, respectively. The USACE New York District would require on-site restoration for temporary PFO wetland impacts and would require off-site mitigation for the permanent conversion of PFO wetlands within the maintained right-of-way. Off-site mitigation must be in-kind, located in the same watershed as the impact, and provided at a 2:1 ratio. A mitigation plan for New York is included as part of appendix M. Onsite restoration for temporary PFO wetland impacts in New York would include restoration of approximately 6.3 acres of small areas of forested wetland located in temporary workspace outside the permanent pipeline right-of-way. Restoration would include select re-planting efforts combined with 4-73 invasive species control and post plant monitoring. All plants would be native and locally sourced. All trees would be potted nursery stock with a minimum height of 24 inches. Algonquin would seek to plant 1.5 times the pre-construction number oftrees cleared from each wetland.  For offsite mitigation, Algonquin has proposed the Junior Lake Enhancement Project in Yorktown, New York. Junior Lake is an approximately 3.4-acre site located within Memorial Park with a manmade pond and wetlands, and a fringe of riparian trees and shrubs. Enhancement opportunities at the park include; forested wetland enhancement, mixed forest and shrub wetland enhancement, and riparian wetlands and upland buffer enhancement around the pond. Algonquin created an offsite mitigation work plan as part of appendix M. This work plan includes information of invasive species management, planting specifications, coarse woody debris, buffers, and a proposed schedule.  Conclusions  As discussed in section 4.4.3.1, based on the avoidance and minimization measures developed by Algonquin, including the E&SCP, we conclude that impacts on most wetland resources would be minimal and would be temporary in duration. Also, Algonquin’s implementation of a final, agency-approved Wetland Mitigation Plan, would further offset any adverse impacts on wetland functions that would result from the permanent conversion of 0.8 acre of PFO wetlands to a non-forested wetland type in New York and 1.6 acres of PFO wetlands to a non-forested type in Connecticut. The USACE, the NYSDEC, and the CTDEEP would review and incorporate theFinalWetland Mitigation Plan into project permits. 4.5  VEGETATION  4.5.1  Existing Vegetation Resources  Ecoregions are areas that have similar environmental resources and characteristics, including  geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology (EPA, 2013). Classification at the ecoregion level describes the broad-scale environmental factors that contribute to the dominant natural vegetation that may be present within a particular region. The AIM Project facilities would be located in three EPA ecoregions: the Northeastern Highlands, Northeastern Coastal Zone, and Atlantic Coastal Pine Barrens Ecoregions (USGS, 2013).  All of the Project facilities in New York would be located in the Northeastern Highlands Ecoregion. The Northeastern Highlands Ecoregion is an area with topography ranging from low mountains in portions of southern New York, western Connecticut, and western Massachusetts, to open high hills in Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine (Kambly, 2013). The ecoregion also shows many remnants of glaciation, including rocky soils, glacial lakes, and wetlands. The ecoregion is generally sparsely populated, and land cover in the region is largely forested with naturally occurring northern hardwood and spruce fir forests growing on nutrientpoor soils (USGS, 2013).  With the exception of the existing Middleborough M&R Station in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, all of the Project facilities in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts would be located within the Northeastern Coastal Zone Ecoregion. The Northeastern Coastal Zone Ecoregion has relatively low but irregular topography that was created by glaciation. Vegetative communities naturally consist of hardwood and mixed forests and smaller areas of inland and coastal wetlands. Land use is predominantly forested and urban (Auch, 2013).  The Middleborough M&R Station would be located in southeastern Massachusetts, which is part of the Atlantic Coastal Pine Barrens Ecoregion. This ecoregion is found along the coastal plain from Massachusetts to New York. Natural ecosystems present within this ecoregion include cedar swamps, pitch pine and oak forests, sphagnum bogs, coastal salt ponds, dune systems, and maritime grasslands (Sohl, 2013).  Portions ofthis ecoregion are highly urbanized.  4-74 The vegetative cover types within the Project area are consistent with typical plant communities found in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Plant community types along the proposed pipeline routes and at aboveground facility sites were determined based on a review of aerial photography, existing land use classifications, and field surveys. Field surveys for wetlands and waterbodies were completed in January 2014, and encompassed all proposed construction work areas. During these surveys, in addition to wetland vegetation, field observations and notes were made to identify the upland vegetation communities and their associated habitats. Descriptions of existing typical vegetative cover types in the Project area are based on the field observations and the natural community classification systems described in Draft Ecological Communities of New York State (Edinger et al., 2002), The Vegetation of Connecticut: A Preliminary Classification (Metzler and Barrett, 2006), and Classification of the Natural Communities of Massachusetts (Swain and Kearsley, 2011). 4.5.1.1 Pipeline Facilities About 13 percent (58.0 acres) of the land that would be required for construction and operation of the pipeline facilities is unvegetated industrial/commercial land. Of the vegetated areas, forested upland is the most common vegetation type that would be affected by the pipeline followed by open upland (see section 4.5.4).  The common species associated with each ofthese covertypesis described below.  Forested Uplands Typical forested upland community types in the Project area include, but are not limited to, drymesic inland mixed oak forest, Appalachian oak-hickory forests, successional northern hardwood forests, and chestnut oak forests (Edinger et al., 2002).  In New York, forested upland vegetation along the Project pipeline routes is best classified as dry-mesic inland mixed oak forest, which is typically dominated by northern red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), and eastern black oak (Quercus velutina) (Breden, 1989). Forested vegetation on uplands along the pipeline routes is mostly dominated by northern red oak, chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), white oak, and other oaks (Quercus spp.), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata). Chestnut oak forests crossed by the Project in Rockland County, New York are considered to be a significant natural community within the state (New York Natural Heritage Program [NYNHP], 2013). Chestnut oak forests can be found within the Project area along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay and a portion of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segments. See section 4.5.2 for more information regarding this community type. In Connecticut, forested upland vegetation along the pipeline routes is best classified as beech-maple mesic forests and successional northern hardwood forests. Beech-maple mesic forests are hardwood forests with sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus spp.) co-dominance. Successional northern hardwood forests in Connecticut are hardwood or mixed forests that occur on sites that have been cleared or otherwise disturbed. Common tree species identified during field surveys along the pipeline routes included red maple (Acer rubrum), American beech, red oak, red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), black cherry (Prunus serotina), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Species commonly observed in the understory include multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) and red raspberry (Rubus idaeus).  In Rhode Island, forested upland vegetation is limited to the Burrillville Compressor Station and is best classified as a Northern Hardwood/Hemlock/White Pine forest. Northern Hardwood/Hemlock/ White Pine communities are closed canopy forests dominated by a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, with sparse shrub and herbaceous layers (Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife [MDFW], 2013). Common tree species identified during field surveys at the compressor station included red maple, red oak, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), eastern hemlock, and white pine (Pinus strobus). The 4-75 understory includes sapling and shrub white pine, red maple and American beech with some common barberry (Berberis vulgaris) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) shrubs. Canada mayflower (Maianthemum canadense) is a common groundcover in these forested areas. In Massachusetts, forested upland vegetation in the Project area is limited to the Assonet and West Roxbury M&R Stations (see section 4.5.1.2).  Open Uplands The proposed pipeline segments would cross primarily open upland areas associated with the existing, maintained pipeline rights-of-way in New York and Connecticut.  Open upland communities can generally be subdivided into the following vegetation communities:  grasslands – communities dominated by grasses and sedges with less than 50 percent shrub cover, sometimes with scattered trees;  meadows – plant communities with co-dominant forbs, sedges, grasses and shrubs, sometimes with scattered trees; and  shrublands – plant communities that have more than 50 percent shrub cover (Edinger et al., 2002). Much of the Project pipeline segments would be located within or parallel to existing utility rights-of-way. In other locations, the pipeline segments would be located along an existing roadway or in previously disturbed developed areas. Vegetation management practices along rights-of-way, roadways, or other previously disturbed areas typically result in early successional vegetative cover that ranges from early successional upland scrub-shrub to field and roadside habitats. Species observed in the open, upland areas within the existing pipeline rights-of-way throughout the AIM Project area included red fescue (Festuca rubra), common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), Timothy-grass (Phleum pretense), red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover (T. repens), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Wetland Vegetation Communities Wetland vegetation community types observed along the pipeline facilities included PFO wetlands,PSSwetlands,and PEMwetlands.  These wetland vegetation types andthepotential impactson these communitiesare described in detail in section 4.4.   4.5.1.2 AbovegroundFacilities About 34 percent (32.2 acres) of the land that would be required for construction and operation of aboveground facilities would be unvegetated industrial/commercial land. Portions of some aboveground facility sites contain forested upland and open upland communities. In general, construction and operation of new proposed aboveground facilities and changes to existing facilities would primarily affect open upland communities; however, in a few locations, forested land may be affected. The new Assonet M&R Station would be located in an area of mixed oak forest interspersed with shrub/scrub stands. The dominant tree species are black oak, red oak, pignut hickory (Carya glabra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and sugar maple. The shrub/scrub understory is dominated by multiflora rose and autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata). The West Roxbury M&R Station would be located in an old quarry that been has re-vegetated. The dominant tree species include sugar maple, shagbark hickory, black locust 4-76 4.5.1.3 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards Algonquin has identified three proposed pipe and contractor ware yards for potential use during the construction of the AIM Project. The location of these yards, and their existing conditions, are provided in table 2.2.3-1. All three yards are existing construction or industrial sites with no vegetative communitiesor other natural resources present.   4.5.1.4 Access Roads To the extent feasible, existing public and private road crossings along the proposed Project pipeline segments would be used as the primarymeans of accessingrights-of-way.  Algonquin would also use existing public roads near proposed compressor stations and M&R stations. In addition to the existing access available by the use of public roads, Algonquin has identified 28 existing TARs, and 8 PARs along the pipeline route, including one new PAR to be constructed at the Assonet M&R Station.  A comprehensive list of the proposed TARs and PARs can be found in table 2.2.4-1. 4.5.2 Vegetation Communities of Special Concern or Value This section summarizes unique, sensitive, and protected vegetation that could be affected by the AIM Project facilities in each state. Federal and state resource agencies have been consulted to determine if any federally or state-listed threatened and endangered plant species (including federal and state species of special concern) or their designated communities occur within the Project area, which is discussed further in section 4.7. Agencies contacted include the FWS (New York and New England Field Offices), NYNHP, CTDEEP, MDFW, and RIDEM.   The federally and state-endangered small whorled pogonia (Isotria medeolodes) has historically been recorded in Rockland County, New York. An evaluation of potential impacts on this species is provided in section 4.7). Chestnut oak forests are considered a significant natural community in New York. They are globally listed as G5 (demonstrably secure globally) and in New York listed as S4 (apparently secure) (NYNHP, 2013e). There are several hundred occurrences in New York State. In the Project area, the NYNHP has identified chestnut oak forests within Harriman State Park and the surrounding environs as high quality. Chestnut oak forests comprise the upland forest type west of the Hudson River, including land crossed by the Haverstraw to Stony Point and Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segments and the existing Stony Point Compressor Station. Threats to chestnut oak forests within this region generally include changes in land use (e.g., clearing for development), forest fragmentation (e.g., roads), and invasive species (e.g., insects, diseases, and plants). Other threats may include over-browsing by deer, fire suppression, and air pollution (e.g., ozone and acidic deposition).  Algonquin would limit the amount of disturbance to chestnut oak forests by utilizing the existing pipeline right-of-way during construction to the extent possible. However, some clearing of chestnut oak forest for the temporary construction work areas would be required to safely install the new 42-inchdiameter pipeline in Rockland County, New York. In addition, construction at the Stony Point Compressor Station would require tree clearing for temporary construction work areas, and about 7.6 acres of woodland would be temporarily affected by installation of the newfacilities at the station. 4-77 The CTDEEP identified extant records for eight rare plant species in the vicinity of the AIM Project pipeline segments in Connecticut and Algonquin’s existing Cromwell Compressor Station. These species include climbing fern (Lygodium palmatum), Collins’ sedge (Carex collinsii), field paspalum (Paspalum laeve), hard-stemmed bulrush (Scoenoplectus acutus), three-leaved false Solomon’s seal (Maianthemum trifolium), threadfoot (Podostemum ceratophyllum), twinflower (Linnaea borealis spp. americana), and the yellow fringed orchid (Platanthera ciliaris) (CTDEEP, 2013d). These species are discussed in detail in section 4.7. No unique, protected, or sensitive vegetation has been identified at the Burrillville Compressor Station site in Rhode Island or along the proposed Projectfacilities in Massachusetts. 4.5.3 Noxious Weeds and Other Invasive Plant Species This section summarizes the noxious and invasive vegetation identified during field observations that would be crossed by the AIM Project in each state. Invasive species are species that display rapid growth and spread, becoming established over large areas (USDA, 2013a). Invasive plant species can change or degrade natural vegetation communities, which can reduce the quality of habitat for wildlife and native plant species. The proposed pipeline facilities extend across four states that are represented by a variety of habitat including forests, open fields, wetlands, agriculture, residential development, and industrial development). Much of this area has been disturbed by past land use practices, such as agriculture and residential development. As observed during field surveys, there are many non-native species of vegetation found throughout the Project area. Non-native species commonly observed include non-native honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii), Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum), autumn olive, buckthorns (Frangula or Rhamnus spp.), European common reed grass (Phragmites australis), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea), purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and garlic mustard. Invasive plant species commonly observed during the Project field surveys for each state are detailed below.   Algonquin would conduct post-construction maintenance and monitoring of the right-of-way in affected wetlands to assess the success of restoration and revegetation in accordance with its E&SCP and final Wetland Mitigation Plan. Monitoring efforts would include documenting occurrences of exotic invasive species to compare to preconstruction conditions. During the 2013 wetland field surveys, Algonquin documented the presence of any invasives that comprised a significant percent of the vegetative cover. Algonquin would use this information in conjunction with its Invasive Plant Species Control Plan and Wetland Mitigation Plan to address the spread of invasive plants within the Project rights-of-way and control invasive populations that might prevent successful mitigation of impacts on wetlands.  The CTDEEP has indicated that they would incorporate a special permit condition for invasive species management into the section 401 WQC for the Project (CTDEEP, 2013n). The NYSDEC has also provided comments and recommendations for controlling invasive species in wetlands (NYSDEC, 2013m). Algonquin would continue to consult with the CTDEEP and the NYSDEC as part of the 401 WQC permit process.    New York State has an Invasive Species Council that was created to coordinate among multiple state entities and partners in addressing the environmental and economic threats of invasive species. New York State defines invasive species as "a species that is: (a) non-native to the ecosystem under consideration; and (b) whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health" (NYSDEC, 2013k).  4-78 New York has designated 71 plants as invasive species (NYSDEC, 2013j). Listed invasive plants commonly observed during the AIM Project field surveys in New York include: multiflora rose, Norway maple (Acer platanoides), Japanese barberry, autumn olive, Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), oriental bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), Japanese knotweed, garlic mustard, reed canarygrass, European common reed grass, and purple loosestrife. Connecticut has designated 102 plants as invasive species (USDA, 2013b). CTDEEP defines invasives as, “Non-native species are those that are alien to the ecosystem that they have been introduced into and whose introduction causes or is likely to cause harm to the environment or human health. Some non-native species exhibit an aggressive growth habit and can out-compete and displace native species” (CTDEEP, 2013q). Listed invasive plants commonly observed during the AIM Project survey efforts in Connecticut include: multiflora rose, Japanese barberry, autumn olive, oriental bittersweet, mugwort, Japanese knotweed, garlic mustard, reed canarygrass, European common reed grass, purple loosestrife, Japanese stiltgrass, Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense), and glossy buckthorn. CTDEEP has developed a set of BMPs to reducethe spread ofinvasive species within the state (CTDEEP, 2013q).  The Rhode Island Invasive Species Council is an outreach program of the Rhode Island Natural History Survey, the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station, and the University of Rhode Island Cooperative Extension. According to the Executive Order on Invasive Species, “invasive species means an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harmor harm to human health.” Rhode Island recognizes 69 invasive plant species (Rhode Island Invasive Species Council, 2013). Of those 69 species, none were observed during the field efforts at the Burrillville Compressor Station. The Massachusetts Invasive Plant Advisory Group (MIPAG) is a voluntary collaborative, representing organizations and professionals concerned with the conservation of the Massachusetts landscape. MIPAG defines invasive plants as "non-native species that have spread into native or minimally managed plant systems in Massachusetts, causing economic or environmental harm by developing self-sustaining populations and becoming dominant and/or disruptive to those systems." MIPAG recognizes 66 plant species as Invasive, Likely Invasive, or Potentially Invasive (MIPAG, 2013). Listed plants commonly observed during the AIM Project survey efforts include: multiflora rose, autumn olive, oriental bittersweet, mugwort, Japanese knotweed, garlic mustard, reed canarygrass, European common reed grass, purple loosestrife, Japanese stiltgrass, Canada thistle, tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), tartarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tartarica), black locust, common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), andJapanese wineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius). 4.5.4 GeneralImpacts and Mitigation Table 4.5.4-1 lists the amount of forested and open land vegetation cover types that would be affected by construction and operation of the proposed Project. In total, construction of the proposed Project facilities would temporarily disturb about 352.4 acres of vegetation and permanently affect 34.7 acres. The proposed Project would temporarily affect about 160.9 acres of open land, including 125.4 acres of open upland and 35.5 acres of open wetland vegetation. These impacts would be short term. The proposed Project would temporarily affect about 191.5 acres of forested vegetation, including 174.5 acres of forested upland and 17.0 acres of forested wetland vegetation. Impacts on forested areas would be longer term. The AIM Project would permanently affect about 7.7 acres of open land, of which 6.0 acres are open upland and 1.7 acres are open wetlands, and 27.0 acres of forested vegetation, of which 24.6 acres are forested upland and 2.4 acres are forested wetland. See section 4.8 for additional information on land use impacts.  Additional wetland impact information is provided in section 4.4. 4-79 TABLE 4.5.4-1  Acres of Vegetation Potentially Affected by the AIM Project  Open Land  Forested  Upland  Wetland  Total  Upland  Wetland  Total  Total  Facility Type/Facility  State  Const.

These numbers are not included in the subtotals and totals for aboveground facilities. b A portion of the temporary workspace at the West Danbury M&R Station would fall within the overall temporary workspace area for pipeline facilities; only the portion outside the overall pipeline workspace (0.1 acre of forested upland) is included in subtotal and total calculations. The construction workspace of the North Fall River M&R station is already included in the Assonet M&R temporary/permanent workspace areas. d Vegetation impacts in the subtotal and totals rows do not include the aboveground facilities that are marked with an “a.” The construction workspaces from those facilities are already included in the pipeline facilities. 4.5.4.1 Pipeline Facilities The primary impact on vegetation would be the temporary and permanent alteration of vegetative cover along the pipeline construction rights-of-way. The pipeline right-of-way and ATWSs would be cleared of vegetation prior to construction to provide a safe working area.  The limits of clearing would be identified and flagged in the field prior to the start of clearing operations and Algonquin would install erosion control measures following initial disturbance of the soil as described in its E&SCP. The cleared width within the right-of-way and ATWSs would be kept to the minimum required to safely construct the pipeline. Impacts on forest habitat could include fragmentation, edge effects, and increased opportunity for invasive species establishment. Construction in forest lands would remove mature trees in the construction right-of-way. In addition, the canopy overhanging the right-of-way may be trimmed as needed. Felled trees would be cut into lengths, chipped on the right-of-way, or removed to an approved site. In temporary construction work areas, tree stumps and rootstock would be left in place, wherever possible, to facilitate natural revegetation. The removal of mature trees and other vegetation could also result in secondary impacts such as increased erosion. Incremental fragmentation of forest habitat could occur due to the expansion of Algonquin’s existing right-of-way. The loss of forest habitat and the expansion of existing corridors could also decrease the quality of habitat for forest wildlife species, including alteration of habitat resulting from increased light levels and a subsequent loss of soil moisture as a result of an expanded right-of-way. Expansion oftheexistingcorridorcould alsoresult inan increasedopportunityforinvasive plants to displace native species. However, the Project would not contribute significantly to forest fragmentation. Forest fragmentation generally occurs when a new corridor or clearing is cut through a forested area. Much of the proposed pipeline routes are located along existing rights-of-way and in areas that are already developed and highly fragmented. As a result, the forested areas that are present are predominantly edge habitats. In total, construction of the proposed pipeline facilities, which includes the ATWSs required for construction, would disturb about 316.9 acres of vegetation. The proposed Project would have a temporary, short-term effect on about 155.2 acres of open land, including 119.7 acres of open upland and 35.5 acres of open wetland vegetation. The proposed Project would affect about 161.7 acres of forest vegetation, including 144.7 acres of forested upland and 17.0 acres of forested wetland vegetation. Impacts on these areas would be long term. Permanent vegetation impacts from the pipeline facilities would include about 6.7 acres of open land, of which 5.0 acres are open upland and 1.7 acres are open wetlands, and 20.4 acres of forest vegetation, of which 18.0 acres are forested upland and 2.4 acres are forested wetland (see table 4.5.4-1). Following construction, all disturbed areas would be restored. The ATWSs used during construction (other than areas already existing as gravel or pavement) would be seeded and allowed to revegetate to preconstruction cover types, with no further maintenance or disturbance associated with operation of the pipeline. Clearing for construction of the pipeline would not result in any permanent impacts on wetland vegetation communities located outside of the permanent right-of-way and other maintenance areas, which would be allowed to revegetate naturally following construction. Long-term impacts on forested communities would occur becauseof the time required for woody vegetation to revert to preconstruction conditions. Herbaceous vegetation would be short term, recovering within one to two growing seasons. In accordance with the E&SCP, Algonquin would monitor to determine the post-construction revegetative success.   In addition, Algonquin would implement its Invasive Plant Species Control Plan to address the spread of invasive plants within the Project rights-of-way and control invasive populations that might prevent successful revegetation. Algonquin is also working with the USACE and CTDEEP on an 4-83 approach to managing invasive species in Connecticut. This management would include preconstruction mowing, construction phase mitigation measures, post-construction monitoring, and post-construction management.  Construction phase mitigation measures identified to-date are summarized below.  Using baseline data, areas where invasive species are dominant would be noted and avoided to the extent practicable.  The EIwould make every effort to ensure that construction mats and equipment are clean and freeof excess dirt and mud priorto entering a wetland area.  As needed, equipment wash stations would be designated to ensure that equipment is clean.  Sediment and erosion control devices would be installed across the right-of-way on slopes leading into wetlands and along the edge of the construction right-of-way to preventseed dispersion and spoil from migrating into wetland areas.  Crews would be trained in identifying priority invasive species of concern and using precautions to prevent their spread.  Construction and revegetation would be expedited in wetlands. A final management plan would be filed with the USACE and CTDEEP through the permitting process. During operation, routine maintenance of the right-of-way would occur to allow continued access for routine pipeline patrols, maintaining access in the event of emergency repairs, and visibility during aerial patrols. In upland areas, maintenance of the right-of-way would involve clearing the entire permanentright-of-wayof woodyvegetation. Assuch, the maintained permanent rights-of-waywould be subjected to mowing every3 years.  To facilitate periodic corrosion surveys, a 10-foot-wide strip centered on the pipeline would be mowed annually to maintain herbaceous growth. Algonquin would not apply herbicidesfor general right-of-way maintenance.  These maintenance activities would result in permanent conversion of some areas of existing upland forested vegetation to herbaceous or scrub-shrub vegetation. However, because Algonquin has routed the pipeline facilities to use existing utility rights-of-way and road corridors to the extent possible, impacts on forested vegetation would be minimized. In summary, Algonquin would implement the measures in its E&SCP and Invasive Plant Species Control Plan to minimize impacts on vegetation within the construction and permanent rights-of-way and improve revegetation success. In general, impacts on non-forested vegetation generally would be temporary or short term and would not be significant. Construction of the proposed pipeline facilities would have a long-termeffect on forested wetland and upland vegetation within the construction right-ofway and a permanent affect within the maintained operational right-of-way. We find that Project-specific minimization and mitigation measures, and mitigation measures described in Algonquin’s E&SCP and Invasive Plant Species Control Plan would be sufficient to offset adverse impacts on vegetation in the Project area. Therefore, we conclude that constructing and operating the pipeline facilities would not significantlyaffect existing vegetation populations.  4-84 4.5.4.2 AbovegroundFacilities In total, construction of the proposed new M&R stations, modifications to existing compressor and M&R stations, and removal of the Greenville M&R Station would disturb about 33.6 acres of vegetation, including about 4.8 acres of open upland and 28.8 acres of forest upland vegetation. Construction and operation of aboveground facilities would not affect wetland vegetation. Temporary impacts on vegetation and revegetation plans within the construction workspace areas for the aboveground facilities would be similar to those described above for the pipeline facilities. Many of the ATWSs to be used during construction would be utilized for both pipeline and aboveground facilities. Areas that were included in the vegetation impacts for the pipeline facilities are not included in this section (see table 4.5.4-1). Permanent vegetation impacts from the aboveground facilities would include about 0.1 acre of open upland and 5.6 acresof forest upland vegetation.   Existing compressor stations that would have temporary impacts on vegetation include the Stony Point, Southeast, Cromwell, Chaplin, and Burrillville Compressor Stations. There would also be some permanent vegetation impacts associated with operation of the existing Stony Point and Cromwell Compressor Stations. Work at these compressor stations would permanently convert about 2.6 acres of forested upland vegetation to open upland vegetation.  The effects on vegetation fromeach ofthe existing compressor stations are provided in table 4.5.4-1. The effects on vegetation due to the modification of the existing M&R stations are provided in table 4.5.4-1. All of the temporary effects on vegetation from the Stony Point, Peekskill, Cortlandt, West Danbury, and Montville M&R Stations are associated with construction of the pipeline segments. Additionally, the temporary effects on vegetation from the North River M&R Station are included in the acreage of disturbance for the new Assonet M&R Station. Of the existing M&R stations, only the Willimantic M&R Station would permanently affect vegetation, converting about 0.5 acre of forested upland vegetation to open upland vegetation.  Each of the proposed new M&R stations would have temporary and permanent impacts on vegetation. The effects on vegetation from each of the new M&R stations are provided in table 4.5.4-1.  In total, between these three facilities, about 4.5 acres (3.4 acres of forested upland and 1.1 acres of open uplands) would be temporarily affected by the new facilities. These facilities would permanently convert about2.5 acres of forested upland vegetation to open upland vegetation. The removal of the Greenville M&R Station would temporarily affect 0.2 acre of open uplands. There are no temporary impacts on forested upland or any permanent impacts on vegetation associated with the GreenvilleM&R Station. In summary, construction of the proposed aboveground facilities and modifications to existing stations would result in the long term and permanent impacts on forested vegetation. However, Project-specific minimization and mitigation measures and mitigation measures described in Algonquin’s E&SCP are determined to be sufficient to offset adverse impacts on vegetation in the Project area. Therefore, construction and operation of the aboveground facilities would not significantly affect existing vegetation populations. 4-85 4.5.4.3 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards Algonquin would use three pipe and contractor ware yards, two in Connecticut and one in New York, during construction of the AIM Project facilities. All three of these yards consist of existing construction or industrial sites that would not require any modification or upgrade work that would affect vegetation.  4.5.4.4 Access Roads Algonquin would use existing access roads during construction to the maximum extent practicable, minimizing major impacts on vegetation communities. The majority of the roads identified by Algonquin have existing gravel, asphalt, or concrete surfaces that can be used with little or no preconstruction improvements. In a few locations, upgrades would be required, such as brush removal and tree trimming, to allow safe access along the existing access roads. However, we have determined that no significant effects on vegetation would occur during the use of existing access roads required for the pipeline facilities.  Six of the TARs and one of the PARs are unimproved dirt or gravel roads that would require minor (e.g., about 10-foot) upgrades prior to pipeline construction. These upgrades would result in about 1.9 acres of temporary and permanent vegetation disturbance during Project construction and operation. In addition, Algonquin would also need to construct a new 120-foot-long by 12-foot-wide paved PAR from the existing North Fall River M&R Station site to the new Assonet M&R Station, which would affect about 0.1 acre of forested upland. The vegetative community present is a mixed oak forest, with red oak dominant, and areas of early successional growth.  Total vegetative impacts for these access roads in each state are provided in table 4.5.4-1. Based on the characteristics of the identified vegetation communities in the vicinity of the access roads, the implementation of Project-specific minimization and mitigation measures, and the mitigation measures described in Algonquin’s E&SCP, we conclude that the use and improvement of existing access roads and construction of a new access road would not result in significant impacts on existing vegetation in the Project area. 4.6 WILDLIFE AND AQUATIC RESOURCES 4.6.1 Wildlife 4.6.1.1 Existing Wildlife Resources The AIM Project would traverse terrestrial and wetland habitats that support a diversity of wildlife species. For the purposes of this EIS, the wildlife habitats along the pipeline segments and at the aboveground facility sites are described regionally and are representative of the vegetation community structure and composition of the terrestrial and wetland habitats present within the Project area. The dominant wildlife habitat types that have been identified along the proposed pipeline route and at the aboveground facility sites include: upland forest, open uplands (early successional scrub-shrub and herbaceous vegetation cover), forested wetlands, open wetlands (both palustrine/freshwater and estuarine wetlands), urban, and open water estuarine habitats. Table N-1 in appendix N lists the common wildlife species often associated with the vegetative cover types found within the Project area. Wetland habitat types are further described in section 4.4. Special status species, such as federally and state-listed threatened or endangered species, are discussed in section 4.7. 4-86 Upland forest is present along portions of the pipeline segments and adjacent to many of the aboveground facilities. It generally consists of either mixed oak forest or successional forests dominated by species such as sweetgum, paper birch, and/or tree-of-heaven. Hardwood forests provide year-round food resources, cover, and nesting habitat for a variety of wildlife species, including large and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians, insects, and both migratory and non-migratory birds. Open Uplands This cover type includes successional scrub-shrub areas, fields, and disturbed and/or maintained areas, such as existing utility rights-of-way or other open space areas. Early successional and grassland habitats provide valuable nesting and foraging habitats for grassland bird species. Species such as the Eastern cottontail prefer shrubby, overgrown open habitats and other early successional, while grassy areas offer habitat for ground-nesting birds. Forests adjacent to open space areas create edge habitats that are used by numerous mammals, reptiles, and bird species. Wetlands Wetland vegetation communitytypes along Project facilities include palustrine forested wetlands, palustrine scrub-shrub wetlands, and palustrine emergent wetlands. The forested wetlands crossed by the Project facilities are largely dominated by red maple and provide important food, shelter, migratory and overwintering areas for multiple songbird species, waterfowl, small mammals, and amphibians (see section 4.4.1). Open wetlands are found throughout the Project area and include freshwater scrub-shrub and emergent wetland areas, along with estuarine tidal rivers and creeks. Scrub-shrub wetland habitats contain vegetation that is characteristically low and compact. The plant species in a scrub-shrub wetland offer excellent nesting sites for many bird species. These wetland habitats are also used by reptiles and amphibians. Freshwater emergent wetlands include wet meadows and emergent marshes characterized by a variety of grasses, sedges, and rushes. Many of the freshwater emergent wetlands in the Project area are dominated by invasive species, such as common reed that provide relatively low quality wildlife habitat. However, many common species of birds, small and large mammals, reptiles, and amphibians are associated with emergent wetlands. Urban Environment Urban environments are characterized by a low diversity of wildlife species that are tolerant of human development and activity. Common bird species in cities and residential areas include European starlings, house sparrows, rock pigeons, mourning doves, and Northern mockingbirds. Mammals that have become adapted to living in human environments, such as the Norway rat, are also common. Open Water The Project would cross under the Hudson River Estuary, a 153-mile-long tidal system that stretches from the Troy Dam to New York Harbor (NYSDEC, 2014a). Open water estuarine habitats support a diverse array of coastal wildlife, providing foraging areas for coastal breeding and migratory birds, and supporting both breeding and wintering waterfowl populations. Mudflats exposed by tidal 4-87 4.6.1.2 Significant or Sensitive Wildlife Habitats This section identifies and describes the significant or sensitive wildlife habitats within the AIM Project area, such as vernal pools, sensitive coastal habitats, and other known wildlife resources not specific to threatened and endangeredspecies. VernalPools As described in section 4.4.1.2, vernal pools are intermittently to ephemerally ponded, small, shallow depressions usually located within an upland forest (NYNHP, 2013a). These pools typically flood in spring or after a heavy rainfall, are dry throughout the summer, and then fill again in autumn. The substrate consists of dense leaf litter over hydric soils. Vernal pools typically occupy a confined basin (i.e., a standing waterbody without a flowing outlet), but may have an intermittent stream flowing out of it during high water (NYNHP, 2013a). Vernal pools provide breeding habitat for many species of amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, mollusks, annelids, and insects. Rare species, such as the Jefferson’s salamander, are known to use vernal pools near the Project area (see section 4.7). As discussed in section 4.4.3.2, Algonquin identified 11 vernal pools within the Project study corridor in 2013 and 2014. Two vernal pools are located in the proposed temporary workspace in the Town of Cortlandt, New York. The other nine vernal pools are located outside of the proposed construction workspace areas for the Project. Hudson River SignificantCoastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would cross the lower Hudson River Reach, an area designated as Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat (SCFWH) by the NYSDEC (NYSDOS, 2013). The lower Hudson River Reach contains the Hudson Highlands, which extend roughly from Denning’s Point to Stony Point, New York. This SCFWH encompasses 6,700 acres of the main river channel below mean low water and adjacent shallows and shoals, over an approximate 20-mile reach (NYSDOS, 2013). This area contributes directly to the production of in-river and ocean populations of food, game, and forage fish species. The Hudson Highlands supports the deepest (up to 200 feet deep) and narrowest segment of the Hudson River. The deepwater areas of the Hudson Highlands area are also used by concentrations of species that spawn elsewhere in the Hudson River Estuary. These deep areas are also used as migration routes by the federally endangered Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, and are important nursery and summering areas for juvenile Atlantic sturgeon and summering areas for post-spawn adults (NYSDOS, 2013). A discussion of fisheries and aquatic resources is presented in section 4.6.2, and special status species, such as Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, are discussed further in section 4.7. The Lower Hudson River Estuary is also a significant habitat and habitat complex as defined by the FWS (FWS, 1997). The Lower Hudson River Estuary, Complex #21 of the New York Bight Watershed, is the portion of the Hudson River extending from the Battery atthe southern tip of Manhattan to Stony Point at the northern end of Haverstraw Bay (FWS, 1997). This productive estuary is a regionally significant nursery and wintering area for anadromous, estuarine, and marine fish species, as well as a migratoryand feedingarea forbirds and fish (FWS, 2014k). The proposed pipelinewouldcross the lower Hudson River Reach using the HDD method to minimize effects on this significant habitat 4-88 Associated with the fisheries resources in Hudson Highlands are significant concentrations of wintering bald eagles. Winter residence in the area generally extends from December through March throughout the Hudson Highlands and on Iona Island. Iona Island has been designated as an eagle sanctuary by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC) (NYSDOS, 2013). See section 4.7.3 for further discussion on bald eagles. 4.6.1.3 Wildlife Management Areas or Refuges In New York, the proposed Project pipeline segments would cross designated wildlife management areas, including Harriman State Park in Rockland County and the Blue Mountain Reservation in Westchester County, as discussed below. AIM Project facilities in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts would not affectany wildlife management areas or refuges. Harriman State Park The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would cross Harriman State Park in two locations within existing rights-of-way between MPs 0.0 to 0.3 in the Town of Haverstraw and between MPs 2.5 to 2.6 in the Town of Stony Point.  Harriman State Park is the second largest park in the New York State Parks system, located in Rockland and Orange Counties. The 46,613-acre park holds 31 lakes and ponds, has over 200 miles of trails, and provides a number of recreation areas for camping, swimming, and hiking (New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation [NYSOPRHP], 2013). Harriman State Park supports 18.8 miles of the Appalachian Trail, portions of the Harriman and Sterling Forests IBA (see section 4.7.2), and the Iona Island Bird Conservation Area (BCA). The Iona BCA is an important tidal wetland for migratory waterfowl. Iona Island is located 2 miles north of the nearest proposed AIM Project facility and would not be disturbed by Project construction (NYSOPRHP, 2013). Blue Mountain Reservation In New York, the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay pipeline segment would pass through Blue Mountain Reservation in Westchester County between MPs 6.7 and 8.1 and again between MPs 8.4 and 8.5. Blue Mountain Reservation is a 1,538-acre county-owned park in the northwest section of Westchester County that features miles of trails for mountain biking, walking, nature study, and challenging hikesto the tops of two large peaks, Mt. Spitzenberg and Blue Mountain. The reservation is also classified as a biodiversity hub in the Croton-to-Highlands Biodiversity Plan, because it provides an area of high-quality wildlife habitat in a densely developed area for many wildlife species, including amphibians and reptiles, such as spotted salamanders, gray tree frogs, wood frogs, garter snakes, milk snakes, and the black rat snake (Miller and Klemens, 2004). The mixed hardwood forest also provides habitat for many forest-dwelling bird species including owls, woodpeckers, thrushes, and wood warblers.  4.6.1.4 GeneralImpacts and Mitigation The construction of the AIM Project facilities would affect about 191.5 acres of forested land and 160.9 acres of open land (see section 4.5.1). Construction of the pipeline segments account for 161.7 acres (84 percent) of estimated effects on forested land and 155.2 acres (96 percent) of effects on open land. Aboveground facilities account for about 28.8 acres (14 percent) of estimated effects on forested 4-89 Pipeline Facilities The majority of the pipeline routes are located within or adjacent to existing Algonquin rights-ofway, roadways, railways, and/or utility rights-of-way. These existing rights-of-way are routinely maintained as part of regular facility operations to control vegetative growth, which prevents many areas from reverting back to forested land. Many species of resident and migratory wildlife in the Project area use these existing utility corridors as preferred habitat. Following construction, temporarily disturbed areas would be seeded and left to revegetate via natural succession. About 24.6 acres of forested upland habitat and 2.4 acres of forested wetland would be permanently converted and maintained in an early successional stage by mowing and periodic tree removal during operation. Wildlife could be affected by clearing of vegetation; alteration of the landscape from scraping the ground, soil disturbance, and recontouring; deposition of trash and debris; the use of chemicals or exposure to contaminated soil or groundwater; conflicts with vehicles; human presence; activities associated with trenching; increased predation; and edge effects and habitat fragmentation. During construction, more-mobile species would be temporarily displaced from the construction right-of-way and surrounding areas to similar habitats nearby. Some wildlife displaced from the right-of-way would return to the newly disturbed area and adjacent, undisturbed habitats after completion of construction. Less-mobile species, such as small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and nesting birds, may experience direct mortality or permanent displacement. Displacement of species could lead to increased competition for some resources. The clearing of vegetation on the construction right-of-way and ATWS areas would reduce cover, foraging, breeding, and nesting habitat for some wildlife.  The degree of effects would depend on the type of habitat affected, the timing of clearing and construction activities, and the rate at which the area recovers after disturbance from construction. The effect on species that rely on open land habitats would be short term, because these areas would be reseeded after construction and likely recover within 1 to 3 years.  Habitat areas comprising tree-and shrub-dominated vegetation and their associated wildlife may be affected on a longer-term basis. Clearing these workspace areas would affect forest-dwelling wildlife species to a greater extent than open habitat wildlife species, because forested ATWS areas would be prevented from reestablishing on the permanent right-of-way. Algonquin has minimized the potential for these long-term effects by collocating and overlapping the proposed ATWS areas with their existing rights-of-way to reduce the amount of forest clearing required forthe Project.  The FWS expressed concern for the fragmentation of forest along the Hudson River in relation to migratory birds (Algonquin, 2014b). A discussion of migratory birds is provided in section 4.7.2. Forest fragmentation generally occurs when a new corridor or clearing is cut through a forested area. Much of the proposed pipeline routes are located along existing rights-of-way and in areas that are already developed and highly fragmented. As a result, the forested areas that are present are predominantly edge habitats that are unlikely to support forest interior species. Therefore, the effect on forest-dwelling wildlife would be minimal. Tree clearing for the construction and maintenance of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would fragment small areas of continuous forest. However, the Project would notcontribute significantly to forest fragmentation. 4-90 The alteration of the landscape through removal of vegetation, scraping of the ground, soil disturbance, and recontouring would reduce seed banks, disturb soil-dwelling species, and could temporarily alter drainage patterns. The degree of effects would depend on the species present during the time of construction. Soil-dwelling invertebrates would be directly affected through movement of soil from one place to another, resulting in some mortality and displacement. This could reduce the forage potential for insectivores that inhabit the area. Other animals would be indirectly affected through the reduction in seed banks, resulting in longer recovery times for vegetation thatcould provide forage, cover, and nesting habitat. However, the regional influence of these effects would be minor due to the temporary nature ofthe effects and limited area affected by construction. Increased predation could occur during construction and operation of the proposed Project facilities due to the removal of vegetation and the temporary increase in line-of-sight that would result. Although this could lead to higher mortality rates for certain animals, the Project is unlikely to have any population-level impact due to these effects. Trenching activities and the spoil piles generated during construction could create potential traps for wildlife species and barriers to movement for less mobile species. Wildlife could fall into trenches, and spoil piles could create barriers to some less mobile species, such as small reptiles and amphibians. Where the existing AIM Project pipeline crosses major roadways and sensitive areas, such as the Hudson River and Still River, Algonquin would use the HDD method to minimize effects on wildlife due to trenching.  To further minimize the potential for wildlife to become trapped, Algonquin plans to not have extensive lengths of trench open at one time during pipeline installation. Furthermore, Algonquin would conduct preconstruction sweeps and construction inspections along specific sections of right-of-way, and specific surveys forthe followingdesignated federallyand state-listed species:  timber rattlesnake in StonyPoint, Rockland County, New York;  eastern hognose snake along the E-1 System Take-up and Relay segment in New London County, Connecticut; and  eastern box turtles along the Line-36A Loop pipeline in Cromwell and Rocky Hill, Connecticut.  Algonquin would also incorporate additional conservation measures for bog turtles developed through consultation with the FWS at the crossing of specific wetlands. These measures would minimize the potential for this species to become trapped in trenches during construction. See section 4.7.1.2 for further discussion. Trash and debris could affect wildlife by encouraging certain species to move into areas where humans are working, resulting in potential wildlife–human interaction and conflict and increased predation.  To minimize the potential for wildlife attraction, food wastes from the construction area would be maintained in a neat and orderly manner. Solid wastes, such as food wrappings, cigarette butts and packets, Styrofoam cups and plates, and similar wastes would be routinely collected and disposed off-site. A spill of hazardous materials during construction, such as diesel or oil, or the excavation and exposure of contaminated soil or groundwater could directly affect wildlife through direct ingestion or ingestion of contaminated material. The effects on wildlife from chemicals or contaminants would be minimized by Algonquin’s adherence to their SPCC Plan. Thus, the risk of chemical exposure to individual animals would be low, and there would be no risk of population-level effects on any wildlife species. 4-91 Project-related traffic on paved and unpaved roads during construction could temporarily disturb birds and other wildlife near roadways, resulting in an increase in direct mortalityof certain wildlife from animal/vehicle collisions. Due to the short timeframe of construction for the AIM Project, the effects on animals from increased vehiculartraffic wouldbe minor.  In an effort to minimize permanent effects on wildlife and to promote the rapid stabilization and revegetation of the disturbed areas, Algonquin would comply with its E&SCP to minimize disturbance to vegetation and provide for stabilization of affected areas to mitigate direct and indirect effects on wildlife. Revegetation would be completed in accordance with permit requirements and consultation with agency and non-agency stakeholders affected by the Project.  After the right-of-way is revegetated, the Project would not be expected to have a significant effect on wildlife due to planned maintenance of the right-of-way. With the exception of a 10-foot-wide strip that may be mowed annually in upland areas, vegetative maintenance on the right-of-way would occur no more frequently than once every 3 years. In addition, maintenance clearing would not be conducted between April 15 and August 1 to avoid direct and indirect effects on wildlife during the nesting and breeding season (e.g., grassland birds). In wetland areas, trees located within 15 feet of either side of the pipeline that are greater than 15 feet in height may be selectively cut and removed from the right-of-way. However, trees and shrubs that become reestablished beyond 15 feet on either side of the pipeline would not be disturbed. Algonquin would retain a riparian strip within 25 feet of a stream as measured from the mean high water mark.  This riparian area would be allowed to permanently revegetate with native woody plant species across the entire right-of-way, with exception of a 10-foot-wide corridor centered on the pipeline that would be maintained in an herbaceous state. In the riparian area, trees and shrubs greater than 15 feet in height may also be selectively cut within 15 feet on either side of the pipeline. Because Algonquin would largely make use of its existing rights-of-way and would adhere to its SPCC Plan, E&SCP, and other measures discussed in this EIS, we conclude that Algonquin’s proposed pipeline facilities would not substantially alter local wildlife populations. AbovegroundFacilities The majority of the work at aboveground facilities would take place within existing, developed properties and would not result in significant disturbance to or destruction of wildlife or their habitat. Portions of some aboveground facility sites contain forested upland and open upland communities. Construction and operation of new proposed aboveground facilities and changes to existing facilities would primarily affect forested upland communities (28.8 acres); however, in a few locations, open upland communities may be affected (4.8 acres). For the five compressor stations requiring expansion beyond the current developed footprint, Algonquin has designed the proposed modifications to minimize the amount of forest clearing required for construction. Further, to minimize effects on wildlife and wildlife habitat at aboveground facilities, Algonquin would:  retain the existingforest buffers at all the compressor station sites;  expeditiously restore vegetative cover in areas not occupied by permanent structures at the compressor stations and M&R stations by grading, fertilizing, seeding, and mulching these areas immediately following construction; and  install permanent erosion controls, as needed, to ensure stabilization and minimize effects of long-term erosion and sedimentation. 4-92 While construction and operation of the modified and new aboveground facilities would, in some cases, have permanent impacts on vegetation and wildlife habitat, most of the work would occur at existing facilities where similar habitat exists adjacent to these sites. Further, Algonquin would retain much of the existing forest buffers at the compressor station sites. Therefore, we find that impacts on wildlife from construction and operation ofthe Project aboveground facilities would not be significant. Pipe Yards and Contractor Ware Yards Algonquin has identified three proposed pipe and contractor ware yards for potential use during the construction of the AIM Project. All three yards are existing construction or industrial sites with no vegetative communities or other natural resources present. We conclude that the temporary use of these yards would notresult in a significantimpact on wildlife or wildlife habitat. Access Roads To the extent feasible, existing public and private road crossings along the proposed AIM Project pipeline segments would be used as the primary means of accessing the rights-of-way. Algonquin would also use existing public roads near proposed compressor stations and M&Rstations.  Although Algonquin would be using existing roads for temporary and permanent access, seven of these roads would require minor upgrades and/or widening (by about 10 feet) to be used during pipeline construction. These upgrades would result in about 1.9 acres of new permanent land disturbance dispersed among the states of New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Algonquin would also need to construct one new permanent access road from the existing North Fall River M&R Station site to the new Assonet M&R Station. This new access road would permanently disturb less than 0.1 acre of land; however, its location next to an existing industrial facility would not result in any significant effects on local wildlife populations. The use and modification of these access roads would not result in a significant impact on wildlife or wildlife habitat. 4.6.1.5 Significant or Sensitive Wildlife Habitat Impacts and Mitigation Algonquin has minimized potential effects on significant or sensitive wildlife habitats by locating the majority of pipeline facilities within or adjacent to existing Algonquin pipeline rights-of-way or along existing utility rights-of-way, roads, and railroadsto the maximum extentpossible.  Algonquin would also use the HDD crossing method at the Hudson River crossing to avoid direct affects to aquatic habitats and adjacent riparian habitats. Algonquin continues to address potential effects on significant, sensitive, and managed habitats through consultation with the appropriate federal and state agencies. Vernal Pools Pipeline construction within vernal pools could have a number of potential effects including alteration of a pool’s capacity for holding water, direct disturbance to amphibian adults, eggs and larvae, and removal of vegetation that could serve as egg attachment sites and cover. Pipeline construction activities near vernal pools could disturb or alter adjacent upland habitats for which vernal pool species also inhabit. The primary effects on vernal pools from pipeline maintenance activities would include the periodic removal of emergent and woody vegetation. This activity would potentially remove the vegetative structure that may serve as amphibian-egg-attachment sites and cover, and could disturb adult amphibians, eggs, and larvae in the pool. The Project would not directly affect wildlife in nine of the 11 vernal pools identified by Algonquin in the study corridor, because these pools are located outside of the Project’s proposed construction workspace areas and no clearing or crossing of these resources would occur. The Project may indirectly affect vernal pool wildlife temporarily during construction in adjacent upland habitats if vernal pool-associated species are present in those habitats during the time of construction. The Project 4-93 may directly affect vernal pools and the associated wildlife during construction in and around the two vernal pools located in the construction workspace in the Town of Cortlandt, New York. To minimize direct and indirect effects on vernal pools and their associated wildlife during construction and maintenance activities, Algonquin would treat all vernal pools as wetlands and protect them through adherence to the measures outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP. These measures would protect vernal pools from siltation and stormwater runoff, and provide a barrier to alert construction workers of the presence of this sensitive habitat.  In addition, Algonquin would adhere to any permit conditions developed through consultation with the applicable federal and state agencies (see section 4.4). Therefore, while Project-related impacts could occur, they would be temporary in nature and would not significantly affect wildlife in these areas. Hudson River SignificantCoastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat Based on implementation of the HDD construction method for crossing of the Hudson River and the associated BDP Plan for monitoring the HDD program, the Project would not affect the lower Hudson River Reach SCFWH, which contains the Hudson Highlands, and the adjacent Lower Hudson River IBA. Harriman State Park and Blue Mountain Reservation Algonquin’s existing pipeline right-of-way is currently recognized as existing scrub-shrub and open field wildlife habitats, which are used by a variety of species inhabiting Harriman State Park and Blue Mountain Reservation. In general, the existing right-of-way is bordered by upland forest areas. Temporary, short-term impacts on wildlife species during construction of the pipeline may occur. However, long term significant habitat changes are not anticipated following right-of-way restoration, because the right-of-way would be revegetated following construction and continue to provide the same wildlife habitat functions and valuesthat currently exist. Algonquin met with the PIPC on January 8, 2014, to discuss the AIM Project’s impacts on Harriman State Park. As a result of the meeting, Algonquin would conduct tree counts for the portions of the Project’s pipeline construction work area located inside Harriman State Park and coordinate with the PIPC to address compensation for trees removed as part of the AIM Project. Because the majority of construction would be confined to Algonquin’s existing right-of-way, long-term impacts on sensitive wildlife habitat within the park are not anticipated. However, Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSOPRHP and PIPC to address impacts on Harriman State Park. Given that consultation with NYSOPRHP and PIPC is not complete, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of the OEP, a site-specific plan for the Harriman State Park, including any avoidance or mitigation measures developed with the NYSOPRHP andPIPC. We evaluated a potential pipeline variation to the north of the current pipeline right-of-way in the Blue Mountain Reservation in response to a comment we received about the proximity of the pipeline to a pond located south of the alignment and concerns about the potential impact of construction in this area on amphibians (see section 3.5.2.1). 4.6.2 Aquatic Resources 4.6.2.1 Existing Aquatic Resources A total of 102 waterbody crossings (36 perennial streams and 65 streams with intermittent or ephemeral flow, and 1 pond) would be required for the AIM Project (see section 4.3.2). This section describes the fisheries resources present in the streams and rivers in the Project area based on the review 4-94 Classification of fisheries habitat includes consideration of both chemical and biological characteristics and whether they support anadromous or catadromous fish. Physical and chemical properties that can be used to determine fishery classification include water temperature, salinity, and whether the waterbody is part of a marine, estuarine, or freshwater system.  The marine system occurs in areas of open ocean that are exposed to waves and currents, where hydrology is determined primarily by the ebb and flow of oceanic tides, and the salinity exceeds 30 parts per thousand (ppt) with little or no dilution or input from freshwater rivers and/or runoff (Cowardin, 1979). In the estuarine system, water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land. Estuarine fish species reside in tidal waters with salinities ranging from 0.5 to 20 ppt and spawning is typically in waters with salinities ranging between 5 and 20 ppt, from late spring through summer (Cowardin, 1979).  Freshwater systems have low salinity ranges and contain fisheries that are typically classified as coldwater, coolwater, or warmwater. Coldwater fisheries are characterized by lower than average water temperatures and the ability to support breeding fish, such as brook trout. Coolwater fisheries typically support mixed communities and/or fish species with optimal temperature ranges between warmwater and coldwater communities. Warmwater fisheries are characterized by fish, such as largemouth bass and common carp (Cowardin, 1979). Anadromous fish are marine-living fish that travel upstream to spawn in freshwater (e.g., American shad or blueback herring). Conversely, catadromous fish are freshwater-living fish that travel downstream to breed in saltwater (e.g., American eel). With the exception of the Hudson River and Dickey Brook, the majority of fisheries habitat crossed by the AIM Project pipeline facilities is classified as freshwater. Both the Hudson River and Dickey Brook support estuarine fisheries. Fish known to occur in the proposed Project area are summarized in table 4.6.2-1. Impacts on and mitigation for aquatic resources are discussed in section 4.6.2.3. Notably, no waterbodies are located within the proposed construction workspace areas at the existing compressor stations, existing M&R stations, or new M&R stations. As such, aquatic resource impacts would be limited to the proposed construction of Algonquin’s pipeline facilities. New York The waterbodies crossed by the pipeline segments in New York are located entirely within sub-basin level watersheds of the Lower Hudson Watershed in Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam Counties. These include the crossings of Minisceongo Creek, Cedar Pond Brook on the west side of the Hudson River, and Dickey Brook on the east side of the Hudson River. Streams found in these areas support primarily warmwater fishery species, but there are a number of waterbodies that are classified as coldwater because they support trout populations and/or provide trout spawning habitat. In addition, the NYSDEC stocks troutin a number of these waterbodies. The largest waterbody crossed by the AIM Project is the Hudson River. This river is about 0.7 mile wide at the proposed pipeline crossing location. This crossing area is at the northern end of a nearly 50-mile tidal estuary that extends from the Bear Mountain Bridge in the north to Manhattan in the south. The pipeline crossing would be in an area considered to be part of the Hudson Highlands, which supports the deepest (up to 200 feet deep) and narrowest segment ofthe Hudson River as previously described. 4-95 TABLE 4.6.2-1 Representative Fish Species in Waterbodies Crossed by the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  Freshwater Black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) Redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) Brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) Redfin pickerel (Esox americanus americanus) Carp (Cyprinus carpio) Redside dace (Clinostomus elongates) Chain pickerel (Esox niger) Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) Common shiner (Luxilus cornutus) Smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) Creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) Spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) Cutlips minnow (Exoglossum maxillingua) Sunfish (hybrid) Fallfish (Semotilus corporalis) Tesselated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) White sucker (Catostomus commersoni) Golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) Yellow bullhead (Ameirus natalis) Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) Coldwater Blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) Longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinails) Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Brown trout (Salmo trutta) Tiger Trout (Salmo trutta X salvelinus fontinalis) Anadromous Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) Hickory shad (Alosa mediocris) American shad (Alosa sapidissima) Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhynchus) Shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) Blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) Catadromous American eel (Anguilla rostrata) Estuarine Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) Striped killifish (Fundulus majalis) Bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) Striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) Four-spined stickleback (Apeltes quadracus) Three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) Grubby sculpin (Myxocephalus aeneus) Tidewater silverside (Mendia peninsulae) Hog choker (Trinectes maculatus) White catfish (Ameiurus catus) Inland silverside (Menidia beryllina) White perch (Morone Americana) Mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) Winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) Northern pipefish (Syngnathus fuscus) Marine Anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli) King mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) Atlantic butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) Red Hake (Urophycis chuss) Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) Sandbar shark (Carcharinus plumbeus) Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) Sand tiger shark (Odontaspis taurus) Atlantic sea herring (Clupea harengus) Scup (Stenotomus chrysops) Black sea bass (Centropristus striata) Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) Bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) Summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) Windowpane flounder (Scopthalmus aquosus) Dusky shark (Carcharinus obscurus) Winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus)  4-96 Connecticut Waterbodies crossed by the proposed pipeline segments in Connecticut range from small intermittent headwaters and tributaries (such as the unnamed tributaries found along Susquetonscut Brook) to mid-reach perennial waterways (such as Elisha Brook). The pipeline facilities would also cross a few larger streams and rivers including the Sawmill River, Still River, and Kohanza Brook in Western Connecticut. These waterbodies area classified as either coldwater or warmwater systems. Connecticut stocks trout in both warmwater and coldwater perennial waterbodies to support recreational fishing (CTDEEP, 2013h). Massachusetts The West Roxbury Lateral would cross one perennial waterbody draining from an existing manmadepond at a golfcourse. The perennialstreamexitingthe golfcourse pond is an unnamed tributaryof Purgatory Brook. This tributary has a crossing width of 9 feet, and would be crossed by the pipeline in the Town of Dedham at MP 0.1. The unnamed tributary of Purgatory Brook is classified as warmwater waterbody according to the Massachusetts Surface Water Quality Standards (314CMR: 4.00). 4.6.2.2 Fisheries of Special Concern Consultations with the FWS, NOAA Fisheries, NYSDEC, CTDEEP, MDFW, and Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program were conducted to identify waterbodies that may contain federally or state-listed threatened, endangered, or candidate species and their habitat; EFH; coldwater fisheries; and other fisheries resources that could be considered fisheries of special concern (see section 4.7 for a discussion of threatened and endangered species). Fisheries of special concern in the AIM Project area are listed in table 4.6.2-2 and described below. Potential construction impacts on aquatic resources, including fisheries of special concern, are discussed in section 4.6.2.3. Algonquin proposes to use a dry crossing method further described in section 4.3.2.3 for all waterbody crossings along the proposed pipeline route except for the crossing of the Hudson River in New York and the Still River in Connecticut, which would be crossed using the HDD method. Minisceongo Creek and Tributaries The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would cross Minisceongo Creek in Rockland County at MP 1.1 and 14 tributaries of Minisceongo Creek between MPs 0.6 and 2.3. Minisceongo Creek is a large boulder strewn perennial waterway with a gravel bottom and moderate flow. Its surrounding tributaries include both perennial and intermittent streams with sand/gravel substrates and moderate flow rates. Minisceongo Creek and its tributaries are designated as trout streams under New York Water Quality Standards. The river is used for recreational fishing and is stocked with brown trout (Salmo trutta)by the NYSDEC (NYSDEC, 2013h). Cedar PondBrook The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would cross Cedar Pond Brook in Rockland County at MP 3.0. Cedar Pond Brook is a large perennial waterway with a gravel bottom and moderate flow.  Cedar Pond Brook is designated astrout spawning waters underNew York Water Quality Standards. The river is used for recreational fishing and is stocked with brown trout (Salmo trutta) by the NYSDEC (NYSDEC, 2013h, 2013i). 4-97 TABLE 4.6.2-2 Fisheries of Special Concern Crossed by the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  Facility/Waterbody Name MP County State Fishery Concerna,b  Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay Unnamed Tributary (UNT) to 0.3 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters Downstream of Mahwah River Crossing Location UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.6 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.8 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.8 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.9 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.9 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.9 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 0.9 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 1.0 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 1.0 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 1.0 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 1.1 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 1.1 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters Minisceongo Creek 1.1 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 1.7 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Minisceongo Creek 2.2 Rockland NY Trout Stocked Waters Cedar Pond Brook 3.0 Rockland NY Trout Spawning Habitat UNT to Cedar Pond Brook 3.0 Rockland NY Trout Spawning Habitat Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay Hudson River 3.0 Rockland/ NY Threatened and endangered species, Westchester anadromous fisheries, commercial/recreational Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay Still River 1.7 Fairfield CT Trout Stocked Waters E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay Susquetonscut Brook 0.7, 2.0, 5.8 New London CT Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Elisha Brook 8.3 New London CT Trout Stocked Waters Elisha Brook 8.5 New London CT Trout Stocked Waters Loop Extension E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension UNT to Stoney Brook 0.0 New London CT Trout Spawning Habitat UNT to Stoney Brook 0.2 New London CT Trout Spawning Habitat UNT to Stoney Brook 0.3 New London CT Trout Spawning Habitat UNT to Stoney Brook 0.3 New London CT Trout Spawning Habitat  4-98 TABLE 4.6.2-2 (cont’d) Fisheries of Special Concern Crossed by the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  Facility/Waterbody Name MP County State Fishery Concerna,b  Falls Brook 0.8 New London CT Trout Stocked Waters UNT to Stoney Brook 0.9 New London CT Trout Spawning Habitat UNT to Stoney Brook 1.2 New London CT Trout Spawning Habitat __________________________ a Threatened and endangered species = federally or state-listed threatened, endangered, or candidate species. b Trout Stocked Waters = waters where trout are stocked for recreational fishing. Trout Spawning Habitat = waters with naturally occurring spawning populations of trout.  Hudson River The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would cross the Hudson River between MPs 3.0 and 3.9 using the HDD method. The Hudson River has semi-diurnal tides of 3 to 5 feet and moderate to high salinities up to 26 ppt over the course of the year due to a small percentage of freshwater inflows. Water temperature also varies throughout the year from 35.6 to 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Additionally, high turbidity decreases the amount of light penetration to 3 to 16 feet below the surface. Dissolved oxygen levels are generally above 4.0 milligrams per liter; however, lower values may occur towards the bottom or at certain lagoon, inter-pier, and combined sewer outflow areas (FWS, 1997). The lower Hudson River Estuary is designated as EFH. Anadromous fish in the Hudson River include the federally listed endangered shortnose andAtlantic sturgeon (see section 4.7.1 for discussion of these federally listed species), as well as American shad, striped bass, alewife, and blueback herring. The catadromous American eel can also be found in the lower reaches of the Hudson River. Currently, regulated recreational fishing for striped bass, American eel, alewife, blueback herring, and other species is permitted in the Hudson River; however, the sustainability of alewife and blueback herring fisheries is currently being assessed by the NYSDEC. Commercial fishing for striped bass and most other species, besides baitfish, remains closed in the lower Hudson River due to concerns with PCB (NOAA Fisheries, 2001; NYSDEC, 2009b). Blue crab and shellfish species are also present in the Hudson Riverestuary, although harvest of these species is restricted. Dickey Brook Dickey Brook is classified as a freshwater stream that transitions to an estuarine environment along its lower reach where it joins the Hudson River. The separation point between these two systems is the bridge over Route 9 and Route 9A in the Town of Cortlandt. West of the bridge, Dickey Brook is designated as marine waters (Class SC) and is tidally influenced by the Hudson River. East of the Route 9/9A Bridge, Dickey Brook is designated as a freshwater system Class C waterbody by the NYSDEC.  The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would cross this estuarine section once at MP 5.7 and then the freshwater section at MP 6.0. The Class SC and C designations indicate that the waters are notfit for swimming or human consumption, and fishing is the best use for this waterbody. Still River The Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment crosses the Still River at MP 1.7 in the City of Danbury, Connecticut.  This waterbody crossing is part of the larger Interstate 84/Still River HDD that would extend from MPs 1.4 to 2.1. The river is a large, warmwater, perennial waterway with a sand substrate. Common warmwater game species within the Still River include largemouth bass, smallmouth 4-99 Sawmill River One of the principal tributaries to the Still River, flowing north from the southern uplands, is the Sawmill River. The Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment would cross the Sawmill River at MP 0.3, where the river is about 8 feet wide. Susquetonscut Brook The E-1 System Take-up and Relay segment would cross the Susquetonscut Brook in New London County, Connecticut at three locations: MPs 0.7, 2.0, and 5.8. Two crossings are in the Town of Lebanon and one is in the Town of Franklin. Susquetonscut Brook is a large, warmwater, perennial waterway with a sand and silt substrate. It has a moderately slow flow rate with a number of beaver impoundments, oxbows, and other backwaters located along its reach in the Project area. The Susquetonscut Brook supports a varied assemblage of warmwater game fish species, including largemouth bass and chain pickerel (CTDEEP, 2013f), and is stocked with brook trout and brown trout by the CTDEEP during the springand fallstocking seasons (CTDEEP, 2013p).  Elisha Brook and Tributaries The E-1 System Take-up and Relay segment would cross Elisha Brook in the City of Norwich, Connecticut at MP 8.5, and one of its unnamed tributaries at MP 8.3. Elisha Brook is a minor, coldwater, perennial waterway with a sand, gravel, and cobble substrate. Its unnamed tributary is a minor intermittent stream that feeds the main channel. Elisha Brook has the potential for recreational fishing, and contains populations of brook trout (CTDEEP, 2013f). Unnamed Tributaries to Stony Brook The E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension segment would cross six unnamed tributaries of Stony Brook in the Town of Montville, Connecticut at the following locations: MPs 0.0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.9, and 1.2. Stony Brook is rated a Class 3 wild trout management area and contains spawning populations of brook trout (CTDEEP, 2013h). Stony Brook is also stocked with brown and rainbow trout (CTDEEP, 2013f, 2013p), and has more stringent fishing regulations in place than other waterbodies in the state (CTDEEP, 2013h). The unnamed tributaries of Stony Brook crossed by the proposed pipeline facilities contain both perennial and intermittent waterbodies, all of which likely contain trout feeding, and possibly spawning habitat.  The tributaries likely supportlimited levels ofrecreational fishing. Falls Brook The E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension segment would cross Falls Brook in the Town of Montville, Connecticut at MP 0.8. Falls Brook is a high velocity, shallow, perennial stream that provides coldwater fishery habitat and contains large boulders on a gravel and cobble substrate. It supports a varied assemblage of coldwater fish species, including four species of trout: brook, brown, rainbow, and tiger trout (Salmo trutta X salvelinus fontinalis) (CTDEEP, 2013f). Tiger trout are a hybrid species derived froma cross between brook and brown trout, and are highly prized by anglers (CTDEEP, 2013p). Falls Brook is used for recreational fishing, and is stocked by the CTDEEP with all four of the above-mentioned trout species (CTDEEP, 2013p). 4-100 4.6.2.3 GeneralImpacts and Mitigation This section describes general impacts and measures that would be implemented to minimize impacts on fisheries and aquatic resources in the Project area, including EFH and other fisheries of special concern.  Specific effects on EFH are discussed in section 4.6.2.4. Construction and modifications to existing aboveground facilities are not expected to result in significant affects to any waterbodies or fisheries. Thus, the following section focuses on activities associated with the construction of the proposed pipeline facilities. Additional details regarding waterbody crossing methods are provided in sections 2.3 and 4.3.2.3, and the proposed crossing method for each waterbody potentially affected by the Projectis listed in table I-1 in appendix I. Dry Crossing Method As discussed previously, Algonquin proposes to use a dry crossing method (i.e., flume or dam-and-pump) to install all but two of the waterbody crossings along the proposed pipeline segments. None of these other waterbodies includes designated EFH. The other two waterbodies would be crossed using the HDD method. Dry crossing methods involve the installation of a flume pipe(s) and/or dam and pump prior to trenchingto divert the stream flow around the construction area and allow trenching of the stream crossing in drier conditions, isolated from the stream flow. These methods typically result in lower sedimentation and associated turbidity impacts when compared to conventional wet crossing methods. The impactsofthe dry crossing methods on fishery resources could include:  increased sedimentation and water turbidity immediately downstream of the construction work area;  direct contact with relatively immobile prey organisms (e.g., benthic and epibenthic) that may be food resources for fish;  alteration or removal of aquatic habitat cover;  introduction of pollutants through possibly contaminated bottom sediments or spills of fuels or lubricants;  impingement or entrainment of fish and other biota associated with the use of water pumps at dam and pump crossings; and  downstream scour associated with use of pumps orflume discharge. In addition, removal of streamside vegetation at the crossings may reduce shading of the waterbody, diminish escape cover, and could, in small areas where flow is minimal or constrained, result in locally elevated water temperatures. In accordance with the FERC Procedures, Algonquin would conduct in-water work, except that required to install or remove equipment, outside of the cold water fisheries timing restriction window (June 1 through September 30) unless expressly permitted or further restricted by the appropriate federal or state agency in writing on a site-specific basis. For example, in its comments provided on the draft EIS, the CTDEEP stated that the seasonal in-water construction window of June 1 through September 30 would apply forall waterbodies regardless of classification. 4-101 The use of dry crossing construction techniques would minimize the potential for erosion and sedimentation within the stream channel by confining impacts to the construction work areas and minimizing impacts on downstream reaches. Additionally, Algonquin would strive to complete each pipeline installation and the associated bed and bank restoration workwithin 24 hours for minor crossings and 48 hours for intermediate crossings. Algonquin would also implement the erosion and sedimentation control measures described in its E&SCP to contain materials within the construction work areas and minimize impacts on fisheries due to changes in waterquality. Use of a flume or dam and pump crossing would have a direct impact on benthos and alteration of aquatic habitats. The impact would result from installation and removal of the temporary dams built to isolate the construction work areas, and from excavation of the pipeline trench. Installation of the temporary dams typically involves the placement of sand bags or equivalent dam diversion structures upstreamanddownstreamof theconstructionworkareas. Thefootprintofthe dams is typicallysmall but would temporarily bury existing benthic organisms within the footprint of the dams. Excavation of the pipeline trench would also directly impact existing benthos through removal and temporary stockpiling in upland areas of bottom sediment. These effects would be limited to a relatively small area. Following installation of the pipeline, the bed and banks would be restored and the temporary dams would be removed. The pipeline trench would be backfilled with the original sediment, restoring similar habitat conditions. Both the restored stream bed and the area beneath the dams would likely be colonized fairly quickly by benthic speciesfrom the adjacentareas of the waterbody. The use of pumps to maintain stream flow around the construction work areas could entrain or impinge fish and ichthyoplankton. This potential impact would be minimized by screening the intakes of the pumping system, as described in Algonquin’s E&SCP. However, some small fish and larvae as well as all forms of ichthyoplankton would still be subject to entrainment, although the duration of this effect would be short (24 to 48 hours) and would cease when the crossing is completed and normal streamflow is restored. The dam and pump crossing method could also result in sediment scour downstream of the crossing if measures were not implemented to dissipate the energy of the pump discharge. As described in the E&SCP for the AIM Project, Algonquin would direct alldischarges from the pumps through energy dissipaters to minimize scour and downstream siltation. The use of the dam and pump crossing method could also temporarily restrict fish passage during the 24 to 48 hours it takes to install the pipeline. This short-term and localized interruption of fish passage is not anticipated to dramatically affect the migration of fish within the stream systems that would be crossed by the Project.  Impacts resulting from tree clearing adjacent to each crossing would be minimal due to Algonquin’s use of existing cleared rights-of-way and/or previously developed corridors for the majority of the proposed pipeline route. Moreover, following the installation of the pipeline, streambanks would be restored, stabilized with erosion control measures, and revegetated. Algonquin would implement procedures to further minimize potential impacts associated with loss of riparian shade and vegetation cover. Clearing of trees and other vegetation would be restricted to only what is necessary to safely construct and operate the pipelines, although use of existing rights-ofway would minimize these impacts. Once construction is complete, streambeds and banks would be quickly restored to preconstruction conditions to the fullest extent possible. Restoration, bank stabilization, and revegetation efforts, which are defined in the AIM Project E&SCP, would minimize the potentialfor erosion from the surrounding landscape. 4-102 In Connecticut, the standard dry crossing methods would be augmented to include recommendations set forth by the CTDEEP (CTDEEP, 2013c). The CTDEEP recommended that the restoration of all stream crossings in Connecticut, not just coldwater resources, have the top 12 inches of native streambed armament scraped off from the existing streambed, stockpiled, and restored back to its original profile, mimicking the physical habitat (riffle, pool, run, etc.) that was present prior to disturbance.  The CTDEEPalsorecommended photo-documentation of the pre-existingstreamconditions to assist in the restoration work. The CTDEEP has specific recommendations for rock used for any stream bank restoration (i.e., use more natural rounded stone cobbles as opposed to riprap) and the planting of shrubs in riparian zones to restore riparian functions (CTDEEP, 2013c). Algonquin would adhere to all of CTDEEP’s recommendations and will finalize the details with the CTDEEP through the permitting processes.  Similarly, the NYSDEC has recommended that the top 12 inches of native streambed material be removed from the crossing area, stockpiled, and placed back in the channel and restored to preconstruction condition. The NYSDEC also recommends that dry stream crossings be conducted using the dam and pump method and that Algonquin require the contractor to have back-up pumps on-site and available in case of mechanical failure. Algonquin would also have 24-hour on-site monitoring during pumping operations, to minimize the chances of any problems at the crossing sites. To achieve a good seal with the channel bottom, Algonquin would use a combination of plastic sheeting and sand bags at the stream dam locations. As per the NYSDEC’s requirement, no liquid concrete is to be placed into any watercourse. The NYSDEC has specific recommendations on the rock used for any stream bank restoration and no riprap armoring or geotextile fabric is to be used for stream bank stabilization. The NYSDEC recommends using a combination of jute matting, seed mixes, and riparian vegetation plantings forstream bank restoration. In summary, implementation of Algonquin's construction, restoration, and mitigation procedures would result in only limited, short-termimpacts on fishery resources, and the aquatic habitats upon which these fishery resources depend. Invertebrate populations would recolonize the crossing area and all temporary construction workspace areas would revert to their original condition, including reestablishment of riparian cover. Furthermore, operation and routine maintenance of the pipeline rightsof-way would not have any noticeable impact on fishery resourcesin the Project area. HDD Crossing Method Algonquin proposes to use the HDD method to cross the Hudson River in New York along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay and the Still River in Connecticut along the Southeast Take-up and Relay segment.  The Hudson River HDD crossing would take place in soft soils above the bedrock and old channel lag deposits. The results of the preliminary hydrologic fracture evaluation are discussed in section 4.3.2.3. Algonquin has prepared and would implement the measures identified in its BDP Plan (see appendix J). Algonquin is proposing to use municipal sources of water for the HDD operations. As such, the Project would not significantly affect aquatic resources in the Hudson River in New York or the Still River in Connecticut.  Blasting Some limited blasting could be required along the AIM Project pipeline segments to increase the depth and width of the existing trenches to accommodate the larger diameter pipeline. Most streambeds with shallow bedrock would likely be of sedimentary rock and thus would not require blasting. In instances where the rock would not be rippable, drilling and blasting would be used to install the pipeline. Potential rock removal and blasting in waterbodies is further discussed in section 4.3.2.3. Rock removal is also discussed in sections 2.3.1 and 4.1.6 and a Rock Removal Plan is provided in appendix E. 4-103 Potential adverse effects of blasting in waterbodies could include direct mortality of organisms in the immediate vicinity of the blast. Blasting can also have same short-term adverse impacts, similar to trenching, including reduced macroinvertebrate prey base, alteration of substrate characteristics, and loss of large woody debris and structure. Algonquin would mitigate the effects of blasting on fish species in several ways. As explained in section 4.3.2.6, Algonquin would file a schedule with FERC identifying when blasting would occur within each waterbody greaterthan 10 feet wide and within any designated coldwater fishery, and provide the schedule to the applicable agencies. The blasting contractor would use delays and stemming to dampen the shock wave. The nature of the material that would require blasting and the short duration of blasting activities would help minimize the amount of fine-grained material released to the aquatic habitat. Furthermore, resident fish inhabiting the area would already be dispersed due to active drilling and preparation of the construction workspace area at the crossing for the particular dry crossing technique selected. Once complete, debris would be removed as needed so as not to interfere with downstream flow. Therefore, by implementing the measures identified in the Rock Removal Plan and additional measures identified above, impacts on aquatic resources from blasting would be adequately minimized and short-term. Hydrostatic Test Water Algonquin would ensure that hydrostatic test water appropriations and discharges would not result in a significant entrainment of fish, loss of habitat, or an adverse effect to water quality. For non-municipal sources of hydrostatic test water, the withdrawal intake hoses would be fitted with intake screen devices that would eliminate the entrainment of fingerling and small fish during water withdrawal. Discharge would comply with regulatory permit conditions and be controlled to prevent scour and sedimentation, flooding, or the introduction of foreign or toxic substances into the aquatic system. With these measures, the intake of water for hydrostatic testing would not significantly impact aquatic resources. SpillPrevention and Control Countermeasures Accidental spills of construction-related fluids (e.g., oil, gasoline, or hydraulic fluids) on the landscape or directly into waterbodies could be debilitating to biota, depending on the type and quantity ofthe spill, and the dispersaland attenuation characteristics ofthe waterbody. Toreduce the potentialfor surface water contamination, Algonquin would adhere to its SPCC Plan. Potential impacts on fish are largely attributable to effects on water quality and other habitat factors that influence the health of the aquatic ecosystem. Minimization and mitigation procedures related to water quality are discussed in detailin section 4.3.2.6.  To minimize the potential for spills from equipment use, Algonquin's SPCC Plan would be implemented.  Refueling orother handling of hazardous materials within 100 feet of wetland and waterbody resources would not be allowed. If the 100-foot setback could not be met, these activities would be performed under the supervision of an EI in accordance with Algonquin's SPCC Plan. Algonquin would conduct routine inspections of tank and storage areas to help reduce the potential for spills or leaks of hazardous materials, as specified in the SPCC Plan.  Implementation of these measures wouldadequately minimize the chances of a spill. 4.6.2.4 EssentialFish Habitat The MSA (16 USC 1801 et seq.) established a management system for marine fisheries resources in the United States. In particular, Congress charged the NOAA Fisheries and the fishery management councils, along with other federal and state agencies and the fishing community, to identify habitats essential to managed species, which include marine, estuarine, and anadromous finfish, mollusks, and 4-104 Federal agenciesthat authorize, fund, or undertake activitiesthat may adversely impact EFH must consult with NOAA Fisheries. Although absolute criteria have not been established for conducting EFH consultations, NOAA Fisheries recommends consolidated EFH consultations with interagency coordination procedures required by other statutes, such as NEPA or the ESA, in order to reduce duplication and improve efficiency. We reviewed the information provided by Algonquin, conducted our own analysis, and consulted with NOAA Fisheries. Our analysis of the potential for Project-related effects on EFH and managed species is provided in this EIS. As a result, FERC requests NOAA Fisheries consider the information provided here asthe EFHassessment for the Project.  Managed Fish Species and Essential Fish Habitats NOAA Fisheries Northeast Regional Office EFH designation tables were reviewed to identify managed species for which EFH could potentially occur within the Project area. This review identified 16 managed species that could occur in the Project area. Information on these 16 managed species and the EFH characteristics of the various life stages is provided in table 4.6.2-3. A list of the waterbodies containing EFH species is included in table 4.6.2-2. The proposed Hudson River crossing area for the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment is located to the north of the designated EFH associated with the lower Hudson River Estuary (NOAA Fisheries, 2013a, 2013c). The estuarine water column provides seasonal nursery areas for young developmental stages, but also as migratory habitat foranadromous species. Although the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would cross the Hudson River up-river of the lower Hudson River designated EFH area, the crossing area may contain habitat that is essential to certain EFH species. The area of the Hudson River that would be crossed by the Project is characterized by an estuarine water column with a lower relative salinity ranging from 0 to 6 ppt (Yozzo et al., 2005). The Hudson River system has a large mixing zone, where fresh and tidal waters come together. NOAA Fisheries expressed concern regarding the Project’s proposed crossing of other tidally influenced or freshwater streams thatcould support EFH speciesand is reviewing the proposed waterbody crossings and crossing methods for the Project. Through consultation with NOAA Fisheries, we have determined that the only waterbody crossing where EFH species could potentially occur is the Hudson River (see table 4.6.2-2).  Assessment of PotentialImpacts on EFH Many of the potential effects on EFH and managed fish species would be similar to those discussed for surface waters and aquatic species and theirhabitats in sections 4.3.2.6 and 4.6.2.3. Because the Hudson River Estuary supports EFH and managed fish species, Algonquin proposes to install the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay across the Hudson River using the HDD method and employing the BMPs outlined in Algonquin’s BDP Plan (see appendix J). Algonquin has performed geotechnical analysis of the proposed crossing and identified that drilling would occur in soft soils. If successfully employed, the HDD method would avoid direct effects, including disturbance to the bed, banks, and EFH species, as well as non-mobile life stages of managed species. 4-105 TABLE 4.6.2-3 Summary of Essential Fish Habitat and General Habitat Parameters for the AIM Project a  b EFH Species Life Stage EFH Characteristics c  Red hake Egg Surface waters; <10 °C; <25 ppt Urophycis chuss Larvae Surface waters;<19 °C; <200 m; >0.5 ppt Juvenile Shell fragment bottom habitats; <16 °C; <100 m; 31-33 ppt Adult Sand/mud bottom depressions; <12 °C; 10-130 m; 33-34 ppt Winter flounder Egg Demersal; sand/muddy sand/mud/gravel bottom; <10 °C; <5 m; 10-30 ppt Pleuronectes americanus Larvae Pelagic and bottom waters; <15 °C; <6 m; 4-30 ppt Juvenile Mud/fine sand bottom habitats; <28 °C; 0.1-10 m; 5-33 ppt Adult Mud/sand/gravel estuarine bottom habitats; <25 °C; 1-100 m; 15-33 ppt Windowpane flounder Egg Surface waters; <20 °C; <70 m Scophthalmus aquosus Larvae Pelagic waters; <20 °C; <70 m Juvenile Mud/fine sand bottom habitats; <25 °C; 1-100 m; 5.5-36 ppt Adult Mud/fine sand bottom habitats; <26.8 °C; 1-75 m; 5.5-36 ppt Atlantic herring Larvae Pelagic waters; <16 °C; 50-90 m; 32 ppt Clupea harengus Juvenile Pelagic waters and bottom habitats; <10 °C; 15-135 m; 26-32 ppt Adult Pelagic waters and bottom habitats; <10 °C; 20-130 m; >28 ppt Bluefish Juvenile Mixing/seawater portions of estuaries Pomatomus salatrix Adult Estuarine waters; >25 ppt Atlantic butterfish Larvae Pelagic waters; mixing portions of estuaries; 9-19 °C; 10-1,800 m Peprilus triacanthus Juvenile Pelagic waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; 3-28 °C; 10-365 m Adult Pelagic waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; 3-28 °C; 10-365 m Atlantic mackerel Juvenile Pelagic waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; 4-22 °C; shore to 320 m Scomber scombrus Adult Pelagic waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; 4-16 °C; shore to 380 m Summer flounder Larvae Pelagic shelf waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; nearshore 10-70 m Paralicthys dentatus Juvenile Demersal; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; salt marsh creeks/ seagrass beds/mudflats/open bays; >3 °C; 10-30 ppt Adult Demersal waters; shallow mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; shallow coastal waters Scup Egg Mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; 13-23 °C; >15 ppt Stenotomus chrysops Larvae Mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; 13-23 °C; >15 ppt Juvenile Demersal waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; sand/mud/mussel and eelgrass beds; >7 °C; >15 ppt Adult Demersal waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; >7 °C Coastal Migratory Pelagics Black sea bass Juvenile Demersal waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; rough bottom; Centropristis striata shellfish/eelgrass beds; structures >6 °C; >18 ppt Adult Demersal waters; mixing/seawater portions of estuaries; structured habitat; >6 °C King mackerel Egg Pelagic waters; > 17 °C; 32-36 ppt Scomberomorus cavalla Larvae Pelagic waters; 26-31 °C; 26-37 ppt Juvenile Pelagic waters; > 20 °C Adult Pelagic waters; > 20 °C  4-106 TABLE 4.6.2-3 (cont’d) Summary of Essential Fish Habitat and General Habitat Parameters for the AIM Project a  b EFH Species Life Stage EFH Characteristics c  Spanish mackerel Egg Pelagic waters; > 17 °C; 32-36 ppt Scomberomorus maculatus Larvae Pelagic waters; 19-30 °C; > 28 ppt Juvenile Estuaries; > 17 °C; 32-26 ppt Adult Estuaries; pelagic waters; 21-31 °C; 32-36 ppt Cobia Egg Offshore Rachycentron canadum Larvae Offshore Juvenile Coastal waters; high salinity Adult Estuaries; mud, sand, coral reef substrates Highly Migratory Species Sandbar shark Neonates Shallow coastal waters; < 25 m Carcharhinus plumbeus Dusky shark Neonates Shallow coastal waters, inlets, estuaries; < 25 m Carcharhinus obscures Sand tiger shark Neonates Shallow coastal waters; < 200 m Carcharias taurus ____________________ a Based on 10-minute by 10-minute latitudinal/longitudinal designated EFH quadrants. b Designated EFH along the Project only in areas where EFH characteristics are present. c °C = degrees Celsius; m = meters; ppt = parts per thousand; > = greater than; < = less than Source: NOAA Fisheries, 2013c  While avoiding direct impacts, the HDD method is not without risks. The potential effects on aquatic resources associated with HDD can include:  erosion or sedimentation associated with onshore operation ofthe HDD equipment;  inadvertent hazardous material spills associated with operation of construction equipment; and  inadvertent release of drilling fluids. Construction related to the onshore operation of the HDD equipment could cause run-off of sediment into the waterbody, which could adversely affect managed fish species. Also, accidental spills of petroleum products or hazardous materials into or near the waterbody could be toxic to any life stage, depending on the type and quantity of the spill. As discussed in sections 4.3.2.6 and 4.6.2.3, Algonquin would minimize the potential impacts on aquatic resources during construction through implementation of the measuresidentified in its E&SCP and BDP Plan (see appendix J), which we find acceptable.  NOAA Fisheries concurredwith the assessment that the Project would have no effect on federally listed sturgeon (see section 4.7.1.1) given the proposed use of the HDD construction method and implementation of Algonquin’s proposed BDP Plan for the Hudson River crossing. Additionally, no water would be withdrawn from the Hudson River to support Project construction, such that direct effects from entrainment of managed fish species and their prey would also be avoided. As indicated in section 4.3.2.3, if some drilling fluid is released into the river during a hydraulic fracture, the volume would be minimal and would not accumulate due to the rapid drilling rates. Due to the river current, marine traffic, existing turbidity, and other pollutants that contribute to the discoloration of a major waterbody like the 4-107 Hudson River, it is unlikely thatan inadvertentreleasewould be identifiable. Therefore, we conclude that the Project would have minimal, if any, adverse effects on EFH or managed species associated with the proposed HDD of the Hudson River. As supported through consultation, NOAA Fisheries concurs with our determination (NOAAFisheries, 2014c). 4.7 SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES Special status species are those for which federal or state agencies afford an additional level of protection by law, regulation, or policy. Included in this category are federally listed threatened or endangered species, migratory birds protected by the MBTA; eagles protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA); marine mammals protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA); and species that are designated as state-listed or receive special management consideration by New York State, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Species listed as candidates or proposed for federal listing by the FWS or NOAA Fisheries are also included here as special status species due to the potentialfor these species to become listed as threatened orendangered during the term ofthe Project. 4.7.1 Federally Listed Species Section 7 of the ESA requires federal agencies to ensure that any actions authorized, funded, or carried out by the agencies do not jeopardize the continued existence of a federally listed threatened or endangered species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat for a federally listed species. The FWS, which is responsible for terrestrial and freshwater species and NOAA Fisheries, which is responsible for marine and anadromous species, jointly administer the law. As the lead federal agency for authorizing the Project, FERC is required to consult with the FWS and NOAA Fisheries to determine whether federally listed endangered or threatened species or designated critical habitat are found in the vicinity of the Project, and to evaluate the proposed action’s potential effects on those species or critical habitat. For actions involving major construction activities with the potential to affect listed species or designated critical habitat, the FERC must report its findings to the FWS and NOAA Fisheries in a BA for those species that may be affected. If it is determined the action is likely to adversely affect listed species or designated critical habitat, the FERC is required to initiate formal consultation with the appropriate agency. In response, the FWS or NOAA Fisheries would issue a Biological Opinion (BO) as to whether or not the action would likely jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat.  Algonquin, acting as the FERC’s non-federal representative for the purpose of complying with section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, initiated informal consultation with NOAA Fisheries Protected Resources Division on May 20, 2013. NOAA Fisheries identified two federally listed threatened or endangered species (Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon) under their jurisdiction that are known to occur in the Hudson River within the Project area. As discussed in section 4.7.1.1, the Project would have no effect on the shortnose or Atlantic sturgeon. In a letter dated April 18, 2014, NOAA Fisheries concurred with this determination and consultation for the Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon is complete (NOAA Fisheries, 2014a). Algonquin also initiated informal consultation with the FWS Ecological Field Services Office in New England on May 17, 2013 and New York on May 20, 2013 regarding federally listed threatened or endangered species potentially occurring in or near the Project area. The FWS identified seven federally listed threatened or endangered species (piping plover, roseate tern, Puritan tiger beetle, Indiana bat, bog turtle, northern red-bellied cooter, and small whorled pogonia), as well as one candidate species (New England cottontail) and one species proposed for listing as endangered (northern long-eared bat) that are known to occur in the Project area. These species are summarized in table 4.7.1-1 and discussed in sections 4.7.1.2 (federally listed) and 4.7.1.3 (proposed and candidate).  4-108 TABLE 4.7.1-1 Federally Listed Species Potentially Occurring Within the Vicinity of the AIM Project  Species/ Federal Common Name (Scientific Name) Status a  Pipeline Facilities  b Aboveground Facilities  Determination c  NY  CT  MA  NY  CT  RI  MA  Haverstraw to Stony Point T&RStony Point to Yorktown T&R Southeast to ML V 19 T&R  Southeast to ML V 19 T&RLine 36A Loop ExtensionE-1 System Lateral T&R E-1 System Lateral Loop  West Roxbury Lateral Stony Point Compressor Station Southeast Compressor Station Stony Point M&RPeekskill M&RCortland M&R Cromwell Compressor Station Chaplin Compressor Station Oakland Heights M&R West Danbury M&RSouthbury M&RWaterbury M&RGuilford M&RFarmington M&RGlastonbury M&RMiddletown M&RMontville M&RWillimantic M&RPomfret M&R Burrillville Compressor Station  Assonet M&R West Roxbury M&RMiddleborough M&R  Fish  Atlantic sturgeon E  X  No effect  (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus)  Shortnose sturgeon E  X  No effect  (Acipenser brevirostrum)  Birds  Piping plover T  No effect  (Charadrius melodius)  Roseate tern E  No effect  (Sterna dougallii dougallii)  Invertebrates  Puritan tiger beetle T  No effect  (Cicindela puritan)  Mammals  Indiana bat E  X X X  X X X X  X  X X X X  X X X X X X X X X X X X X  X  X X  Not likely to  (Myotis sodalis)  adversely affect  Northern long-eared bat PE  X X X  X X X X  X  X X X X  X X X X X X X X X X X X X  X  X X  Not likely to jeopardize  (Myotis septentrionalis)  the continued existence  New England cottontail C  X  X X  Would not contribute to a  (Sylvilagus transitionalis)  trend toward federal listing  Reptiles  Bog turtle T  X X X  X  X X X X X  Not likely to  (Glyptemys muhlenbergii)  adversely affect  Northern red-bellied cooter E  X  No effect  (Pseudemys rubriventris)  Plants  Small whorled pogonia E  X X  X  No effect  (Isotria medeolodes)  ____________________  a Abbreviations: (E) Endangered; (T) Threatened; (C)  Candidate ; (PE) Propos ed E ndangered.  b Aboveground facilities include facilities where the F WS expres sed concern w ith r egards to a partic ular species or facilities where vegetation woul d be  affected a s described in section 4.5  of this EIS.  c The FERC’s determination for federally listed threat ened and e ndangered sp ecie s and preliminary  determination for candidate and proposed spe cies  should the y be listed during the term  of the Project.  4-109 In compliance with section 7 of the ESA, FERC requested that the FWS consider the draft EIS, along with various survey reports submitted by Algonquin directly to the FWS, as the draft BA for the AIM Project. After issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin submitted additional survey reports and other information to both the FWS and FERC relative to the Indian and northern long-eared bats. On October 24, 2014, FERC consulted with the FWS regarding Algonquin’s survey results and to request concurrenceon oureffects determinations forthe specieslistedintable4.7.1-1 under its jurisdiction. The FWS concurred with our findings and confirmed that the AIM Project is unlikely to adversely affect any federally listed species under its jurisdiction as listed in the table (FWS, 2014l). At the time of publication of this final EIS, the FWS is in the process of issuing a letter of concurrence for the AIM Project, which will conclude consultation under section 7 of the ESA(FWS, 2014l). 4.7.1.1 Species Under NOAAFisheries Jurisdiction NOAA Fisheries identified two species under their jurisdiction that are likely to occur where the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would cross the Hudson River. These fish species include the Atlantic sturgeon and shortnose sturgeon, for which all life stages are known to transit through the Project area. Atlantic sturgeon are also known to concentrate and overwinter within the Project area. As such, both species have the potential to be presentthroughoutthe year. Atlantic Sturgeon The Atlantic sturgeon is listed as an endangered species for the New York Bight distinct population segment (DPS) located within the Hudson River (NOAA Fisheries, 2013a). Atlantic sturgeon of the New York Bight DPS are also listed as protected/critically imperiled in New York (NYNHP, 2013b). The New York Bight DPS is the only DPS of Atlantic sturgeon known to spawn in the Hudson River, although other DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon are known to be present within the Hudson River. As such, sub-adult and adult Atlantic sturgeon from any DPS may be present within the Hudson River as far north as the Troy Dam, and have the potential to occur within the Project area (NYNHP, 2013d; NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). The Atlantic sturgeon is a large, anadromous fish that prefers deeper parts of large rivers with moderate flow. Adults typically spawn between April and June from Canada to the mid-Atlantic, with timing depending on the latitude. Following spawning, males may remain in the river or lower estuary until the fall; females typically exit the rivers within 4 to 6 weeks. Juveniles move downstream and inhabit brackish waters for a few months, and when they reach a size of about 30 to 36 inches, they move into near shore coastal waters (NOAA Fisheries, 2013a). Catches of immature sturgeon (age 1 year and older) suggest that juveniles occupy waters in the Hudson River within the Project area in both summer and fall (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). Atlantic sturgeon adults are likely to migrate through the proposed crossing area in the spring as they move from oceanic overwintering sites to upstream spawning sites and back to lower reaches of the estuary or oceanic areas in the late spring and early summer. Atlantic sturgeon adults are most likely to occur in the AIM Project area from May through September(NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). Shortnose Sturgeon The federally endangered shortnose sturgeon is also state-listed as endangered/critically imperiled in New York (NYNHP, 2013b). Shortnose sturgeon is a large, long-lived benthic-feeding species of anadromous fish. Habitats primarily include slow-moving riverine, estuarine and marine near shore habitats. Shortnose sturgeons are known to occur in the Hudson River from the tip of Manhattan north to the Troy Dam (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d, 2013f). Shortnose sturgeon travel upriver to spawn (NOAA Fisheries, 2013f). In the Hudson River, adults have been reported throughout the year in both freshwater and upper tidal saline areas. From late 4-110 spring to early fall, sturgeon typically use the deep channels in fresh and brackish habitats. In late fall, most adults congregate in a single wintering site (Bain et al., 2007), located south of Kingston New York (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). Each year, spawning begins in late March through mid-April, when water temperatures increase to 8 to 9 degrees Celsius(°C), and usually ends once temperatures reach 12 to 15 °C (NOAA Fisheries, 1998, 2013b). Reproductively active adults begin their upstream migration to the spawning grounds that extend below the federal dam at Troy to about Coeymans, New York (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). After spawning, adults quickly disperse, traveling to their summer feeding grounds, which encompass approximately 86 river miles from north of Yonkers to South of Coxsackie, New York (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d.). Juveniles are found typically at the saltwater/freshwater interface, and move back and forth in the low salinity area during the summer. In the Hudson River, juveniles are usually found in channels over silt substrates (NOAA Fisheries, 1998). Age to maturity varies throughout the range, but appears to be at approximately 7 to 10 years to first spawn for females in the Hudson River, with males maturing slightly earlier(NOAA Fisheries, 1998). Conclusions for Atlantic and Shortnose Sturgeon NOAA Fisheries indicated that shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon are present in the Hudson River near Algonquin’s proposed pipeline crossing location year-round (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). In a letter dated May 30, 2014, NOAA Fisheries requested Algonquin avoid in water work from October 1 through April 1 of any year to avoid adverse effects on the Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon (NOAA Fisheries, 2013d). Adhering to NOAA Fisheries request, Algonquin would install the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment across the Hudson River using the HDD method, avoiding any in water work in the Hudson River. The primary environmental concern associated with an HDD is the potential for an inadvertent release of drilling fluids into waterbodies or wetlands during drilling operations. Algonquin has developed a BDP Plan (see appendix J) for monitoring the HDD and responding in the event of an inadvertent release.  If an inadvertent release were to occur, the Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon would not be effected since the HDD drilling fluids are believed non-toxic to sturgeon. Additionally, the increase in turbidly associated with an inadvertent release would be temporary, confined to the area ofthe releasedue to the rapid settling rate of bentonite, and considered insignificant due tothe existing turbidly levels in the Hudson River(NOAA Fisheries, 2014b). Based on implementation of the HDD method for crossing the Hudson River with the associated BDP Plan and existing turbidity levels in the Hudson, the Project would have no effect on the shortnose or Atlantic sturgeon. In a letter dated April 18, 2014, NOAA Fisheries concurred with this determination and consultation for the Atlantic and shortnosesturgeon is complete (NOAA Fisheries, 2014a). 4.7.1.2 Species under FWS Jurisdiction Piping Plover The piping plover is a federally listed threatened species that is also state-listed as endangered in New York (NYSDEC, 2014c) and threatened in Massachusetts (MDFW, 2014a) and Connecticut (CTDEEP, 2014a). The piping plover is a shorebird found on coastal beaches in counties where AIM Project facilities are located, including Plymouth and Bristol Counties in Massachusetts and New Haven County, Connecticut (FWS, 2014a). The AIM Project facilities in these three counties are not located on or near any coastal beaches. As such, we conclude that the Project would have no effect on the piping plover.  The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l).  Roseate Tern The roseate tern is a federally listed endangered species and is also state-listed as endangered in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut (CTDEEP 2013a; FWS, 2014b; MDFW, 2014b; NYSDEC, 4-111 2014c). Like the piping plover, the roseate tern is a shorebird found on coastal beaches in counties where AIM Project facilities are located including Plymouth and Bristol Counties in Massachusetts and New Haven County, Connecticut.  However, the facilities in these countieswould notbe located on or near any coastal beaches. Therefore, we conclude that the Project would have no effect on the roseate tern. The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). Puritan Tiger Beetle The puritan tiger beetle is a federally listed threatened species and Connecticut state-listed endangered species that has been documented within sandy beach habitats along the Connecticut River in the Town of Cromwell, Middlesex County, Connecticut (FWS, 2014c; CTDEEP, 2014b). The closest AIM Project facility to the Connecticut River is the Line-36A Loop Extension located in the Towns of Cromwell and Rocky Hill. The proposed facilities would not be located on sandy beach habitat on the shore of the Connecticut River. Therefore, we conclude that the Project would have no effect on the puritan tiger beetle.  The FWS hasconcurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). Indiana Bat The Indiana bat is a federally listed endangered species and is also a state-listed endangered species in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. During the winter months, from late October to April, Indiana bats hibernate in caves and abandoned mineshafts. Hibernation can begin as early as September and can extend to late May (NYSDEC, 2013a; Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program [MNHESP], 2013a). The bats emerge in the spring and travel to summer roost sites and maternity colonies in wooded or semi-wooded habitats (FWS, 2004). Females give birth during this period, typically forming small colonies located in the crevices or under loose bark in large dead or living trees. Roost trees may be in upland areas or floodplain forests and occasionally in man-made structures, such as sheds or bridges (FWS, 2004). Large trees of species such as shagbark hickory and white oak are often preferred roost sites. Indiana bats have the potential to occur in New York in Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam Counties, and in Connecticut in Fairfield and New Haven Counties. Project pipeline facilities in these counties include the Haverstraw to Stony Point, Stony Point to Yorktown, and the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segments. Aboveground facilities include the existing Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations and four existing M&R stations (Guilford, North Haven, Southbury, and Waterbury).  The FWS identified a section of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment as having the potential to provide suitable summer habitat for the Indiana bat, due to the proximity of an active hibernaculum 12 miles away in Blooming Grove New York (FWS, 2013a). The FWS also indicated that Indiana bats have active hibernacula in New York and the potential to occur throughout the Project area (Algonquin, 2014a). The FWS identified that wooded areas, open fields and lawns may provide suitable roosting and/or foraging habitat for Indiana bats (FWS, 2013a) and recommended presence/absence surveys if suitable habitat is present in the AIM Project area. If bats are present in suitable summer habitat, tree clearing could potentially kill, injure, or disturb breeding or roosting bats. Indiana bats could also be impacted by the loss of tree habitat or changes to other vegetation if significant amounts of clearing were to occur (FWS, 2013a).  To determine if Indiana bats are presentalong the AIM Project rights-of-way and at aboveground facilities, Algonquin conducted acoustic surveys in areas identified as potential Indiana bat summer roosting habitat within the Project area between May 28 and June 19, 2014 (Algonquin, 2014l). These surveys were conducted in accordance with FWS established protocols (FWS, 2014d) and a study plan developedthrough consultation with the FWS (Algonquin, 2014c).  Algonquin submitted the results of the Indiana bat surveys directly to the FERC, FWS, and NYSDEC. The surveys found that no Indiana bats were detected in Connecticut, Massachusetts, or 4-112 Rhode Island. Indiana bats were detected at two locations in New York, including one location in Rockland County and another in Westchester County. To avoid direct impact on and incidental take of Indiana bats during the maternity season at these locations, Algonquin would adhere to the FWS-recommended tree clearing restriction window (April 1 to September 31) within a 5-mile radius of each identified bat location.  Therefore, Algonquin would conduct all tree clearing within the 5-mile known bat habitat protection area between October 1 and March 31 when bats are in hibernation. Based on Algonquin’s 2014 survey results and implementation of the FWS-recommended tree clearing restriction window within the accepted home range of the species (5-mile radius), we have concluded that the Project may affect but is not likely to adversely affect the Indiana bat. The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). Bog Turtle The bog turtle is a federally listed threatened species that is also listed as endangered in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts (NYNHP, 2013b; NYSDEC, 2013e; CTDEEP, 2013b; MNHESP, 2013b). The species range is restricted to scattered populations in the eastern United States from western Massachusetts and New York south to North Carolina. Bog turtles hibernate through the winter in a muskrat lodge or burrow, emerging by around mid-April (NYSDEC, 2013e). Bog turtles live in habitats with cool, shallow, slow-moving water, soft muck soils, and tussock-forming herbaceous vegetation. Preferred habitats include wet meadows or open calcareous bogs dominated by sedges or sphagnum moss (NYSDEC, 2013e). Based on initial information from the FWS and CTDEEP, bog turtles could be present in suitable wetlands along Algonquin’s proposed Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment in Putnam County, New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut (Algonquin, 2014a; CTDEEP, 2013d). No potential habitat for bog turtles has been identified at Project facilities in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. Further consultation with the FWS identified historic occurrences of bog turtles in Danbury, Connecticut and known bog turtle habitat within 16 miles of the proposed Project pipeline facilities in New York (Algonquin, 2014a). To address the potential occurrence of bog turtles in the Project area, Algonquin conducted Phase 1 surveys for the AIM Project facilities in New York, and the Southeast to MLV-19 Take-up and Relay segment and the Southeast Compressor Station in Connecticut during the spring of 2014. Based on Phase 1 survey results, and through consultation with the FWS, Algonquin conducted Phase 2 surveys for seven wetland sites that would be directly affected by the Project. Bog turtle surveys were conducted by a FWS-qualified bog turtle surveyor (FWS, 2013f) during March, April, and May 2014, corresponding with the prescribed spring/summer survey period (FWS, 2006). Algonquin submitted the results of the bog turtle surveys directly to the FERC, FWS, and NYSDEC. No bog turtles were detected during Phase 2 surveys.   For five wetland sites that contained potential habitat for bog turtles but would not be directly affected by the Project, Algonquin would implement site-specific conservation measures approved by the FWS.  These conservation measuresinclude:  retaining a qualified bog turtle surveyor to clear the work area of any wildlife prior to the start of any earth moving activity;  erecting a double layer of heavy duty silt fence delineating the work area within potential habitat;  retaining a qualified bog turtle surveyor to inspect the work area each day prior to construction within the wetlands;  contacting the FWS and ceasing work ifa bog turtle is found; and  avoiding blasting within the wetlands. 4-113 Based on the survey results and Algonquin’s proposed commitment to implementing the conservation measures presented above, which the FWS considers adequate for avoiding adverse impacts on bog turtles, we conclude that the Project may affect, but would not likely adversely affect the bog turtle. The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). Northern Red-bellied Cooter Northern Red-bellied cooter is a federally endangered species that inhabits a small geographic range in Massachusetts (FWS, 2014e). The Middleborough M&R Station is located in the town of Middleborough in Plymouth County where historical records indicate that the northern red-bellied cooter may be present(FWS, 2013a). Northern red-bellied cooters inhabited ponds, lakes, and other large waterbodies. During their active season they are almost exclusively found in open water habitats (MDFW, 2014c). Northern red-bellied cooters normally nest within 100 yards of their home waterbody, in exposed locations with minimal canopy coverage. The existing Middleborough M&R Station would undergo modifications as part of the AIM Project. The existing station is surrounded by paved roadways, residential developments, and a closed canopy red-maple swamp. The nearest open waterbody is a small manmade pond located approximately 400 feet to the northwest of the existing station. There is no suitable foraging or nesting habitat for northern red-bellied cooters located within 200 feet of the existing station. All proposed modification work at the Middleborough M&R Station would take place within the existing fence line and developed portion ofthe site and would not disturb any vegetation as described in section 4.5.4. Due to the absence of suitable habitat for the northern red-bellied cooter in the areas to be disturbed by the Project, we have determined that the Project would have no effect on the northern red-bellied cooter. The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). Small Whorled Pogonia Small whorled pogonia is a federally listed threatened species and a New York State-listed endangered species that has been historically recorded in Rockland County, New York (NYSDEC, 2010b; FWS, 2013a). The plant is a small orchid that grows in mature hardwood forests of beech, birch, maple, oak and hickory, preferring acidic soils with thick leaf litter (FWS, 2013b). Algonquin consulted with the FWS regarding the potential for small whorled pogonia habitat to occur in the AIM Project area in Rockland County, New York and the need for field surveys (Algonquin, 2014a).  During a meeting on March 20, 2014, the FWS identified six areas of concern in the Project area. To determine if the small whorled pogonia is present in the proposed construction work area within the six areas of concern, Algonquin conducted botanical surveys between July 1 and 3, 2014, which is a time when the small whorled pogonia is considered easily identifiable. No small whorled pogonia plants were observed during these surveys and only a few suitable microhabitats were observed. Based on our review of Algonquin’s survey report that was filed with the FWS and FERC on July 10, 2014, we conclude that the Project would have no effect on the small whorled pogonia. The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). 4-114 4.7.1.3 Federal Candidate andProposed Species Although candidate and proposed species do not receive federal protection under the ESA, the FWS requested that the FERC consider the potential effects on northern long-eared bat and New England cottontail so that section 7 consultations could be facilitated in the event these species become listed before or during Project construction (FWS, 2013a, Algonquin, 2014a, Algonquin, 2014b). New England Cottontail New England cottontail is currently a candidate species for listing under the ESA (FWS, 2013c). The New England cottontail prefers early successional forests (e.g. thickets with thick and tangled vegetation) that aregenerally less than 25 years old. Algonquin’s existing pipeline rights-of-way are maintained in an early vegetative successional state, and may provide suitable shrub habitat for New England cottontails. Information on potential vegetation impacts and mitigation is provided in section 4.5.4. The FWS indicated that the New England cottontail is currently undergoing review for listing by the FWS and has the potential to be present near AIM Project facilities (Algonquin, 2014a). These facilities include the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment in Westchester County, New York; the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment in Putnam and Fairfield Counties, Connecticut; and the E-1 System Lateral Take-Up and Relay segment in Connecticut (Algonquin, 2014a). However, the FWS explained that the final rule and list status for New England Cottontail would not likely occur until after the AIM Project completed construction (FWS, 2014f; FWS, 2014g). As such, the FWS indicated that the New England cottontail was not an issue for the Project (FWS, 2014f). The FWS also reviewed photo documentation taken along Algonquin’s right-of-way during bog turtle surveys in 2014 and concluded that the habitat in the proposed AIM Project area is not likely suitable for the New England cottontail (FWS, 2014g). Therefore, we conclude that the Project would not contribute to a trend toward federal listing of the New England cottontail. The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014l). Northern Long-eared Bat The northern long-eared bat is currently proposed for federal listing as an endangered species (FWS, 2013d) and is also a state-listed endangered species in Massachusetts (MDFW, 2014d). The northern long-eared bat was not initially identified by the FWS as rare or a species of concern during consultation in 2013. However, due to rapid and profound declines in Northeast bat populations due to white-nose syndrome, the species was proposed for listing as endangered by the FWS in October 2013 and afinal rule is anticipated in April 2015 (FWS, 2013a, 2014m). During the summer, northern long-eared bats hunt and roost in forests, roosting in stands of dead hardwoods with large vertical cavities (FWS, 2014h; MDFW, 2014d). During the winter months, from late October to April this species returns to historic hibernacula sites. Suitable winter hibernacula for this species includes underground caves and cave-like structures (such as mines or railroad tunnels), typically with large passages and significant cracks and crevices for roosting. Northern long-eared bats typically occupy theirsummer habitat from early April through mid-September each year. If northern long-eared bats are present, tree clearing could potentially kill, injure, or disturb breeding or roosting bats. Northern long-eared bats could also be affected by the loss of tree habitat if significant amounts of tree clearing were to occur. To determine if northern long-eared bats are present within the Project area, Algonquin conducted acoustic surveys in potential northern long-eared bat summer habitat, concurrent with the surveys for the Indiana bat, and consulted with the FWS for both bat species (see discussion for Indiana bat above). Specific to the northern long-eared bat, Algonquin used the Northern long-eared bat Interim Conference and Planning Guidance document (FWS, 2014i) to guide 4-115 Algonquin submitted the results of the northern long-eared bat surveys directly to the FERC, FWS, and NYSDEC. The surveys found that no northern long-eared bats were detected in Connecticut, Massachusetts, or Rhode Island. Northern long-eared bats were detected at one location in Westchester County, New York. To avoid direct and incidental take of northern long-eared bats during the maternity season at this location, Algonquin would adhere to the FWS-recommended tree clearing restriction window (April 1 to September 31) within the accepted home range of the species (3-mile radius). Therefore, Algonquin would conduct any required tree clearing for the Project within the 3-mile known bat habitat protection area between October 1 and March 31 when the bats are in hibernation. Based on Algonquin’s 2014 summer habitat survey results and implementation of the FWS-recommended tree clearing restriction window within the accepted home range of the species (3-mile radius), we have concluded that the Project would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the northern long-eared bat.  The FWS has concurred with this determination (FWS, 2014). 4.7.2 Migratory Birds Migratory birds are species that nest in the United States during the summer and make short or long-distance migrations for the non-breeding season. Neotropical migrant birds migrate south to the tropical regions of Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean for the non-breeding season. Migratory birds are protected under the MBTA (16 USC 703-711). The MBTA, as amended, prohibits the taking, killing, possession, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, or nests unless authorized under a FWS permit. Executive Order 13186 (66 Federal Register 3853) directs federal agencies to identify where unintentional take is likely to have a measurable negative effect on migratory bird populations and to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on migratory birds through enhanced collaboration with the FWS. Executive Order 13186 states that emphasis should be placed on species of concern, priority habitats, and key risk factors, and that particular focus should be given to addressing population-level impacts. On March 30, 2011, the FWS and the Commission entered into a MBTA MOU that focuses on avoiding or minimizing adverse impacts on migratory birds and strengthening migratory bird conservation through enhanced collaboration between the two agencies. This voluntary MBTA MOU does not waive legal requirements under the MBTA, BGEPA, ESA, Federal Power Act, NGA, or any other statutes and does notauthorize the take of migratory birds. To assist in our review of the AIM Project, Algonquin provided the Commission with the FWS list of Birds of Conservation Concern (BCC) for the Bird Conservation Regions (BCR) where AIM Project facilities would be located, including the Appalachian Mountains (BCR 28) and New England/Mid-Atlantic Coast (BCR 30), as published by the FWS. In this list Algonquin also included the Atlantic Northern Forest BCR (14) as referenced by the FWS (FWS, 2013a). This table identifies 127 species occurring in BCRs 30 and 28 where AIM Project facilities would be located, including 89 species that breed in these BCRs. All of the migratory BCCs and other sensitive bird species that occur in BCRs 14, 28, and 30 are listed in table O-1 in appendix O. See section 4.7.1 for discussion of potential effects on migratory birds thatarealso federally listed as threatened or endangered. The potential impact of the Project on migratory birds, including BCC-listed birds, would include the temporary and permanent loss of habitat associated with the removal of existing vegetation during construction (see section 4.5.4). Noise and other construction activities could potentially affect foraging and breeding activities of birds in nearby areas, or temporarily displace birds into adjacent habitats. Construction activities that occur during the nesting season for migratory birds (generally April 1 to August 31) could result in abandonment or destruction of nests and mortality of eggs and young birds that 4-116 have not yet fledged. Migratory birds could also be affected by operation and maintenance of the new facilities, which would permanently convert approximately 24.6 acres of upland forest to an herbaceous state. Potential effects would include a reduction in available forest habitat associated with the conversion of forested land to open land on the permanent right-of-way possibly resulting in increased competition, a potential increase in parasitic bird species, edge effects, and ongoing disturbances associated with periodic mowing and other right-of-way maintenance activities. The FWS expressed specific concern regarding impacts on forest-interior birds and their habitats due to fragmentation (FWS, 2013a).  The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would run adjacent to and across a section of the Harriman and Sterling Forests IBA in Rockland County, New York (Audubon, 2014).  About 15.3 acres of forested land would be affected by this segment. The Harriman and Sterling Forests IBA is a 63,800-acre area that is part of the Hudson Highlands (see section 4.6.1.2 for discussion of the Hudson Highlands). This IBA is 90 percent forest, including Appalachian oak-pine, deciduous wetland, evergreen northern hardwood, oak, and sugar maple mesic forests (Burger and Liner, 2005).  This diverse, forested area supports a healthy representative breeding community of forest birds including state-listed species of concern including the sharp-shinned hawk, Coopers hawk, northern goshawk, red-shouldered hawk, golden-winged warbler, and cerulean warbler (Burger and Liner, 2005; NYSDEC, 2014c). Tree removal and construction associated disturbance in the area of the IBA could potentially harm or disturb these birds during their breeding season. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would involve 72.7 acres of tree clearing and diverges from Algonquin’s existing rights-of-way where it would cross the Hudson River and the associated Lower Hudson River IBA in Rockland and Westchester Counties, New York (Audubon, 2014). The LowerHudson RiverIBAis a 28,000-acre areathat extends fromjustnorth ofthe Newburgh-beacon Bridge and south to, and including, Croton Point Park (Burger and Liner, 2005). This area also includes surrounding upland areas that are important winter roost sites for state-listed threatened bald eagle (NYSDEC, 2014c). The Lower Hudson River IBA is one of the most critical wintering bald eagle sites in New York and is becoming an important breeding area (Burger and Liner, 2005). In addition to bald eagles, Croton Park also supports wintering and breeding grassland birds including the state-listed endangered short-eared owl, threatened northern harrier and Henslow’s sparrow, and special concern grassland sparrow and vesper sparrow (Burger and Liner, 2005; NYSDEC, 2014c). The proposed pipeline crossing of the Hudson River is approximately 6 miles north of Croton Point Park. As such, the Project would not disturb this park or the park’s resident birds. Potential effects on bald eagles forthe area of the Lower Hudson River IBA crossed by the Project are discussed in section 4.7.3. Algonquin designed the Project to minimize potential impacts on migratory birds and interior forest bird species and would take other measures during Project construction and operation to limit migratory bird impacts. These measuresinclude:  routing Project facilities to avoid sensitive resources where possible;  maximizing the use of existing pipeline and utility rights-of-way;  limiting the construction and operation right-of-way widths to the minimum necessary;  conducting mitigation for impacts on sensitive resources (e.g., wetlands and protected species) through agency permit conditions;  adherence to the measures outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP during construction of the Project facilities; and  limiting routine right-of-way maintenance clearing and prohibiting clearing during the migratory bird nesting season (April15 to August 1). 4-117 In addition to the measures presented above, Algonquin would commit to conducting surveys prior to clearing along the 4.9-mile West Roxbury Lateral in Massachusetts. Excluding the proposed West Roxbury Lateral, 94 percent of the proposed pipeline facilities are located within existing pipeline corridors and other utility rights-of-way, minimizing fragmentation of interior forests to the maximum extent possible.  Thus, tree-clearing activities would be limited in scope and spread over the entire Project area. We find that these measures would minimize the effects of the Project on BCCs and other migratory birds. On October 24, 2014, FERC consulted with the FWS and the FWS confirmed that Algonquin’s proposed measures are sufficient for minimizing impacts on migratory birds (FWS, 2014). 4.7.3 Bald Eagles Although the bald eagle was removed from the federal list of threatened and endangered species by the FWS on July 9, 2007 (FWS, 2007a), bald and golden eagles are still protected under the BGEPA (16 USC 668-668d), which prohibits the taking of eagles, their eggs, or their nests. Bald eagles are also state-listed asthreatened inallstates crossed bythe Project. Bald eaglesforage primarilyforfish in large bodies of waters such as lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. Large nests are built near the tops of tall trees, or occasionally on cliffs, often overlooking open water (FWS, 2014j). During the summer, the eagle pairs defend territories that may include the active nest along with one or more alternate nests (FWS, 2007a). Wintering habitat consists of areas ofice-free open water with nearby foraging perches (FWS, 2014j).  According to information published by the FWS New York Field Office (FWS, 2013e) bald eagles occur in portions of Rockland and Westchester Counties in New York. As previously mentioned, the Lower Hudson River IBA located in these counties is an important wintering and breeding area for bald eagles in New York State (Burger and Liner, 2005; NYSDEC, 2014c) and the NYSDEC identified the area in and around the Hudson River as their main area of concern for the Project (NYSDEC, 2013b). Wintering roost locations occur in and around the proposed crossing location of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay including (but not strictly limited to) Bear Mountain, the Hudson River shoreline, Lake Meahagh, and Iona Island. To assess and address potential Project impacts on bald eagles, the NYSDEC recommends adherence to the FWS’ 2007 National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (FWS, 2007b).  The NYSDEC stated that, generally avoiding Project activities during the wintering period (December 1st to March 31st) is sufficient to avoid impacts on wintering bald eagles (Algonquin, 2014a). Also, the NYSDEC asked that any Project-related blasting be reviewed for potential impacts in areas indicated for bald eagle (i.e., in and around the Hudson River). A meeting between Algonquin and the FWS on January 23, 2014, addressed the potential for bald eagle nests to be present near the Hudson River crossing (Algonquin, 2014a).  The FWS’ primary concern was noise mitigation and proximity of work to active nesting sites. Algonquin conducted bald eagle surveys for the Hudson River crossing area in March and April 2014 to assess winter roosting activity and to investigate the presence of bald eagle nests (Algonquin, 2014c). During the surveys conducted in March, adult and immature bald eagles were observed flying, foraging from ice flows, and perching along the shorelines and hillsides of the Hudson River. These eagles were not observed during the April survey and are considered wintering eagles. No bald eagle nests were observed in the Project area or within 1 mile of the Project; the largest buffer for protecting nests from potential disturbance is 0.5 mile for blasting activities as referenced in the FWS’ 2007 National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines. The closest active nest to the Project is located more than 6,000 feet south of the proposed crossing location outside ofany nestdisturbancebuffer. On October 24, 2014, FERC consulted with the FWS and the FWS concluded that the Project would not result in harm to bald eagles (FWS, 2014). Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSDEC to discuss survey results and state-level concerns for bald eagles, and develop and implement any state4-118 4.7.4 Marine Mammals Marine mammals are federally protected under the MMPA, which prohibits the taking of these species except under certain circumstances (NOAA, 2014a). Common marine mammals, such as harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), are found in the New York Bight. Federally listed species including cetacean species, such as humpback whale (Megaptera noveangliae), have been reported at times in New York Harbor (FWS, 1997) and are theoretically possible within deeper portions of the Hudson River estuary. The Harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is listed as a species of special concern in New York and has historically been an occasional visitor (FWS, 1997) in the Hudson River estuary. Records of any cetaceans in the estuary are rare and generally thought to represent individuals that are unhealthy or lost (FWS, 1997). We have reviewed the information provided by Algonquin, conducted our own research, and consulted with NOAA Fisheries. Through consultation with NOAA Fisheries, we have concluded that the Project would have no effect on marine mammals because they are not anticipated to occur within the Project area of the Hudson River. Additionally, Algonquin would also cross the Hudson River using the HDD method with no associated in-water work proposed. Since no in-water work would occur, the Project would avoid impacts on any rare marine mammals present in the Hudson River during construction. NOAA Fisheries concurred with this determination and consultation regarding marine mammals is complete (NOAA Fisheries, 2014a). 4.7.5 State-listed Species New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts have all passed laws to protect state-listed species. The overall goal of each of the state endangered species laws is to conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any threatened or endangered species and their essential habitat. The state-specific regulations are as follows:  the New York ESA (New York Environmental Conservation Law § 11-0535 and 6 New York Code of Rulesand Regulations [NYCRR] Part 182);  the Connecticut ESA(Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 495);  the Rhode Island ESA (Rhode Island Title 20. Fish and Wildlife. Chapter 37. Endangered Speciesof Animals and Plants); and  the MassachusettsESA (Massachusetts General Law section 131A). To determine if state-listed species or their habitats are known or have the potential to occur within the AIM Project area, Algonquin consulted with the NYNHP, NYSDEC, CTDEEP, Connecticut Natural Diversity Data Base, RIDEM, Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program, MDFW, and MNHESP. Through consultation with the state agencies, 29 state-listed threatened, endangered, or special concern species were identified as potentially occurring in the New York and Connecticut sections of the Project area. Eight species are also afforded federal protection including seven federally listed threatened and endangered species discussed above in section 4.7.1 and the bald eagle discussed above in section 4.7.3. No state-listed species were identified as a concern for the Project in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. A discussion of agency consultation, survey results, and proposed mitigation for the remaining 21 species potentially occurring in the Project area are provided below and summarized in table 4.7.5-1. 4-119 TABLE 4.7.5-1 State-Listed Species Potentially Occurring Within the Vicinity of the AIM Project  Species  State Field Survey Statusa Habitat Project Component Results  Seasonal Timing Restrictions and Proposed Mitigation  New York Least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) Timber rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus) Connecticut American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus) American kestrel (Falco sparverius) Pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps) Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) Red bat (Lasiurus borealis) Eastern cougar (Puma concolor cougar)  T Fresh or brackish emergent None.

Species-specific discussions of potential Project impacts for each state are presented below. 4.7.5.1 New York In addition to the federally listed species discussed in section 4.7.1 and the bald eagle discussed in section 4.7.3, the following is a discussion of state-listed species that may occur near AIM Project facilitiesin New York (NYSDEC, 2013b). LeastBittern The least bittern is a state threatened species that typically inhabits fresh or brackish emergent marsh and/or shallow pond habitats (NYNHP, 2013f). Least bitterns have been documented in Rockland and Westchester Counties. The NYSDEC reviewed the Project and reported that there were no records of least bittern within 0.5 mile of the proposed facilities and, as such, they have no concerns related to this species(NYSDEC, 2013b).  We conclude that the least bittern would not be affected by the Project. Timber Rattlesnake The Timber rattlesnake is a state-listed threatened species that inhabits deciduous forests in rugged terrain. According to the NYSDEC, timber rattlesnakes are known to occur along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment from approximately MPs 0.7 (Franck Road) to 2.9 (Route 202/9W) in the Town of Stony Point (NYSDEC, 2013b). The NYSDEC’s primary concerns are the Franck Road TAR installation (TAR-1.1), possible laydown yards, and the proposed timing of grading activities.  Impacts on the timber rattlesnake could include alteration of forested habitat and direct impacts including mortality if individuals are struck by construction vehicles or if occupied dens are crushed or excavated. The NYSDEC requested Algonquin assess the construction work areas in Rockland County for potential habitat (NYSDEC, 2014c). To identify potential existing habitat in construction work areas in Rockland County, Algonquin conducted timber rattlesnake habitat assessment surveys on May 15, 2014 using a qualified biologist. No suitable open rock habitat was identified along Algonquin’s existing rights-of-way and no natural open and rocky basking or gestating areas were observed in the proposed Project workspace. Therefore, the Project would not impact any existing basking or gestating habitat. However, two sections of Algonquin’s right-of-way parallel electrical transmission line rights-of-way where abundant rock cover and potential basking and gestating habitat were observed. One of these areas is located within 1.5 miles of known timber rattlesnake dens, and rattlesnakes could potentially bask along the northern edge of Algonquin’s existing rights-of-way. Timber rattlesnakes from these areas could also occur within the Project area while transiting or foraging. The NYSDEC provided a list of potential BMPs that may be used to avoid or minimize Project-related impacts on timber rattlesnakes, but noted that not all the methods are appropriate for all projects, and should be considered where appropriate (NYSDEC, 2013b).  These BMPs are listed below. Seasonal Restrictions All allowable disturbance activities, including movement of construction vehicles, excavation, and alteration of vegetation, should be conducted during the period when the snakes would be expected to be hibernating and are less likely to be directly impacted by aboveground disturbances. This acceptable work period is November 1 through March 31. 4-123 Habitat management (including timber harvesting) and trail maintenance activities should also be timed to minimize the potential for injury/death to snakes. Habitats that are actively managed (e.g. mowing and prescribed burning) and trail edges that are cleared using a brush hog may increase mortality as snakes are killed by machinery or incinerated by fire. In addition to the seasonal restrictions applied to all vegetation management practices, disturbance to non-transient habitats should be avoided at all times. Roads, skid trails, and landings should be kept within at least 330 feet from all known or potentially suitable basking and gestating habitats, and to minimize the potential for collapse or disturbance of dens, heavy equipment and site preparation work (e.g., disk-harrowing, shearing, root raking) should be prohibited within 660 feet of any known hibernacula. Timber Rattlesnake Monitor If any Project-related work is to occur (in whole or in part) during April 1 through October 31, the project sponsor should retain the services of a snake monitor. The snake monitor must be a qualified biologist that has knowledge of timber rattlesnake ecology and relocation procedures. The monitor should be on site during all construction activities and would be responsible for: 1) conducting reconnaissance surveys for timber rattlesnakes within the work area prior to the initiation of any disturbance activities, and 2) relocating snakes as required. Temporary Barrier When disturbance is likely to occur from actions occurring outside of the acceptable work period, a temporary restrictive barrier may help to avoid impacts if installed around the perimeter of the disturbance footprint of smallprojects (less than 1 acre).  The barrier should be: 1. installed before the end of the acceptable work period and maintained until the end of the construction phase of the Project or until the beginning of the next acceptable work period, whichever occurs first; 2. inspected daily and, if necessary, repaired immediately to a fully functional condition; and 3. constructed in accordancewith NYSDEC-approved design specifications. The effectiveness of the barrier is diminished and snakes may be able to gain access to the disturbance areaif debris (e.g., treelimbs, soil) is allowed to overtop or pile up alongside the barrier. Education The NYSDEC reports that persecution by humans is a significant source of timber rattlesnake mortality and is thought to be a major contributing factor to the population decline experienced by the species over the past 100 years. Misconceptions about the actual verses perceived threat posed by timber rattlesnakes often leads to the snakes being injured or killed by humans who, when encountering a timber rattlesnake, are fearful of being attacked. Given this, the NYSDEC supports efforts to educate residents located near known den sites to help identify timber rattlesnakes and accurately describe the snakes’ non-aggressive behavior. 4-124 Given the complex construction schedule that includes pipeline outages, Algonquin would not be able to adhere to the NYSDEC’s recommended seasonal restrictions for timber rattlesnakes. Therefore, Algonquin would, at a minimum, implement the following measures to minimize potential impacts on timber rattlesnakes during construction.  Algonquin would conduct preconstruction survey sweeps of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment, with particular emphasis on the pipeline segment from approximately MPs 0.7 to 2.9 using an experienced, New York-licensed rattlesnake monitor.  The monitor would be on site during all construction related activities, would conduct reconnaissance surveys for timber rattlesnakes prior to the initiation of any disturbance activities, and relocate anyrattlesnakesencountered.  Temporary barriers would be used when applicable, likely to isolate equipment storage yards.  Construction staff would be educated about the presence of timber rattlesnakes, and provided with contact numbers to call if a timberrattlesnake is encountered. Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSDEC to discuss the results of the timber rattlesnake habitat assessment survey and determine the appropriate conservation measures to address the potential occurrence of timber rattlesnakes in the Project area and their habitat adjacent to Algonquin’s right-ofway.  Because consultation regarding the timber rattlesnake is not complete, we recommend that:  Prior to construction in New York, Algonquin should file with the Secretary all permit requirements and avoidance or mitigation measures developed for the timber rattlesnakes in consultation with the NYSDEC, and documentation of its correspondencewith the NYSDECregarding the proposed measures. 4.7.5.2 Connecticut In addition to the federally listed species discussed in section 4.7.1, the CTDEEP has identified the potential for the presence of state-listed species near AIM Project facilities (CTDEEP, 2013d). Algonquin is in the process of preparing a conservation plan that discusses each of the species identified by the CTDEEP, addresses potential impacts and, if necessary, avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures. The CTDEEP provided comments to FERC on the draft EIS, which identified their concerns for Connecticut state-listed species. Algonquin has agreed to implement the CTDEEP species-specific recommended measures as outlined in their comments; their commitments to the measures are included in this section. State-listed Wildlife Species in Connecticut American Bittern The American bittern is listed as a state endangered species (CTDEEP, 2013b) and is found in interior freshwater wetlands. The American bittern has been documented in Windham County (CTDEEP, 2013d), which is where Algonquin’s existing Pomfret M&R Station is located. No habitat for American bittern occurs near the M&R station site and none would be affected by the proposed station modifications, which would take place within the existing fence line of the Pomfret M&R Station site. Based on the absence ofsuitable habitat, the Project would not affect this species. 4-125 The American kestrel is listed as a state threatened species (CTDEEP, 2013b), which is found in open grassy or shrubby areas with short vegetation in which to hunt for their prey. In Connecticut, American kestrels are usually observed near open roadsides and agricultural areas, airports, large parks, and power line rights-of-way. American kestrels also occur in urban and suburban areas and will use manmade structures (e.g. buildings, barns, silos, cornices, etc.) for nestsites. American kestrels have been documented in Windham County (CTDEEP, 2013d) where Algonquin’s existing Pomfret M&R Station is located. While potential habitat for the American kestrel occurs near this site, the proposed station modifications would take place within the existing fence line of the Pomfret M&R Station site. Wehave concluded the Project would notsignificantlyaffect this species. Pied-billed Grebe The pied-billed grebe is listed as a state endangered species (CTDEEP, 2013b). Pied-billed grebes breed on freshwater to brackish seasonal and permanent ponds and require dense stands of deep water emergent vegetation (e.g. cattails) for nesting and cover that are situated close to open water for foraging (CTDEEP, 2013i;NYSDEC, 2013g). Pied-billed grebes have been documented in Windham County (CTDEEP, 2013d). Algonquin’s existing Pomfret M&R Station is located within this county; however, habitat for the pied-billed grebe does not occur near this site. The proposed station modifications would take place within the existing fence line of the Pomfret M&R Station site. Based on the absence of suitable habitat, the Project would not affectthe pied-billed grebe. Savannah Sparrow The savannah sparrow is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013b). Savannah sparrows breed in open areas with low vegetation (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2013). Savannah sparrows have been documented in Windham County (CTDEEP, 2013d) where Algonquin’s existing Pomfret M&R Station is located. While potential habitat for the savannah sparrow occurs near this site, the proposed station modifications would take place within the existing fence line of the Pomfret M&R Station site and land disturbance would be minimal. We have concluded the Project would not affect this species. Red Bat The red bat is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013b). Red bats are typically forest dwellers, and generally prefer a deciduous forest biome. During the day it roosts in trees, often roosting in dense foliage or occasionally moss (CTDEEP, 2013j;University of Connecticut, 2013). Red bats have been documented in Windham County (CTDEEP, 2013d) where Algonquin’s existing Pomfret M&R Station is located. While potential habitat for the red bat occurs near this site, the proposed station modifications would take place within the existing fence line of the Pomfret M&R Station site and land disturbance would be minimal. We have concluded the Project would not affect this species. Eastern Cougar The eastern cougar is listed as a state species of special concern and is presumed to be extirpated from Connecticut (CTDEEP, 2013b, 2013d). Eastern cougars utilize a wide range of habitats including tidal marshes, deserts, mountainous terrain, and deciduous, coniferous, and tropical forests (NYSDEC, 2013f). 4-126 Given that eastern cougars are presumed extirpated from the state, the Project would not affect this species. Should an unexpected eastern cougar be observed during construction of the AIM Project facilities in Connecticut, Algonquin would notify the CTDEEP and ensure the animal not be disturbed by construction activity. Eastern Box Turtle The eastern box turtle is listed as a special concern species in Connecticut (CTDEEP, 2013b, 2013e). This terrestrial turtle is found in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, field edges, thickets, marshes, bogs, and stream banks, but typically prefer well-drained forest bottomlands and open deciduous forests. They will use wetland areas at various times during the season. Eastern box turtles overwinter in low-lying wooded wetlands where they burrow into the forestfloorto hibernate. The CTDEEP identified the eastern box turtle as having the potential to occur along the Line-36A Loop Extension, the existing Cromwell Compressor Station, the existing Middletown M&R Station, and the North Haven M&R Station (CTDEEP, 2013d). The site descriptions for each of these facilities are provided below:  The North Haven M&R Station property in North Haven, Connecticut consists of a paved yard and gravel lot surrounded by a chain-link fence. The station is bordered on the northern side by a forested wetland community. The proposed upgrades to the facility and the temporary workspace would all occur within the existing fenced metering station.  The Middletown M&R Station property in Middlesex, Connecticut is maintained as a mowed lawn, with a gravel pad inside a high chain-link fence surrounding the existing facility. The station is bordered on the southern side by a deciduous upland forest community. No wetlands were found within 100 feet of the M&R station property. The proposed upgrades to this facility are to occur within the existing fenced M&R station, with ATWS situated on the surrounding lawn to be used for equipment staging and vehicle parking.  The Line-36A Loop Extension is a 2-mile-long segment of existing pipeline right-of-way that crosses four wetland communities. These wetlands, and their adjacent uplands, have the potential to provide suitable habitat foreastern box turtles.   The existing Cromwell Compressor Station site is located along the eastern end of the Cromwell Line-36A Loop and shares the same upland and wetland communities as the pipeline segment right-of-way.  The CTDEEP recommended that work to be conducted in box turtle habitat occur during the winter dormancy period of October through March, if possible (CTDEEP, 2013d). For the facilities where this timetable could not be met, and work would be conducted when box turtles are active, Algonquin would implement, as applicable, the following conservation measures recommended by the CTDEEP (CTDEEP, 2013d, 2013e):  Silt fencing would be installed around the work area priorto construction.  After silt fencing is installed and prior to construction, a sweep of the work area would be conducted to look forturtles.  Workers would be apprised of the possible presence of turtles, and provided a description of the species.  Any turtles that are discovered would be moved, unharmed, to an area immediately outside ofthe fenced area, and positioned in the same direction that it was walking.  No vehicles or heavy machinery would be parked in any turtle habitat.  Work conducted during early morning and evening hours would occur with special care not to harm basking or foraging individuals.  All silt fencing would be removed after work is completed and soils are stable so that reptile and amphibian movement between uplands and wetlandsis notrestricted. 4-127 Algonquin’s proposed construction schedule for the Line-36A Loop Extension, Cromwell Compressor Station, existing Middletown M&R Station, and North Haven M&R Station all extend through the box turtle’s active period from April to October 2015. As requested by the CTDEEP, Algonquin would implement all of the conservation measures listed above for conducting work during the eastern box turtle’s active season at the aboveground facilities (the Cromwell Compressor Station, existingMiddletown M&RStation, and North Haven M&R Station).  Due to the linear nature of the Line 36-A Loop Extension, and constant advancement of crews down the pipeline right-of-way, turtle exclusion barriers (e.g. silt fencing) are not practical in this application. As requested by the CTDEEP, to minimize possible impacts on box turtles during construction of the Line 36-A Loop Extension, Algonquin would implement all conservation measures listed above, with exception of silt fencing, for conducting work during the eastern box turtle’s active season. Based on implementation of the protective measures for aboveground facilities and the Line 36-A Loop Extension, we have concluded that the Project would not significantly affect the eastern box turtle. Eastern Hognose Snake The eastern hognose snake is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013b). The eastern hognose snake's center of distribution in Connecticut is the extensive glacial sand and gravel deposits that span the central portions of the eastern and western hills (CTDEEP, 2013l). According to the CTDEEP, the eastern hognose snake has the potential to occur along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment in New London County (CTDEEP, 2013d). To minimize possible impacts on eastern hognose snakes along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin would retain the services of a qualified biologist to conduct surveys of the Project area during clearing and grading activities, and conduct periodic inspections of the workarea after the clearing and grading construction phases. Additionally, construction staff working at this facility would be provided with a description and photos of the species, along with contact numbers to call if a hognose snake is encountered. In comments provided by the CTDEEP to FERC on the draft EIS, the CTDEEP only requested education of work crews for the E-1 SystemLateral Take-up and Relay segment to minimize the potential for inadvertent mortalities prior to construction. Based on implementation of these protective measures, we have concluded that the Project would not significantly affect the eastern hognose snake. Ground Beetle The ground beetle (Scaphinotus viduus) is listed as a state species of special concern. It occurs in older growth mature floodplain forests where it is most often found under rocks, logs, leaf piles, and other decaying organic debris. 4-128 According to the CTDEEP, ground beetles have the potential to occur along the Line-36A Loop Extension segment and near the existing Cromwell Compressor Station and existing Middletown M&R Station located in Middlesex County (CTDEEP, 2013d). Because no suitable old growth floodplain forests occur within the Project area, we have concluded that the Project would not affect this species. Pine BarrensTiger Beetle The pine barrens tiger beetle is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013b) that occupies sparsely vegetated blowouts and sand plains of dry-xeric, loose shifting sand. The pine barrens tiger beetle has the potential to occur along the Line-36A Loop Extension in Middlesex County (CTDEEP, 2013d). While no pine barrens or similar habitats occur near this pipeline segment, an old sand quarry is located adjacent to the westernmost 2,500 feet of pipeline corridor. In comments on the draft EIS provided by the CTDEEP, sightings of the pine barren tiger beetle at this location have occurred as recently as 2013. As recommended by the CTDEEP to protect the pine barrens tiger beetle, Algonquin would avoid staging any equipment or materials in the sand quarry. Based on implementation of these protective measures, we have concluded that the Project would not significantly affect the pine barrens tiger beetle. Jefferson Salamander“Complex” Jefferson salamander “complex” is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013b). It occurs west of the Connecticut River where it is localized in the upland areas of Litchfield County and northern Fairfield County.  This salamander is very sensitive to habitat disturbance and fragmentation and is undergoing a range-wide decline. It breeds in vernal pools and requires extensive tracts of forest surrounding these pools to survive. Populations in Fairfield, New Haven, and Hartford Counties have been severely reduced and stressed by habitat fragmentation (CTDEEP, 2013m). Jefferson salamander “complex” has the potential to occur along the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment and near the existing West Danbury M&R Station site in Fairfield County (CTDEEP, 2013d). No impacts on Jefferson salamander “complex” or its habitat are anticipated as a result of the proposed modification work that would take place within the existing fence line of the West Danbury M&R Station site. Algonquin conducted vernal pool surveys in April 2013 and identified one vernal pool along the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment. This feature is on the edge of the temporary workspace and would not be disturbed during construction. As requested by the CTDEEP to prevent intrusion of impacts on potential Jefferson salamander “complex” habitat, Algonquin would install silt fencing and signage along the edge of the temporary workspace adjacent to the vernal pool, and have the area monitored by an on-site EI to prevent intrusion of impacts on the vernal pool. Based on implementation of these protective measures, we have concluded that the Project would not significantly affectJefferson salamander “complex.” State-listed Plant Speciesin Connecticut The CTDEEP identified eight plant species of concern with the potential to occur within the area of impact of four separate proposed Project facilities (CTDEEP, 2013d). These four facilities and the potential rare plant species can be grouped into three distinct areas: the Cromwell facilities (consisting of the Cromwell Compressor Station and associated Line-36A Loop Extension), the Southeast to MLV-19 Take-up and Relay, and the E-1 System lateral Take-up and Relay. Six state-listed species could potentially be found within the area that would be impacted by the Cromwell facilities: climbing fern, Collin’s sedge, field paspalum, twinflower, three-leaved false Solomon’s seal, and yellow-fringed orchid (CTDEEP, 2013d). All six of these species display readily identifiable flowers or fruiting bodies during the month of July. In order to determine whether any of these six species are present in the Project area, Algonquin conducted botanical surveys of the Cromwell 4-129 Algonquin submitted the results of the botanical surveys to the CTDEEP on August 9, 2014. As described in the CTDEEP’s comments on the draft EIS, the only state-listed plant identified during these surveys was the climbing fern, which was located at a site immediately east of the Cromwell Compressor Station and just outside of the construction area. To avoid affecting this state-listed plant, Algonquin would install protective fencing and signage at the climbing fern locationand ensure diligence by an EIto repair or replace the fencing and signage should they be damaged. These mitigation measures have been approved by the CTDEEP. In addition to the climbing fern, the CTDEEP indicated in their comments on the draft EIS that the field paspalum has been identified in the immediate area of the climbing fern locations identified by Algonquin, with reports as recent as 2001. The CTDEEP explained that the plant is found coincident with or immediately east of the climbing fern population location, south of the pipeline right-of-way. As requested by the CTDEEP, to prevent possible incursion into the field paspalum area, Algonquin would also install protective fencing and signage along the south side of the right-of-way and extend it 200 feet further east from the climbing fern occurrence. Species-specific information regarding each of the eight state-listed plant species is listed below. Climbing Fern Climbing fern is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013b). It is an evergreen, ivy-like plant that sprawls over the ground or climbs clockwise short distances up shrubs and low herbs. Climbing fern grows in moist pine-oak-maple woodlands with an open understory, in moist thickets, and along stream margins. Regenerating woodlands and right-of-way corridors also provide habitat for this species(MDFW, 2013a). Collins’ Sedge Collins’ Sedge is listed as a state species of special concern and is presumed to be extirpated (CTDEEP, 2013b). It is a perennial grass-like plant that is most recognizable when fruiting in summer (PNHP, 2013b). The species grows in sphagnum moss in acidic swamps and wet woods, often where conifers are aprominent part of the canopy (PNHP, 2013b). Field Paspalum Field Paspalum is listed as a state endangered species (CTDEEP, 2013b; NYNHP, 2013c). It is a perennial grass growing from short rhizomes. Fruit is present from Late July through September (NYNHP,2013g). Field Paspalumis foundindamp meadows, fields, mowed roadsides,mowed grounds, and lawns (NYNHP, 2013g). Hard-stemmed Bulrush Hard-stemmed bulrush is listed as a state threatened species (CTDEEP, 2013b). It is an erect grass-like perennial that grows from a spreading rhizome: the firm, rounded stems can reach a height of 10 feet or more within a single growing season. The flower can be found in spikelets that are held in small, branched clusters and fruiting from June to August. Hard-stemmed bulrush grows in wetlands and in the shallow water along the edges of lakesor ponds (PNHP, 2013a). 4-130 Three-leaved false Solomon’s seal is a state listed threatened species (CTDEEP, 2013b). It is an herbaceous plant, with alternate, oblong-lanceolate leaves and flowers that display six white petals (USDA, 2013a). The flower cluster is a terminal panicle of 20 to 80 small white flowers which appear in July through August, and then develop into red or white berries dotted with purple (Washington State University, 2014). It is found in cool bogs and wetlands with peat soils. Threadfoot Threadfoot is listed as a state species of special concern (CTDEEP, 2013f). It is an olive-green, aquatic plant of firm texture that grows in streams and rivers while attached to rocks. It resembles seaweed, alga, or moss and attaches to rocks by fleshydisks. The stems are often branchedand the leaves are very narrow and divided into numerous linear lobes. The flowers are small, not showy, and scattered along the stems. Flowers and/or fruits are present from mid-June through early October. Threadfoot grows submerged, to seasonally exposed, on cobbles and bedrock substrate in fast flowing, relatively large streams or rivers. Since this species often grows submerged in rapids and fast moving water it can be difficult to spot. Therefore, the best time to survey for this species is between mid-June and early October and when water levels are low(NYNHP 2013f). Twinflower Twinflower is listed as a state endangered species (CTDEEP, 2013b). Twinflower is a small, herbaceous species with basal leaves characterized by a pair of small pink nodding flowers at the top of a slender, hairy stem. The pink to white bell-like flowers are nodding and are born in pairs on short, thin Y-shaped stalks, seldom exceeding six inches in height, hence the common name “twinflower.” Throughout its range twinflower is commonly found under moderate deciduous canopy in either moist soil or average moisture conditions (USFS, 2014). In Connecticut, it inhabits cool wetlands and swamps (USDA, 2013b). Yellow Fringed Orchid Yellow fringed orchid is listed as a state threatened species (CTDEEP, 2013b). It is a relatively stout, robust orchid with leafy shoots and basal leaves that terminate with a long, pointed tip. The stem is terminated by a densely flowered raceme of strikingly orange to yellow-orange flowers, each flower with an unlobed, prominently fringed lower lip. Yellow fringed orchid blooms primarily from late July through August (Washington State University, 2014, Michigan Natural Features Inventory 2009). It inhabits open mats of sphagnum bogs where its associates include pitcher plant, beak rush, cranberry, sedges, larch and other plants of acid peat bogs. This orchid also occurs in damp sandy meadows or in acid soils adjacent to marshes (Michigan Natural Features Inventory, 2009). Summary and Conclusionfor State-listed Speciesin Connecticut Based on the information provided by Algonquin and comments provided to FERC from the CTDEEP on the draft EIS, we conclude that the Project would not affect Connecticut state-listed plants because Algonquin would implement protective measures for species identified near the Project area, including the climbing fern and field paspalum. Based on the same information sources and Algonquin’s proposed conservation measures for several Connecticut state-listed animals, as presented in table 4.7.5-1, we have concluded that the Project would not affect the American bittern, pied-billed grebe, savannah sparrow, red bat, eastern cougar, and ground beetle; and would not have a significant effect on the American kestrel, eastern box turtle, eastern hognose snake, Jefferson salamander “complex,” and pine barrenstiger beetle.   4-131 4.7.5.3 Rhode Island Algonquin consulted with the RIDEM/ Rhode Island Natural Heritage Program to determine if any state-listed species are known to occur near Algonquin’s Burrillville Compressor Station site (Jordan, 2013). No known records of occurrence of state-protected species were identified. Therefore, the Project would not affect state-listed speciesor habitats in Rhode Island.  4.7.5.4 Massachusetts Algonquin consulted with the MDFW/MNHESP to determine if any state-listed species are known to occur along Algonquin’s proposed West Roxbury Lateral or its existing and proposed M&R stations in Middlesex, Norfolk, Bristol, Plymouth and Suffolk Counties (MDFW, 2013b; French, 2013). No known occurrences of state-listed species were reported by MDFW and MNHESP for the Project areas in Massachusetts. Therefore, the Project would not affect state-listed species or habitats in Massachusetts. 4.8 LAND USE, RECREATION, SPECIAL INTEREST AREAS, AND VISUAL RESOURCES 4.8.1 Land Use The AIM Project would consist of 37.4 miles of replacement, loop extension, and new natural gas pipeline that would cross three counties in the State of New York, four counties in the State of Connecticut, and two counties in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and new aboveground facilities and modifications to existing aboveground facilities in three counties in New York, six counties in Connecticut, one county in the State of Rhode Island, and five counties in Massachusetts. Of the 37.4 miles of pipeline, 20.1 miles would replace existing 26-inch-diameter mainline pipeline with 42inch-diameter pipeline, 2.0 miles would extend an existing loop pipeline with 36-inch-diameter pipeline, 9.1 miles would replace existing 6-inch-diameter pipeline with 16-inch-diameter pipeline, 1.3 miles of new 12-inch-diameter pipeline would loop an existing pipeline, and 4.9 miles would consist of installation of new 16-inch and 24-inch-diameter lateral pipelines (see table 2.1.1-1). In addition to the installation of replacement, loop extension, or new pipeline, about 0.9 mile of Algonquin’s existing 26inch-diameter Southwest to MLV 19 pipeline would be abandoned in place. The proposed Project would also include modifications to 6 existing compressor stations, modifications to 24 existing M&R stations, construction of 3 new M&R stations, removal of one existing M&R station, construction of pig launcher and receiver facilities, construction of 1 new MLV, and modifications to 5 existing MLVs sites (see table 2.1.2-1).  4.8.1.1 Environmental Setting Six general land use types would be affected by the AIM Project, which include open land, agricultural, forest/woodland, industrial/commercial, residential, and open water. Table 4.8.1-1 summarizes the acreage of each land use type that would be affected by construction and operation of the Project. The definitions ofeach land usetype are as follows:  Open land – includes Algonquin’s existing pipeline right-of-way, other utility rights-ofway, open fields, vacant land, herbaceous and scrub-shrub uplands, non-forested lands, emergent wetland, scrub-shrub wetland, golfcourses, and municipal land;  Agricultural – includes active hayfields and cultivated lands;  Forest/woodland – includes mixed oak forest and forested wetlands; 4-132   Industrial/commercial – includes manufacturing or industrial plants, paved areas, landfills, mines, quarries, electric power or natural gas utility facilities, developed areas, roads, railroads and railroad yards, and commercial or retail facilities;    Residential – includes existing developed residential areas and planned residential developments. This may include large developments, low, medium, and high density residential neighborhoods; urban/suburban residential; multi-family residences; residentially zoned areas  that have been developed; or short segments of the route at road crossings with homes near the route alignment; and    Open water – includes all waterbody crossings, unless the waterbody is not visible on aerial photography (in which case it is incorporated into the surrounding land use).  Construction of the Project would impact a total of about 575.6 acres. About 78 percent of this acreage would be utilized for the pipeline facilities, including the construction right-of-way and ATWS. The remaining acreage impacted during construction would be associated with aboveground facilities (16 percent), pipe and contractor ware yards (5 percent), and access roads (less than 1 percent). The primary land use types impacted during construction would be forest/woodland (33 percent), open land (28 percent), industrial/commercial land (26 percent), and residential land (9 percent). Agricultural land and open water would make up the remaining 4 percent of land types impacted during construction of the proposed Project. Following construction, about 42.4 acres of new land outside of Algonquin’s existing permanent right-of-way would be permanently encumbered by operation of the Project. About 80 percent of this acreage would be for the new pipeline right-of-way, 16 percent for aboveground facilities, and 4 percent for new permanent access roads. The primary land use types that would be permanently encumbered would be forest/woodland (64 percent), open land (18 percent), industrial/commercial land (7 percent), and agriculturalland (7 percent).  Open water and residential land would make up the remaining 4 percent of permanent impacts. Forest/woodland affected bythe Project would consist mainlyof mixed oak forest and consists of both wetland and upland areas. Algonquin would minimize forest land impacts by locating Project facilities and work areas within existing rights-of-way and on open land wherever possible. Following construction activities, forest/woodland cleared outside of the permanent right-of-way would be allowed to regenerate to preconstruction conditions, but impacts on forest resources within these areas would last for several years. Forest/woodland falling within the new maintained permanent right-of-way would be permanently converted to a non-forested condition. Open land could be temporarily impacted during Project construction by removal of vegetation and disturbance of soils. Impacts on open land would be temporary and short term, and would be minimized by the implementation of the E&SCP and by restoring open land areas to preconstruction conditions. Since the permanent pipeline right-of-way would be maintained as open land, there would be no permanent change in land use where the right-of-way crosses existing open land areas. Following construction, these areas would continue to function as open land. However, some activities, such as the building of new commercial or residential structures, would be prohibited on the new permanent right-ofway.   4-133 TABLE 4.8.1-1 a Land Use Types and Acres Impacted by Construction and Operation of the AIM Project Industrial/ Open Land Agricultural Forest/Woodland Commercial Residential  Open Water  Total  Facility  Total New Total New Total New Total New Total New County, State Const.

Impacts on industrial and commercial properties would be restored to preconstruction conditions or as specified in specific landowner agreements. All road surfaces would be quickly reestablished so that normal access to area businesses can resume. Most often, access would be reestablished by the contractor’s filling in the trench and leaving either a dirt surface or a rough coat of pavement to restore access. So that construction equipment would not tear up the road surface when traveling across it during construction, a separate contractor would usually return later to complete final paving, at which time the road surface is considered permanently restored to pre-existing conditions. Crossing of private driveways would be coordinated with business owners so as to maintain vehicle access and minimize impacts. Steel plates and/or wood mats would be kept on-site at all times so that a temporary platform can be made across the trench should the need arise.  Additional discussion oftraffic-related impacts is provided in section 4.9.5. Agricultural land uses could be temporarily impacted during Project construction by removal of vegetation, disturbance of soils, and increased dust from exposed soils. Agricultural land in the Project area consists of feed and hay corn not considered specialty crops. Following construction, all impacted agricultural land would be restored to preconstruction conditions to the extent possible, in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP, and with any specific requirements identified by landowners or state or federal agencies with appropriate jurisdiction. Algonquin would acquire 2.9 acres of agricultural land as new permanent right-of-way, but operation of the proposed pipeline would not affect the continuing use of these areas for agriculturalactivities after construction is complete. Effects of construction on agricultural land would be minor and short term. Algonquin would maintain landowner access to fields, storage areas, structures, and other agricultural facilities during construction and would maintain irrigation and drainage systems that cross the right-of-way to the extent practicable. Landowners would be compensated for crop losses and other damages caused by construction activities. Algonquin’s landowner-compensation program would address temporary loss of productivity in affected areas after construction. 4.8.1.2 Pipeline Facilities The proposed replacement, loop, and lateral pipeline would consist of 37.4 miles of multi-diameter pipe. Of this amount, about 26.3 miles (70 percent) would consist of replacement of existing pipeline and about 11.1 miles (30 percent) would consist of new pipeline loops and one newlateral. The predominant land use that would be crossed by the pipelines is open land (55 percent) followed by forest/woodland (14 percent), residential (14 percent), industrial/commercial (9 percent), agricultural (6 percent), and open water (2 percent). Of the 37.4 miles of proposed pipeline, about 93 percent would be within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way, consisting of pipeline rights-of-way currently occupied by Algonquin, public roadways, railways, and/or other utility rights-of-way. Land use-related impacts associated with the Project would include the disturbance of existing uses within the right-of-way during construction and retention of an expanded or new permanent right-of-way for operation of the pipeline. The replacement portions of the Project pipeline facilities would cross 29.2 miles of land, consisting of 65 percent open land, 13 percent forest/woodland, 11 percent residential, 5 percent agricultural, 3 percent industrial/commercial, and 3 percent open water. The loop extension portions of the Project pipeline facilities would cross 3.3 miles of land, consisting of 40 percent open land, 33 percent forest/woodland, 21 percent agricultural, and 6 percent residential. The new pipeline portion of the Project pipeline facilities would cross 4.9 miles of land, consisting of 49 percent industrial/commercial, 39 percent residential, 6 percent open land, and 6 percent forest/woodland. 4-138 For the replacement portions of the Project, Algonquin would generally use a 100-foot-wide construction right-of-way. This 100-foot right-of-way width would not include special crossing areas such as wetlands and waterbodies, residential areas, and agricultural areas where other construction rightof-way widths are proposed.  The construction right-of-way would include the use of the existing 75-footwide permanent right-of-way to the extent practicable, as well as additional workspace. There are three exceptions to this proposed right-of-way use:  For the portion of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment crossing the Blue Mountain Reservation in the Town of Cortlandt, New York, Algonquin would utilize an existing 75-foot-wide maintenance easement and 25 feet of additional temporary right-of-way, and the replacement pipeline would be installed and operated within an existing 6-foot-wide permanenteasement.  For the portion of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment associated with the HDD crossing of the Hudson River, Algonquin would utilize a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way and a 50-foot-wide permanent right-of-way where the route deviates from the existing right-of-way on land. Within the Hudson River itself, there would be no construction right-of-way with the use of HDD, but a new nominal 10-footwide permanent right-of-way would be established across the river.  For the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin would use a 75-footwide construction right-of-way (including the existing 50-foot-wide permanent easement to the extent practicable), and would obtain an additional 10 feet of new permanent rightof-way along some portions. For the Line-36A Loop Extension portion of the Project, Algonquin would use an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way (including the use of the existing 75-foot-wide permanent right-of-way to the extent practicable, and an additional 10 to 35 feet of temporary workspace). Algonquin also would obtain an additional 20 to 30 feet of new permanent right-of-way. For the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension portion of the Project, Algonquin would use a 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way (including the use of the existing 30-foot-wide permanent right-of-way, an additional 25 feet of temporary workspace, and an additional 20 feet of new permanentright-of-way). For the new pipeline portion of the Project, the construction right-of-way would vary between 15 feet and 75 feet in width, depending on location. The permanent right-of-way would be 50 feet wide, where available. In addition to the construction right-of-way, various ATWSs would be used for construction. As discussed in section 2.2.1.5, Algonquin identified several areas where it believes site-specific conditions require the use of ATWS outside the proposed construction right-of-way. Table C-1 in appendix C lists the locations of these ATWSs and their dimensions. Table C-1 also lists the acreage of impact and the justifications for the use ofadditional workspace. In addition to the installation of replacement, loop extension, or new pipeline described above, about 0.9 mile of Algonquin’s existing 26-inch-diameter Southwest to MLV 19 pipeline would be abandoned in place along the Interstate 84/Still River HDD segment. This activity would not impact any additional land. 4.8.1.3 AbovegroundFacilities Construction at the 28 M&R stations, 6 compressor stations, and various MLV and launcher/receiver sites in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts would disturb a total 4-139 of about 94.9 acres of land. Of this total, about 6.6 acres would be permanently retained for operation of the aboveground facilities. Table 4.8.1-1 above summarizes the land requirements and land use for the aboveground facilities associated with the Project. The primary land uses that would be affected by these facilities are industrial/commercial (65 percent) and forest/woodland (30 percent). Open land would make up the remaining 5 percent. Compressor Station Modifications Algonquin proposes to modify six existing compressor stations to add 81,620 hp to its pipeline system as part of the Project. The compressor station modifications would impact a total of about 79.5 acres of land during construction. Of the 79.5 acres, about 3.5 acres (4 percent) would consist of new land that would be permanently affected by operation of the modified compressor stations within the existing station property owned by Algonquin. AIM Project modifications at the Stony Point Compressor Station in Rockland County, New York would impact a total of about 20.3 acres of land, consisting of 58 percent industrial/commercial land, 37 percent forest/woodland, and 5 percent open land. Of the 20.3 acres, about 1.6 acres of new land would be permanently affected by operation of the modified facility (56 percent forest/woodland and 44 percent industrial land). Outside the permanently affected area, construction impacts would be temporary and short term, except on forested land where impacts would be long term. The area surrounding the station property is predominantly forested, with some residentialland nearby. Modifications at the Southeast Compressor Station in Putnam County, New York would impact a total of about 15.9 acres of land, consisting of 67 percent industrial/commercial land, 32 percent forest/woodland, and 1 percent open land. No new land would be permanently impacted by operation of the modified compressor station. Construction impacts would be temporary and short term, except on forested land where impacts would be long term. The area surrounding the station property is predominantly forested. At the Oxford Compressor Station in New Haven County, Connecticut modifications would be conducted entirely inside the existing compressor building. Therefore, construction and operation of the Project would not impact any land. AIM Project modifications at the Cromwell Compressor Station in Middlesex County, Connecticut would impact a total of about 14.9 acres of land, consisting of 77 percent industrial/commercial land, 22 percent forest/woodland, and 1 percent open land.  Of the 14.9 acres, about 1.9 acres of new land would be permanently affected by operation of the modified compressor station (89 percent forest/woodland and 11 percent industrial/commercial land). Outside the permanently affected area, construction impacts would be temporary and short term, with the exception of forested land where impacts would be long term. The area surrounding the station property is predominantly forested, with some industrial/commercialand agricultural land nearby. Modifications at the Chaplin Compressor Station in Windham County, Connecticut would impact a total of about 11.7 acres of land, consisting of 61 percent industrial/commercial land, 25 percent forest/woodland, and 14 percentopen land. No new land would be permanentlyimpacted byoperation of the modified compressor station. Construction impacts would be temporary and short term, except on forested land where impacts would be long term. The area surrounding the station property is predominantly forested. At the Burrillville Compressor Station in Providence County, Rhode Island modifications would impact a total of about 16.7 acres of land, consisting of 64 percent industrial/commercial land, 35 percent forest/woodland, and 1 percent open land. No new land would be permanently impacted by operation of 4-140 the modified compressor station. Construction impacts would be temporary and short term, except on forested land where impacts would be long term. The area surrounding the station property is predominantly forested, with some residentialland nearby. New andModified M&RStations Algonquin proposes to modify 24 existing M&R stations in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts to accept the new gas flows associated with the AIM Project. Modifications at 21 of the 24 existing stations are minor in nature and would take place within the existing fenced facilities. The remaining three M&R stations (Guilford, Glastonbury, and Willimantic M&R Stations) would require complete reconstruction because the existing station piping and metering equipment, and in the case of the Willimantic M&R Station, the existing station site, are significantly undersized to accommodate the increase in the projected flow rate. The M&R station modifications would temporarily impact a total of about 11.2 acres of land. Of the 11.2 acres, about 0.5 acre (4 percent) would consist of new land that would be permanently affected by operation of the modified Willimantic M&R Station. None of the other 23 modified M&R stations would permanently impact new land during operation. Algonquin proposes to construct three new M&R stations to accept the new gas flows associated with the AIM Project. Construction of the three new M&R stations would temporarily impact a total of about 3.9 acres of land. Of the 3.9 acres, about 2.6 acres (67 percent) would consist of new land that would be permanently affected by operation ofthe new M&R stations.  Algonquin also proposes to decommission and remove one M&R station in New London County, Connecticut. The Greenville M&R Station would be removed and replaced by the new Oakland Heights M&R Station once that station has been constructed and is in service. Removal of the Greenville M&R Station would temporarily impact about 0.3 acre of land, and would not permanently impact any new land. Land impacts for M&R station construction activities are summarized below by state. See table 4.8.1-1 for impacts at individualstations.  In New York, there would be no additional impacts from M&R station activities. The temporary workspaces at M&R stations in New York would fall entirely within the workspacefor pipeline facilities, and there would be no new permanent land impacts.  In Connecticut, M&R station activities would temporarily impact about 8.5 acres of land, consisting of 47 percent industrial/commercial, 39 percent forest/woodland, and 14 percent open land. Of the 8.5 acres, 1.9 acres (22 percent) would be permanently impacted by operation of the Willimantic M&R Station and the new Oakland Heights M&R Station. Outside the permanently affected area, construction impacts would be temporary and short term, except on forested land where impacts would be long term.  In Massachusetts, M&R station activities would temporarily impact about 6.9 acres of land, consisting of 84 percent industrial/commercial, 10 percent forest/woodland, and 6 percent open land. Of the 6.9 acres, 1.2 acres (17 percent) would be permanently impacted by operation of the new Assonet and West Roxbury M&R Stations. Outside the permanently affected area, construction impacts would be temporary and short term, except on forested land where impacts would be long term. 4-141 As part of the AIM Project, Algonquin would also modify three existing MLV sites and five existing launcher/receiver sites, construct five new launcher/receiver sites, construct new cross over piping at two locations, and construct one new MLV (see table 2.1.2-1 ). Modification and construction activities for these facilities would take place within the Algonquin’s proposed permanent right-of-way and construction work areas for pipeline facilities; therefore, these additional aboveground facilities would not impact any additional land. 4.8.1.4 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards Algonquin proposes to use three pipe and contractor ware yards during construction of the AIM Project facilities. Of the three yards, one would be located in New York and two would be located in Connecticut. We received numerous comments about a contractor yard on parkland in the Town of Yorktown, New York. Algonquin is no longer proposing to use a contractor ware yard in the Town of Yorktown. These yards would impact about 28.6 acres of land, consisting of 100 percent industrial/commercial land (see table 4.8.1-1). These impacts would be temporary and the pipe and contractor ware yards would not permanently affect any new land. 4.8.1.5 Access Roads In addition to the existing access available by the use of public roads, Algonquin has identified a total of 36 access roads for use on the AIM Project (16 in New York, 16 in Connecticut, and 4 in Massachusetts). These 36 access roads would include 28 TARs and 8 PARs. With one exception, the access roads are comprised of existing gravel roads, unimproved dirt roads, paved and gravel driveways, private industrial and commercial roads, paved parking lots, and golf course roads. The exception is a new PAR to be constructed forthe Assonet M&R Station.  The one new PAR to be constructed for the new Assonet M&R Station would run from the existing North Fall River M&R Station to the Assonet M&R Station. This new PAR would disturb less than 0.1 acre (0.03 acre) of land. The area impacted by this new PAR would fall entirely within the new permanent pipeline right-of-way; therefore, it is not included in the 1.9-acre total of impacts associated with accessroads. For all other temporary and permanent access, Algonquin would use existing roads. However, of these existing roads, six TARs and one PAR would require minor upgrades and/or widening (by about 10 feet) for use during pipeline construction. These upgrades would result in about 1.9 acres of new permanent land disturbance, consisting of 53 percent forest/woodland and 47 percent open land (see table 4.8.1-1). See table 2.2.4-1 for the locations, lengths, and acres of impact for all individual TARs and PARs associated with the AIM Project. 4.8.2 Land Ownership and Easement Requirements Pipeline operators must obtain easements from existing landowners to construct and operate proposed facilities, or acquire the land on which the facilities would be located. Easements can be temporary, granting the operator the use of the land during Project construction (e.g., ATWSs, temporary access roads, contractor ware yards), or permanent, grantingthe operator the right to operate and maintain the facilities once constructed. 4-142 Algonquin’s existing permanent easements give it the right to maintain the existing right-of-way as necessary for pipeline operation. Where the proposed pipeline construction activities occur within Algonquin’s existing rights-of-way, it would not need to acquire new easements or property to operate the proposed facilities. However, Algonquin would need to acquire new easements or acquire the necessary land to construct and operate the new pipeline where any of the proposed activities deviate from the existing right-of-way. These new easements would convey both temporary (for construction) and permanentrights-of-way to Algonquin. In addition to the right to use specific property for construction, operation, maintenance, pipeline repair and replacement, and related activities as referenced above, an easement agreement between a company and a landowner typically specifies compensation for losses resulting from construction. This includes losses of non-renewable and other resources, damages to property during construction, and restrictions on existing uses that would not be permitted on the permanent right-of-way after construction. Compensation would be based on a market study conductedby a licensed real estate appraiser. If an easement cannot be negotiated with a landowner and the Project is approved by the Commission, Algonquin may use the right of eminent domain to acquire the property necessary to construct the Project. This right would extend to all Project-related workspace covered by the Commission’s approval, including the temporary and permanent rights-of-way, aboveground facility sites, pipe and contractor ware yards, access roads, and ATWSs. Algonquin would still be required to compensate the landowner for the right-of-way and damages incurred during construction. However, the level of compensation would be determined by a courtaccording to state orfederal law. Algonquin plans to retain its easement and maintain the rights-of-way following the installation of the pipeline facilities except as otherwise provided in the existing easements or modified as part of the negotiations with the landowner. 4.8.3 Existing Residences, Commercial and IndustrialFacilities, and Planned Developments 4.8.3.1 Existing Residences andCommercialand IndustrialFacilities Table H-1 in appendix H lists residences and other structures located within 50 feet of the construction work areas associated with the AIM Project (i.e., construction right-of-way, ATWS, and pipe and contractor ware yards) by milepost, and indicates the type of structure and its distance from the proposed Project work areas. Based on field surveys and aerial photography, Algonquin’s proposed construction work areas would be located within 50 feet of 332 residential structures (i.e., houses and apartment buildings) and 94 non-residential structures (i.e., commercial or industrial facilities, sheds, garages).  The residential structures within 50 feet of the construction work areas would experience effects of Project construction and operation. In general, as distance from the construction work area increases, the impacts on residences decrease. In residential areas, the two most significant impacts associated with construction and operation of a pipeline are temporary disturbances during construction and the encumbrance of a permanent right-of-way, which would restrict the construction of new permanent structures within the right-of-way. Temporary impacts during construction of the pipeline facilities in residential areas could include: inconvenience caused by noise and dust generated by construction traffic; disruption to access of homes by trenching of roads or driveways; increased localized traffic from transporting workers, equipment, and materials to the work site; disturbance of lawns, landscaping, and visual character caused by the removal of turf, shrubs, trees, and/or other landscaping between residences and adjacent rights-of-way; and potential damage to existing septic systems or wells.  4-143 Special construction and restoration methods would be used at site-specific locations to minimize residential neighborhood disruptions and to reduce impacts during construction. In particular, crossing of any private driveways would be managed in such a way as to ensure that access to residential homes and businesses is maintained at all times. During negotiations with landowners, pipeline crossing locations can be established for residents to drive across the right-of-way to access other parts of their property if desired. Disruption to residential utilities would be minimized by using the local “One Call” system to locate utilities, and by hand digging. In the event of a disruption of service, immediate steps would be taken to restore service such as calling the service provider and keeping repair clamps on site in case a residential water or sewer system is encountered.  Algonquin would implement the following general measures to minimize construction-related impacts on residential areas:  install safety fence at the edge of the construction right-of-way for a distance of 100 feet on either side of a residence within 50 feet ofthe construction right-of-way;  attempt to preserve mature trees, vegetative screens, and landscaping within the construction work areato the extent possible;  backfill the trench as soon as the pipe is laid or place temporary steel plates or timber mats over the trench; and  complete final cleanup (including final grading) and installation of permanent erosion control measures within 10 days after the trench is backfilled. For the residences within 50 feet of the construction workspace, Algonquin has developed Residential Construction Plans to inform affected landowners of proposed measures to minimize disruption and to maintain access to the residences (see appendix H). The plans include a dimensioned drawing depicting the residence relative to the pipeline construction; workspace boundaries; the proposed right-of-way; and nearby residences, structures, roads, and miscellaneous features (e.g., other utilities, playgrounds, etc.). Notes that describe the general measures that would be implemented at residential properties (e.g., landowner notification prior to construction, installation of safety fencing), potential construction techniques to be used, workspace restrictions, anticipated construction schedule, and safety considerations are also included. Algonquin provided its Residential Construction Plans to property owners for review and comment in March 2014. Algonquin has received feedback from landowners on several ofthe plans.  Based on our review of those plans, in the draft EIS we requested that Algonquin address the possibility of reducing its construction work area to maintain at least a 10-foot separation from all residences in New York and Connecticut, unless a site-specific justification for being within 10 feet was provided. Algonquin filed revised Residential Construction Plans on September 29, 2014, incorporating additional site-specific details and revising the proposed workspaces to ensure that construction work areas are greater than 10 feet from residences in New York and Connecticut, where possible. However, there remain some residences that are less than 10 feet from construction work areas. One residence located at about MP 1.0 of the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay would be about 9 feet from a proposed work area; this work area cannot be further reduced because it is necessary to facilitate the crossing of a wetland. There is also a residence located within the proposed work area at about MP 10.7 of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay; this residence has been purchased by Algonquin and would be removed. With these two exceptions, all residences within 10 feet of the proposed construction area in New York and Connecticut are also located within 10 feet of Algonquin’s existing permanent easement. Because they are within 10 feet of the existing permanent easement, these residences may already experience maintenance activities within 10 feet, and further reduction in construction workspace 4-144 Many of the residences identified within 50 feet of the construction work area (including those within 10 feet) are located along the West Roxbury Lateral.  We recognize that all activities within 50 feet of residences along the West Roxbury Lateral would be associated with in-street construction; therefore, no residential land would be affected. However, Algonquin developed and provided the Residential Construction Plansto property owners with residences within 50 feet in this area to inform them about the proximity of the work to their houses and measures that would be taken to minimize impacts (e.g., installation of safety fencing).   We have reviewed Algonquin's revised Residential Construction Plans and find them acceptable overall. However, to ensure that the Residential Construction Plans address landowner comments received by Algonquin and allow property owners adequate opportunity for input regarding construction activity so close to theirresidence, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the AIM Project, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of the OEP, a revised set of Residential Construction Plans that incorporate and address the comments Algonquin received from affected landowners. Following construction, all residential areas would be restored to preconstruction conditions or as specified in written landowner agreements. Landowners would continue to have use of the right-of-way provided it does not interfere with the easement rights granted to Algonquin for construction and operation of the pipeline facilities. For example, no structures would be allowed on the permanent rightof-way, including houses, decks, playgrounds, tool sheds, garages, poles, guy wires, catch basins, swimming pools, trailers, leach fields, septic tanks, or other structures not easily removed.  Algonquin has also developed and provided an Environmental Complaint Resolution Procedure Plan as part of its application. It identifies procedures that Algonquin would take to address landowner calls received during construction and how the procedures would be implemented. Algonquin would provide this procedure to landowners via letter prior to construction. The letter would include a toll free telephone number to contact with questions or concerns and the commitment that a response to the question or concern would be provided no later than 48 hours after receiving the initial call. In the event the response is not satisfactory, the proposed letter would identify the FERC’s Dispute Resolution Service Helpline contact information.  We have reviewed the plan and find itacceptable. We conclude that implementation of Algonquin’s construction methods for working in proximity to residences and other structures and site-specific Residential Construction Plans would minimize disruption to residential and commercial areas to the extent practicable and facilitate restoration of these areas as soon as possible upon completion of construction, Further, Algonquin’s Environmental Complaint Resolution Procedure Plan would promote resolution of landowner issues. We received a comment from the Town of Cortlandt expressing concern that the proposed Project would undermine the residential land use policies of the Town’s Comprehensive Master Plan. The Comprehensive Master Plan is a document containing recommended policies to “help the Town direct and manage the decision-making process for years to come” (Town of Cortlandt, 2004). In particular, the comment noted that the Comprehensive Master Plan states a policy of “preserv[ing] and reinforc[ing] the Town’s basic residential character.” This policy is specifically related to residential density planning. The policy seeks to preserve the town’s residential character by ensuring that “higher residential densities will remain focused in already built-up areas and in hamlet centers,” and recommends that the Town 4-145 evaluate some areas for future upzoning to reduce residential densities. The proposed pipeline would not impact the Town’s ability to focus higher residential densities in already-developed areas; therefore, it would not conflict with the Comprehensive Master Plan’s recommended policy. The comment also notes that the Comprehensive Master Plan recommends adopting an Open Space Plan that emphasizes a “natural buffer between and within residential neighborhoods to protect and enhance quality of life and neighborhood character.” Although new permanent right-of-way would be required in the Town of Cortlandt, an existing wooded buffer would be maintained between existing residential areas and the new permanent easement; therefore, the Project would not impact the natural buffer between and within existing residential neighborhoods in Cortlandt. 4.8.3.2 Planned Developments Algonquin contacted landowners and local officials in the municipalities that would be affected by the AIM Project to identify planned residential, commercial, or industrial developments within 0.25 mile of the proposed facilities. Planned developments identified within 0.25 mile of the AIM Project are described and listed in table 4.8.3-1. A discussion of cumulative impacts associated with the proposed Project and these developments is provided in section 4.13. Several of the planned developments, although located within 0.25 mile of the AIM Project, would not be crossed by any Project facilities (see table 4.8.3-1). Planned construction dates are not currently available for any of these developments. Since the AIM Project would not cross any of these developments, Project activities would not cause any direct conflicts or preclude the development of these projects.  If a planned development’s construction period overlaps with AIM Project construction, indirect impacts such as noise from construction activities, dust resulting from soil work, and traffic congestion would occur on a temporary basis. In the event of overlapping construction periods, Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the developer and permitting authorities to identify any potential conflicts associated with construction of the Project. Planned developments that would be crossed by the Project and may experienceimpacts are discussed in more detailbelow.  Carlton Park, Jessup Valley, Jessup Valley North, and Stony Ridge Estates Residential Developments The proposed Project would cross portions of property associated with each of these four planned residential developments from about MPs 1.8 to 2.0 along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment. This area is currently undeveloped forest land, and is surrounded by existing residential subdivisions. Lots in the Carlton Park and Stony Ridge Estates developments have been subdivided, but have not yet been sold, and no planned construction dates are currently available as they are pending sale of the lots. In the Jessup Valley and Jessup Valley North developments, the developer has applied for re-subdivision ofthe lots; planned construction datesare not currently available. Lots on which residential construction could occur are located throughout the area, between0 and 400 feet from the proposed Project workspace. Although construction dates are not known, if construction were to overlap, conflicts with residential development on these lots could occur on a temporary basis. However, no permanent impacts would occur because Algonquin would construct the replacement pipeline adjacent to its existing pipelines and within its existing permanent right-of-way, which already precludes the placement of structures over the right-of-way in this area. Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the developers and permitting authorities to identify and address any potential construction-related conflicts.   4-146 TABLE 4.8.3-1 Planned Residential and Commercial Developments Within 0.25 Mile of the AIM Project  Distance Distance and Direction from Nearest Facility/County, State/ Begin End Crossed Point Along Municipality MP MP (feet)a Construction Work Area Planned Development, Description, Timing  PIPELINE FACILITIES Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay Rockland County, NY Haverstraw 0.0 1.0 NA At MP 0.6, site(s) are located east/ Highgate Estates FM# 3727 – Residential development/ southeast from the work area approx. subdivision with empty lots for sale; no current construction. 250 feet.

The proposed project would cross the AIM Project pipeline alignment at about MP 3.3 within the Hudson River bed; however, no direct interaction would occur because the AIM Project pipeline would be installed beneath the river using the HDD construction method. Construction of the Champlain Hudson Power Express Project is anticipated to take place between late 2014 and 2017.  4-147 TABLE 4.8.3-1 (cont’d) Planned Residential and Commercial Developments Within 0.25 Mile of the AIM Project  Facility/County, State/ Begin Municipality MP  Distance Distance and Direction from Nearest Crossed Point Along End MP (feet)a Construction Work Area Planned Development, Description, Timing  Westchester County, NY City of Peekskill 5.3 Cortlandt 7.6 Cortlandt 3.9 Cortlandt 9.8 Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay Fairfield County, CT City of Danbury 1.8  5.3 NA At MP 5.3, site is located along Waste Transfer Facility – Per Mr. John Lynch of the City of railroad on Tract No. W-136; #WE-Peekskill Planning Dept., a Waste Transfer Facility is planned by 02550 in a northerly direction from Kmmkm, Ldt.

WPP also proposes to construct a converter station that would occupy about 3.8 acres on a 105-acre parcel owned by Con Edison in the Hamlet of Verplanck located in the Town of Cortlandt. WPP filed an application with the New York State Public Service Commission in July 2013, and anticipates filing an amendment in early 2015. WPP also filed an application with the USACE in August 2013, and anticipates publication of public notice of the USACE application in 2014. 9.8 NA At MP 9.8, the site is located south of Three-lot Subdivision – Per Asst.

The site is located in on parcel ID 233-030 on a site known locally as the Churchill & Banks parcel. Planning is still in early stages of development and permitting and no construction date has been filed. –––––––––––––––––––– a Where distance crossed is NA (not applicable), the Project would not cross the planned development but would be located within 0.25 mile.  4-150 The proposed Project would cross a railroad track owned by CSX Corporation at MP 3.0 along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment. The crossing would be about 100 feet in length. CSX has received approval to rehabilitate and replace this segment of railroad track, but no construction date has been set. Algonquin proposes to bore this railroad crossing, which would avoid direct impacts on the track and surrounding right-of-way. Therefore, the AIM Project would not preclude or conflict with CSX’s ability to complete its proposed work. If construction of both projects were to overlap, indirect impacts such as increased traffic and noise from construction equipment and dust resulting from soil work would occur on a temporarybasis.  Algonquin would continue to coordinate with CSX and applicable authorities during the permitting of this crossing to identify and address any potential construction-related impacts. Champlain Hudson Power Express Project The Champlain Hudson Power Express Project, a proposed electric transmission project by Transmission Developers, Inc., would include a high-voltage direct-current line installed in a 30-footwide corridor within the bed of the Hudson River. The alignment of Algonquin’s proposed HDD of the Hudson River would cross this proposed transmission line at about MP 3.3. We received numerous comments indicating that the Commission had already authorized this project. To clarify, on July 1, 2010, the Commission authorized the rates associated with the Champlain Hudson Power Express Project. However, the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the siting of this Project. The New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) has siting authority for the portion of the project in New York. The DOE released a final EIS on the Champlain Hudson Project in August 2014, and a Presidential Permit was issued by the DOE in October 2014. Transmission Developers, Inc. expects to construct the project between 2014 and 2017 but various federal and state permits are still pending. Although construction of both projects could overlap, Algonquin would avoid any in-water work as the proposed HDD would be staged from either side of the river and would place the pipeline far below the river bed. Therefore, the AIM Project would not directly preclude or conflict with the installation of the transmission line. However, indirect impacts such as increased traffic and noise from construction equipment would occur on a temporary basis if construction schedules were to overlap. Algonquin would coordinate with Transmission Developers, Inc. and permitting authorities to identify and address any potentialconstruction-related impacts. WestPoint Transmission Project The West Point Transmission Project is a proposed 1,000 MW underwater power cable proposed by WPP to bring untapped power from northern and western New York State to the New York City area. The proposed route begins in Athens, New York, and the cable would be buried below the bottom of the Hudson River for a distance of about 74 miles before making landfall in the Hamlet of Verplanck, New York. The cable would then be buried underground for about 1.5 miles before interconnecting with existing transmission facilities at the Buchanan North Substation in the Village of Buchanan, New York.  WPP also proposes to construct a converter station that would occupy about 3.8 acres on a 105-acre parcel owned by Con Edison in the Hamlet of Verplanck. WPP has filed applications with the USACE and the NYSPSC.  WPP anticipates filing an amendment to its NYSPSC application in early 2015. The proposed route of the AIM Project’s Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment also crosses the Hudson River onto the same Con Edison parcel in the Hamlet of Verplanck. Based on WPP’s September 2014 filing before the NYSPSC, the AIM Project pipeline would cross the West Point Transmission Project’s high-voltage direct-current cable route at MP 3.9 (9th Street). From this crossing, the transmission line would be parallel to the proposed AIM Project pipeline at an offset of 50 feet, as both projects proceed easterly toward the Con Edison parcel. At the Con Edison parcel, the AIM Project 4-151 pipeline would be located about 50 feet west of WPP’s proposed converter station.  North of the converter station, the West Point Transmission Project’s transmission line would again run parallel to the proposed AIM Project pipeline for a distance ofapproximately 1,000 feet. WPP modified its proposed transmission line alignment to closely parallel Algonquin’s temporary construction workspace as described above, in order to reduce impacts on residential areas in the Hamlet of Verplanck. Algonquin and WPP would coordinate construction schedules to avoid overlap in construction activities on the Con Edison parcel. Algonquin anticipates that AIM Project pipeline construction would take place in 2015, with the Hudson River HDD crossing taking approximately four months to complete. Construction of WPP’s transmission line in the Hamlet of Verplanck would take place after completion of Algonquin’s construction activities. The modified transmission line alignment would allow a reduction in WPP’s construction time period and construction impacts, because WPP could rely on construction workspace already cleared by Algonquin in the area where the projects parallel one another. While Algonquin has indicated that construction of the two projects on the Con Edison parcel would not overlap, the parcel is also large enough to accommodate both projects should the construction schedules change resulting in overlapping activities. We have received several comments expressing safety concerns about potential interactions between Algonquin’s proposed pipeline facilities and the WPP transmission line. A discussion of these safety concerns is provided in section 4.12.3.  Prindle Lane Center The Prindle Lane Center is a proposed office building, restaurant, and hotel in the City of Danbury, Connecticut.  The AIM Project would cross this property for about 600 feet at MP 1.8 along the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment. No construction date is currently available for the Prindle Lane Center.  It is possible that AIM Project construction could conflict with construction of these facilities. Although construction dates are not known, if construction were to overlap, conflicts with development at this site could occur on a temporary basis. However, Algonquin would construct the replacement pipeline adjacent to its existing pipelines and within its existing permanent right-of-way, which already precludes the placement of structures over the right-of-way in this area. Therefore, there would be no new permanent impacts on this development. Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the developers and permitting authorities to identify and address any potential construction-related impacts. Franklin Hills Estates and Country Club Franklin Hills Estates and Country Club is a development that includes a golf course, country club, and houses. Clearing activities for construction began in January 2014. The AIM Project would cross this property for about 2,400 feet from MPs 7.0 and 7.5 along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment. A projected completion date is not available for the estates and country club. Depending on the completion date, conflicts between the two projects could occur during construction. However, Algonquin would construct the replacement pipeline adjacent to its existing pipelines and within its existing permanent right-of-way, which already precludes the placement of structures over the right-ofway in this area. Therefore, there would be no new permanent impacts on this area. Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the developers and permitting authorities to identify and address any potential construction-related impacts. 395/2 Flex Center Commercial Development The 395/2 Flex Center commercial development is a proposed multi-use commercial building in Franklin, Connecticut. The property is currently undeveloped and forested. The AIM Project would 4-152 cross this property for about 625 feet from MPs 8.1 to 8.2 along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment. The nearest proposed structure associated with the commercial development would be about 400 feet from the AIM Project workspace. A proposed construction date for the commercial development has not yet been filed. Although construction dates are not known, if construction were to overlap, conflicts with development on this property could occur on a temporary basis. However, Algonquin would construct the replacement pipeline adjacent to its existing pipelines and within its existing permanent right-of-way, which already precludes the placement of structures over the right-ofway in this area. Therefore, there would be no new permanent impacts on this development. Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the developers and permitting authorities to identify and address any potentialconstruction-related conflicts. Cochegan Rock Access Driveway The Mohegan Tribe of Indians plans to improve an existing driveway for access to Cochegan Rock, a sacred site owned by the tribe in Montville, Connecticut. The surrounding area is undeveloped and forested. The AIM Project would cross this driveway easement at about MP 1.0 on the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension. No date has been set for construction. Although construction dates are not known, if construction were to overlap, conflicts with improvements to the existing driveway could occur on a temporary basis.  However, there would be no new permanent impacts because the pipeline would be installed beneath the driveway and the driveway could continue to be used following installation of the pipeline.  Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the tribe and permitting authorities to identify and address any potential construction-related conflicts. 4.8.4 Coastal Zone Management In 1972, Congress passed the CZMA to “preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance, the resources of the nation’s coastal zone for this and succeeding generations” and to “encourage and assist the states to exercise effectively their responsibilities in the coastal zone through the development and implementation of management programs to achieve wise use of the land and water resources of the coastal zone” (16 USC 1452, Section 303 (1) and (2)). Section 307 (c)(3)(A) of the CZMA states that “any applicant for a required federal license or permit to conduct an activity, in or outside the coastal zone, affecting any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone of that state shall provide a certification that the proposed activity complies with the enforceable policies of the state’s approved program and that such activity will be conducted in a manner consistent with the program.” In order to participate in the CZMP, a state is required to prepare a program management plan for approval by the NOAA, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM). Once the OCRM has approved a state’s plan, including its enforceable program policies, the state program gains “federal consistency” jurisdiction. This means that any federal action (e.g., a project requiring federally issued licenses or permits) that takes place within the state’s coastal zone must be found to be consistent with state coastalpolicies before the action can take place. Portions of the AIM Project are subject to a federal Coastal Zone Consistency Review because it would: 1) involve activities within the coastal zones of New York and Massachusetts; and 2) require several federal permits and approvals (see table 1.5-1). The Project would not be located within the coastal zones of Connecticut or Rhode Island. New York and Massachusetts have approved CZMPs administered by the NYSDOS and the MAEOEEA, respectively. A description of each state’s program, the applicable Project activities, and information provided by Algonquin regarding consistency of the Project with state policies is provided below. 4-153 4.8.4.1 New York The NYSDOS, through the Division of Coastal Resources, is the lead agency responsible for administering the State’s Waterfront Revitalization and Coastal Resources Act, Section 919, as approved by NOAA in 1982. This act provides the NYSDOS with the authority to establish a coastal management program, develop coastal policies, define the coastal boundaries, and establish state consistency requirements. The New York Coastal Management Program requires actions within the coastal zone to be consistent with the state’s coastal area policies or a state-approved Local Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP). A LWRP is a refinement of the state’s coastal policies, developed jointly by the state and a municipality.  The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment crosses the coastal zone management area associated with the Hudson River in the Town of Stony Point and in the City of Peekskill. Both the Town of Stony Point and the City of Peekskill have approved LWRPs fromthe NYSDOS that refines and supplements the State’s Coastal Management Program. The Town of Stony Point’s LWRP was approved in 1994 and the City of Peekskill’s LWRP was approved in 2004 (Town of Stony Point, 1994; City of Peekskill, 2004). Algonquin plans to cross the Hudson River using the HDD method to avoid impacts on aquatic resources and potential impacts on critical environmental areas (CEA). Algonquin filed its consistency assessment application with the NYSDOS on February 27, 2014. In its application, Algonquin described how the AIM Project would be consistent with each of the applicable state coastal policies, as well as with the applicable additional policies of the Stony Point and Peekskill LWRPs. On September 2, 2014, the NYSDOS concurred with Algonquin’s consistency certification (NYSDOS, 2014a). On October 21, 2014, Algonquin notified the NYSDOS of changes to the proposed pipeline route and workspaces at the Hudson River crossing (as described in section 3.5). The NYSDOS confirmed that the September 2 consistency determination remains valid for the current proposed alignment of the Project (NYSDOS, 2014b). 4.8.4.2 Massachusetts The MACZM, within the MAEOEEA, is the lead agency for administering the Massachusetts Coastal Zone Management Plan, as approved by NOAA in 1978 and updated through subsequent filings. This plan provides MACZM with the authority to review federal projects affecting the Massachusetts coast to ensure consistencywith state policies(MACZM, 2014).  The proposed new Assonet M&R Station would be located within the Massachusetts coastal zone. However, on February 6, 2014, MACZM determined that due to the limited nature of the work at this site, the Project falls below the threshold requiringfederal consistency review. 4.8.5 Public Land, Recreation, and Other Special Interest Areas USGS topographic maps; aerial photographs; correspondence with federal, state, and local agencies; field reconnaissance; and internet searches were used to identify parks, recreation areas, scenic areas, and other designated or special interest areas at the federal, state, and local level in the vicinity of the proposed Project facilities. The areas that would be crossed by the Project or that would be within 0.25 mile of the construction right-of-way are listed in table P-1 in appendix P.  During pipeline construction within 0.25 mile of the areas identified in P-1 in appendix P, impacts associated with increased traffic, noise, and dust, as well as impacts on visual resources, could occur; however, these impacts would be temporary and limited to the time of construction. Visual 4-154 One of the primary concerns when crossing recreation and special interest areas is the impact of construction on the recreational activities, public access, and resources the area aims to protect. Construction would alter visual aesthetics by removing existing vegetation and disturbing soils. Construction would also generate dust and noise, which could be a nuisance to recreational users, and may interfere with or diminish the quality of the recreational experience by affecting wildlife movements or disturbing trails. In general, Project impacts on recreational and special interest areas occurring outside of forest land would be temporary and limited to the period of active construction, which typically lasts several weeks or months in any one area. These impacts would be minimized by implementing the measures in Algonquin’s E&SCP. Traffic-related impacts would be minimized through implementation of the measures in Algonquin’s traffic management plans (see section 4.9.5). Noise mitigation measures that would be employed during construction include ensuring that the sound muffling devices, which are provided as standard equipment by the construction equipment manufacturer, are kept in good working order. To control fugitive dust during construction, Algonquin would apply water or other commercially available dust control agents on unpaved areas subject to frequent vehicle traffic. In addition, we have recommended that Algonquin develop and implement a Dust Control Plan that specifies the mitigation measuresto be used for dust abatement (see section 4.11.1).  Following construction, most open land uses would be allowed to revert to their former uses. Forest land affected by the temporary construction right-of-way and ATWS areas, however, would experience long-term impacts because of the time required to restore the woody vegetation to its preconstruction condition. Further, forest land within the new permanent right-of-way would experience permanent impacts because it would be precluded from being reestablished within the maintained portion of the right-of-way. Algonquin would construct the majority of the Project adjacent to its existing pipelines within its existing permanent right-of-way or largely overlapping its existing permanent rightof-way, or within or adjacent to existing roadways.  Therefore, most of the recreational and public interest areas crossed would not be further impacted during operation ofthe Project. Implementation of the measures discussed above would minimize or eliminate impacts on most of the public lands, recreation, and other public interest areas identified in P-1 in appendix P. We do not believe the Project would result in significant impacts on these areas. Areas requiring additional site-specific considerations are discussed in detail below by state. 4.8.5.1 New York Harriman State Park Harriman State Park is the second largest park in the New York State Parks system, located in Rockland and Orange Counties and managed by the PIPC. The park, at 46,613 acres, holds 31 lakes and ponds; over 200 miles of trails; and a number of recreation areas for camping, swimming, and hiking (New York State Parks, 2013). On its northeastern edge, Harriman State Park borders the 5,000-acre Bear Mountain State Park as well as the United States Military Academy’s 16,000-acre forest reserve. Additionally, 18.8 miles ofthe Appalachian Trail are within the park.  The Project pipeline facilities would cross Harriman State Park in two locations in Rockland County, on the existing right-of-way from about MPs 0.0 to 0.3 in the Town of Haverstraw along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment, and from about MPs 2.5 to 2.6 in the Town of Stony Point (Hamlet of Tomkins Cove) along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment.  4-155 A total of about 4.5 acres of temporary construction workspace would be required for the construction of the pipeline facilities crossing Harriman State Park. This area consists of forested land that would be cleared for Project construction. Of the 4.5 acres of temporary construction workspace, 2.5 acres would consist of existing permanent right-of-way. Algonquin met with the Executive Director of the PIPC on January 8, 2014, and determined that the land use where the pipeline would cross the park is passive recreation with no active trails orpublic facilities. No new permanent right-of-way would be added in Harriman State Park; therefore, any impacts would be temporary and limited to the construction period. Although temporary, impacts as a result of tree clearing would be long term. Construction would take place during the summer months of 2016, when recreational use of the park would be at a peak. However, no active public facilities are located in the Project area so there would be no direct impacts on recreational use of the park during construction. Any interaction with the public during construction would be mitigated with appropriate monitoring, use of safety devices, and signage. As part of its easement negotiations, Algonquin has agreed to complete a tree inventory and utilize erosion and sediment control procedures during construction. We have also recommended that Algonquin provide us with any additional avoidance and mitigation measures developed in consultation with NYSOPRHP and PIPC (see section 4.6.1.5). Cheesecote Mountain Town Park Cheesecote Mountain Town Park is owned by the Town of Haverstraw and contains 217 acres of land and a 6-acre pond (Cheesecote Reservoir). The park is open to the general public daily from April 1 through October 31st (Town of Haverstraw, 2014). The construction right-of-way associated with the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would be located on town-owned property on Cheesecote Mountain, but would be about 0.4 mile west of the town park itself. The park is accessed from Willow Grove Road in the Town of Haverstraw, about 0.5 mile from the construction right-of-way. The portion of town property that would be crossed by the Project is not a designated public recreational area, and is not used for recreational or access purposes. Therefore, although Project construction would occur during the park’s open season in 2016, construction would not have an impact park use or access. Temporary visual impacts associated with construction would be consistent with the existing visual character of the area, because an existing overhead transmission line occupies the same areaasthe Project right-of-way.  Letchworth Village Cemetery The Letchworth Village Cemetery is located in the Town of Haverstraw and owned by the State of New York and has been previously determined eligible for listing in the NRHP by the New York SHPO. The Project would cross a portion of open area within the cemetery on existing right-of-way at approximate MP 0.8 along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment. The AIM Project would not have any permanent impacts on land use within the cemetery because the replacement pipeline would be located within Algonquin’s existing permanent right-of-way, which already crosses the cemetery property. During the construction period, visits to the historic cemetery would be temporarily impacted by construction noise and dust. Letchworth Village Cemetery has been determined eligible for the NRHP. The boundaries for this resource will be delineated and avoided (see section 4.10.1). Algonquin must file documentation that it has completed NHPA section 106 consultation with the New York SHPO before construction could begin (see section 4.10.5). Camp Bullowa Camp Bullowa is a private facility owned by the Hudson Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The camp consists of about 300 acres of fields and trails that serve local youth through Boy 4-156 Scout programs. Activities within the camp include a shooting sports area and fishing and boating on Lake Boyce (Hudson Valley Council, 2010). The camp is available for use year-round by Boy Scout units and outside groups.  The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would cross Camp Bullowa on existing right-of-way for a distance of about 0.6 mile, from MPs 0.7 to 1.3. The entrance to the camp is located off Franck Road, immediately adjacent to the existing right-of-way. The portion of the camp that would be crossed by the Project is about 200 feet north of the camp recreation area, and is also occupied by an existing high-tension powerline.  Project construction would occur during the summer of 2016; therefore it is likely that the camp could be in use during construction.  Temporary construction noise, dust, and traffic would be the primary impacts associated with construction within Camp Bullowa. Impacts on the camp would be mitigated with appropriate monitoring, safety devices, and signage. Algonquin has committed to continue coordinating with the Hudson Valley Council of the Boy Scouts to address any specific concerns and ensure the safety of all scouting members atthe camp. Simpson Memorial Church Simpson Memorial Church, Inc. is a property in the Hamlet of Tompkins Cove with land use classified as Institutional Quasi Public (Rockland County Planning Department, 2013). The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would cross this property between MPs 2.8 and 3.0.  A new easement would be required for this crossing. The crossing of the church property would be located entirely along a wooded area. There is no church structure in this area, and the area is not used for church or recreational functions. Therefore, there would be no direct impact on public use of the property. Temporary noise, dust, and traffic impacts would occur during construction, but these impacts would be minimized by screening from the surrounding wooded areain addition to the general measuresidentified above.  Washington-Rochambeau National Historic Trail (New York Portion) The Washington-Rochambeau National Historic Trail (NHT) is managed by the National Park Service (NPS) and covers over 680 miles of land and water used by General Washington and General Rochambeau during the siege of Yorktown in the War of Independence. This trail crosses major rivers, metropolitan areas, state parks, and ruraland suburbancommunities fromVirginia to Massachusetts.  The NHT also follows many roads that have been in existence sincethe 18th century (NPS, 2014a).  In New York, the Project would cross the NHT at one location in Stony Point and three locations in Cortlandt. The points crossed are all on existing paved public roadways that have been designated as part of the NHT: Route 9W/202-N. Liberty Drive (MP 3.0), Broadway Street (MP 4.8), Route 9A (MP 5.8), and Route 9 (MP 5.9). Algonquin has consulted with the NPS, and the NPS indicated that they do not have any concerns regarding the proposed Project. Algonquin also met with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) on April 17, 2014, and NYSDOT personnel indicated that they do not foresee any conflict with the NHT or any need for additional mitigation measures, since the NHT is along paved roads and the Project would not alter the existing road use. Because the NHT is collocated with modern paved roads at these points, the Project would not have any impact on the recreational use or aesthetic character of the NHT. 4-157 St. Patrick’s Church is located in the Hamlet of Verplanck with land use classified as Institutional Quasi Public (Westchester County, 2009). The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of would cross this property at MP 4.1. A new easement would be required for this crossing as it is in the portion of this pipeline segment that deviates from Algonquin’s existing right-of-way. In addition, the ATWS associated with the pullback area of the Hudson River HDD would be located on the property. The workspace associated with the Project would be located partially within two parking lots associated with the church. One of the lots is accessed from 11th Street and includes a small paved parking area near its entrance, with a larger unpaved area extending to the northeast. The other lot is accessed from Highland Avenue and is unpaved. Project activities would not affect access to the two parking lots, and would not affect the availability of on-street parking near the church. However, Project workspaces would be located on large portions of the unpaved areas within both parking lots, as well as on a small portion of the paved area within the 11th Street lot. Church officials have indicated that most parishioners use on-street parking; nonetheless Project construction would temporarily reduce the area available foroff-street parking near the church. We received a comment from the Administrator of St. Patrick’s Church noting that, in addition to weekend masses, the church conducts weddings, baptisms, funerals, and holiday services throughout the week, as well as holding 9:00 a.m. masses each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Algonquin has agreed to avoid construction activities during weekend services, thereby reducing some impacts on church activities during construction. However, during weekday functions the church would experience temporary impacts from construction noise, dust, and traffic, similar to those impacts experienced by other landowners and businesses in the Project area. As noted above, Project construction would also temporarily reduce the availability of off-street parking. After construction, the parking lots would be returned to their prior use; therefore, there would be no permanent impacts associated with the new easement. To ensure that impacts on St. Patrick’s Church are furtherminimized, we recommend that:  Prior to the construction of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of OEP, a revised site-specific construction plan for St. Patrick’s Church.  The plan should include: a. a detailed schedule for construction activities within the HDD pullback area located on church property (i.e., month(s), week(s), days of the week, and hours of the day); b. in addition to avoiding construction activities during weekend services, avoidance of construction activities during the morning masses held at 9:00a.m. each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, andFriday; c. provisions for an alternate parking area and/or shuttle service for use by parishioners during the time the church’s parking areas are disrupted by construction activities; and d. restoration of the church’s parking areas to their preconstruction condition immediately following completion of construction activities in the HDD pullback area. 4-158 While we recognize that events such as weddings, baptisms, and funerals may take place on weekdays in addition to morning masses, we do not believe that it is reasonable to avoid all such events, because they do not occur on a regular schedule. We conclude that the measures identified above, including our additional recommendation, are sufficient to minimize impacts on St. Patrick’s Church to less than significant levels. Indian Point Energy Center The IPEC is a nuclear powered generating facility owned by Entergy in the Village of Buchanan, New York. Algonquin’s existing pipeline right-of-way crosses through the IPEC property on the east side of the Hudson River Crossing. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would be located south of the existing right-of-way but would still include construction right-ofway within the IPEC facility property, and the east side of Algonquin’s proposed HDD crossing of the Hudson River would include a staging area located on the IPEC property. The Project would cross the IPEC property for a total of 2,159 feet from about MPs 4.4 to 4.9. The Project would require about 2.4 acres of new permanent easement on the IPEC property, along with 1.9 acres of temporary workspace. The IPEC lands that would be crossed by the Project are located over 1,600 feet from the power plant structures, with other road, parking, and industrial/commercial land uses in between. The proposed AIM Project alignment within the IPEC property would be located outside the facility’s primary security zone.  We received a comment from the New York State Attorney General’s Office stating that Algonquin’s pipeline is near a potential location for a closed-cycle cooling system for Indian Point Unit 3, and citing concerns that the pipeline could impede the construction of such a cooling system. This concern refers to Algonquin’s existing pipelines on the IPEC property, immediately south of the IPEC security barrier. The proposed route would be located about 0.5 mile south of the IPEC security barrier, and would not impact construction of a closed-cycle cooling tower. Algonquin stated that Entergy, during consultation on May 16, 2014, has agreed that the proposed southern route for the AIM pipeline would not interfere with future plans to construct closed-cycle cooling towers. We also received several comments expressing safety concerns about the proximity of the AIM Project facilities to the IPEC nuclear facilities. Algonquin engaged in ongoing consultation with Entergy regarding the proposed AIM Project, and has committed to enhanced mitigation measures for the portion of the proposed pipeline near IPEC (see section 4.12.3). Entergy filed a Safety Evaluation for the AIM Project with the NRC in August 2014, and has concluded that the AIM project would pose no increased risks to IPEC and that there would be no significant reduction in the margin of safety. The NRC conducted an independent analysis of Entergy’s finding and concurs with Entergy’s conclusions (NRC, 2014b). Algonquin would coordinate all construction activities at this site with Entergy’s IPEC site manager. See section 4.12.3 for additional discussion of safety-related concerns associated with the IPEC facility. Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School The Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School is a public elementary school serving about 300 students in Westchester County. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the AIM Project would be located adjacent to the back portion of the school property between MPs 4.9 and 5.0. The Project construction right-of-way and workspace would be located about 450 feet away from the school facility itself at its closest point. The area between the school and the proposed Project workspace is densely wooded, and a natural berm separates the schoolfrom the proposed pipeline route.  Noise and dust generated by the construction activities could temporarily impact the school and related school activities. To minimize these impacts, Algonquin would attempt to complete construction 4-159 while school is not in session (i.e., the summer). However, as discussed in sections 4.7.1.2 and 4.7.1.3, Algonquin has also committed to adhering to the FWS-recommended tree clearing restriction window for Indiana and northern long-eared bats (April 1 to September 31) within a 5-and 3-mile radius, respectively, of each identified bat location (Indiana bat) or accepted home range of the species (northern long-eared bat). These 3-to 5-mile buffers overlap the area around the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. As a result, tree clearing in this area needs to occur between October 1 and March 31 when the bats are in hibernation. If the Project is approved and tree clearing cannot occur before March 31, construction nearthe school could be delayed until the fall, overlapping with the school year. To further minimize impacts regardless of when construction would occur, Algonquin has committed to avoiding rock blasting in this area, which would minimize noise impacts associated with construction. The interveningwooded land and naturalbermwould also provide a bufferto visual, noise, and dust impacts associated with construction activities. In addition, Algonquin has agreed to additional design and installation enhancements for construction and operation near the IPEC facility, which it would also apply to the portion of the proposed pipeline near the school (see section 4.12.3). Therefore, we conclude that impacts on Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School during both construction and operation would be sufficiently minimized. Village Park (Village ofBuchanan) This Village Park, owned by the Town of Cortlandt Manor – Village of Buchanan, is a municipal park about 43 acres in size. According to the County of Westchester Department of Planning, the land use within the park is classified as open space designated for municipal and park purposes (Westchester County, 2014a).  TheStonyPoint to Yorktown Take-up and RelaysegmentoftheProjectwould cross the park at about MP 5.1.  The Project would cross this park for about 313 feet along a wooded area at the back of the property. This area is about 165 feet from the portion of the property used for public recreation. Construction activities would be completed within a few months between March and October 2015, which coincides with the recreation season. The intervening woodland would provide a visual buffer during project construction; however, temporary construction noise and dust impacts could still occur. A new easement would be required for construction and operation of the pipeline as it falls within the portion of this segment that deviates from Algonquin’s existing right-of-way. However, the right-of-way would not preclude use of the park. Algonquin has committed to coordinating with the Town of Cortlandt (the landowner for the Village Park) regarding the proposed crossing of this park. Blue Mountain Reservation The Blue Mountain Reservation is a 1,538-acre park located in the Town of Cortlandt, New York, and managed by Westchester County. The reservation is characterized by steep topography, rugged terrain, and the wide presence of exposed bedrock. The reservation offers trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding, including the two peaks of Blue Mountain and Mt. Spitzenberg (Westchester County, 2014b). The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the AIM Project would cross the Blue Mountain Reservation from about MPs 6.7 to 8.1and again between MPs 8.4 and 8.5.  The new 42-inch-diameter pipeline would replace the existing 26-inch diameter pipeline within a 6-foot-wide permanent easement granted in 1952 by the Westchester County Park Commission and the Westchester County Board of Supervisors. That easement also provides for a 75-foot-wide maintenance easement. The new pipeline would be installed in the same trench as the existing pipeline to be removed. Upon completion of construction, Algonquin would file and record as-built drawings with the county. A total of about 18.8 acres of temporary construction workspace would be required within the Blue Mountain Reservation for construction of the AIM Project. This area consists of forested land that would 4-160 be cleared for construction activities. Of the 18.8 acres of temporary workspace, 1.1 acres would be within existing permanent right-of-way. No new permanent right-of-way would be added within the reservation. The AIM Project would require ATWS outside the existing 75-foot-wide maintenance easement within the Blue Mountain Reservation for up to a 6-month period; the total temporary construction right-of-way would generally be 100 feet wide.   Construction noise, dust, tree clearing, and traffic would temporarily impact the Blue Mountain Reservation during Project construction. Construction in the reservation is expected to occur between March 2016 and October 2016; Algonquin would inform the public prior to commencement of construction activities once a more specific construction schedule is determined. Algonquin would also implement the measures in its E&SCP to minimize impacts on the area. Surrounding woodland would largely screen visual impacts on recreational/aesthetic use of the reservation. After construction, all impacted areas within the Reservation would be returned to their preexisting use, and although long-term temporary impacts would occur as a result of treeclearing, no permanent impactswould occur. We received comments regarding the need to minimize construction impacts and protect the recreational use and aesthetic character of the park. On January 28, 2014, Algonquin met with Westchester County officials to address specific issues related to construction of the pipeline through the reservation and continued operation of Algonquin’s facilities, and to request approval for additional workspace from the county. As mitigation for crossing the reservation, Algonquin would pay rent to Westchester County for its ATWS, and would pay compensation for trees removed along the right-ofway.    We evaluated a route variation within the Blue Mountain Reservation as a result of comments on the draft EIS. The variation would have shifted the pipeline alignment about 100 feet to the north. However, because there is another utility corridor abutting the north side of Algonquin’s existing right-ofway at this location, the variation would have needed to cross this utility corridor twice, once to put the proposed pipeline north of the corridor and then a second time to return to the proposed alignment after passing by the pond. These crossings of the existing utility corridor and the new right-of-way resulting from the shift would increase the amount of temporary and permanent workspace and land disturbance as well as the amount of temporary and permanent forest clearing that would be needed to install the pipeline.  Therefore, we do not recommend its incorporation into the proposed route (see section 3.5.2.1).  Although long-term impacts associated with tree clearing would occur, overall impacts on the area would be minimized by installing the pipeline within Algonquin’s existing permanent easement. Therefore, we conclude that impacts on the Blue Mountain Reservation would be sufficiently minimized. New York City Catskill Aqueduct The New York City Catskill Aqueduct channels New York City’s water supply system from the Catskill/Delaware Watersheds. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the AIM Project would cross the Catskill Aqueduct at about MP 10.3 on Croton Avenue near the Cortlandt M&R Station.  The NYCDEP manages this aqueduct.  The 26-inch-diameter pipeline and casing pipe that crosses the aqueduct would be removed (although Algonquin would not disturb the existing protective concrete slab pending concurrence from the NYCDEP) and the 42-inch-diameter pipeline would be installed within a new casing pipe above the aqueduct.  As with the existing pipeline, the new pipeline would be located above the aqueduct and would rest on concrete pads to provide adequate separation and protection for the aqueduct pipe. The new pipeline segment would be located 50 feet to the south of the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline (see section 3.5.2.1), placing the new 42-inch-diameter pipeline at the edge of the area permitted by Algonquin’s existing Land Use Permit from NYCDEP. The new pipeline would require additional 4-161 permitted right-of-way and temporary construction workspace. The measures that would be implemented at this crossing are described in section 4.3.2.1. Algonquin continues to consult with the NYCDEP regarding this crossing. We have recommended that Algonquin provide a final site-specific crossing plan forthe aqueduct prior to construction (see section 4.3.2.1). Sylvan Glen Park Preserve and Granite Knolls Park West The Sylvan Glen Park Preserve and Granite Knolls Park West are adjacent parks located west of Stony Street and east of Lexington Avenue in the Town of Yorktown.  The preserve is the site of a former quarry that supplied honey-colored granite for the approaches to the George Washington and Whitestone bridges. The parks contain 5.0 miles of trails used for hiking and dog walking and are open year-round. Old cables, discarded slabs of granite, and an explosive shed are a few of the remnants along the trails in the parks (New York–New Jersey Trail Conference, 2014).  The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the Project crosses parcels within the Sylvan Glen Park Preserve and Granite Knolls West terminating at the west side of Stony Street. The crossings would occur on existing right-of-way for a total distance of about 1.2 miles, from about MPs 11.0 to 11.8 (with a short separation where the pipeline leaves the park property) and MPs 11.9 to 12.3. A new launcher/receiver and pressure regulating facility would be constructed and operated at MP 12.3 on a parcel within Granite Knolls West.  In 1952, Loyola Seminary granted Algonquin a 50-foot-wide permanent easement for a pipeline and appurtenant facilities under and upon the land in what is now the Sylvan Glen Park Preserve. The Town of Yorktown acquired the Loyola Seminary property in 1981 for park purposes. The conversion to a park use did not extinguish Algonquin’s existing easement. The AIM Project replacement pipeline and new launcher/receiver and pressure regulator facility would be installed within the existing permanent easement. However, construction would require the clearing of a strip of mostly upland forest between 30 to 40 feet wide on the north side of the existing right-of-way. Some additional tree clearing would be required for a roughly 350-by 85-foot extra workspace on the west side of Stony Street and for nine ATWSs, roughly 100 feet by 35 feet, throughout the parks. The installation of the launcher/receiver facility on the west side of Stony Street would also introduce a new, low profile visual impact in a viewshed otherwise unaffected by aboveground ground structures. The launcher/receiver facility may be visible to passing motorist and pedestrians on or adjacent to Stony Street. Also, Algonquin is no longer proposing to use a contractor ware yard within the Granite Knolls Park West.  The Town of Yorktown identified two hiking trails (High Quarry and Turtle Pond trails) that it wished to remain open during Project construction, and a historic lime kiln that it expects the New York SHPO would want maintained rather than demolished. We also received a scoping comment expressing concern about damage to this kiln. Phase II archaeological evaluation is in progress for this site (see section 4.10.1). Construction activities, noise, and dust would impact recreational use of this area. Algonquin would place timber mats over the High Quarry and Turtle Pond trails, as requested by the town, in order to keep them open during construction. Algonquin would mitigate construction impacts by installing safety fencing around excavations left overnight, installing signage, and watering regularly to control fugitive dust. After the construction period, Algonquin would return the construction area to its preexisting use. The new launcher/receiver facility would have a minor but permanent impact on the visual character of the parcel of Granite Knolls West where it would be installed. There would be no other permanent impacts on Sylvan Glen or Granite Knolls West; however, the impacts associated with the tree clearing would be long term. Cultural surveys for this location are pending. Per our recommendation, Algonquin would file documentation that it has completed NHPA section 106 consultation with the NewYork SHPO before construction could begin (see section 4.10.5). 4-162 In New York State, local agencies may designate specific geographic areas within their boundaries as CEAs. State agencies may also designate geographic areas they own, manage, or regulate. To be designated as a CEA, an area must have an exceptional or unique character with respect to one or more of the following:  a benefit or threat to human health;  a natural setting (e.g., fish and wildlife habitat, forest and vegetation, open space and areas of important aesthetic or scenic quality);  agricultural, social, cultural, historic, archaeological, recreational, or educational values; or  an inherent ecological, geological, or hydrological sensitivity to change that may be adversely affected by any change. Algonquin identified two CEAs that would be crossed by the AIM Project (NYSDEC, 2014b):  Hudson River CEA: The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment in Westchester County would cross the Hudson River from MPs 3.0 to 3.8. This area is designated as a CEA. The Project would cross the Hudson River using the HDD method to avoid impacts on the CEA. Specifically, the crossing would be south of the Hudson River Mile 44-56 habitat, and avoid the Iona Island and Haverstraw Bay Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitats located to the north and south, respectively. The Project wouldalso avoid the Hudson Highlands State Park Preserve, which lies within the coastal zone north of the Project.  Therefore, no impacts on these areas would occur.  County and State Park Lands CEA: The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would cross this CEA from MPs 6.7 to 8.1 and again from MPs 8.4 to 8.5.  This CEA areais associated with the Blue Mountain Reservation (see the discussion of the Blue Mountain Reservation above). State of New York Parkland Alienation In New York, the Public Trust Doctrine requires state legislative approval when there is a “substantial intrusion on parkland for non-park purposes, regardless of whether there has been an outright conveyance of title and regardless of whether the parkland is ultimately to be restored” (Friends of Van CortlandtParkv. CityofNew York, 2001). Therefore, municipalities proposingto permita non-parkuse on parkland must seek approval from the New York State Legislature, a process called “alienation of parkland.” New York courts, nonetheless, have recognized that there are de minimis exceptions to the Public Trust Doctrine that have a time and area component. In particular, minor uses of parkland for non-park purposes that do not interfere with public use do not require legislative approval (Hand v. Hospital for Special Surgery, 2012; Roosevelt Island Residents Assoc. v. Roosevelt Island Operation Corp., 2005). In addition, construction projects of less than 1 year generally do not constitute alienations, particularly when park uses can continue to go on around the construction (Hand v. Hospital for Special Surgery, 2012; Powell v. City of New York, 2011). As discussed above, the AIM Project would cross the Blue Mountain Reservation, the Sylvan Glen ParkPreserve, CheesecoteMountain,anda Village Parkinthe Village ofBuchanan.  Withregard to state parks or other lands owned by New York State agencies, such as the crossing in Harriman State 4-163 Park, Rockland County, alienation is not triggered. New York State’s parkland law authorizes state agencies to approve easements and licenses in parkland for utilities serving a public purpose (N.Y. Parks & Hist. Pres. L. §13.06). The AIM Project replacement pipeline would be located underground and thus would not permanently affect the use of the surface land for park purposes in the parks that would be crossed by the Project. The construction period within each individual park would be less than 1 year. We note that the Commission has jurisdiction for federal projects regardingthe authorization of siting interstate natural gas facilities under the NGA. Each state or local park management agency would decide whether to seek alienation for the proposed activities on their lands. We do not express an opinion as to whether legislative parkland alienation should be sought by these agencies.  However, iftheProjectis approved by the Commission, the alienation process could not prohibit or unreasonably delay its construction.3 4.8.5.2 Connecticut Ridgewood Country Club Ridgewood Country Club is a private 18-hole golf course located on Franklin Street just north of Interstate 84 in the City of Danbury (Ridgewood Country Club, 2013). The club is owned by Ridgewood County Club, Inc. and offers golf, recreational (tennis and swimming), and dining memberships. A pro golf shop is also located on-site as well as a banquet, patio, garden room, and grill room. The club’s season is May through September with June, July, and August being the most active months for the club. The Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would border the northeastern side of the Ridgewood Country Club property and cross a small portion of it on existing right-of-way at the northern tip between Franklin Street Extension (MP 3.9) and Kohanza Street (MP 4.2). The portion of the Club property that would be crossed includes part of the golf course. In October 2013, Algonquin met with the General Manager of the club to discuss the proposed Project and any concerns the club may have. In a letter to the Commission dated October 24, 2013, the club requested that Algonquin schedule the proposed work between October 2015 and April 2016 because this is their off-season and would cause the least interruption. Algonquin has agreed to this timeframe. Therefore, there would be no significant impacts on the Ridgewood Country Club, as temporary construction impacts would be restricted to the club’s off-season and there would be no new permanent easement. Trumbull Cemetery The Trumbull Cemetery is located in the Town of Lebanon and managed by the Town of Lebanon Historical Society Museum and Visitor Center.  It contains many historic headstones and notable graves, including Revolutionary War Governor John Trumbull and William Williams, a signer of the Declaration of Independence (Town of Lebanon, 2014). The E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment of the AIM Project would be adjacent to the cemetery property for about 400 feet at MP 1.9. This cemetery is listed in the Connecticut State Register of Historic Places and would be avoided (see section 4.10.1). See, e.g., Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293 (1988); National Fuel Gas Supply v. Public Service Commission, 894 F.2d 571 (2d Cir. 1990); and Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., et al., 52 FERC ¶ 61,091 (1990) and 59 FERC ¶ 61,094 (1992). 4-164 The Aspinall Recreation Complex is located in the Town of Lebanon. The Town of Lebanon acquired the 51-acre Aspinall property in 1977 and developed it for recreation in the early 1980s. The property is managed by the Lebanon Recreation Commission and is the major non-school recreational facility in the town. It is located adjacent to Lebanon Elementary School and includes ball fields, tennis courts, and a pavilion (Town of Lebanon, 2013). The E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment of the AIM Project would cross this property on existing right-of-way from about MPs 2.0 to 2.2.  The portion of the property that would be crossed by the Project is forested and is not developed for recreational use. The crossing would be entirely located within a wetland; mitigation would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP.  The adjacent Lebanon Elementary School is actually located closer to the right-of-way than any of the recreational facilities on the Aspinall Complex property.  The Project workspace would be about 750 feet northeast of the school (at its closest point). The intervening land is heavily forested, and would provide screening from visual, noise, and dust impacts during Project construction. The shared entrance to the school and the recreation complex would be over 1,150 feet from the access point to the Project workspace along Exeter Road; therefore, construction traffic would not interfere with accessto the facilities. Senator Thomas J. Dodd Memorial Stadium Dodd Stadium is a minor league baseball stadium located in and owned by the City of Norwich. Itis affiliated withthe ConnecticutTigersMinorLeague Baseballteam.  Thestadiumopenedin1995and is primarily used for baseball, with a seating capacity of 6,270. It is most active during the baseball season (June through September) and closed during the winter. The E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment of the Project would cross the outskirts of the stadium property on existing right-of-way for a total ofabout 1,489 feet (fromabout MPs 8.7 to 8.9 and MPs 8.9 to 9.0). The Project crosses a forested area southwest of the stadium and its associated parking lot. The Project workspace would be about 40 feet from the rear (outfield) edge of the stadium structure, at its closest point. The Project would not interfere with use of the stadium, since it would not cross any developed stadium facilities. However, construction would occur between April and October 2015 (i.e., spring, summer, and early fall), which is the high use period for the stadium (the Connecticut Tigers host home games between mid-June and mid-September, starting at 7:00 p.m.). Temporary noise, dust, and visual impacts would be mitigated by a strip of forest left intact as a buffer between the Project area and the stadium. Algonquin would also regularly water the construction area to control dust, and would install safety fencing and signage.  Project traffic would not impact access to the stadium because the road that provides stadium access, Stott Avenue, would not be utilized by construction vehicles. Although Algonquin’s existing permanent right-of-way would be expanded to accommodate the replacement pipeline along this segment, operation of the pipeline facilities would not create any new restrictions or conflicts with useofthe stadium.  In consultation with stadium officials, Algonquin has agreed to avoid construction activities after 7:00 p.m. and on Sundays during the baseball season. Stadium officials also indicated that high school and college playoff games may be hosted at the stadium prior to the Tigers baseball season. Algonquin has committed to avoiding noise-generating activities while patrons are at the stadium for such events. Therefore, by avoiding construction during events held at the stadium, we conclude that impacts on the use of Dodd Stadium would be sufficiently minimized.  4-165 Watrous Park is located on a 75.1-acre property owned by the Town of Cromwell, which also houses Cromwell Middle School (Cromwell Recreation Department, 2011). Watrous Park is located on a portion of the property behind the school, accessed from Geer Street. Facilities include a pavilion, volleyball courts, tennis courts, basketball courts, a playground, walking trails, softball fields, and a skate park. The park is open daily from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. during the summer months and 7:00 a.m. to sunset the rest of year. The Line-36A Loop Extension would cross this property on existing right-of-way from about MPs 0.5 to 0.8. The construction workspace would be located over 100 feet away from park recreational fields at its closest point, and more than 0.25 mile from the middle school, which shares the property. Because construction would occur primarily during the summer months, users of the nearest park baseball field could experience temporary noise and dust impacts during construction. However, the Project would be located in a forested area that would provide screening to minimize these impacts and avoid visual impacts. Project traffic would not impact access to Watrous Park or Cromwell Middle School, because Geer Street, the main access, would not be utilized by construction traffic. The Project would not have any new permanentimpacts on the park. CromwellFire District Property Managed by the Town of Cromwell, the Cromwell Fire District is a Special Act District created by the Legislature of the State of Connecticut. The District maintains and services the water distribution, pumping, and treatment facilities that service the Town of Cromwell as well as providing fire protection and ambulance service (Cromwell Fire District, 2013). The Line-36A Loop Extension would cross a property owned by the Cromwell Fire District on existing right-of-way from about MPs 1.1 to 1.2. This 7.6-acre property is used for potable public water wells and is occupied by a pump house.  Algonquin has met with representatives of the Cromwell Fire District to determine the location of public water supply wells on the property and to discuss the protection of aboveground supply valves within the proposed Project workspace. Algonquin has committed to continue coordinating with the Fire District to ensure the protection of well valves on the property. Project construction and operation would not impact the function of this facility. Mohegan Tribe of Indians Property This property owned by the Mohegan Tribe of Indians is located in the Town of Montville. The E-1 System Lateral Loop would cross the property on existing right-of-way for a total of about 750 feet (at approximate MP 1.1). This land is held in trust by the Mohegan Tribal Nation and is not classified as Sovereign land. The portion of the property that would be crossed by the Project is forested and undeveloped. Algonquin would expand its existing 30-foot-wide permanent easement by an additional 20 feet to accommodate the new 12-inch diameter pipeline. Algonquin met with representatives of the Mohegan Tribe regarding the proposed Project in June 2013. According to Algonquin, the representatives did not express any concerns about the Project. The expanded permanent easement would permanently impact about 0.3 acre of forest/woodland on the property. Impacts on areas outside the new permanent easement would be temporary, and these areas would be allowed to return to their preconstruction condition. Algonquin has committed to continuing discussions with the tribe to discuss the additional permanent easement and temporary workspaces that would be needed forthe Project. 4-166 The State of Connecticut has proposed a new bike trail about 120 feet (at nearest) to the east of the existing Farmington M&R Station. Algonquin has reduced its proposed workspace to avoid conflict with the construction of the bike trail. The Town of Farmington has agreed to install a driveway apron to provide access for Algonquin across the bike trail. Therefore, there would be no impact on the development ofthis trail. Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley NationalHeritage Corridor is located in northeastern Connecticut and portions of Massachusetts. It is an area known for its rural character with rolling hills, farmland, and classic New England scenery. The corridor contains some of the largest unbroken forests in southern New England.  In 1994, Congress designated the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley as a national heritage corridor to recognize the valley’s unique natural and historical qualities and because it is one of the last remaining stretches of green in the Boston to Washington, D.C. heavily urbanized corridor (NPS, 2014b; Connecticut General Assembly, 2000). In 1999, Congress enlarged the corridor to include Quinebaug and Shetucket River Valley towns in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, now numbering 35 in all. The corridor is spread over 695,000 acres. The valley encompasses two scenic rivers, 80 ponds and lakes, more than 130 miles of hiking trails, and habitat for several different species of animals. The region has some 43 historic towns, 118 historic sites, and museums and several neighborhoods that preserve historic structures. Walking and hiking are two of the most popular recreation activities in the park. Although the corridor is a federally designated national heritage corridor, the federal government does not own or manage any of the associated lands. The NPS indicated that the Last Green Valley, a local non-profit stewardship organization, should be contacted for all comments and questions regarding the corridor. Algonquin contacted The Last Green Valley to provide Project materials in April 2014, and The Last Green Valley is currently reviewing the Project. In Connecticut, the proposed Project facilities would be located within several municipalities that are included in this corridor, including the City of Norwich, the Town of Chaplin, the Town of Pomfret, the Town of Putnam, and the Town of Windham, where aboveground facilities would located. The facilities would all be located on private land, and with the exception of the new Oakland Heights M&R Station, they are all preexisting facilities. Modifications at the existing facilities would be consistent with the existing visual character and would not impact the aesthetic character of the corridor. Operation of the new Oakland Heights M&R Station would newlyencumber about 1.4 acres of forest/woodland within the corridor, resulting in a minor, but permanent, impact on the visual character at that location. None of the Project facilities would be located in any portions of the corridor designated for public recreational use;therefore, construction and operation of the Project would not impact recreational use of the corridor. 4.8.5.3 Massachusetts Norfolk Golf Club The Norfolk Golf Club is a private, nine-hole golf club. The West Roxbury Lateral would cross the Norfolk Golf Club property, including a portion of the golf course, between East Street and Canton Street from about MPs 0.0 to 0.1. Based on consultation with club representatives, Algonquin modified the proposed pipeline alignment across the property in order to impact less playable golf course area and to avoid an existing tee box (see section 3.5.2.2). Algonquin has also committed to completing construction on the club property during the fall or winter months, in order to minimize impacts on use of the facilities by the club’s membership. After construction, the property would be restored to its 4-167 preexisting use and no permanent impacts would occur. Golf course features would be restored by the following season. Therefore, we conclude that impacts on the Norfolk Golf Club would be sufficiently minimized.  Gonzalez Field Gonzalez Field is a public athletic field located in the Town of Dedham at the intersection of High Street and East Street, adjacent to the Boston-Providence Highway (Dedham Youth Soccer Association, 2014). This field is owned by the Town of Dedham and is also home to the Dedham Youth Soccer Association. The West Roxbury Lateral would traverse the edge of Gonzalez Field from about MPs 2.4 to 2.5. The proposed pipeline crosses a soccer field located on the property, at the edge of the property nearest to Providence Highway. Algonquin incorporated a route variation to minimize total construction impacts on Gonzalez Field, and to reduce the number of soccer fields disrupted from two to one (see section 3.5.2.2). Additionally, ATWS would be located within the field’s parking lot. Construction of the Project would therefore temporarily disrupt recreational use as well as access and parking at the facility. After the construction period, the property would be restored to its preexisting use and no permanent impacts would occur. Algonquin has discussed potential impacts on the field with Town officials, and the Town Board of Parks and Recreation has granted permission for Algonquin to conduct geotechnical, environmental, and cultural resource investigations within the field. Algonquin has committed to continue consultation with the Board to minimize impacts and discuss possible mitigation requirements. Algonquin has agreed to schedule construction across Gonzalez Field after the conclusion of the Town’s soccer program in the fall, commencing construction in mid-November of 2015. Therefore, although one soccer field would be disrupted during construction, the construction schedule would minimize impacts on recreational useofthe field. Washington-Rochambeau National Historic Trail (Massachusetts Portion) The Washington-Rochambeau NHT is described above (see section 4.8.5.1). In the Town of Dedham, the proposed West RoxburyLateral would be collocated with the NHT along Washington Street from the Dedham Mall northeast to Grove Street (MPs 3.0 to 3.7).  As noted above, the NPS has indicated that they do not have any concerns regarding the proposed Project and the NHT. Algonquin has also consulted with the Town of Dedham Department of Public Works (DPW) to discuss specific construction procedures along Washington Street; the DPW indicated that no additional mitigation related to the NHT would be required.  Because the NHT is collocated with a modern paved road, the Project would not have any impact on the recreational use or aesthetic character of the NHT. Mother Brook Reservation The Mother Brook Reservation contains the riparian corridor surrounding Mother Brook, a historic hand-dug canal. Managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (MADCR), the Mother Brook Reservation’s corridor totals 3.7 miles in length and encompasses a total area of about 47.7 acres. Of this amount, 1.8 miles (15.1 acres) are located in the Town of Dedham.  Originally built in 1639 to divert water from the Charles River to the Neponset River to create hydropower potential for mills, the brook is now used as part of a flood-control system that diverts water from the Charles River to the Neponset River (Mother Brook Arts and Community Center, 2014). Based on a taking made in 1958 for the limited purpose of flood control, the MADCR holds several permanent easements along Mother Brook along the proposed AIM Project alignment which permit the MADCR to access private property “… for the purpose of dredging and otherwise improving Mother Brook so as to 4-168 relieve flood conditions and improve the water quality thereof and to construct, reconstruct and repair such dams and gates as may be required…” (MADCR, 2008). These easements do not allow public access, and the underlying fee interest remains with private landowners.  The West Roxbury Lateral would cross the Mother Brook Reservation along Washington Street between Eastbrook Road and Post Lane in Dedham (MP 3.1). The proposed pipeline would be installed within Washington Street, and would pass above the culvert that carries Mother Brook under Washington Street. Algonquin incorporated a route variation in order to keep the pipeline within Washington Street and pass above Mother Brook (see section 3.5.2.2). Therefore, a crossing of Mother Brook would not be required and there would be no direct impacts on Mother Brook or the Mother Brook Reservation. Because the pipeline would be installed within an existing roadway and because the MADCR’s easement in this area does not allow public access, construction and operation of the Project would not impact any public use of the Mother Brook Reservation. Operation of the Project would not impact the MADCR’s ability to access the reservation and perform flood controlactivities. Brookdale Cemetery Brookdale Cemetery is a non-denominational municipal cemetery located off Washington Street in the Town of Dedham (Town of Dedham, undated). The West Roxbury Lateral would traverse the property boundary along East Street from about MPs 2.8 to 3.1.  The Project would be collocated with East Street in this area, and its operation would not have any impact on the cemetery. During the construction period, pipeline construction along East Street would be visible and audible from the northwestern portion of the cemetery. The cemetery’s main entrance is located on Brookdale Avenue, over 1,000 feet from any Project workspaces, but Project construction could disrupt access to the cemetery for short amounts of time through a secondary entrance gate on East Street.  However, these impacts would be temporary and minor. Mary DraperPlayground The Mary Draper Playground is set back from Washington Street in the West Roxbury section of Boston, and contains a pool, playgrounds, a basketball court, and ball fields (West Roxbury Patch, 2014). The facilities are open year-round. The West Roxbury Lateral would be adjacent to the playground’s entrance from Washington Street near MP 3.6.  The Project would be collocated with Washington Street in this area, and its operation would not have anyimpacton the playground.  The playground field is setbackabout300feetfromthe Washington Street entrance and is screened by several large residential structures; therefore, Project construction along Washington Street would not have any significant visual or noise impact on users of the playground. However, Project construction could temporarily disrupt access to the playground from Washington Street. This disruption would be short in duration, and would not significantly impact access to the playground as another entrance is located on Stimson Street. CentreMarsh The proposed West Roxbury M&R Station is located on a property identified as an Urban Wilds &NaturalArea byCityof Boston’s Open SpacePlan 2008-2014 (CityofBoston,2008). This propertyis listed as “Centre Marsh” (BNAN, 1990). However, the property has been identified as “lost,” which is defined as “Wilds that have been so obliterated or so altered that any small pieces that are left clearly do not do what the original Wilds did for their neighborhood or for the City” (BNAN, 1990). The City of 4-169 Boston’s Open Space Plan 2008-2014, Section 9, Seven-Year Action Plan did not include this site among the plan’s many goals and objectives of evaluating, protecting, or enhancing open space. Algonquin purchased this private property in 2013 forthe proposed West Roxbury M&R Station.  Construction and operation of the West Roxbury M&R Station would permanently convert about 1.0 acre of forest/woodland on this property to industrial use. A strip of woodland would be left intact along Grove Street to mitigate the visual impact of the new M&R station. Because the property is privately owned and has already long been classified as “lost,” construction of the new M&R station would not have any impact on its use or development as an urban wild. West Roxbury Quarry Urban Wild A ring of undeveloped property identified as Urban Wild by the BNAN surrounds the West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry (BNAN, 1990). The quarry is an active, private facility owned by West Roxbury Crushed Stone Company.  The West Roxbury Lateral, along Grove Street from aboutMPs 4.0 to 4.5, would be adjacent to the urban wild property. The Project would be adjacent to the narrow southwestern portion of the ring of urban wild property. The majority of the urban wild acreage is located in the northeastern portion of the ring, on the opposite side of the active quarry. The Project would have no direct impact on the urban wild lands. During the construction period, temporary visual and noise impacts on recreational users of the urban wild could occur but would be minor relative to the existing character of the area, due to the presence of the active quarry, the dense existing residential development in the area, and the fact that only a small, narrow portion ofthe urban wild is adjacent to the Projectarea. We received several comments expressing concern about conflicts between the Project and operations atthe quarry.  Thisis discussed in more detailin section 4.1.4. Roxbury Latin School The Roxbury Latin School is an independent boys’ private day school in the West Roxbury section of Boston, serving about 300 boys in grades seven through twelve (about 100 from the City of Boston, with the remainder commuting from several surrounding parishes and towns through provided bus service). The school is open year-round, hosting several programs during the summer for students. The school’s academic and athletic facilities total about 120 acres. The West Roxbury Lateral would be located about 15 feet from the boundary of the school property along Centre Street at MP 5.1. Although the proposed West Roxbury Lateral would be about 15 feet from the school property, the school’s academic facilities are located about 800 feet southeast of the proposed pipeline at its closest point. The portion of the school property closest to the Project serves as a baseball field. The Project would not have any permanent impact on the school itself. However, users of the baseball field may experience temporary noise and visual impacts during the construction period, although a row of trees at the edge of the field would provide apartialbuffer.  Overall, the impacts would be temporary and minor. St. Theresa of Avila School andParish The St. Theresa of Avila School is a private Catholic school in the West Roxbury section of Boston serving 300 to 400 students age three to eighth grade commuting to the school from several surrounding parishes and towns. The St. Theresa of Avila Parish is located adjacent to the school and faces Centre Street. The West Roxbury Lateral terminates at an interconnection with National Grid’s 4-170 facilities north of the intersection of Centre Street and Spring Street, (about MP 5.1), about 295 feet southwest of the school and parish property. The Project would not have any permanent impact on the school or parish. In response to concerns from stakeholders including St. Theresa Parish, Algonquin incorporated a route revision modifying the proposed location of its interconnection with National Grid’s facilities in order to avoid construction within St. Theresa Avenue (see section 3.5.2.2). Parish representatives have indicated that this modification addresses their concerns regarding impacts on the school and parish. The school and parish may experience some noise and visual impacts during construction at the endpoint of the West Roxbury Lateral, but these impacts would be temporary and minor.  State of Massachusetts Article 97 Land Massachusetts Article 97, approved in 1972 as an amendment to the state constitution, requires that public lands acquired for natural resource purposes not be converted to other uses without consideration of a feasible alternative and replacement with equivalent natural resource land. Algonquin has conducted a review ofpossible Article 97 lands crossed by the West Roxbury Lateral.  Algonquin’s review suggests that Gonzalez Field in the Town of Dedham (see above) is subject to Article 97. Discussions between Algonquin and the Town of Dedham concerning the Town’s ownership interest and the Project’s impact on the field are ongoing.  4.8.6 Hazardous Waste Sites and Polychlorinated Biphenyls 4.8.6.1 Hazardous Waste Sites and Landfills Algonquin contracted with EDR to prepare a corridor database search for the AIM Project and identified 23 sites within 500 feet of the Project, on an individual basis, with potential and/or actual sources of contamination. Several of these sites have the potential to impact soils or groundwater at Project facilities. Section 4.2.1.5 provides summaries of these sites as they pertain to soils, and table 4.3.1-2 provides a summary of these sites as they pertain to groundwater. To-date, Algonquin has determined that field sampling would be required at two locations. The first location is along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment near MP 8.6 (Collins and Jewel site) and the other is along the West Roxbury Lateral Pipeline near MP 2.2. The CTDEEP also identified a concern about encountering contamination at a third site near the Lightolier property (also near MP 8.6 along the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay). We have recommended that Algonquin develop a Field Sampling Plan prior to sampling for contamination at these and any other sites identified prior to construction (see section 4.2.2.6).  Algonquin would implement the protocols in its Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures if contamination is encountered during construction. We find these procedures to be acceptable.  In general, if unanticipated contamination is encountered or suspected during construction, all construction work in the immediate vicinity would be stopped until an appropriate course of action is determined (see section 4.2.2.6). We have reviewed the Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures and find it acceptable. 4.8.6.2 Polychlorinated Biphenyls PCBs are a blend of chemical compounds that were used in a variety of industrial applications until their commercial manufacture was banned by the EPA in 1979. Before then, PCBs were introduced 4-171 into many natural gas transmission lines in the United States through the use of PCB-containing lubricants at compressor station sites and in other operation and maintenance activities. Since 1981, the EPA has worked with pipeline operators to identify and remove PCBs from the nation’s natural gas transmission systems. The Algonquin pipeline system is PCB regulated due to PCB concentrations greater than 50 ppm in recovered pipeline liquids. Based on historical sampling at the existing facilities, concentrations of PCBs could range from Non-Detect to less than 500 ppm. Algonquin’s removal of any existing piping or equipment that has been in contact with natural gas would be completed in accordance with the EPA’s PCB rules and regulations (40 CFR 761). Algonquin’s handling of PCB contaminated pipeline and materials would be performed in accordance with federal and state standard operating procedures (SOP).  Algonquin has developed a SOP for removing, storing, sampling, and disposing of pipe and equipment removed from gas service. “Material removed from gas service” refers to all material that has been in contact with gas flow prior to combustion. Examples of materials that have been in gas service include pipe, valves, separators, meter tubes, and fabricated assemblies. The process of removing pipe and equipment from gas service includes: 1. pigging the pipeline to remove any liquids prior to exhuming the pipe forremoval; 2. additionalinspection for liquids during pipe or equipmentremoval; and 3. cutting and removal of the pipe into sections for handling and transportation.  Liquids may be removed using pigging, draining valves, and equipment and purging methods. Pigging is required prior to removal of pipe and equipment except when pipe or equipment cannot be pigged due to size or configuration. Purging of the line using nitrogen or air may be used to further evacuate the pipeline. Additional inspection of pipe for liquids is conducted during removal of the pipe at low points and water crossings. Any residual liquids found during the inspection process are removed.  All liquids removed from the pipeline system are handled in accordance with company SOPs and in compliance with federalrequirements. Pipe and equipment would be cut into sections no longer than 40 feet in length and secured with end caps for transportation. Pipe and equipment removed from gas service would be transferred from the right-of-way to a storage facility within 48 hours of removal. Wipe sampling of pipe and equipment would be completed prior to disposal in order to determine proper disposal. Results of wipe sampling would be used to classify the pipe and equipment as unrestricted (less than or equal to 10 micrograms [µg] per 100 square centimeters [cm2]), conditional (greater than 10 and less than 100 µg per 100 cm2), or restricted (greater than or equal to 100 µg per cm2). There are no special storage requirements for “unrestricted” material. This material may be sold at Algonquin’s discretion. Algonquin would decontaminate or dispose of “Conditional” and “restricted” material at a Toxic Substances Control Act landfill in accordance with allapplicable federal and state regulations. In the unlikely and unforeseeable event of an inadvertent release of PCBs to the environment, response and remediation would be conducted in accordance with all applicable federal and state regulations. 4-172 4.8.7 Visual Resources 4.8.7.1 Pipeline Facilities Visual resources along the proposed pipeline routes are a function of geology, climate, and historical processes, and include topographic relief, vegetation, water, wildlife, land use, and human uses and development. The majority of the proposed pipeline facilities (about 93 percent) would be installed within or adjacent to existing pipeline, roadway, railway, and/or other utility rights-of-way. As a result, the visual resources along the majority of the Project have been previously affected by pipeline or other operations. Visual impacts associated with the Project construction right-of-way and ATWSs would include the removal of existing vegetation and the exposure of bare soils, as well as earthwork and grading scars associated with heavy equipment tracks, trenching, blasting, and machinery and tool storage.  Other visual effects could result from the removal of large individual trees that have intrinsic aesthetic value; the removal or alteration of vegetation that may currently provide a visual barrier; or landform changes that introduce contrasts in visual scale, spatialcharacteristics, form, line, color, ortexture.  Visual impacts would be greatest where a pipeline route parallels or crosses roads and the pipeline right-of-way may be seen by passing motorists, from residences where vegetation used for visual screening or for ornamental value is removed, and where the pipeline is routed through forested areas. The duration of visual impacts would depend on the type of vegetation that is cleared or altered. The impact of vegetation clearing would be shortest in open areas where the re-establishment of vegetation following construction would be relatively fast (generally less than 5 years).  The impact would be greater in forest land, which would take many years to regenerate. The greatest potential visual impact would result from the removal of large specimen trees, which would take longer than other vegetation to regenerate and would be prevented from re-establishing on the permanent right-of-way. The area crossed by the pipeline facilities is a highly fragmented landscape, comprising mostly a mixture of open land, residential areas, forest/woodland, industrial/commercial development, and agricultural land. Additionally, as discussed above, about 93 percent of the proposed pipeline routes would be located within or adjacent to the existing rights-of-way. These factors would minimize the visual impact of construction. The visual effect of the pipeline would also be mitigated by the HDD crossings, where impacts on visualresources between the HDD entry and exit holes would be avoided. After construction, all disturbed areas would be restored and returned to preconstruction conditions in compliance with federal, state, and local permits; landowner agreements; and Algonquin’s easementrequirements, with the exception of aboveground facility sites. 4.8.7.2 AbovegroundFacilities The modified and new aboveground facilities associated with the AIM Project would be the most visible features and would result in long-term impacts on visual resources. The magnitude of these impacts would depend on a variety of factors such as the existing landscape, the remoteness of the location, and the number of viewpoints from which the facility could be seen. The work at a majority of the aboveground facilities would occur within the property line of existing compressor station or M&R station sites. Only minor, temporary construction disturbance would occur outside the existing fence line for some facilities. Therefore, after the completion of construction, these aboveground facilities would be consistent with the existing visuallandscape. 4-173 New aboveground facilities for the AIM Project wouldinclude three new M&R stations. The proposed Assonet M&R Station would be located adjacent to Algonquin’s existing North Fall River M&R Station, within the same property line on industrial land. Construction of the new Assonet M&R Station would permanently impact an additional 0.1 acre of forest/woodland and an additional 0.1 acre of open land, but this would not significantly alter the visual character of the property becausethe station would be adjacentto the existing North Fall River M&R Station.  The proposed West Roxbury M&R Station would be sited on a wooded property located across the street from an active rock quarry. It would be bounded by residential properties to the north, south, and west and there is a residence immediately adjacent to the proposed facility off of Centre Street. Algonquin would maintain an existing wooded buffer along the entire western portion of the property as well as portions on the north and south sides of the site. Although maintaining a wooded buffer around the M&R station would provide substantive visual screening, the location of the site in a dense residential areacould resultin some visualimpacts. Therefore, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the West Roxbury M&R Station, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of OEP, a detailed site-specific landscaping plan for mitigation of visual impacts at the station. The proposed Oakland Heights M&R Station would be located adjacent to the Oakland Heights residential community. To provide visual screening, Algonquin would maintain a 30-to 50-foot buffer of existing vegetation from the edge of the property line to the M&R station. This vegetative buffer would be left undisturbed by construction with the exception of the station access road. Due to this buffer, no significant visual impacts would be likely from construction and operation ofthis station. In addition, the existing Willimantic M&R Station would be rebuilt on an adjacent new parcel of land. Algonquin has adjusted the proposed workspace for construction of the proposed rebuild of the station to keep an existing 25-foot-wide vegetative buffer intact between the new facility and South Road. By implementing this mitigation measure, no significant visual impacts would be likely fromconstruction and operation ofthis station. A new launcher/receiver and pressure regulating facility would be constructed and operated at MP 12.3 on a parcel within Granite Knolls West. The installation of the launcher/receiver facility on the west side of Stony Street would introduce a new, low profile visual impact in a viewshed otherwise unaffected by aboveground ground structures. The launcher/receiver facility may be visible to passing motorist and pedestrians on or adjacent to Stony Street but would not have a significant impact on the overall visual character of the parks. 4.8.7.3 Pipe and Contractor Ware Yards With the possible exception of minor grading activities and surfacing, soils at the pipe and contractor ware yards would not be disturbed.  As aresult, there would be no permanent impacts on visual resources associated with the use of these yards. The only impacts at yards would be temporary during construction, when trailers, vehicles, pipe, and other construction-related material would be stored at these sites. 4.8.7.4 Access Roads Algonquin proposes to use 28 roads for temporary access to the Project facilities during construction and 8 roads for permanent access to the Project facilities during operation. With one 4-174 exception, the access roads are comprised of existing gravel roads, unimproved dirt roads, paved and gravel driveways, private industrial and commercial roads, paved parking lots, and golf course roads. Seven of these existing roads would require minor improvements, but this would not have a significant impact on visual resources.  After construction, the TARs would be returned to preconstruction conditions unless another arrangement is mutually agreed upon with the landowner. In addition, one new PAR would be constructed running from Algonquin’s existing North Fall River M&R Station to the proposed Assonet M&R Station. The existing station and proposed station would be located adjacent to each other within Algonquin’s existing property line. Because this new PAR would be located within the existing industrial property, it would be consistent with existing land use and would notresult in significant visualimpacts. 4.9 SOCIOECONOMICS The socioeconomic conditions and impacts associated with construction and operation of the pipeline facilities, M&R stations, and existing compressor stations in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts are discussed below. The proposed pipeline facilities would be constructed in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Work at the existing Burrillville Compressor Station in Providence County, Rhode Island does not constitute a new, significant aboveground facility that could result in socioeconomic impacts; therefore, the potential impacts on existing socioeconomic conditions in Rhode Island are not evaluated in this section. The AIM Project includes about 37.4 miles of replacement, loop, lateral, and new natural gas pipeline facilities that would cross three counties in New York, four counties in Connecticut, and two counties in Massachusetts. The six compressor stations to be modified resulting in the addition of 81,620 hp would be located in Rockland and Putnam Counties, New York; Middlesex and Windham Counties, Connecticut; and Providence County, Rhode Island; however, because the work at these stations would require minimal site disturbance within Algonquin’s station property lines and a limited construction workforce, the potential impacts on existing socioeconomic conditions at these existing stations are not evaluated further in this section. Likewise, the AIM Project would include modifications to 24 existing M&R stations in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but because these modifications would occur within or directly adjacent to existing Algonquin M&R stations, they do not constitute significant aboveground facilities and thus the potential impacts on existing socioeconomic conditions are not evaluated further at these stations. Additionally, three new M&R stations would be constructed in New London, Connecticut and Bristol and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts; and the removal of one M&R station in New London Connecticut. The socioeconomic impact area analyzed encompasses an estimated maximum distance of 20 miles for workers to travel each way to and from the construction sites within the following counties:  Rockland County, New York;  Westchester County, New York;  Putnam County, New York;  Fairfield County, Connecticut;  Middlesex County, Connecticut;  Hartford County, Connecticut;  New London County, Connecticut;  Norfolk County, Massachusetts;  Suffolk County, Massachusetts;and  Bristol County, Massachusetts. 4-175 Approximately 93 percent of the 37.4 miles of pipeline facilities would be within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way, consisting of Algonquin’s pipeline rights-of-way, public roadways, railways, and/or other utility rights-of-way. The potential socioeconomic effects of the Project include population effects associated with the influx of construction workers and the impact of these workers on public services and temporary housing during construction. Other potential socioeconomic effects include traffic impacts due to in-street construction; increased vehicle traffic necessary to move materials, equipment, and workers to and from the right-of-way; as well as increased property tax revenue, job opportunities, and income associated withlocal construction employment. 4.9.1 Population and Employment Table 4.9.1-1 provides a summary of selected demographic and socioeconomic conditions for the communities that would be affected by the AIM Project in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. The major occupations throughout the Project area are in education, health, and social services; professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste management; retail; manufacturing; financeand insurance; and real estate and rentaland leasing. The population of the potentially affected counties in New York from Project construction range from approximately 99,710 to 949,113 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010a). One metropolitan area4, the New York–Jersey City–White Plains Metropolitan Division, is located within the Project area, which includes all of Rockland and Westchester Counties. The AIM Project pipeline would pass through two communities in Rockland County (the Town of Haverstraw [including the Village of Pomona] and the Town of Stony Point [including the Hamlet of Tomkins Cove]) and four communities in Westchester County (the Town of Cortlandt [including the Hamlet of Verplanck and the Village of Buchanan], the City of Peekskill, and the Town of Yorktown). Population densities vary from approximately 433 to 2,205 people per square mile (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010a), and the county-level civilian workforces range from 65.6 to 68.4 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Based on 2011 data, the per capita incomes in Rockland, Putnam, and Westchester Counties are about $3,187, $7,950, and $16,510 higher, respectively, than the state average of $31,796. Unemployment rates within the potentially affected New York counties range from 5.7 to 6.2 percent (based on July 2013 for county data and August 2013 for state data). In Connecticut, the populations in the potentially affected counties from Project construction range from approximately 165,676 to 916,829 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010a). Three metropolitan areas are located within the Project Area: the Norwich-New London-Westerly Metro Area, the Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford Metro Areas, and the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk Metro Area. Population densities vary from approximately 412 to 1,467 people per square mile (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010a), and the county-level civilian workforces range from 65.3 to 68.8 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Based on 2011 data, the per capita incomes in Middlesex and Fairfield Counties are about $1,720 and $11,295 higher, respectively, than the state average of $37,627. However, per capita incomes in New London and Hartford Counties are between $4,149 and $3,636 less than the Connecticut state average. Unemployment rates within the potentially affected Connecticut counties range from 7.0 to 8.8 percent (based on July 2013 forcounty data and August 2013 for state data). 4 A metropolitan or metroareacontains a coreurban areaof50,000or moreinpopulation,and amicroareacontains anurban core of at least 10,000 (but less than 50,000) population. Each metro or micro area consists of one or more counties and includes the counties containing the core urban area, as well as any adjacent counties that have a high degree of social and economic integration (as measured by commuting to work) with the urban core (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b, available online at http://www.census.gov/population/metro/). 4-176 TABLE 4.9.1-1 Existing Economic Conditions by Geographic Area for the AIM Project  Population Unemployment Density Rate Civilian Population (Persons/sq.

One metropolitan area, the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy Metro Area is located within the Project area. It includes the Town of Westwood, the Town of Dedham, and the neighborhood of West Roxbury (City of Boston), where the AIM Project pipeline facilities are proposed to be located. Population densities vary from approximately 991 to 12,416 people per square mile (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010a), and the county-level civilian workforces range from 67.6 to 69.0 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Based on 2011 data, the per capita income for Norfolk County is about $8,634 higher than the state average of $35,051. However, per capita incomes in Bristol and Suffolk Counties are between $6,369 and $3,017 less than the 4-177 Construction of the AIM Project would temporarily increase the population in the general vicinity of the Project. Table 4.9.1-2 lists the size of the estimated construction workforce for the AIM Project. The highest concentration of workers for the Project would occur from the spring of 2015 and continue until August of 2016. Workforce numbers during this period would range from a low of about 10 workers to a high of about 899 workers and includes preparation and start-up efforts for construction of the pipeline, as well as peak construction at the three new M&R station sites. Peak construction workforce is expected to total about 2,693 workers across all Project components (see table 4.9.1-2).  Once the pipeline and the M&R stations are completed, the workforce numbers would decrease substantially. Construction at each Project location would last approximately 1 to 12 months. The number of personnel required at each proposed activity location would vary greatly, depending on the activity (i.e., HDD crossings, etc.). If a larger than anticipated percentage of non-local workers is required to meet peak workforce requirements, sufficient workers should be available in the labor pool in the surrounding counties and states. Algonquin anticipates hiringa substantial number of local construction workers with the requisite experience for the installation of the natural gas facilities. These local hires would include surveyors, welders, equipment operators, and general laborers. About 15 to 76 percent of the construction workers are expected to be local hires depending on the facility. The local supply of construction workers needed for the AIM Project would be derived from workers employed in the construction industry in the affected counties of New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts including those employed in the large metro areas identified earlier. As shown in table 4.9.1-3, the New-York-Jersey City-White Plains Metro Area has the highest population and potential workforce of 19,567,410 people. The Norwich–New London Metro Area, with a potential workforce of only 274,055 people, is also well above the maximum number of workers needed for the Project. Construction personnel that may be hired from outside these areas include supervisory personnel and inspectors. These individuals are anticipated to temporarily relocate to the Project vicinity during construction.  Project-area population impacts would be temporary and proportionally small. The total population change would equal the total number of non-local construction workers plus any family members accompanying them. Given the brief construction period and in our experience, most non-local workers would not be expected to be accompanied by their families. Based on the county populations within the Project area, the additional people that might temporarily relocate to the area would not result in a significant change. Additionally, this temporary increase in population would be distributed throughout the proposed facilities and would not have a permanent impact on the population. A brief decrease in the unemployment rate could occur as a result of hiring local workers for construction and increased demands on the local economy. Algonquin would add three full-time permanent workers for operation of the proposed and modified facilities. This small number would have a negligible impact on the population and employment in the project area. 4-178 TABLE 4.9.1-2 Summary of the Average and Peak Construction Workforce by Facility for the AIM Project  Length Average Facility (miles) Year Workforce  Peak Workforce  PIPELINE FACILITIES Replacement Pipeline Mainline Take-up and Relay a 20.1 2016 124 b Hudson River HDD 2.1 2015 15 Interstate 84/Still River HDD 0.7 2015 17 E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay 9.1 2015 18 Loop Extension Line-36A Loop Extension 2.0 2015 12 E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension 1.3 2015 66 New Pipeline West Roxbury Lateral 5.1 2015/2016 15 ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES Existing Compressor Station Modifications Stony Point Compressor Station c NA 2016 5 Southeast Compressor Station NA 2016 11 Oxford Compressor Stations NA 2016 4 Cromwell Compressor Station NA 2015 12 Chaplin Compressor Station NA 2015 5 Burrillville Compressor Station NA 2015 8 Existing M&R Station Modifications Stony Point M&R Station NA 2016 0 Peekskill M&R Station NA 2015 3 Cortlandt M&R Station NA 2016 5 West Danbury M&R Station NA 2016 2 Southbury M&R Station NA 2015 3 Waterbury M&R Station NA 2016 10 North Haven M&R Station NA 2016 10 Guilford M&R Station NA 2015 1 Farmington M&R Station NA 2016 1 Glastonbury M&R Station NA 2015 4 Middletown M&R Station NA 2015 5 Salem Pike M&R Station NA 2015 1 Montville M&R Station NA 2015 2 Willimantic M&R Station NA 2015 1 Pomfret M&R Station NA 2016 6 Putnam M&R Station NA 2016 6 North Fall River M&R Station NA 2016 3 New Bedford M&R Station NA 2016 5 Middleborough M&R Station NA 2015 1 Brockton M&R Station NA 2015 4 Norwood M&R Station NA 2015 5 Needham M&R Station NA 2016 6 Wellesley M&R Station NA 2015 6 Mystic M&R Station NA 2015 6  899 178 86 158 201 133 162 76 76 14 76 38 76 0 13 10 11 11 10 10 10 11 11 10 11 10 12 11 11 11 10 11 13 10 11 11 11  4-179 TABLE 4.9.1-2 (cont’d) Summary of the Average and Peak Construction Workforce by Facility for the AIM Project  Length Average Peak Facility (miles) Year Workforce Workforce  New M&R Stations Oakland Heights M&R Station NA 2016 4 11 Assonet M&R Station NA 2015 4 11 West Roxbury M&R Station NA 2016 4 11 Existing M&R Station Removal Greenville M&R Station NA 2016 1 10 TOTALS 421 2,693 ____________________ a Includes the Haverstraw to Stony Point, Stony Point to Yorktown, and Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segments. b Includes the 0.7-mile HDD and the surrounding areas not adjacent to Algonquin’s existing right-of-way. c Construction workforce is shown in the mainline take-up and relay.  TABLE 4.9.1-3 Population Changes for the Five Metro Areas Within the Vicinity of the AIM Project  Population Metro Area April 1, 2000 April 1, 2010 Percent Change  New York-Jersey City–White Plains, NY 18,944,519 19,567,410 +3.3 Norwich-New London, CT 259,088 274,055 +5.8 Hartford-West Hartford-East Hartford, CT 1,148,618 1,212,381 +5.6 Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk, CT 882,566 916,829 +3.9 Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA 4,391,344 4,552,402 +3.7 ____________________ Source: U.S. Census. 2010b.

In 2012, the number of vacant housing units across the 10 potentially affected counties in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts ranged from a high of 27,762 units in Suffolk County, Massachusetts to a low of 3,075 vacant units in Westchester County, New York. Rental vacancy rates in these same counties varied from 7.8 percent in Fairfield County to 4.1 percent in Westchester County. Temporary housing availability varies geographically within the counties near the proposed Project facilities. Temporary housing is available in the form of daily, weekly, or monthly rentals in hotels and motels. In addition to vacant housing, there are about 1,200 hotels/motels and 76 campgrounds/ recreational vehicle parks in the Project area. Connecticut has the highest number of hotels/motels and campgrounds/recreational vehicle parks at a combined total of 572 compared to New York with a combined total of 190. Suffolk County in Massachusetts has the highest number of hotels/motels of 308 compared to Westchester County in New York with a low of 14.  4-180 TABLE 4.9.2-1 Housing Statistics by County in the Vicinity of the AIM Project  Number of Rental Campgrounds/ Vacant Vacancy Rate Number of Recreational Vehicle b State, County Housing Units a (percent) a Hotels/Motels Parks c, d  New York Rockland County 5,286 5.3 40 29 Putnam County 23,845 5.3 99 8 Westchester County 3,075 4.1 14 0 Total 32,206 4.9 153 37 Connecticut Fairfield County 27,734 7.8 155 1 Middlesex County 7,682 5.5 45 17 a Hartford County 24,842 7.3 178 1 New London County 13,451 6.0 159 16 Total 73,709 6.9 537 35 Massachusetts Norfolk County 13,399 4.9 105 2 Suffolk County 27,762 5.2 308 1 Bristol County 19,489 6.5 95 1 Total 60,650 5.5 508 4 a U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a.

Available online at http://www.rv-clubs.us/. d Some campgrounds and/or parks contained over 100 sites available for lodging purposes.  Construction of the AIM Project could temporarily decrease the availability of housing in the Project area; however, the Project could have a short-term positive impact on the area’s rental industry through increased demand and higher rates of occupancy. Thus, no significant impacts on the local housing market are expected. Assuming that the local construction workers do not require housing, a range of between 592 and 2,096 housing units5 for non-local workers may be required during peak construction activities. Given the vacancy rates (4.1 percent to 7.8 percent) and the high number of vacant housing units in the counties that would be affected by the Project (32,206 in New York, 73,709 in Connecticut, and 60,650 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), construction crews should not encounter difficulty in finding temporary housing. In addition, we conclude that the three new operational workers would not have a significantimpact on housing availability in the area. As provided in section 4.9.1, the peak construction workforce is expected to total about 2,693 workers of which between 15 and 76percent are expected tobelocal hires orbetween 85 and 24percent ofnon-local workers. 4-181 4.9.3 Public Services A wide range of public services and facilities are also offered in the AIM Project area. Services and facilities include hospitals, full-service law enforcement, career and volunteer fire departments, and schools.  Sheriffs also serve each county, except those in Connecticut, which are served by State Marshals and Judicial Marshals. Table 4.9.3-1 provides an overview of select public services available by county in the vicinity of the Project area. There are a number of police departments and fire departments or districts within 0.5 mile of the proposed Project route, including Buchanan Village Police Department (New York), Buchanan Fire Department (New York), Verplanck Fire District (New York), Cromwell Fire Department (Connecticut), Lebanon Police Department (Connecticut), Lebanon Fire Department (Connecticut), Town of Dedham Police Department (Massachusetts), and Dedham Fire Department (Massachusetts). Based on the number of police (186) and fire stations (677), public schools (1,639), and hospitals (57), there appears to be adequate public service infrastructure in the vicinity of the AIM Project to accommodate the temporary needs of the non-localconstruction workers and their families. In the event of an on-the-job accident, Algonquin’s contractors could require police, fire, and/or medical services, depending on the type of emergency; however, the anticipated demand for these services would not exceed the existing capabilities of the emergency service infrastructure in the Project area. Short-term, temporary impacts on certain other public services are possible, which would include the need for localized police assistance or certified flaggers to control traffic flow during construction activities. Additional discussion of traffic and public service assistance necessary to support traffic controlis provided in section 4.9.5. Table 4.9.3-2 provides the names of schools within 0.5 mile of the Project pipeline right-of-way. Based on the number and size of these schools, there appears to be adequate education infrastructure in the vicinity of the Project to accommodate any temporary educational needs for the number of non-local construction workers and their families. In summary, there are ample public services available in the area to meet the needs of the AIM Project. Therefore, we do not believe any long-term impacts would result from construction of the Project. We received comments about the safety of installing a high-pressure pipeline in urban or developed setting in close proximity to facilities such as schools. As further discussed in section 4.12.1, Algonquin would construct, operate, maintain, and inspect the proposed facilities to meet or exceed PHMSA’s safetyrequirements.  We received several comments on the draft EIS regarding emergency response capabilities in the Project area. Algonquin currently operates existing pipeline facilities in all of the municipalities where the proposed Project facilities are to be located. According to Algonquin, there have been no issues regarding payment for training or equipment identified in the past 60 years. Algonquin pays property taxes on all of its facilities and presumably these funds are available to assist with local resource needs. Furthermore, Algonquin offers to provide training with municipalities every 3 years and, if requested, is available to provide more frequent training or a specific class related to the Project. We find these measures acceptable. Additional discussion on the safety measures that would be implemented for the Project is provided in section 4.12. 4-182 TABLE 4.9.3-1 Public Service Infrastructure for the AIM Project  Number of Fire Number of Number of Number of Stations (by active Police Public Number of Hospital b d, e, f d, e, f, g State, County firefighter type) a Departments Schools c Hospitals Beds  New York Rockland County 46 (0 career/ 10 70 4 1,018 1,944 volunteer) Putnam County 129 (1,276 44 263 15 4,601 career/4,290 volunteer) Westchester County 20 (0 career/ 6 22 1 298 904 volunteer) Connecticuth Fairfield County 97 (1,211 career/ 24 252 6 4,558 1,527 volunteer) Middlesex County 29 (104 career/864 7 60 1 230 volunteer) Hartford County 125 (1,069 27 342 8 2,649 career/1,580 volunteer) New London County 61 (369 career/ 13 105 2 425 1,330 volunteer) Commonwealth of Massachusetts Norfolk County 61 (1,257 career/ 30 190 4 600 6 volunteer) i Suffolk County 45 (1,817 career/ 5 190 12 4,099 0 volunteer) Bristol County 64 (941 career/ 20 145 4 1,310 124 volunteer) __________________________ Sources: a U.S. Fire Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 2013.

Available online at http://www.publicschoolreview.com/; Western Connecticut State University statistics, available online at https://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures.asp.  4.9.4 Public Utilities and Related Infrastructure The pipeline would cross a number of buried utilities and would be constructed within roadways that include existing buried utilities such as sewer and water lines within the road easement. Prior to construction, Algonquin would identify and locate existing utility lines and other sensitive resources identified in easement agreements or by federal and state agencies to prevent accidental damage during construction. Algonquin’s contractors would contactthe “CallBefore YouDig” or“OneCall” system, or state or local utility operators, to verify and mark all utilities along the Project workspace areas to minimize the potential for damage to other buried facilities in the area. If there is a question as to the location of a utility, such as a water, cable, gas, or sewer line, Algonquin would verify the vertical and horizontal location of the existing infrastructure using field instrumentation and test pits prior to installation of the pipeline. Where the proposed pipeline crosses under an existing utility line, the utility line would be temporarily supported as required. After the pipeline is installed, the backfill would be compacted properly to prevent settling. If concerns are raised regarding utility damage, a post-construction inspection would also be performed to clarify damages. Algonquin would be responsible for the repair/replacement of any damaged existing sewer or water infrastructure to the satisfaction of the city/utility owner and to ensure the impacts on residences or businesses as a result of any such damage are minimized. Algonquin would comply with appropriate federal, state, and local requirements intended to protect existing utilities that are crossed by the pipeline, which is consistent with the terms and conditions 4-184 of the FERC Certificate if the Project is approved. These measures would minimize potential impacts on water, sewer, and other utilities. Specific details regarding individual crossings would be provided by Algonquin to the appropriate municipal permitting agencies prior to construction. We received comments regarding the potential effect of Project construction on subsurface systems.  A subsurface drain or drainage is any artificial system of pipes or conduits designed to intercept, collect, and convey excess soil moisture to a suitable outlet. These may include clay and concrete tile, vitrified sewer tile, corrugated plastic tubing, and stone drains. Following construction, Algonquin would repair and/or replace any damaged subsurface drainage systems that were affected during Project implementation. No impacts on existing utilities and related infrastructure are anticipated during operation of the proposed facilitiesand only short-term, temporary impacts would result from construction activities.  4.9.5 Transportation and Traffic The local road and highway system in the vicinity of the proposed Project facilities is readily accessible by interstate highways, U.S. highways, state highways, secondary state highways, county roads, and private roads. The Project may temporarily impact transportation and traffic during construction across and within roadways and railroads and due to increased vehicle traffic associated with the commuting of the construction workforce to the Project area and the movement of construction vehicles and delivery of equipment and materials to the construction work area. However, no long-term impacts are anticipated. To the extent feasible, existing public and private road crossings along the AIM Project routes would be used as the primary means of accessing rights-of-ways. In addition to the existing access available by the use of public roads, Algonquin would use 35 existing roads for temporary or permanent access during Project construction. Of this total, 15 access roads would be in New York, 16 access roads in Connecticut, and four access roads in Massachusetts (see section 2.2.4).  Access to the Project area is also served by other means of transportation such as commuter rail systems and buses.  As noted earlier, construction activitieswouldbe located in or near large metropolitan areas that have sufficient transportation infrastructure. For instance, in New York, the Project area is serviced by several lines and stops along the Metro North Railroad system (Metropolitan Transportation Authority, 2013). In Connecticut, there are 50 rail stations providing easy access to the Project area (CTrides, 2013a) and 8 state-owned bus divisions servingdifferent areas of the state (Connecticut Transit, 2013b). In Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority commuter rail system provides over 20 transit lines with direct access to the Project area (Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority, 2013). The Project area also provides convenient (free) park and ride areas in numerous areas along the major expressway and highway systems for commuters. Table F-1 in appendix F provides the milepost as well as the crossing method for each of the road and railroad crossings associated with the Project. In addition to road and railroad crossings, portions of the West Roxbury Lateral in Massachusetts would be installed within roadways using in-street construction methods. Road and railroad crossings and in-street construction are discussed in more detail below.  4-185 4.9.5.1 Roadway and Railroad Crossings The AIM Project would require 100 public road crossings and 5 railroad crossings (see table F-1 in appendix F). The crossings would be accomplished using one of several possible methods. Railroads would be bored or crossed using the HDD method and roads would either be bored, cased, hammered, or open-cut.  A summary of each ofthese crossing techniques is provided in section 2.3.1.  The use ofboring and hammeringtechniqueswould avoid road and railsurface impacts, but the use of the open-cut crossing method would not. Road crossing permits would be obtained from applicable federal, state, and local agencies. These permits would dictate the specific requirements for the day-to-day construction activities at each crossing, and the restoration and repair ofthe areas after construction. The open-cut crossing method would primarily be used to cross driveways, parking lots, and roads with low traffic densities. The first step for an open-cut crossing would be to install traffic control devices. Traffic would be detoured around the open trench during the installation process. The pipeline crossing would be installed one lane at a time and, as the pipe is installed, successive lanes would alternately be taken out of service until the crossing is completed. Another option that may be used would be to temporarily close a portion of the road and detour traffic around the work area onto an adjacent roadway. In response to public scoping comments, Algonquin retained traffic management consultants to provide traffic engineering consulting services in support of the AIM Project facilities, particularly in Massachusetts and New York. Algonquin has committed to consulting with each municipality along the Project to address potential traffic-related impacts associated with constructing the Project. Algonquin has also prepared separate traffic management plans for the West Roxbury Lateral and pipeline segments in New York (see appendix G). Since issuance of the draft EIS for the Project, Algonquin has updated its traffic management plan for the West Roxbury Lateral, which is discussed in section 4.9.5.2. The Traffic Management Plan for the New York Pipeline Segments includes a summary of roadways where Project construction would take place and information regarding general traffic management strategies.  The locations and crossing methods of the proposed pipeline installations in New York are summarized in table F-1 in appendix F. All of the roads to be crossed during construction are paved.  The general traffic management plans for the roadways affected by pipeline construction in New York are provided in appendix G. These detailed plans contain temporary traffic control (TTC) devices for:  short-6 or intermediate-term7 stationary lane closures on two-lane, two-way roadways (TTCno. 1);  short-or intermediate-term single lane closures for an undivided, multi-lane highway (TTCno. 2);  double interior laneclosures for a multi-lane highway (TTC no. 3); 6 Short-term stationary closure: daytime work that occupies a location for more than 1 hour within a single daylight period (NYSDOT, 2014). 7 Intermediate-term stationary closure: work that occupies a location more than one daylight period up to 3 consecutive days, or nighttime work lasting more than 1 hour (NYSDOT, 2014). 4-186  short-or intermediate-term sidewalk detour on a two-lane, two-way roadway (TTC no. 4);  road closure with off-site detour on two-lane, two-way roadways (TTC no. 5); and  work beyond the shoulder at a construction entrance (TTC no. 6). The TTC typical detail(s) to be implemented for the crossing of a proposed roadway are also specified and provided in appendix G. We have reviewed the Traffic Management Plan for the New York Pipeline Segments and find it to be acceptable; however, several of the road crossings listed in the plan were identified as needing further site-specific details (i.e., Zachary Taylor Street, Gate Hill Road (Highway 210), Bleakley Avenue, Route 9A, Montrose Station Road, Maple Avenue, and Cordwood Road). Therefore, we recommend that:  Prior to construction in New York, Algonquin should file with the Secretary, for review and written approval of the Director of OEP, a revised Traffic Management Plan for the New York pipeline segments that includes the site-specific details for the crossings of Zachary Taylor Street, Gate Hill Road (Highway 210), Bleakley Avenue, Route 9A, Montrose Station Road, Maple Avenue, and Cordwood Road. 4.9.5.2 In-street Construction In addition to road crossings, portions of the West Roxbury Lateral would be constructed within or along existing roadways. A detailed description of the in-street construction method is provided in section 2.3.1.2. In-street construction would affect traffic in the Project area and could also effect on-street parking and use of sidewalks adjacent to the roadway. Since issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin has reduced the length of the West Roxbury Lateral from 5.1 miles to 4.9 miles, a reduction of about 1,395 linear feet. The modifications result in a 2.9-acre reduction in the overall workspace area required to construct the West Roxbury Lateral. Additionally, Algonquin has submitted other minor pipeline and workspace adjustments along the West Roxbury Lateral route as a result of further consultation with landowners, stakeholders, and agencies to minimize potential impacts on traffic flow patterns (see sections 3.5.2 and 3.5.3). Algonquin has committed to consulting with each municipality along the Project corridor to address potential traffic-related impacts associated with constructing the Project. Road crossing permits would be obtained from applicable federal, state, and local agencies, including the City of Boston and the Town of Dedham before conducting work in these roadways. As discussed above, Algonquin has updated its traffic management plan forthe West Roxbury Lateral (see appendix G). The Updated Traffic Management Assessment and Plans for the West Roxbury Lateral includes the following information to help assess the potential impacts of the Project along this pipeline segment:  current level-of-service (LOS) and projected change in LOS during construction;  duration of construction, time of year, number of days per week, and time of day for each segment;  the severity and duration of potential traffic and business interruptions or delays at different times of the year and at different times of the day during peak periods and hours;  turning movement counts at key intersections for peak commuting hours and peak shopping hours;  location of lane closures, including the parking lane, and other available parking areas during site-specific closures; and  the specific mitigationmeasures to be implemented to alleviate traffic congestion in these areas during construction. 4-187 The plan includes detailed traffic counts at key locations along the Project corridor where construction would occur, as well as existing traffic conditions and general traffic management strategies. It also includes measures to address motor vehicles, includingparking, and considerations for pedestrians, bicycles, and construction workers. Because some of the preliminary traffic count data for this area was outdated, Algonquin hired a traffic engineering consultant to conduct Automatic Traffic Recorder counts for a 72-hour period along the following study area roadways in May 2014:  Elm Street Dedham– between Providence Highway and Legacy Place driveway;  Providence Highway Dedham – between Legacy Boulevard signal and Best Buy/Star signal;  East Street Dedham– north of High Street;  High Street Dedham– eastof East Street;  Washington Street Dedham– between Lower East Street and Oak Street;  Grove Street West Roxbury – south of Centre Street; and  Centre Street West Roxbury– south of Spring Street. The data gathered was used to evaluate the LOS for these key study area roadways and intersections under existing conditions and during construction of the pipeline lateral over the course of a typical weekday and on Saturday as presented in table 4.9.5-1. Additionally, manual turning movement counts were also collected during the same timeframe at key signalized study area intersections where traffic flow may be affected by some temporary travel lane closures during daytime construction. Capacity analyses at key signalized intersections where capacity would be reduced on a temporary basis during daytime construction hours (High Street/Harris Street/East Street and Spring Street/Centre Street/Temple Street) are presented in table Q-1 in appendix Q. For comparison purposes, this analysis was conducted for both current conditions and the temporary conditions involving lane closures at intersections that would occur on a phased basis during construction. 4-188 TABLE 4.9.5-1 Observed Traffic Counts at Key Locations Along the AIM Project Corridor in Massachusetts Weekday Hourly Traffic Range Commuter Hours Saturday Hourly Traffic Range a.m. p.m. Location Daily Low High Average Peak Peak Daily Low High Average Dedham Elm Street 6,309 146 640 390 284 640 7,736 120 696 517 (eastbound) Elm Street 8,636 240 698 545 500 661 10,768 181 950 687 (westbound) Total 14,945 386 1,301 936 784 1,301 18,504 301 1,603 1,204 Providence 24,178 1,294 1,735 1,545 1,634 1,735 25,667 646 1,993 1,633 Highway (northbound) Providence 22,542 558 1,790 1,377 1,098 1,789 23,669 579 1,925 1,548 Highway (southbound) Total 46,720 1,992 3,524 2,921 2,732 3,524 49,336 1,225 3,826 3,181 East Street 1,981 67 161 124 141 161 2,298 38 208 152 High Street 16,181 796 1,362 1,101 1,221 1,362 14,522 465 1,089 954 Washington Street 11,358 513 802 692 661 795 11,976 250 926 704 (northbound) Washington Street 9,827 431 766 628 576 766 10,698 388 817 702 (southbound) Total 21,185 944 1,561 1,320 1,237 1,561 22,674 638 1,687 1,405 West Roxbury Grove Street 8,569 402 724 597 682 724 7,266 229 589 478 Centre Street 7,282 331 637 513 577 637 6,219 190 506 400 The recently gathered Automatic Traffic Recorder counts indicate that traffic flow within this study area remains relatively constant throughout the day. For the purposes of this Project, construction hours are expected to be a 12-hour day from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. when allowable by traffic conditions and as permitted by the various agencies and municipalities having control over the affected roadways. Any work that is to occur during peak traffic hours (7:00 to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.) would be coordinated in advance with the MassDOT, Westwood, Dedham, and/or West Roxbury. To prevent unnecessary delays to the motoring public during Project construction, Algonquin would implement the following measures:  Reducing the existing roadway cross-sections by no more than one lane on multi-lane roadways during regular working hours. The majority of the study area would be accomplished using this traffic set-up.  The East Street (Westwood) crossing is expected to occur via underground boring so no traffic management would be required along this roadway.  The proposed boring work at the easterly end of Rustcraft Road may require a single lane closure of the northbound travel lane. Under such a scenario, traffic flow in each direction would need to alternate underthe control ofpolice details at this location.  For the entire length of the Providence Highway (a commercial street), including the Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection, work would occur during evening hours to minimize disruption to traffic flow.  Traffic control devices would be placed to allow for access and egress from the West Roxbury Crushed Stone quarry.  For those areas where sidewalks would need to be closed on a temporary basis, a proposed pedestrian bypass would be provided within the standard details of the traffic management plans. Pedestrian access would be maintained on the same side of the roadway and temporary wheelchair ramps would be provided to ramp the pedestrians from the existing sidewalk to the roadway. The pedestrians would be separated from the travel lanes by drums. If the width is not sufficient to accommodate traffic and pedestrian activity, then pedestrians would be directed to cross to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street or atthe closest adjacent intersection.  Safe and ready means of ingress and egress to all stores and shops; public, private, and professional offices; and any other businesses or residences in the Project area, both day and night, shall be provided for the project duration.  Bicyclists currently share the road within the Project study area because there are not separate bicycle facilities currently in place, so bicycles would be accommodated within normal vehicular traffic.  For the approximately 0.5 mile of work proposed within Grove Street (a residential street), Algonquin would minimize the number of construction workers needing to drive to this area to alleviate the shortage of available on-street parking on Grove Street. 4-189 In addition, corridor work along Washington Street (a residential road) may need to be limited to end prior to 4:00 p.m. as this corridor is near capacity during evening peak periods. The exact work schedule and hours for construction would be discussed and agreed upon with the Town of Dedham and City of Boston throughout Projectcoordination.  As shown in table Q-1 in appendix Q, High Street’s intersection with East Streetand Harris Street (a residential intersection) currently operates acceptably under peak-hour conditions and during a typical weekday midday period under existing conditions. However, the required lane closures at this intersection would result in significant adverse impacts on traffic operations during the course of construction, especially during the weekday midday period. To reduce impacts at this intersection, and at the request of the Town of Dedham, Algonquin would construct during nighttime hours (7:00 p.m. to 5:00a.m.). This would not eliminate all traffic-related impacts, but would reduce the traffic impacts at this location to less than significant levels. However, there are residential properties located in close proximity to this intersection, so while nighttime construction would minimize impacts on traffic, it would increase noise-related impacts on these nearby residences.  Similarly, traffic generally operates acceptably at the Spring Street/Centre Street intersection (a residential intersection) in West Roxbury throughout the day under existing conditions. With the planned pipeline construction route, the northbound Centre Street right-turn lane would need to be blocked off temporarily. This would be limited to only one phase of the four traffic management phases planned for this location. Even so, lengthy delays would occur on the northbound Centre Street approach to this intersection. The analysis also indicates that, with some of the temporary lane closures, there would be longer than normal delays that occur as a result of the lost capacity. These delays should generally be limited to a single intersection approach during a given phase of the traffic management plan. Although temporary, these impacts could be significant. Algonquin would have police details in place to monitor traffic conditions and make adjustments as required. To avoid excessive delays at this location, Algonquin would schedule work in the vicinity of this intersection prior to the late afternoon commuter peak period and would consider performing the work at night if recommended and agreed to by the City 4-190 of Boston. However, there are residential properties located in close proximity to this intersection, so while nighttime construction would minimize impacts on traffic, it would increase noise-related impacts on these nearby residences. For these reasons, we conclude that there would be temporary, but significant, impacts atthis intersection during construction. We received specific comments regarding traffic access impacts and congestion during construction of the West Roxbury Lateral. Legacy Place and National Amusements (collectively, Legacy Place) operates a theatre that is part of the 550,000-square-foot Legacy Place shopping center at Elm Street and Route 1 in Dedham and is concerned that the businesses at Legacy Place would be adversely affected by nearby roadway construction, traffic congestion, and access restrictions during construction of the AIM Project. Since issuance of the draft EIS, the pipeline alignment for the West Roxbury Lateral in the Town of Dedham has been realigned in areas to address some of these concerns (see sections 3.5.2.2 and 3.5.3). Based on the revised alignment of the route and the completion of the geotechnical survey work since the issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin and Legacy Place have also agreed to several construction mitigation measures intended to further minimize the potential impacts on the shopping center.  The following construction conditions were agreed upon between Algonquin and Legacy Place:  Algonquin is no longer proposing to cross the three principal exit and entrance points into Legacy Place (i.e., National Drive, Legacy Boulevard, and Legacy Place Driveway adjacent to LL Bean) and at least one paved lane for each turning movement would be made available at alltimes.  Algonquin is committed to completing the installation of the pipeline within Providence Highway in the nighttime (i.e., 9:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.), which further reduces the potential impacts on Legacy Place and all along Providence Highway due to the significant reduction in traffic volume atnight.  Algonquin is committed to continued coordination with Legacy as well as other abutters in the areathroughout the remainder of the permitting and construction process.  By shifting the pipeline location along Providence Highway, Algonquin is also able to reduce the extent of the temporary construction workspace by approximately 2.5 acres. Legacy Place also requested that additional timing restrictions be put in place during weekends, holidays, and school vacations. These additional restrictions could serve to slow down pipeline construction, thereby increasing the overall amount of time traffic-related impacts associated with the Project would occur.  Weconclude thatthe measures proposed above would adequately minimize impacts on traffic while allowing construction to proceed as efficiently as possible to reduce the overall length of disruptionto traffic patterns.  Therefore, we do not find these additionaltiming restrictions warranted. Algonquin’s traffic management plans continue to be refined pursuant to input from the municipalities. Prior to constructing across town roads, further refinements are expected based on the municipality conditions, which often depend on the time period proposed for construction. Algonquin has indicated that the details of working hours and times and dates of restricted work hours would be developed with local municipalities as part of the road operating permits or other similar approvals. To ensure that the municipalities along the West Roxbury Lateral are aware of the proposed construction schedule, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the West Roxbury Lateral, Algonquin should develop and file with the Secretary a detailed construction schedule for each segment of the lateral that includes the proposed construction timeframes (month, week, days), working hours, and times and dates of any restricted work hours. The detailed 4-191 construction schedule should be shared with each affected municipality. During active in-street construction of the West Roxbury Lateral, the schedule should be updated and provided to the municipalities on a biweekly basis and included in Algonquin’s construction status reports required in condition 8. We conclude that impacts on traffic during construction along the West Roxbury Lateral would result in localized, unavoidable significant adverse impacts, particularly at the Spring Street/Centre Street intersection. However, with the implementation of Algonquin’s Updated Traffic Management Assessment and Plans for the West Roxbury Lateral, including the measures described above, and our additional recommendation, impacts resulting from in-street construction would be minimized to the extent possible and would be reduced to less than significant levels at all other locations along the West Roxbury Lateral.   After construction, Algonquin has committed to repaving the Town of Dedham’s roadways impacted bypipelineconstruction fromcurb-to-curb. No impacts ontraffic would occurduringoperation of the Project. 4.9.6 Project-related Traffic In addition to the direct temporary impacts associated with road crossings and in-street construction, the daily commuting of the construction workforce to the Project area could result in short-term impacts on traffic during Project construction. It is estimated that a maximum of 2,693 workers would be working on the proposed pipeline facilities at any one time. These workers would commute typically6 days a week to and from the construction work area between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., resulting in increased traffic in the Project area at specific times. To minimize traffic congestion, Algonquin would encourage construction workers to share rides or use mass transit to the construction work area. Contractors may also provide buses to move workers from common parking areas to the construction work area. Algonquin would also schedule construction work within roadways and specific crossings to avoid commuter traffic and school buses to the greatest extent practical. Additionally, Algonquin has developed site-specific traffic management plans that would be implemented along the Project corridor (see appendix G). We find the general traffic management principles depicted on these to be acceptable and agreethat they would help to minimize any disruptions to traffic operations in the Projectarea. In addition to the construction workforce, the delivery of construction equipment and materials to the construction work area could temporarily congest existing transportation networks at specific locations. Several construction-related trips would be made each day (to and from the job site) on each spread. This level of traffic would remain consistent throughout the construction period and would typically occur during the early morning hours and evening hours. The route vehicles would take after leaving the construction work area would vary, depending on the location of construction activity. Therefore, materials and equipment could be hauled long distances, resulting in longer drive time. The local public roads in the vicinity of the Project are mostly paved or gravel roads. Construction of the Project could result in short-term impacts along some roads and highways due to the movement and delivery of equipment and materials. Existing public and private road crossings along the proposed pipeline route would be used as the primary means of accessing the right-of-way to the extent feasible. Algonquin propose to use 28 temporary access roads and eight permanent access roads along the pipeline route.  Table 2.2.4-1 identifiesthe locations of new and existing roadsassociated with the AIM Project. Although Algonquin would be using existing roads for temporary and permanent access, seven of these roads would require minor upgrades, so they can be used during pipeline construction. Algonquin would also need to construct new permanent access road from the existing North Fall River M&R Station to the new Assonet M&R Station. No improvements would be made to the 29 other temporary and permanent access. Following construction, these roads would be used to access the right-of-way for 4-192 ongoing operations and maintenance, but these activities would not significantly increase the use of the access roads or the surrounding public roads. Any road damage that might occur due to the operation of construction equipment would be repaired by Algonquin orits contractors after the pipeline is installed. As described in the revised traffic management plan for the West Roxbury Lateral, roadway capacity in certain areas would be impacted on a temporary basis. One-lane closures would be utilized when crossing two lanes or more in a single direction. If a lane needs to be closed at intersections, the work would be conducted during off-peak hours so that traffic flows are not constrained at the study area intersections. Therefore, we find the revised plan for the West Roxbury Lateral to be acceptable and conclude that the traffic measures and practices to be implemented during Project construction would maintain appropriate traffic flow and access to abutting residents and businesses at key locations along the Project corridor in the Towns of Dedham and WestRoxbury, Massachusetts. 4.9.7 Displacementof Residences andBusinesses One residence, located near MP 10.7 along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment, would be displaced as a result of construction and operation of the AIM Project. The residence was constructed in 1959 within Algonquin’s right-of-way. In order to replace the 26-inch-diameter pipeline with a 42-inch-diameter pipeline, while maintaining the same separation distance of 15 feet from the adjacent 30-inch-diameter loop line, the edge of the 42-inch-diameter replacement pipeline would be installed in closeproximityto the residence. Accordingto Algonquin, itwould notbe possible to remove the existing pipeline and excavate the ditch for the 42-inch-diameter pipeline without damage to the residence due to the size of equipment required to complete these tasks. Consequently, Algonquin’s right-of-way agent approached the owners and determined that they were willing to sell the property. A purchase and sale agreement has been agreed to by attorneys for both the buyerand the seller. No businesses would be displaced by the Project. However, impacts on businesses could occur during in-street construction along the West Roxbury Lateral. For example, Legacy Place shopping center has expressed concern that construction of the Project in the roadways adjacent to the shopping center would result in significant impacts on the businesses and stores within the center.  To address these issues, Algonquin has developed a Traffic Management Plan for the West Roxbury Lateral to allow for continued access to businesses and stores during construction, including the Legacy Place shopping center (see section 4.9.5.2). 4.9.8 Property Values We received some comments regarding the potential effect of the Project on property values. Landowners typically have the following concerns regarding potential impacts on property values: devaluation of property if encumbered by a pipeline easement; being the responsible party for property taxes within a pipeline easement; paying potential landowner insurance premiums for Project-related effects; and negative economic effects resulting from changes in land use. As described in section 4.8.2, Algonquin would acquire easements for both the temporary (construction) and permanent rights-of-way where applicable. With the exception of the West Roxbury Lateral, most of the remaining pipeline segments would be installed within Algonquin’s existing right-of-way. Further, the majority of the AIM Project pipeline segments are a replacement of existing pipeline in the same location and would not be encumbered by a new pipeline easement. Also, the majority of the West Roxbury Lateral would be located within streets or public property and, therefore, would not require a pipeline easement on individual properties. Most of the aboveground facilities would be modified within an existing facility owned by Algonquin. Algonquin would compensate the landowners for any new easements, the temporary loss of land use, and any damages. In addition, affected landowners who believe that their property values have been negatively impacted could appeal to the local tax agency for reappraisal and 4-193 In comments on the draft EIS regarding the potential impact on property values from the proposed Project, one commenter requested that the Commission staff expand its analysis on property values to provide quantitative analysis or factual support. Several studies have looked at the effect of pipelines on sales and property values. We acknowledge that most were conducted on behalf of the project developers. However, our analysis did not identify any relevant studies to refute the conclusions presented here. A report by Allen, Williford & Seale, Inc., which was prepared in 2001 for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America Foundation, Inc., evaluated the impact of natural gas pipelines on real estate in four separate and geographically diverse areas, including two suburban areas and two rural areas crossed by one to multiple natural gas pipelines. The study concluded that there was no significant impact on property sales located along natural gas pipelines nor by the pipeline size or the product carried. Additionally, other studies have reached similar conclusions: PGP Valuation Inc. (2008) for Palomar Gas Transmission Inc.; Ecowest (Fruits, 2008) for the Oregon LNG Project; Diskin, Friedman, Peppas, and Peppas (2011); and Hansen et al. (2006). Regarding the potential for insurance premium adjustments associated with pipeline proximity, insurance advisors consulted on other natural gas projects reviewed by the FERC indicated that pipeline infrastructure does not affect homeowner insurance rates (FERC, 2008). As such, we find that homeowners’ insurance rates are unlikely to change due to construction and operation of the proposed Project. Similarly, regarding the potential impacts on mortgage rates associated with pipeline proximity, we are not aware of any practice by mortgage companies to re-categorize properties nor are we aware of federally insured mortgages being revoked based on proximity to pipelines. In relation to the AIM Project, the existing pipelines have been in place for over 50 years, and according to Algonquin, new residences have been built closer to the existing pipelines since the 1950s without property values or mortgage concerns being raised. 4.9.9 Economy and Tax Revenues Construction and operation of the Project would have a beneficial impact on the local economy in terms of increased payroll, local materials purchased, and utilization of local vendors. Table 4.9.9-1 provides the estimated payroll associated with construction of the AIM Project. Payroll taxes would also be collected from the workers employed on the Project. Algonquin anticipates that the total payroll for the Project would be approximately $264,316,027 during the construction phase. Construction payroll would be about $11,075,046 in Rhode Island, $127,228,136 in New York, $89,663,796 in Connecticut, and $36,349,049 in Massachusetts(see table 4.9.9-1). TABLE 4.9.9-1 Socioeconomic Impact Resulting from Construction and Operation of the AIM Project  Construction (Estimated Operation (Estimated State Construction Payroll) Annual Ad Valorem Tax)  New York $127,228,136 $20,070,000 Connecticut $89,663,796 $5,770,000 Massachusetts $36,349,049 $2,360,000a Rhode Island $11,075,046 $970,000 Total $264,316,027 $29,170,000 __________________________ a Includes the annual property taxes for the City of Boston.  4-194 Algonquin estimates that some additional money would be spent locally on the purchase and/or rental of equipment and the purchase of materials and supplies such as stone, sand, concrete, fencing material, and bulk fuel.  These and other items required for construction would be purchased, as available, from vendors within Rockland, Westchester, and Putnam Counties, New York; Fairfield, Middlesex, Hartford, and New London Counties, Connecticut; and Norfolk, Suffolk, and Bristol Counties, Massachusetts. Construction of the AIM Project would also result in increased state and local sales tax revenues associated with the purchase of some construction materials as well as goods and services by the construction workforce. Local communities would benefit from ad valorem taxes, paid annually by Algonquin overthe life of the AIM Project (see table 4.9.9-1). The Project is not expected to have any long-term negative economic impact.  The pipeline would be installed underground and any surface impacts, such as damaged pavement, would be repaired. Once installed, the pipeline would not impede normal surface traffic or access to businesses, and most preconstruction property uses would be allowed. The primary long-term impact of the pipeline would be the restrictions associated with the various permanent right-of-way widths, which would preclude specific uses, such as the installation of permanent aboveground structures, over the pipeline. Business owners would be compensated forthis encumbrance, if applicable.  We received several comments regarding the potential effect of the Project on home heating costs. Research shows that natural gas prices are a function of market supply and demand. The strength of the economy greatly influences natural gasmarkets.  During periods of economic growth, the increased demand for goods and services from the commercial and industrial sectors generates an increase in natural gas demand.  The increased demand can lead to increased production and higher prices.  Declining or weak economic growth tends to have the opposite effect. During cold months, residential, and commercial end users consume natural gas for heating, which places upward pressure on prices as demand increases. Because of limited alternatives for natural gas consumption or production in the near term, even small changes in supply or demand over a short period can result in large price movements that bring supply and demand back into balance. Thus, increases in supply tend to result in lower prices, whereas decreases in supply tend to increase prices (DOE/EIA, 2012). 4.9.10 Environmental Justice Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice recognizes the importance of using the NEPA process to identify and address, as appropriate, any disproportionately high and adverse health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations. Consistent with Executive Order 12898, the CEQ called on federal agencies to actively scrutinize the following issues with respectto environmental justice(CEQ, 1997a):  the racial and economic composition of affected communities;  health-related issues that may amplify project effects on minority or low-income individuals; and  public participation strategies, including community or tribal participation in the process. 4-195 The EPA’s Environmental Justice Policies focus on enhancing opportunities for residents to participate in decision making. The EPA (2011) states that Environmental Justice involves meaningful involvement so that: “(1) potentially affected community residents have an appropriate opportunity to participate in decisions about a proposed activity that will affect their environment and/or health; (2) the public's contributions can influence the regulatory agency's decision; (3) the concerns of all participants involved will be considered in the decision-making process; and (4) the decision-makers seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected.” In accordance with Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice, all public documents, notices, and meetings were made readily available to the public during our review of the Project. Algonquin met with many different stakeholders during the initial development of the route, including local residents and affected landowners. These efforts involved a number of open houses with the affected communities and local authorities. Algonquin also established, and is maintaining, a Project website to share Project information with the public. The applicant also used the FERC’s pre-filing process (see section 1.4). One of the major goals of this process is to increase public awareness and encourage public input regarding every aspect of the project before an application is filed. As part of this process, FERC staff participated in several of Algonquin’s open houses and hosted several scoping meetings to receive input from the public about the Project. The scoping meetings were held in the Town of Cortlandt, New York; Danbury, Connecticut; Norwich, Connecticut; and the Town of Dedham, Massachusetts. FERC staff also participated in site visits to all the proposed pipeline segments. Interested parties have had, and will be given, opportunities to participate in the NEPA review process. To date, this included the opportunity to participate in the public scoping meetings within the Project area to identify concerns and issues that should be covered in the EIS, and the opportunity to submit written comments about the Project to the FERC. Outreach with Indian tribes is described in section 4.10.1. Stakeholders will have the opportunity to review this draft EIS, participate in public meetings, and provide comments directly to the FERC staff in person or in writing.  In its comments on the draft EIS, the EPA recommended some non-traditional communication techniques to improve success in contacting some of the low income and minority communities along the proposed Project route. In response, Algonquin has agreed to prepare fact sheets in Spanish to be posted on the Project website and would prepare notices regarding public meetings and, in the future, notices regarding construction information in Spanish for the identified environmental justice communities. 4.9.10.1 Demographic and Economic Data Environmental Justice Areas or Communities are defined by the EPA as locations that have a “meaningful greater” percentage of minorities than the general population has, or locations in which minorities comprise more than 50 percent of the affected area’s population. The environmental justice communities potentially crossed by the Project’s pipeline facilities were identified using available 2010 census block group statistics regarding ethnicity, median income, and poverty levels. Table 4.9.10-1 provides demographic statistics for the states and counties that would be affected by the Project. Table 4.9.10-2 provides an overview of the general economic status ofthese statesand the counties. 4-196 TABLE 4.9.10-1 Demographic Statistics for Counties Crossed by Project Facilities in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts for the AIM Project  Native Native American Hawaiian and & Hispanic African Alaskan Pacific Other or Latino Total Total White American Native Asian Islander Race Origin Minority a State/County Population (percent) (percent) (percent) (percent) (percent) (percent) (percent) (percent)  New York 19,378,102 65.7 15.9 0.6 7.3 0.0 7.4 17.6 41.7 Rockland 311,687 73.2 11.9 0.3 6.2 0.0 5.8 15.7 34.7 Westchester 949,113 68.1 14.6 0.4 5.4 0.0 8.3 21.8 42.6 Putnam 99,710 90.7 2.4 0.2 1.9 0.0 2.8 11.7 17.1 Connecticut 3,574,097 77.6 10.1 0.3 3.8 0.0 5.6 13.4 28.8 Fairfield 916,829 74.8 10.8 0.3 4.6 0.0 6.8 16.9 33.8 Middlesex 165,676 89.2 4.7 0.2 2.6 0.0 1.3 4.7 13.6 Hartford 894,014 72.4 13.3 0.3 4.2 0.0 7.1 15.3 33.9 New London 274,055 82.2 5.8 0.9 4.2 0.1 3.2 8.5 21.7 Massachusetts 6,547,629 80.4 6.6 0.3 5.3 0.0 5.6 9.6 23.9 Norfolk 670,850 82.3 5.7 0.2 8.6 0.0 1.3 3.3 19.6 Suffolk 722,023 56.0 21.6 0.4 8.2 0.0 9.7 19.9 51.9 __________________________ Source: U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b.

The use ofa 51.1 percent threshold to identify minority populations is within the parameters identified in the EPA Region 2 Interim Environmental Justice Policy, which applies to permits issued by that region, including those in New York. The interim guidance suggests that the minority threshold should be 51.5 percent in urban areas of New York State. The NYSDEC issued guidance for conducting environmental justice analyses for New York State Environmental Quality Review. This guidance establishes a minority community threshold as being equal to or greater than 51.1 percent in an urban area; therefore, this is what was used for this analysis. None of the counties affected by the Project in New York have minority populations greater than the general EPA guideline of 50 percent; therefore, they are also under the EPA Region 2 guidance of 51.5 percent and the NYSDEC guidance of 51.1 percent. However, two census block groups crossed by the Project in Westchester County do have minority8 populations greater than these (EPA and NYSDEC) thresholds:  Census Tract 141, Block Group 4 (Town of Cortlandt, including Buchanan) with a minority population of 57.3 percent; and  Census Tract 141, Block Group 3 (City of Peekskill) with a minority population of 53.9 percent. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would cross these two block groups for about 940 feet out of the total segment length of 12.3 miles (8.8 miles of which is in Westchester County). The crossings would occur on either side of where the pipeline crosses Route 9A (near MP 5.8) and would not be located through neighborhoods. FERC staff participated in a site visit to this and the other pipeline segments in New York and also conducted a public scoping meeting in the Town of Cortlandt. Additionally, Algonquin has met with the officials in the City of Peekskill on at least five occasions to discuss the AIM Project, and all landowners have received information about the Project and were invited to attend information meetings by Algonquin and public meetings by the FERC as required by the NEPA process. The proposed pipeline in this area would replace an existing pipeline within the same right-of-way. None of the census blocks crossed have 23.6 percent or more of the individuals within it living belowthe poverty line. Connecticut None of the counties or census blocks crossed in Connecticut have minority populations greater than the general EPA guideline of 50 percent. However, the State of Connecticut has additional guidelines on what constitutes an environmentaljustice community, which are defined as:  a U.S. census block group, as determined in accordance with the most recent U.S. census, for which 30 percent or more of the population consists of low income persons who are Minority refers to people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic White by itself in the decennial census. 4-198 not institutionalized and have an income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level; or  a distressed municipality (Connecticut Environmental Justice Policy, 2012a,b). The pipeline facilities would not cross any of the 2012 Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development’s List of Distressed Municipalities (Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, 2012); however, a portion of the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment in Danbury (about 1.4 miles or about 30 percent of the total segment length) would be located in a defined census block group (Census Tract 2108, Block Group 3) with 30 percent or more of the population living below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. This census block group is regulated under section 22a–20a of the Connecticut General Statutes (CGS). According to this section of the CGS, the pipeline itself does not qualify as an “affecting facility” under the environmentaljustice policies of the CTDEEP, as defined. Therefore, Algonquin would not be subject to the requirements for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need from the Connecticut Siting Council and so filed a petition for a declaratory ruling seeking a “finding of no jurisdiction” from the Connecticut Siting Council for the AIM Project, due to the FERC’s federal jurisdiction. The petition was approved on November 7, 2013. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline in this area would replace an existing pipeline within the same rightof-way.  Massachusetts Suffolk County is the only county crossed in Massachusetts with a minority population greater than the general EPA guideline of 50 percent. However, none of the census blocks crossed by the West Roxbury Lateral within Suffolk County have minority populations greater than 50 percent. Similar to the State of Connecticut, MAEOEEA has established an Environmental Justice Policy (MAEOEEA, 2002) to help address the disproportionate share of environmental burdens experienced by lower-income people and communities of color who, at the same time, often lack environmental assets in their neighborhoods. According to the MAEOEEA, environmental justice populations are those segments of the population defined as neighborhoods (U.S. Census Bureau census block groups) that meet one or more of the following criteria:  the median annual household income is at or below 65 percent of the statewide median income forMassachusetts;  25 percent ofthe residents are minority;  25 percent ofthe residents are foreign born; or  25 percent ofthe residents are lacking English language proficiency. According to the 2010 U.S. Census data, 11.4 percent of the Town of Dedham’s population in Norfolk County is located in environmental justice block groups that meet the 25 percent minority criteria listed above. Of the 2.9 miles of the West Roxbury Lateral in Dedham, about 1.4 or 47 percent would cross through a portion of one of these groups. In Suffolk County, the Project would pass through environmental justice block groups in West Roxbury that meet two of the above four criteria (25 percent minority, below the 65 percent of the median income, or a combination of the two). All 1.7 miles (100 percent) of the AIM Project pipeline in West Roxbury would cross through these groups and/or traverse along the outeredges ofthese groups. 4-199 In support of the environmental justice populations, the Environmental Justice Policy identifies a number of specific services to be provided to environmental justice populations by the Secretary of the energy and environmental affairs agencies and other related state agencies, including greater public participation and outreach. To date, Algonquin has reached out to the public through various forums, particularly landowners, local community groups, and public officials, to inform them about the Project and has also prepared a Public and Agency Participation Plan for the AIM Project. In addition, FERC conducted a site visit with EPA staff along the entire pipeline route and also hosted a public scoping meeting in Dedham. 4.9.10.2 Impact Analysis The construction and operation of the proposed facilities would affect a mix of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic areas in the Project areas as a whole. To minimize overall impacts, Algonquin would collocate the majority of its proposed Project facilities with existing linear and facility infrastructure. In addition, not all impacts identified in this EIS are considered to affect minority or low-income populations. The primary adverse impacts on the environmental justice communities associated with the construction of the AIM Project would be the temporary increases in dust, noise, and traffic from Project construction. These impacts would occur along the entire pipeline route and in areas with a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds.  As part of the Project, Algonquin would implement a series of measures to minimize such impacts (see sections 4.9.5, 4.11.1, and 4.11.2). For instance, Algonquin proposes to employ proven construction-related practices to control fugitive dust such as application of water or other commercially available dust control agents on unpaved areas subject to frequent vehicle traffic. Similarly, the noise control measures that would be implemented by Algonquin during Project construction and operation would ensure that noise attributable to the new aboveground facilities would be either less than 55 decibels on the A-weighted scale (dBA) day-night sound level (Ldn) at nearby NSAs, or where the noise currently attributable to a particular station is greater than 55 dBA Ldn, the noise attributable to the station modifications would cause no perceptible change to station noise levels. Algonquin has also developed traffic management plans for New York and the West Roxbury Lateral to minimize impacts during construction. In addition, the roads crossed within the identified New York census block groups would be bored, so impacts on traffic would be avoided. Based on the identified estimated emissions from operation of the proposed Project facilities and review of the modeling analysis, the Project would result in continued compliance with the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), which are protective of human health, including children, the elderly, and sensitive populations (see section 4.11.1). The Project facilities would also be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with or to exceed PHMSA’s minimum federal safety standards in 49 CFR 192. These regulations, which are intended to protect the public and to prevent natural gas facility accidents and failures, apply to all areas along the proposed pipeline routes regardless of the presence or absence of minority or lowincome populations.  The AIM Project would also bring economic benefits to the region via added tax revenues and jobs associated with construction and operation of the pipeline facilities in these and other areas along the right-of-way.  Therefore, the AIM Project would not result in any disproportionately high or adverse environmental and human health impacts on minority or low-income communities, or Indian tribes. In its comments on the draft EIS, the EPA concurred with the conclusion that no disproportionate impacts would occur. 4-200 4.10 CULTURAL RESOURCES Section 106 of the NHPA (16 USC 470) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings (including the issuance of Certificates) on propertieslisted in or eligible forlisting in the NRHP and to provide the ACHP an opportunity to comment on the undertaking. Algonquin, as a non-federal party, is assisting the FERC in meeting its obligations under section 106 by preparing the necessary information, analyses, and recommendations as authorized by 36 CFR 800.2(a)(3). Algonquin conducted archival research and walkover surveys of the proposed Project area to identify historic aboveground properties and locations for additional subsurface testing in areas with potential for prehistoric and historic archaeological sites. Algonquin then conducted field surveys for aboveground properties and archaeological sites. 4.10.1 Cultural Resources Consultations On September 13, 2013, the FERC sent copies of the NOI for this Project to a wide range of stakeholders, including the ACHP, the NPS, Historic Preservation Field Services Bureau of the NYSOPRHP, the Connecticut State Historic Preservation Office of the Department of Economic and Community Development, the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission, the Massachusetts Historical Commission, and federally recognized Indian tribes (tribes) that may have an interest in the Project area. The NOI contained a paragraph about section 106 of the NHPA, and stated that we use the notice to initiate consultations with the SHPO,and to solicit their views and those of other government agencies, interested tribes, and the public on the Project’s potential effects on historic properties. In addition to the FERC’s notification process, Algonquin or its consultant, Public Archaeology Laboratory (PAL), separately contacted the SHPOs and tribes that might attach cultural or religious significanceto cultural resources in the Project area. 4.10.1.1 State Historic Preservation Offices Table 4.10.1-1 summarizes communications with the SHPOs. PAL contacted the New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts SHPOs to provide them information regarding the Project and to request comments on May 17, 2013, and provided each SHPO with technical proposals for conducting identification surveys in each state on May 23, 2013. The New York SHPO provided comments on the technical proposal on July 19, 2013; the Connecticut SHPO responded on September 19, 2013; the Rhode Island SHPO responded November 1, 2013; and the Massachusetts SHPO indicated by telephone that it would not be commenting until formal application materials are submitted. On October 25, 2013, PAL provided each SHPO with technical memoranda describing the initial identification survey results and requesting comments. The New York SHPO responded with comments on December 2, 2013, while the other SHPOs have not commented at this time. On February 24, 2014, PAL submitted identification survey technical reports to each SHPO. The New York SHPO provided comments on March 28, 2014; the Connecticut SHPO provided comments on April 8, 2014; the Rhode Island SHPO provided comments on March 5, 2014; and the Massachusetts SHPO provided comments on March 10, 2014. On December 4, 2014, PAL provided the New York SHPO with and addendum to the identification survey technical report, as well as a technical memorandum assessing a cemetery. On December 18, 2014, PAL provided the Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island SHPOs additional documentation on outstanding cultural resource investigations. The SHPOs have not yet commented on these additional submittals at this time. Details on specific comments/concurrence for archaeological sites and historic architectural properties are found in section 4.10.2. Where the respective SHPO has concurred with specific findings and recommendations below, we also concur.  4-201 TABLE 4.10.1-1 Algonquin and State Historic Preservation Office Correspondence for the AIM Project  Date Sender Recipient Correspondence  New York May 17, 2013 Gregory Dubell, PAL Ruth Pierpont, NY SHPO Letter introducing Project and initiating consultation.

Theseconsulting partiesincluded:  Ramapough Conservancy;  Massachusetts Board of Underwater Archaeological Resources;  Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation;  Boston Landmarks Commission;  Brockton Historical Commission;  Dedham Historical Commission;  Freetown Historical Commission;  Middleborough HistoricalCommission;  Medford Historical Commission;  Needham Historical Commission;  New Bedford Historical Commission;  Norwood Historical Commission;  Wellesley Historical Commission;  Westwood Historical Commission;  Eastern PequotTribal Nation;  Golden HillTribe of the Paugussett Indian Nation;  Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation;  Schaghticoke Tribal Nation;  Connecticut Indian Affairs Council;and  Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs. The Boston Landmarks Commission commented on the archaeological overview survey methodology. Algonquin provided the archaeological overview survey and historic architectural properties overview/identification survey technical reports to the relevant Massachusetts consulting parties for review.  No comments have been received to date from the remaining consulting parties. 4.10.1.3 Federally Recognized Indian Tribes Consultations On May 17, 2013, Algonquin wrote to nine tribes (the Delaware Nation of Oklahoma, Delaware Tribe of Indians, Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribal Nation, Mashpee Wampanoag Indian Tribe, Mohegan Indian Tribe, Narragansett Indian Tribe, Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians, and Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah)) in the attempt to identify any concerns about properties of traditional religious or cultural significance that may be affected by this undertaking. The Delaware Nation of Oklahoma responded that they would like to be apprised of changes in the expansion or inadvertent discoveries. The Delaware Tribe of Indians responded that there are no religious or culturally significant sites in the Project area and they defer comments to the SHPOs; in addition, the tribe stated that it wishes to continue as a consulting party. The Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribal Nation reviewed the survey reports and wished to continue receiving information regarding the Project. The Mohegan Indian Tribe sent a representative to accompany the archaeological field crew for a portion of the Project in Connecticut and identified areas of interest that may need further 4-204 consideration. The Narragansett Indian Tribe expressed an interest in the Project and were going to send a representative to accompany the archaeological field crew in Rhode Island. Stockbridge–Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians responded that they are not aware of any cultural sites but wished to continue receiving information regarding the Project. The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) responded that they wished to continue to be consulted during Project planning activities and accompanied an archaeological field crew during a portion of the identification fieldwork and identified areas of interest. The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe responded that, because of known archaeological sites in the Project area, the tribe would require periodic visits by tribal monitors during ground-disturbing activities and requested at least a 14-day notice prior to the start of construction as well as contact information for the construction contractor/project manager. No response has been received from the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe. Table R-1 in appendix R provides a summary of consultations with federally recognized tribes. On September 13, 2013, the FERC sent copies of the NOI to all tribes with a known interest in the area. In addition, on November 25, 2013, the FERC wrote letters to the federally recognized tribes to request their comments on the proposed Project. An email was sent to each of these tribes on February 4, 2014, to ensure that the tribes had received copies of the cultural resources studies for the Project and to seek comments. In response to these emails, three tribes (Mohegan Indian Tribe, Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), and Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribal Nation) requested to meet with the FERC. On March 12, 2014, the FERC met with these three tribes as well as the Narragansett Indian Tribe to discuss their concerns about the Project. The tribes expressed concerns about utility projects, including natural gas pipelines and effects on ceremonial stone landscapes and wanted to be involved with the initial cultural resources surveys for projects in the vicinity. The tribes were disappointed that site identification studies had begun without their involvement. Beginning April 3, 2014, the FERC hosted regular (mostly weekly) conference calls with these four tribes, Algonquin, and Algonquin’s cultural resources consultant (PAL) to discuss schedule and coordination for pending cultural resources field investigations and any areas within the APE that the tribes had concerns and wanted to investigate. When calls could not be scheduled, Algonquin representatives provided the parties weekly updates via email on upcoming and planned field work, as well as a summary of work completed the prior week. Although representatives of some of the tribes who participated in the calls accompanied PAL during a number of the Phase II site evaluations, no specific areas of concerns within the APE were raised during the phone calls by the tribes. Because no concerns were being raised by tribes regarding historic properties impacted by the AIM Project, archaeological fieldwork was concluding, and challenges to continue to attend calls, FERC staff decided to conclude the weekly calls, but clearly expressed that if any concerns or questions arose that tribes should contact FERC staff or Algonquin to discuss. In a meeting with the United South and Eastern Tribes Inc. (USET), on September 30, 2014, it was brought to FERC staff’s attention that certain stone features of interest to tribes may be present near or within the AIM Project. On October 17, 2014, FERC staff, Algonquin, and representatives from the Narragansett Tribe, Mohegan Indian Tribe, Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), and Oneida Nation met in Brewster, New York to discuss ceremonial stone landscapes. In a memo filed on October 29, 2014, FERC staff requested that the Tribes work with Algonquin to identify potential features that may have cultural affiliation to tribes within the APE. In a letter dated October 30, 2014, USET, which includes member tribes such as the Narragansett Tribe, Mohegan Indian Tribe, Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah), Mashantucket (Western) Pequot Tribal Nation, and Oneida Nation, among others, stated concerns regarding ceremonial stone landscapes in Brewster, New York that may be potentially impacted by the AIM Project and provided the tribes’ account of the October 17, 2014 site visit. Algonquin responded in a letter dated November, 14, 2014, providing documentation of the extensive tribal outreach that has occurred for the AIM Project, their opinion regarding stone landscapes, and an example survey scope of work for ceremonial stone landscapes. In separate letters, dated November 24, the Mohegan Indian Tribe and the Narragansett Tribe provided a rebuttal to Algonquin’s November 14, 4-205 2014, filing. The tribes emphatically stated they do not agree with Algonquin’s position and found the filing to be culturally insensitive to tribal expertise. Additionally USET, in a letter dated November 25, 2014, stated concerns about the company’s filing and requested a meeting with FERC. Although the tribes have expressed concerns and proposed to conduct investigations for ceremonial stone landscapes, surveys have not been initiated. The Commission has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify Indian tribes to be consulted for the AIM Project, and ensured that consultation in the section 106 process provided the Indian tribes a reasonable opportunity to identify its concerns about historic properties; advise on the identification and evaluation of historic properties, including those of traditional religious and cultural importance; and articulate its views on the undertaking's effects on such properties. Consultation is ongoing. 4.10.2 Results of Cultural Resources Surveys Algonquin surveyed a 200-foot-wide corridor for archaeological sites. The pipeline construction workspace, ATWS, and permanent right-of-way would be contained within this surveyed corridor. Surveys for historic architectural properties were conducted in a 300-foot-wide area that extended 150 feet on either side of the pipeline centerline. For aboveground facilities (compressor stations and M&R stations), the survey area included properties within view of the constructed facility. The APE for access roads would be defined based on the width needed to make the roads usable for construction, and the APE for contractor yards would include the footprint of those yards. Table 4.10.2-1 provides a summary of culturalresource investigations and work that is pending for each state. 4.10.2.1 New York Pipeline Facilities In New York, regarding the identification survey coverage, the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment has received 83 percent coverage for archaeology, the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment has received 99 percent coverage for archaeology, and the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay segment has had 100 percent survey for archaeology. Each segment has received 100 percent identification survey coverage for historic architecture. Reports presenting the results of this survey work were submitted to the SHPO on February 24, 2014 and December 4, 2014. The findings for each segment are summarized below. Haverstraw to Stony PointTake-up and Relay Three archaeological sites (two pre-contact, one dating to the Archaic period but also containing post-contact artifacts, the other undetermined; and one post-contact cemetery) were identified along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay survey corridor. Two of the sites are recommended potentially eligible for the NRHP and are recommended for further testing. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014. Site evaluation would be undertaken at these two sites to evaluate their eligibility for the NRHP. The remaining site, Letchworth Village Cemetery, has been determined eligible for the NRHP (New York SHPO unique site number [USN] 08702.000274). The proposed AIM Project workspace extends approximately 15 meters (50 feet) into the cemetery property, but archaeological survey of this workspace conducted in November 2014 and submitted to the New York SHPO on December 4, 2014 has determined that no graves are present in the workspace. In addition, eight stone walls were recorded within the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay survey corridor. These walls have been interpreted as former property boundaries, and where avoidance is not possible, documentation and restoration would be undertaken.  4-206 TABLE 4.10.2-1 Cultural Resources Investigations for the AIM Project  State/Type of Investigation Report of Investigation  Percent Surveyed  Acreage remaining  New York Phase I archaeological Nichole Gillis et al.

Four of these are residences and considered not eligible for the NRHP. Two resources, Harriman State Park (NY-A; New York SHPO USN 08702.000044 – USN 08702.000176) and Letchworth Village Cemetery (NY-2), have been determined eligible for the NRHP. The remaining two resources, Palisades Interstate Parkway (NY-6; New York SHPO USN 08702.000179) and Stony Point District School, No. 4 (NY-7; New York SHPO USN 08705.000083) are listed in the NRHP. The assessment indicates that the AIM Project would have no effect on the significance of the Palisades Interstate Parkway, Stony Point District School No. 4, or Harriman State Park. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014. Archaeological investigations within the AIM workspace indicate that the Project would have no effect on Letchworth Village Cemetery. Comments from the New York SHPO regarding effects on Letchworth Village Cemetery are pending. 4-208 Fourteen archaeological sites were identified along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay survey corridor, half of which are pre-contact sites (one dating to the Archaic period, the others undetermined) and half post-contact, ranging from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries. Seven of the sites have been recommended not eligible for the NRHP. Seven of the sites are recommended potentially eligible for the NRHP and would require further testing. Avoidance has been recommended in one case. In addition, 48 stone walls were recorded within the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay survey corridor. These walls have been interpreted as former property boundaries and, where avoidance is not possible, documentation and restoration is recommended. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014. Site evaluation would be conducted at the seven sites recommended eligible for the NRHP to evaluate theirNRHP eligibility.  A comment wasreceived abouta lime kiln site within Sylvan Glen Park. The archaeological survey identified a portion of this site within the Project area, and it is one of the sitesto be evaluated.  Twenty-seven aboveground historic resources were identified in the APE associated with the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment. Of those, 26 are recommended not eligible for the NRHP. The remaining resource, the Fresh Air Association House of St. John the Divine (NY-C), is recommended potentially eligible for the NRHP. While the Project has no potential to impact standing structures associated with the Fresh Air Association House of St. John Divine Complex, archaeological remains that might contribute to the significance of the property are located within the impact area of the pipeline. The examination of this resource for potentially significant archaeological remains would be included in the evaluation noted above. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014.   Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay No archaeological resources were identified along the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay survey corridor and no further testing was recommended. However, three stone walls were recorded. These walls have been interpreted as former property boundaries and, where avoidance is not possible, documentation and restoration is recommended. No historic resources were identified in the APE. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014.   AbovegroundFacilities There are two compressor stations (Southeast and Stony Point Compressor Stations) and three M&R station modifications (Cortlandt, Peekskill, and Stony Point M&R Stations) associated with the Project in New York. Most of these facilities were reviewed and determined to have low potential for intact archaeological resources and no identification surveys were undertaken there. Archaeological field surveys were conducted for the Southeast Compressor Station, Stony Point Compressor Station, and the Cortlandt M&R Station. All facilities also were surveyed for historic architectural properties with the Project’s APE. The other aboveground facilities in New York (MLVs, launcher/receivers, cross over piping) would be modified or constructed within the proposed pipeline rights-of-way and are, therefore, included in the discussion of pipeline facilities. A summary of the survey findings for each facility is presented below. 4-209 No archaeological resources were identified in the proposed Southeast Compressor Station site, and no historic resources were identified in the APE. No further studies were recommended. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014. Stony Point Compressor Station No archaeological resources were identified in the proposed Stony Point Compressor Station site, and no historic resources were identified in the APE. No further studies were recommended. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014. Stony Point M&R Station One historic resource was identified in the APE: the NRHP-listed Stony Point District School, No. 4 (NY-7; New York SHPO USN 08705.000083). The assessment indicates the Project would have no effect on the significance of the resource. No further studies were recommended. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014.  Peekskill M&R Station Four historic resources, all of which were considered not eligible for the NRHP, were identified in the APE. No further studies were recommended. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014.  Cortlandt M&R Station No archaeological resources were identified in the proposed Cortlandt M&R Station site, and no historic resources were identified in the APE. No further studies were recommended. The New York SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 28, 2014.   4.10.2.2 Connecticut Pipeline Facilities In Connecticut, regarding the identification survey coverage, the Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay has received 100 percent coverage for both archaeology and historic architecture. The E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment has received over 99 percent coverage for archaeology and 100 percent coverage for historic architecture. The Line-36A Loop Extension has received 100 percent coverage for archaeology and 100 percent coverage for historic architecture. The E-1 System Lateral Loop has received 100 percent identification survey coverage for both archaeology and historic architecture. The findings for each segment are summarized below. Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up and Relay The archaeological survey of this Project facility in Connecticut identified a single archaeological site, datingto the early19thcentury. The site wasrecommended noteligible forthe NRHP and no further work was recommended. In addition, 36 stone walls were recorded within the Southeast to MLV 19 4-210 Take-up and Relay survey corridor. These walls have been interpreted as former property boundaries and, where avoidance is not possible, documentation and restoration is recommended. A survey for historic architectural properties located 13 resources that were 50 years old or older within the Project’s APE. Only one of these resources, a residence and barn in Danbury, is recommended eligible for the NRHP. However, the Project would have no effect on this resource. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April8, 2014. Line-36A Loop Extension The archaeological survey of this Project facility identified a single pre-contact archaeological site. The site was recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no further work was recommended. A survey for historic architectural properties located four resources that were 50 years old or older within the Project’s APE; all four were recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no further work was recommended.  The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April 8, 2014.  E-1 SystemLateralTake-up and Relay A total of 18 archaeological sites, dating from the pre-contact period (one Early Archaic, one Middle Archaic, five Late Archaic, and nine undefined) and post-contact period (a mill site dating to the early 18th century and a domestic site likely dating from the mid-18th to 19th centuries), as well as a single cemetery were identified during the archaeological survey of the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay segment. The cemetery, Trumbull Cemetery, which has grave markers from about 1700 to 1850, is already listed on the State Register of Historic Places and would be avoided. Sixteen sites are recommended for evaluation to determine their eligibility for the NRHP, and the sites would be investigated to make that determination. The remaining two sites are recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no further work is recommended. In addition, 28 stone walls were recorded within the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay survey corridor. These walls have been interpreted as former property boundaries and, where avoidance is not possible, documentation and restoration would be undertaken. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April 8, 2014. Site evaluation investigations are pending for the 16 sites. In November 2014, an archaeological survey for an alignment change identified another pre-contact period site from the Late Archaic period. The report for this work was provided to the Connecticut SHPO on December 4, 2014.  This site is recommended for evaluation to determine its eligibility for the NRHP if the site cannot be avoided. Site evaluation or avoidance plan for this site is pending. A survey for historic architectural properties found 13 additional properties within the Project’s APE, 3 of which are recommended eligible for the NRHP: Jonathan Metcalf House in Lebanon (Statewide Historic Resource Inventory No. 71-5); a residence on Trumbull Highway in Lebanon (Statewide Historic Resource Inventory No. 71-125; 113); and a residence and barn in Franklin. The Project would have no effect on these resources. The Connecticut SHPO considers seven of the remaining 10 architectural properties that were recommended not eligible as potentially eligible for the NRHP, but agreed that there would be no adverse effect on potentially eligible resources in a letter dated April 8, 2014.   E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension A single archaeological site, a pre-contact site of unknown temporal association, was identified on the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension. The site was recommended for evaluation to determine its NRHP eligibility. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendation of additional testing of this site in a letter dated April 8, 2014. Site evaluation of the site is pending. In addition, nine stone walls 4-211 were recorded within the E-1 System Lateral Loop survey corridor. These walls have been interpreted as former property boundaries and, where avoidance is not possible, documentation and restoration is recommended. Seven historic architectural properties were identified within the APE, but none are recommended eligible for the NRHP. The Connecticut SHPO considers four of these architectural properties potentially eligible for the NRHP, but agreed that there would be no adverse effect on potentially eligible resources in a letterdated April8, 2014. AbovegroundFacilities There are 18 aboveground facilities located in Connecticut. Work at the Oxford Compressor Station would consist of modifications within the existing compressor building and would not require any temporary workspace; therefore, it is not included in this discussion. Eleven of the facilities (West Danbury M&R Station, Waterbury M&R Station, North Haven M&R Station, Farmington M&R Station, Glastonbury M&R Station, Greenville M&R Station, Middletown M&R Station, Salem Pike M&R Station, Montville M&R Station, Pomfret M&R Station, and Putnam M&R Station) were reviewed and determined to have low potential for intact archaeological resources. No identification surveys were conducted. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with this approach in a letter dated April 8, 2014. Field investigations for archaeological sites were carried out at the remaining facility locations where there was sensitivity for containing intact archaeological sites. All facilities also were surveyed for historic architectural properties within the Project’s APE. A summary of the findings for each facility is presented below. Cromwell Compressor Station An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that were eligible for the NRHP, and no further archaeological work was recommended. Four historic architectural properties were identified within the APE, but none are considered eligible for the NRHP. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April 8, 2014.  Chaplin Compressor Station An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that were eligible for the NRHP, and no further archaeological work was recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April 8, 2014.  Oakland Heights M&R Station One archaeological site was identified during the field investigations at this new station site, an undetermined pre-contact site. This site has been recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no further archaeological work was recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April 8, 2014.   Southbury M&R Station An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that were eligible for the NRHP, and no further archaeological work was recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendationsin a letter dated April 8, 2014.  4-212 The survey for historic architectural properties identified five resources within the APE. None of these resources was recommended eligible for the NRHP. No further studies were recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letterdated April 8, 2014.    North Haven M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified two resources within the APE. Neither of these resources was recommended eligible for the NRHP. No further studies were recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with Algonquin’s recommendations in a letterdated April 8, 2014.    Guilford M&R Station An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that were eligible for the NRHP, and no further archaeological work was recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendationsin a letter dated April 8, 2014.  Glastonbury M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified six resources within the APE and none of these resources was recommended eligible for the NRHP. No further studies were recommended. The Connecticut SHPO responded that one resource, CT-38, may be eligible for the NRHP, but concluded that no historic architectural properties would be affected in a letterdated April 8, 2014.    Greenville M&R Station An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that were eligible for the NRHP, and no further archaeological work was recommended. An architectural assessment that included this station and associated workspace was conducted for a prior FERC project (FERC Docket No. CP08-420-000). This prior study identified one historic property within the APE, and the Connecticut SHPO concurred at that time that there would be no effect on historic properties. No further studies are recommended.  Comments from the Connecticut SHPO on these recommendations are pending. Middletown M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified one resource within the APE; however, this resource was not recommended eligible for the NRHP. No further studies were recommended. The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendation in a letterdated April 8, 2014.    Salem Pike M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified three resources within the APE. None of these resources were recommended eligible for the NRHP, and no further studies were recommended.  The Connecticut SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated April 8, 2014.    4-213 An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that are eligible for the NRHP. The survey for historic architectural properties identified three resources within the APE. None of these resources were recommended eligible for the NRHP, and no further work was recommended. The Connecticut SHPO responded that one resource, CT-65, may be eligible for the NRHP, but concluded that no historic properties would be affectedin a letter dated April 8, 2014.    Pomfret M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified one resource within the APE; however, this resource was not recommended eligible for the NRHP. No further work was recommended. The Connecticut SHPO responded that this resource, CT-47, may be eligible for the NRHP, but concluded that no historic properties would be affected in a letter dated April 8, 2014.   Putnam M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified seven resources within the APE. None of these resources were recommended eligible for the NRHP, and no further studies were recommended.  The Connecticut SHPO responded that three resources (CT-48, CT-52, and CT-53) may be eligible for the NRHP, but concluded that no historic properties would be affected in a letterdated April 8, 2014.   4.10.2.3 Rhode Island Algonquin conducted an archaeological survey of the Burrillville Compressor Station and identified two archaeological sites, both pre-contact sites of unknown temporal affiliation. One of the sites, the Algonquin Lane Site (RI 2568), may be eligible for the NRHP and requires evaluation of its eligibility; the second site was not recommended eligible for the NRHP. The Rhode Island SHPO agreed with this recommendation in a letter dated March 5, 2014. Site RI 2568 was evaluated in May 2014, and was recommended as not eligible for the NRHP. The report for this evaluation was submitted to the Rhode Island SHPO on December 18, 2014, and comments from the Rhode Island SHPO are pending. The survey for historic architectural properties identified two resources within the APE. Neither of these resources was recommended eligible for the NRHP. The Rhode Island SHPO agreed with this recommendation in aletterdated April 1, 2014. 4.10.2.4 Massachusetts Pipeline Facilities Many portions of the West Roxbury Lateral have low potential for containing significant archaeological sites due to prior disturbance. However, Algonquin has identified the West Roxbury M&R Station as alocation that required archaeological investigations.  The survey for architectural properties identified 259 resources within the APE of the West Roxbury Lateral. Only two of these resources are considered eligible for listing on the NRHP: St. Theresa of Avila Church Complex in West Roxbury and the Willow Street Area in Dedham. The Project would have no effect on these historic resources.  4-214 The Project would involve work at 10 M&R stations, including: Assonet M&R Station, West Roxbury M&R Station, North Fall River M&R Station, New Bedford M&R Station, Middleborough M&R Station, Brockton M&R Station, Norwood M&R Station, Needham M&R Station, Wellesley M&R Station, and Mystic M&R Station. Based on research on previously recorded sites and a walk-over reconnaissance of these stations, all except the West Roxbury M&R Station have little potential for the presence of significant archaeological sites and do not require additional studies. The Massachusetts SHPO agreed with the recommendations in a letter dated March 10, 2014. All facilities also were surveyed for historic architectural properties with the Project’s APE. The other aboveground facilities in Massachusetts (MLVs and launcher/receivers) would be modified or constructed within the proposed pipeline right-of-wayand are thereforeincluded in the discussion ofpipeline facilities. A summaryofthe findings at each facility is presented below. West Roxbury M&R Station An archaeological survey of this station identified no sites that are eligible for the NRHP.  Review of this recommendation by the Massachusetts SHPO is pending. The survey for historic architectural properties identified 14 resources within the APE, five of which also were within the APE forthe West Roxbury Lateral.  None oftheseresources were recommended eligible for the NRHP.  North Fall River M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified one resource within the APE; however, this resource was not recommended eligible forthe NRHP, and no further work was recommended. Brockton M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified one resource within the APE; however, this resource was not recommended eligible forthe NRHP, and no further work was recommended.   Norwood M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified three resources within the APE. None of these resources were recommended eligible forthe NRHP, and no further work was recommended.  Mystic M&R Station The survey for historic architectural properties identified three resources within the APE. None of these resources were recommended eligible forthe NRHP, and no further work was recommended.  4.10.3 Outstanding Cultural Resource Investigations Algonquin has yet to file some identification reports, evaluation reports, and SHPO comments for portions ofthe Project.  A summary of this outstanding work is presented below (see also table 4.10.2-1).  4-215 4.10.3.1 New York Identification survey for archaeological sites remains for a portion of the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay as well as the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segments.  Additionally, evaluation work is pending for two sites along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment (Corral and Depressions Site and the Pound Swamp Site) and for seven sites on the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment (Franck Road Site, St. John the Divine Fresh Air Home, Westchester Wetlands Site, Pleasantside Site, Little Stream Site, Furnace Brook Site, and Kiln Site).  4.10.3.2 Connecticut Identification survey is not complete for a portion of the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay. Evaluation work also is pending for 17 sites on the E-1 System Lateral Take-up and Relay (Elisha Brook Pre-Contact Site; Johnnycake Brook Site; Meetinghouse Hill Site; Susquetonscut Brook Mill Site; Susquetonscut Brook Post-Contact Site; Susquetonscut Brook Pre-Contact sites 1 through 9, 11, and 12; and the Pullback Site), and the Raymond Hill Wetland Site on the E-1 System Lateral Loop Extension. 4.10.3.3 Rhode Island Evaluation studies for one site located at the Burrillville Compressor Station, the Algonquin Lane Site, hasbeen completed, but comments from the Rhode Island SHPO are pending. 4.10.3.4 Massachusetts Comments from the Massachusetts SHPO are pending for additional studies conducted for portions of the West Roxbury Lateraland the West Roxbury M&R Station. 4.10.4 Unanticipated Discoveries Procedures Algonquin has prepared procedures to be used in the event any unanticipated historic properties or human remains are encountered during construction. The Procedures Guiding the Discovery of Unanticipated Cultural Resources and Human Remains provide for the notification of interested parties, including Indian tribes, in the event of any discovery. The Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island SHPOs agreed with the procedure’s provisions and we find them acceptable as well. 4.10.5 GeneralImpactand Mitigation Construction and operation of the Project could affect historic properties. Direct effects could include destruction or damage to all, or a portion of, an archaeological site, or alteration or removal of a historic property. Indirect effects could include the introduction of visual, atmospheric, or audible elements that affect the setting or character of a historic property. Compliance with section 106 of the NHPA has not been completed for the Project. Cultural resources surveys of portions of the Project and consultation with the SHPOs and other parties has not been completed. To date, nine archaeological sites located in New York, 17 sites in Connecticut, and one site in Rhode Island require additional testing to determine eligibility for listing on the NRHP. If FERC, in consultation with the New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island SHPOs, determines that the sites are eligible and cannot be avoided, Algonquin would be required to prepare a treatment plan, in consultation with the appropriate parties, to mitigate adverse effects. The FERC would afford the ACHP an opportunity to comment in accordance with 36 CFR 800.6. Implementation of a treatment plan would occur only after Certification of the Projectand receiptof written notification to proceed from the FERC.  4-216  Algonquin should not begin implementation of any treatment plans/measures (including archaeological data recovery); construction of facilities; or use of staging, storage, or temporary work areas and new or to-be-improved access roads until: a. Algonquin files with the Secretary all remaining cultural resources survey and evaluation reports, any necessary treatment plans, and the New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts SHPOs’ comments on the reports and plans; b. the ACHP is provided an opportunity to comment on the undertaking if historic properties would be adversely affected; and c. the FERC staff reviews and the Director of OEP approves all cultural resources survey reports and plans, and notifies Algonquin in writing that treatment plans/mitigation measures may be implemented or construction may proceed.  All material filed with the Secretary containing location, character, and ownership information about cultural resources must have the cover and any relevant pages therein clearly labeled in bold lettering: “CONTAINS PRIVILEGED INFORMATION - DO NOT RELEASE.” 4.11 AIR QUALITY AND NOISE 4.11.1 Air Quality Air quality would be affected by construction and operation of the AIM Project. Although air emissions would be generated byconstruction activities involving the proposed pipeline and aboveground facilities, the majority of air emissions associated with the Project would result from operation of the new compressor units at five of the existing compressor stations. These would be the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations in New York; the Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations in Connecticut; and the Burrillville Compressor Station in Rhode Island. The modifications at the sixth compressor station, the Oxford Compressor Station in Connecticut, would involve the restaging of one existing compressor unit. This work would not result in impacts on air quality or noise. Therefore, the Oxford Compressor Station is not included in the analysis below. Three new M&R stations are also proposed to be added as part of the Project, including one in Connecticut and two in Massachusetts. The new M&R stations would include natural gas-fired heaters, which would be new sources of emissions during operation ofthe proposed Project. 4.11.1.1 Existing Air Quality The Project area in southeastern New York and southwestern Connecticut has a climate that is characterized as continental. Winters are short and moderately cold lasting into mid-March. Summers are warm with periods of oppressive heat and humidity, while autumn is characterized by mild temperatures extending into November. Normal monthly precipitation, as recorded at the nearest measurement stations (Suffern, New York; Carmel, New York; and Danbury, Connecticut),ranges froma high of 5 inches during the month of July to a low of approximately 3 inches during the month of February.  Airflow and weathersystems that affectthe areaare primarily ofcontinental origin. The Project area in central and western Connecticut has a climate that is characterized as continental with hot summers and cold winters. Normal monthly precipitation, as recorded at the nearest 4-217 measurement stations (Middletown and Thompson, Connecticut), ranges from a high of 5 inches during the month of October to a low of approximately 3 inches during the month of February. The primary airflow and weather systems that affect the area are either cold, dry air originating from sub-arctic North America or warm, moist air moving across the mid-continent from the Gulf of Mexico and sub-tropical waters of the Atlantic. The Project area in Rhode Island has a climate that is characterized as humid continental. In general the winters are cold, but extreme temperatures are of short duration. The summers are comparatively cool, although there are some periods of hot weather, usually of short duration. Normal monthly precipitation, as recorded at the nearest measurement station (Foster, Rhode Island), ranges from a high of 5 inches during the month of March to a low of approximately 4 inches during the month of July. Winds are predominantly from the west and seasonal temperature differentiation is moderated by the proximity of Narragansett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.  The Project area in eastern and southeastern Massachusetts has a climate that is characterized as humid continental. The climate in the region is characterized by frequent changes in the weather, large ranges in temperature, and considerable diversity from place to place. Normal monthly precipitation, as recorded at the nearest measurement station (New Bedford and Milton, Massachusetts), ranges from a high of 5 inches during the month of March to a low of approximately 4 inches during the month of May. The primary airflow and weather systems that affect the area are either cold, dryair originating from subarctic North America or warm, moist air moving across the mid-continent from the Gulf of Mexico and sub-tropical watersof the Atlantic,or coldairfromthe NorthAtlantic. Occasionally, cool, damp airfrom the North Atlantic results in Northeasters. Ambient air quality is protected by federal and state air quality standards. The EPA established NAAQS for seven “criteria air pollutants”, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone, sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), and lead. There are two classifications of NAAQS, primary and secondary standards. EPA set limits under the primary standards to protect human health including sensitive populations such as children, the elderly, and asthmatics.  EPA set secondary standardlimits to protect public welfare from detriments such as reduced visibility and damage to crops, vegetation, animals, and buildings. The federal NAAQS are presented in table 4.11.1-1. The NYSDEC, CTDEEP, and MADEP all have adopted ambient air quality standards (AAQS) that differ in some respects from the current NAAQS. Table 4.11.1-2 summarizes the current AAQSs for New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts (NYSDEC, 2014h; CTDEEP, 2014d; MADEP, 2014a).  The RIDEM hasadopted in full allof the NAAQS. GHGs occur in the atmosphere both naturally and as a result of human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels. These gases are the integral components of the atmosphere’s greenhouse effect that warms the earth’s surface and moderates day/night temperature variation. In general, the most abundant GHGs are water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone. On December 7, 2009, the EPA defined air pollution to include the mix of six long-lived and directly emitted GHGs, finding that the presence of the following GHGs in the atmosphere may endanger public health and welfare through climate change: CO2, CH4, N2O, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Rhode Island has also developed ambient air toxic guidelines, including a standard for benzene, to which the Project would also be subject (RIDEM, 2014). 4-218 TABLE 4.11.1-1 National Ambient Air Quality Standards  Standards  Pollutant  Averaging Period  Primary  Secondary  SO2  j,k 1-hour  75 ppb  - b 3-hour  - 0.5 ppm  3 1300 µg/m Annual a,k  0.03 ppm  - 3 80 µg/m b,k 24-hour  0.14 ppm  - 3 365 µg/m PM10  d 24-hour  3 150 µg/m 3 150 µg/m PM2.5 (2012 Standard)  Annual e,l  3 12.0 µg/m 3 15.0 µg/m PM2.5 (2006 Standard)  f 24-hour  3 35 µg/m 3 35 µg/m PM2.5 (1997 Standard)  Annual e,l  3 15.0 µg/m 3 15.0 µg/m f 24-hour  3 65 µg/m 3 65 µg/m NO2  Annual a  0.053 ppm (53 ppb)  0.053 ppm (53 ppb)  3 100 µg/m 3 100 µg/m 1-hour c  100 ppb  - 3 188 µg/m CO  b 8-hour  9 ppm  - 3 10,000 µg/m b 1-hour  35 ppm  - 3 40,000 µg/m Ozone (2008 Standard)  g,h,i 8-hour  0.075 ppm  0.075 ppm  Ozone (1997 Standard)  g,i 8-hour  0.08 ppm  0.08 ppm  Lead (Pb)  Rolling 3-month a  3 0.15 µg/m 3 0.15 µg/m a Not to be exceeded. b Not to be exceeded more than once per year. c Compliance based on 3-year average of the 98th percentile of the daily maximum 1-hour average at each monitor within an area. d Not to be exceeded more than once per year on average over 3 years. e Compliance based on 3-year average of weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations at community-oriented monitors. f Compliance based on 3-year average of 98th percentile of 24-hour concentrations at each population-oriented monitor within an area. g Compliance based on 3-year average of fourth-highest daily maximum 8-hour average ozone concentrations measured at each monitor within an area. h The EPA is currently reconsidering the 8-hour ozone standard set in March 2008.

The primary GHGs that would be produced by the Project include CO2, CH4, and N2O. Emissions of GHGs are typically quantified and regulated in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). The CO2e takes intoaccount theglobalwarmingpotential(GWP) ofeachGHG.  TheGWP is a ratiorelative to CO2 of a particular GHG’s ability to absorb solar radiation as well its residence time within the atmosphere (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). Thus, CO2 has a GWP of 1, CH4 has a GWP of 25, and N2O has a GWP of 298.9 To obtain the CO2e quantity, the mass of the particular GHG is multiplied by the corresponding GWP. The CO2e value for each of the GHG compounds is summed to obtain the total CO2e GHG emissions. We received comments on the amount and impacts of GHG emission the Project would contribute. In compliance with EPA’s definition of air pollution to include GHGs, we have provided estimates of GHG emissions for construction and operation, as discussed throughout this section. Impacts from GHG emissions (i.e., climate change) are discussed in more detail in section 4.11.1.3. Air quality control regions (AQCR) are areas established by EPA and local agencies, in accordance with section 107 of the CAA, for air quality planning purposes in which SIPs describe how NAAQS would be achieved and maintained. The AQCRs are intra-and interstate regions such as large metropolitan areas where improvement of the air quality in one portion of the AQCR requires emission These GWPs are based on a 100-year time period. We have selected their use over other published GWPs for other timeframes because these are the GWPs EPA has established for reporting of GHG emissions and air permitting requirements. This allows for aconsistentcomparison withtheseregulatoryrequirements. 4-221 reductions throughout the AQCR. Each AQCR, or portion thereof, is designated based on compliance with the NAAQS. Areas are designated attainment, unclassifiable, nonattainment, or maintenance on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis. Attainment areas are in compliance (below) with the NAAQS and nonattainment areas not in compliance (exceed) with the NAAQS. Areas where no data are available are designated unclassifiable. Areas that have been designated nonattainment but have since demonstrated compliance with the NAAQS are designated as “maintenance” for that pollutant. Maintenance areas may be subject to more stringent regulatory requirements to ensure continued attainment of the NAAQS pollutant. The entire Project area is designated attainment or unclassifiable for SO2, NO2, PM10, and lead. Table 4.11.1-3 identifies the counties designated as nonattainment and/or maintenance within the Project areafor CO, ozone, and PM2.5 (EPA, 2014a). All Project facilities are also within the Northeast Ozone Transport Region.  The Ozone Transport Region (42 USC §7511c) includes 11 northeastern states in which ozone transports from one or more states and contributes to a violation of the ozone NAAQS in one or more other states. States in this region are required to submit a SIP, stationary sources are subject to more stringent permitting requirements, and various regulatory thresholds are lower for the pollutants that form ozone, even if they meet the ozone NAAQS. The EPA and state and local agencies have established a network of ambient air quality monitoring stations to measure and track the background concentrations of criteria pollutants across the United States. This data is then used by regulatory agencies to compare the air quality of an area to the NAAQS. To characterize the background air quality in the region surrounding the Project areas, data were obtained from representative air quality monitoring stations. A summary of monitoring data from the EPA AirData database for the 3-year period of 2010 through 2012 is provided in table 4.11.1-4 (EPA, 2014b). 4.11.1.2 Air Quality Regulatory Requirements Federal Air Quality Regulations Air quality in the United States is regulated by federal statutes in the CAA and its amendments.  The provisions of the CAAthat are applicable to the AIM Project are discussed below. Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattainment New Source Review  Ambient air quality within the Project area is protected by the EPA’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) programs. The PSD regulations apply to new major stationary sources or major modifications to existing stationary sources located in attainment areas. The NNSR regulations apply to new or modified stationary sources located in nonattainment areas. The PSD regulations (40 CFR 52.21) define a major source as any source listed under the named industrial source categories in the regulation that has the potential-to-emit (PTE) 100 tons per year (tpy) or more of anyNew Source Review (NSR) pollutant or any source not on the list of named categories that has a PTE of any NSR pollutant equal to or greater than 250 tpy. The Project would not include facilities or operations included on the list of named source categoriesto which the 100-tpy trigger applies. 4-222 TABLE 4.11.1-3 Nonattainment and Maintenance Areas

increase and a significant net emissions increase ofa regulated NSR pollutant. They would include: a modification to an existing major source that results in a net emissions increase greater than the PSD significant emission rates specified in the regulations; or an existing minor source proposing a modification that is major by itself. NOx and VOCs are precursor pollutants to ozone; therefore, major NNSR thresholds are 25 tpy for NOx or VOC emissions, each. Similarly, SO2 and NOx are PM2.5 precursors and therefore the NNSR threshold for PM2.5 is 100 tpy of direct PM2.5, SO2, or NOx emissions, each. Although major NNSR thresholds are established on a federal level, they may be implemented by state or local permitting authorities.  As a result, the major NNSR thresholds vary by state and by location within a state. 4-226 GHGs are now a regulated NSR pollutant and under the EPA’s GHG Tailoring Rule. The rule covers an estimated 70 percent of GHG emissions from stationary sources but does not apply to smaller sources such as apartment buildings and schools. Beginning on July 1, 2011, an existing industrial facility is subject to PSD review for GHGs if:  it is already subject to PSD review for another NSR pollutant and would increase its GHG emissions by 75,000 tpy CO2e;  the existing potential GHGs emissions are equal to or greater than 100,000 tpy CO2e and GHG emissions as a result of the Project would increase by 75,000 tpy CO2e or more; or  the existing source is minor for PSD (including GHGs) and the modification alone would result in equal to or greaterthan 100,000 tpy CO2e.  The U.S. Supreme Court recently issued a ruling related to the EPA’s GHG Tailoring Rule. It is not clear at this time the implication of this ruling on pending permit actions. The air permitting actions associated with the proposed Project have been presented based upon the previous interpretations of the GHG Tailoring Rule and would comply with all currently applicable federaland state rules. We received numerous comments that the compressor stations should not be allowed to exceed permitting thresholds and obtain offsets. The emission thresholds identified above are not a limit on emissions, but are an evaluation criteria used to determine whether a specific type of permitting applies to a facility. Facilities may exceed the thresholds, which prompts further review, emission controls, and permitting requirements by the applicable air permitting authority. The CAA and air permitting program allows facilities to use air emission offsets during permitting. In order to achieve improved air quality within a nonattainment area, reductions are required throughout the entire AQCR. The commentors also misinterpret the existing compressor station emissions or offsets already obtained with the proposed changes for this Project. We are not aware of any offsets required under NNSR permitting or general conformity for any facilities associated with this Project. Because of their attainment status, all Project facilities would potentially be subject to NNSR review for ozone precursor pollutants NOx and VOCs. Facilities located in Rockland and Westchester Counties, New York would potentially be subject to NNSR for PM2.5. Facilities located in Westchester County, New York; Fairfield, Hartford, Middlesex, and New Haven Counties, Connecticut; Norfolk, Suffolk, and Middlesex Counties, Massachusetts would potentially be subject to NNSR for CO. All other Project facilities and pollutants, including GHGs, would potentially be subject to PSD review. Each of the states in which Project facilities would be located have state-level programs that implement federal NNSR and PSD permitting, which are summarized below. One additional factor considered in the PSD permit review process is the potential impacts on protected Class I areas.  Certain lands were designated as Mandatory Federal Class I Areas as a part of the CAA Amendments of 1977. Class I Areas were designated because the air quality was considered a special feature of the area (e.g., national parks, wilderness areas, national forests). Federal Class I Areas are protected against several types of pollution including criteria pollutant concentrations, visibility degradation, and acidic deposition. If a new major source or major modification is located within 62 miles (100 kilometers) of a Class I Area, the facility is required to notify the appropriate federal officials and assess the impacts of that project on the nearby Class I Area. For major sources that are located within 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) from a Class I area, ambient air pollutant impacts must be assessed for any project emission increases. The nearest Class I areas to the AIM Project are the Lye Brook Wilderness Area in Vermont and the Brigantine Wilderness Area in New Jersey (EPA, 2014c). The shortest distance between the Lye Brook Wilderness Area and the closest portion of the Project (the Cromwell Compressor Station) is approximately 100 miles. The shortest distance between the Brigantine 4-227 The NYSDEC administers its major NSR permitting program through 6 NYCRR 231. The New York SIP was updated in November 2010 to create a new state PSD program and to update the existing New York NNSR rules to include the 2002 federal NSR reform provisions. The Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations are existing major PSD sources located in New York. The facilities are also existing major NNSR sources. The proposed modifications to the Stony Point Compressor Station trigger PSD for GHG emissions and do not trigger NNSR review. An application for a significant modification to the Stony Point Compressor Station was submitted to the NYSDEC in February 2014. The proposed modifications to the Southeast Compressor Station do not trigger PSD or NNSR review.  The CTDEEP administers its NSR permitting program through Regulation of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) § 22a-174-3a. The Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations are existing major PSD sources located in Connecticut. The facilities are also existing major NNSR sources. The proposed modifications to the Cromwell Compressor Station do not trigger NNSR review. Because Algonquin has chosen to accept a fuel use restriction, the proposed modifications also do not trigger PSD review. The proposed modifications to the Chaplin Compressor Station do not trigger PSD orNNSR review.  The RIDEM NSR permitting program is established in Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 9. The Burrillville Compressor Station is an existing major NNSR. Although the facility has existing GHG potential emissions greater than 100,000 tpy of CO2e, in Rhode Island, a major source of GHGs is not considered a major PSD source if it is not also major for another PSD pollutant. Therefore, the Burrillville Compressor Station is not considered a major source under the PSD program. The proposed modifications to the Burrillville Compressor Station do not trigger NNSR review. Also, because Algonquin has chosen to accept a fuel use restriction for the new turbine, the proposed modifications also do nottrigger PSD review. Algonquin is also proposing to modify 24 existing M&R stations, remove one existing M&R station, and install three new M&R stations; however, Algonquin has not decided on the size of some of the emission generating units at the new and/or revised M&R stations. The modifications to five existing M&R stations located in Peekskill, New York (the Peekskill M&R Station); Cortlandt, New York (the Cortlandt M&R Station); Guilford, Connecticut (the Guilford M&R Station); Windham, Connecticut (the Willimantic M&R Station); and New Bedford, Massachusetts (the New Bedford M&R Station) would include new or replacement natural gas-fired inlet gas heaters. The primary source of air emissions at the three new M&R stations proposed in Norwich, Connecticut (the Oakland Heights M&R Station); Freetown, Massachusetts (the Assonet M&R Station); and Boston, Massachusetts (the West Roxbury M&R Station) would be natural gas-fired inlet gas heaters. These gas heaters are expected to have rated maximum heat input capacities ranging from less than 1 million metric British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr) up to approximately 10 MMBtu/hr. Based upon the information provided by Algonquin, the potential emissions from the modified and new M&R stations would be significantly below NNSR and PSD permitting thresholds and would, therefore, not be subject to federal air permitting. Further details regarding the air permitting requirements associated with these modifications are included in the state permitting summary. Title V Permitting Title V of the CAA requires each state to develop an operating permit program. The operating permit program is implemented through Title 40 CFR Part 70, and the permits required by these regulations are often referred to as Part 70 permits. If a facility’s PTE is equal to or greater than the criteria pollutant or hazardous air pollutants (HAP) thresholds, the facility is considered a “major source.” 4-228 The EPA also promulgated the Title V GHG Tailoring Rule, which established permitting thresholds for GHG emissions under the Title V program. Sources with an existing Title V permit or new sources obtaining a Title V permit for non-GHG pollutants are required to address GHGs. New sources and existing sources not previously subjectto Title V that have a PTE equal to or greater than 100,000 tpy CO2e would become subject to Title V requirements. Algonquin’s Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations in New York, Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations in Connecticut, and Burrillville Compressor Station in Rhode Island have existing Title V permits, all of which are required to modify their Title V permit to incorporate the proposed modifications associated with the Project. Title V permit modifications for the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations were submitted to the NYSDEC in February 2014. Air permit modifications for the Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations were submitted to the CTDEEP in February and January 2014, respectively. Algonquin would be required to submit additional applications to request modifications to the existing Title V permit for these facilities once state permits have been issued. An air permit modification for the Burrillville Compressor Station was provided to the RIDEM in February 2014, which included a request to modify the existing Title V permit to incorporate the proposed modifications.  As presented in section 4.11.1.2, the individual emissions from the proposed modified or new M&R stations are unlikely to trigger federal major source permitting. Although the exact equipment has not yet been selected for the proposed modified or new M&R stations, based upon maximum potential emission estimated provided by Algonquin, it is unlikely that any of the M&R stations would trigger Title V permitting.  New Source Performance Standards The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), codified in 40 CFR 60, applyto new, modified, or reconstructed stationary sources that meet or exceed specified applicability thresholds. The NSPS are divided into several subparts. Each subpart regulates a specific source type and size. The potentially applicable subparts are addressed below. NSPS Subpart Dc applies to steam generating units, with a maximum design heat input capacity of greater than or equal to 10 MMBtu/hr but less than or equal to 100 MMBtu/hr for which construction, modification, or reconstruction is commenced after June 9, 1989. Algonquin has not completed the final design of its heaters. Therefore, it cannot be determined if there would be any subject steam generating units with a maximum design heat input capacity of greater than or equal to 10 MMBtu/hr installed at any of the proposed Project facilities. However, if any steam generating units with a maximum design heat input capacity greater than 10 MMBtu/hr are installed as part of the Project, they would be subject to Subpart Dc requirements. There are no emissions limitations that apply to natural gas-fired steam generating units subject to Subpart Dc. Applicable units are subject to reporting requirements (for notification of initial construction and initial startup) and recordkeeping requirements (for amount of fuel combusted). NSPS Subpart JJJJ is applicable to owners and operators of new or existing stationary spark ignition internal combustion engines that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction after June 12, 2006. The Project includes new emergency generators greater than 25 hp at each of the five affected compressor stations. Therefore, requirements of Subpart JJJJ would apply to the proposed Project. There are NOx and CO emission limits that would apply to the emergency generators and applicable units are potentially subject to fuel use, testing, monitoring, notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. 4-229 NSPS Subpart KKKK applies to stationary combustion turbines with a heat input rate at peak load of 10 MMBtu/hr or greater that commenced construction, modification, or reconstruction after February 18, 2005. Subpart KKKK limits emissions of NOx as well as the sulfur content of fuel that is combusted from subject units. The AIM Project involves the installation of new stationary combustion turbines at all five affected compressor stations. Therefore, the Project would trigger the emissions limitations as well as the monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping, and testing requirements under Subpart KKKK of Part 60.  NSPS Subpart OOOO applies to storage vessels that are located in the oil and natural gas production segment, natural gas processing segment, or natural gas transmission and storage segment that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after August 23, 2011, and have the potential to emit VOC emissions equal to or greater than 6 tpy, as determined in accordance with Part 60.5365(e). Natural gas transmission is defined as the pipelines used for the long distance transport of natural gas (excluding processing). The Project does not include the construction, reconstruction, or modification of any storage vessels. Therefore, the requirements of Subpart OOOO do notapply. In summary, the Project is subject to NSPS Subpart JJJJ, Subpart KKKK, and potentially Subpart Dc requirements.  National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) are codified in Title 40 CFR Parts 61 and 63 to regulate facilities that emit specific HAPs. Part 61 regulates only eight hazardous substances and specific industries: asbestos, benzene, beryllium, coke oven emissions, inorganic arsenic, mercury, radionuclides, and vinyl chlorides. The AIM Project would not emit these pollutants; therefore, the Part61 requirements would not apply to the Project.  The 1990 CAA Amendments established a list of 189 HAPs, resulting in the promulgation of Part 63. Part 63, also known as the Maximum Achievable Control Technology standards, regulates HAP emissions specific source types located at major or area sources of HAPs. The 1990 CAA Amendments define a major source of HAPs as any source that has a PTE of 10 tpy for any single HAP or 25 tpy for all HAPs in aggregate. Area sources are stationary sources that do not exceed the thresholds for major source designation.  The existing Stony Point, Cromwell, and Burrillville Compressor Stations are major sources of HAPs, both because the facilities’ HAP emissions are above the major source threshold of 10 tpy of any single HAP and 25 tpy of all HAPs in aggregate. The Cromwell and Burrillville Compressor Stations would remain major sources of HAP after the Project. Due to the abandonment of the four existing reciprocating engines, the Stony Point Compressor Station would become a minor source of HAPs following the Project; however, the NESHAPs currently applicable to this station would remain applicable following the change. The Southeast and Chaplin Compressor Station are currently not major sources for HAPs and would remain minor sources of HAPs after the Project. Below is a detailed discussion of the NESHAP regulations that are potentially applicable to the compressor stations. In addition to the source type-specific regulations, any source that is subject to a subpart of 40 CFR 63 is also subject to the general provision of NESHAP Subpart A, unless otherwise noted in the applicable subpart. Subpart YYYY of Part 63 applies to stationary combustion turbines at major sources of HAPs.  Emissions and operating limitations under Subpart YYYY apply to new and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines. Because the Stony Point, Cromwell, and Burrillville Compressor Stations are each existing major sources of HAPs with proposed new stationary combustion turbines, the Project would trigger the requirements under Subpart YYYY. However, on August 18, 2004 The D.C. Circuit Court issued a Stay of Implementation regarding this subpart. The EPA is evaluating the possibility of delisting 4-230 gas-fired turbines from the rule. Currently, natural gas-fired turbines are only subject to the general permitting and Initial Notification requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart A. Thus, there are no pollutants regulated under the current Subpart YYYY. Subpart ZZZZ of Part 63 applies to existing, new, and reconstructed stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines depending on size, use, and whether the engine is located at a major or area source of HAPs. The Project includes new emergency generators rated greater than 500 hp at the Stony Point, Southeast, Cromwell, and Chaplin Compressor Stations and a new emergency generator rated less than 500 hp at the Burrillville Compressor Station. Because the Stony Point and Cromwell Compressor Stations are existing major sources of HAPs, the new emergency generator rated greater than 500 hp must meet the Initial Notification requirements set forth in 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart A, but are not subject to any otherrequirement of Subpart ZZZZ.  The Burrillville Compressor Station is also an existing major source of HAPs, however, the new emergency generator rated less than 500 hp must meet the requirements of Subpart ZZZZ by meeting the NSPS Subpart JJJJ. Similarly, a new emergency generator located at an area source of HAPs, such as those proposed for the Southeast and Chaplin Compressor Stations, must also meet the requirements of Subpart ZZZZ by meeting the NSPS Subpart JJJJ. The new emergency generators proposed for these facilitiesare subject to NSPS Subpart JJJJ; therefore the requirements of SubpartZZZZ would be met. Subpart DDDDD of Part 63 applies to certain new and existing boilers and process heaters at major HAP sources and regulates CO, hydrogen chloride, mercury, and total selected metals (arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, nickel, and selenium). The Stony Point, Cromwell, and Burrillville Compressor Stations are major HAP sources. The Project includes the installation of small natural gas-fired turbine compressor fuel gas heaters at the Stony Point, Cromwell, and Burrillville Compressor Stations. The new fuel gas heaters would be considered affected sources under Subpart DDDDD. Therefore, the Project would be subject to the requirements of Subpart DDDDD. Compliance with this subpart may include performance testing, fuel analyses, recordkeeping, and notification requirements. Subpart JJJJJJ of Part 63 applies only to certain new and existing boilers at area sources, where a boiler is defined as “an enclosed device using controlled flame combustion in which water is heated to recover thermal energy in the form of steam and/or hot water.” The rule does not apply to natural gas-fired boilers. The Southeast and Chaplin Compressor Stations are both area sources of HAP. Any new heating devices proposed as part of the AIM Project would be fired by natural gas, and therefore the Project is not expected to be subject to SubpartJJJJJJ requirements.  In summary, the Project is subject to Part 63 Subpart YYYY, Subpart ZZZZ, and Subpart DDDDD NESHAP requirements.  Conformity of General Federal Actions The lead federal agency must conduct a conformity analysis if a federal action would result in the generation of emissions that would exceed the conformity threshold levels of the pollutant(s) for which an air basin is designated nonattainment or maintenance. According to section 176(c) of the CAA (Title 40 CFR Part 93 Subpart B), a federal agency cannot approve or support any activity that does not conformto an approved SIP.  Conforming activities or actions should not, through additionalairpollutant emissions:  cause orcontribute to new violations ofthe NAAQS in any area;  increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any NAAQS; or  delay timely attainment of any NAAQS or interim emission reductions. 4-231 General conformity assessments must be completed when the total direct and indirect emissions of a project would equal or exceed specified pollutant thresholds on a calendar year basis for each nonattainment or maintenance area. With regard to the Project, the relevant general conformity pollutant thresholds are shown in table 4.11.1-3.  The thresholds in table 4.11.1-3 are based on the current air quality designations (e.g., serious nonattainment, moderate nonattainment, maintenance, etc.).  Operational emissions for the Project are presented in section 4.11.1.3. The operational emissions that would be permitted or otherwise covered by major or minor NSR permitting programs are not subject to the general conformity applicability analysis.  Estimated emissions for the Project subject to review under the general conformity thresholds (construction emissions and operational emissions not subject to major or minor NSR permitting), along with a comparison to the applicable general conformity threshold are presented in table 4.11.1-5. TABLE 4.11.1-5 Summary of Emissions Subject to General Conformity Review Associated with the AIM Project for 2015–2017  2015 Total 2016 Total 2017 Ongoing Pollutant Non-Exempt Non-Exempt Operational Designated Threshold or Emissions Emissions Emissions Pollutant Designated Area (tpy) Precursor (tons) a (tons)a (tons)  Ozone New York – N.

Notes: NY = New York; NJ = New Jersey; LI =Long Island; CT = Connecticut; RI = Rhode Island; MA = Massachusetts.  4-232 As shown in table 4.11.1-5, during all years of construction, emission estimates would not exceed general conformity applicability thresholds. Based upon this evaluation, a general conformity assessment is not required. It should be noted that should the schedule for construction change, or modifications to the Project result in emissions that would exceed the general conformity applicability threshold in one calendar year, FERC would be required to preparea General Conformity Determination at thattime. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Mandatory Reporting Rule The EPA’s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from suppliers of fossil fuels and facilities that emit greater than or equal to 25,000 metric tons of GHG (as CO2e) per year. Although the rule does not apply to construction emissions, we have provided GHG construction emission estimates, as CO2e, for accounting and disclosure purposes in table 4.11.1-6. Operational GHG emission estimates for the Project are presented, as CO2e, in table 4.11.1-7. Based on the emission estimates presented, actual GHG emissions from operation of the modified compressor stations have the potential to exceed the 25,000 metric tpy reporting threshold for the Mandatory Reporting Rule. The Mandatory Reporting Rule does not require emission control devices and is strictly a reporting requirement forstationary sources based on actual emissions.  If the actual emissions from any of the compressor stations are equal to or greater than 25,000 metric tpy, Algonquin would be required to comply with all applicable requirements ofthe rule. State Air Quality Regulations This section discusses the potentially applicable state air regulations for the proposed facilities. These regulations include state permitting programs, which are further described by state in the following sections.  Some states within the Project area have developed standards for mobile sources or construction activities.  New York and Connecticut developed standards to limit emissions from diesel engines through idling restrictions (i.e., 6 NYCRR Part 217-3, and RCSA § 22a-174-19), and New York developed standards on diesel engine retrofitting in 6 NYCRR Part 248 on diesel engine retrofitting. These standards as they apply to Projectactivities are further described in section 4.11.1.3. New York The NYSDEC authorizes both construction and operation of emission sources under one permit. Facilities apply for and are issued minor facility registrations (for minor NSR sources) under 6 NYCRR Subpart 201-4 and state facility permits (for synthetic minor sources or minor NSR sources with emissions above certain thresholds) under 6 NYCRR Subpart 201-5. Emission sources or activities listed under 6 NYCRR Subpart 201-3 are exempt from the registration and permitting provisions of 6 NYCRR Subparts 201-4, 201-5, and 201-6. Project activities involving air permitting associated with the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations have been summarized underfederal air permitting programs.  4-233 Project activities in New York also include modifications to the Peekskill, Cortlandt, and Stony Point M&R Stations. The modifications to the Peekskill and Cortlandt M&R Stations would include new natural gas-fired in-line gas heaters; however, because the maximum rated heat input capacity of the heaters are proposed to be less than 10 MMBtu/hr. Algonquin has reviewed the current design of these M&R stations and determined that state-level permits would not be required forthese activities. Connecticut The CTDEEP has established state NSR permitting thresholds at RCSA § 22a-174-3a(a)(1) for new emission units and modifications to existing units of 15 tons or more per year of any individual air pollutant. The CTDEEP also has a permit-by-rule program to which the Project would be subject in RCSA § 22a-174-3b. Project activities involving air permitting associated with the Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations have been summarized under federal air permitting programs. The proposed replacement emergency generators for the Cromwell and Chaplin Compressor Stations would be operated under a permit-by-rule. Project activities in Connecticut include modifications to 13 existing M&R stations, the installation of one new M&R station, and the removal of an existing M&R station. The proposed modifications to the 13 existing M&R stations range in scale from a complete station rebuild, to adding new in-line gas heaters, or adding or replacing a meter run. The proposed new Oakland Heights M&R Station would include an in-line gas heater. Algonquin has reviewed the current design of these M&R stations and determined that state-level permits would not be required for these activities. Massachusetts The MADEP requires that any natural gas-fired fuel utilization equipment resulting in an increase in potential emissions of any single air contaminant equal to or greater than 1 tpy and with a rated maximum heat input capacity of greater than 10 MMBtu/hr and less than 40 MMBtu/hr obtain a Limited Plan Approval prior to construction. However, emissions from emission units installed in accordance with the Industry Performance Standards at 310 Code of CMR 7.26 are not included when calculating an increase in potential emissions for purposes of determining applicability under 310 CMR 7.02(4)(a)1 and 2. Any fuel utilization equipment with a rated maximum heat input capacity of less than 10 MMBtu/hr and utilizing natural gas is exempt from Massachusetts plan approval requirements. Project activities in Massachusetts include two new proposed M&R stations and proposed modifications to eightexistingM&Rstations.  The newAssonetand WestRoxburyM&RStations would include new in-line heaters. Modifications to eight existing M&R stations range from replacing existing natural gas-fired in-line gas heaters to adding a low flow meter. Algonquin has reviewed the current design of these M&R stations and determined that state-level permits would not be required for these activities. 4-234 4.11.1.3 Air Emission Impacts and Mitigation Construction Emissions Air emissions would be generated during construction of the new pipeline, replacement of existing pipeline, modifications at five existing compressor stations, construction of three new M&R stations, modifications at 24 existing M&R stations, and removal of one M&R station.  Construction activities for the proposed facilities and pipeline replacement activities would result in temporary increases in emissions of some pollutants due to the use of equipment powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Construction activities would also result in the temporary generation of fugitive dust due to land clearing, ground excavation, and cut and fill operations. Indirect emissions during construction of the Project would be generated by delivery vehicles and construction workers commuting to and from work areas.  Construction related emission estimates were based on the anticipated types of non-road and on-road equipment and their projected level of use, as well as fugitive dust emission estimates associated with construction activities. Table 4.11.1-6 presents the total direct and indirect estimated construction emissions for 2015 and 2016.  TABLE 4.11.1-6 Potential Construction Emissions (tons per year) for the AIM Project  2015 Direct Construction 2016 Direct Construction 2015 Indirect Construction 2016 Indirect Construction b b Pollutant Emissions a Emissions a Emissions Emissions  NOx 66.2 98.1 1.6 2.1 CO 116.6 155.2 11.1 14.8 SO2 0.1 0.2 0.02 0.02 PM10 59.6 43.1 0.05 0.06 PM2.5 10.5 c 11.1 c 0.05 c 0.06 c VOC 8.1 11.8 0.4 0.6 CO2e 13,879 23,780 1,056 1,381 HAP (total) 0.4 0.7 0.2 0.2 ____________________ a Direct emissions include fugitive dust emissions and non-road and on-road construction emissions. b Indirect emissions include construction worker commuting emissions. c A separate PM2.5 emission estimate was not provided for non-road and on-road construction emissions or for construction worker commuting emissions. PM2.5 emissions were conservatively assumed to be the same as PM10 emissions for non-road and on-road construction emissions.  Fugitive dust would result from land clearing, grading, excavation, concrete work, and vehicle traffic on paved and unpaved roads. The amount of dust generated would be a function of construction activity, soil type, soil moisture content, wind speed, precipitation, vehicle traffic, vehicle types, and roadway characteristics.  Emissions would be greaterduring dry periods and in areas of fine-textured soils subject to surface activity. Algonquin has prepared a Fugitive Dust Control Plan that describes the mitigation measures that would be implemented to control fugitive dust during Project construction, especially in sensitive areas such as road crossings, residences, and nonattainment areas. The mitigation measures described in the Fugitive Dust Control Plan are, in part: 4-235  minimize the generation of fugitive dust by: a. watering the construction workspaceand access roads; b. providing measures to limit track-out onto the roads (e.g. gravel entrances road cleanup); c. maintaining a speed limitof 5 miles per hour(mph) on unsurfaced roads;and d. covering open-bodied haul trucks and other measures to prevent hauled loads from generating dust;  provide authority to construction inspectors to direct dust mitigation measures and stop work until dust control measures are installed; and  establish monitoring for PM10 and recordkeeping of dust control as implemented, with a dedicated monitor in place where construction would occur within 200 feet of a receptor (e.g., residence, church, orbusiness). We have reviewed the Fugitive Dust Control Plan and find it acceptable.  The construction phase of the proposed Project would result in the generation of diesel combustion emissions associated with the operation of construction equipment and vehicles. New York and Connecticut developed standards to limit emissions from diesel engines through idling restrictions (i.e., 6 NYCRR Part 217-3, and RCSA § 22a-174-19). In addition, some of the states that would be affected by the Project have developed standards (e.g., 6 NYCRR Part 248 on diesel engine retrofitting) for other methods of reducing diesel emissions, such as the use of low sulfur diesel and advanced pollution control technologies. Algonquin provided an estimate of construction-related emissions, which are presented in table 4.11.1-6 that includes diesel combustion emissions for the AIM Project. Additionally, Algonquin has committed to using ultra low sulfur diesel fuel and best available technology on non-road engines where feasible, to limit emissions from diesel combustion. These construction emissions would occur over the duration of construction activity and would be emitted at different times and locations along the length of the Project. With the mitigation measures proposed by Algonquin, air quality impacts from construction equipment would be temporary and should not resultin a significant impact on regionalair quality. Operation Emissions Modifications to the five compressor stations, modifications to five existing M&R stations, and three new M&R stations would be sources of air emissions during operation of the Project. One of the five compressor station modifications would require PSD review for GHG emissions, three of the five compressor station modifications would require new state-level or minor source NSR permits, and all five of the compressor station modifications would require revisions to the existing facility Title V operating permits. Tables 4.11.1-7 to 4.11.1-11 provide the potential emissions for the compressor station modifications.  4-236 TABLE 4.11.1-7 Potential Operational Emissions for the StonyPoint Compressor Station

However, Algonquin provided an estimate of representative potential emissions from new proposed combustion sources at M&R stations, which are presented in table 4.11.1-12. TABLE 4.11.1-12 Potential Emissions from New Combustion Sources at M&R Stations for the AIM Project (tons per year)  a M&R Station CO NOx VOC SO2 PM10 PM2.5 CO2e  New Bedford 8 5 1.5 <0.1 0.4 0.4 6,500 West Roxbury 1 0.5 0.2 <0.1 0.3 0.3 813 Assonet 0.1 0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 81 Oakland 0.1 0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 81 Heights Willimantic 0.1 0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 81 Guilford 0.2 0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 163 Peekskill 0.2 0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 163 Cortlandt 0.1 0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 81 ____________________ a These emissions represent the estimated GHG emission estimates for similarly sized gas heaters on the Algonquin system, scaled based on combustion capacity.  We received comments regarding leakage or fugitive releases from the proposed facilities. Fugitive releases at each compressor station were included in the in tables 4.11.1-7 to 4.11.1-11. Non-combustion related emissions would also occur from the pipeline and at the proposed M&R stations during normal operation. These emissions would include fugitive VOC releases from storage vessels and truck loading operations, as well as fugitive natural gas releases from piping components. Table 4.11.113 provides an annual estimate of these emission sources. 4-240 TABLE 4.11.1-13 Non-Routine and Fugitive Operating Emissions (tons per year) for the AIM Project  Pollutant  Fugitives & Non-Routine Fugitives & Non-Routine (M&R Stations) (Pipeline)  Total  VOC CO2e  55.4 2.7 68,968 712  58.1 69,680  Algonquin provided a summary of practices that would be implemented at modified compressor stations associated with the Project and practices that are currently in place at all Algonquin facilities to minimize methane emissions, which are a major source of GHG emissions from the proposed Project.  Algonquin would use highly efficient turbine technology at the modified compressor stations, which would minimize emissions by being appropriately sized, efficient, and would include dry seals to minimize fugitive emissions. Algonquin also has a program in place for minimizing methane emissions at all of their facilities. Measures include replacing wet seals with dry seals at compressors, replacing older infrastructure to reduce blowdowns, installing leak detection monitoring systems, and participating in the EPA's National Gas Star Program to share bestpractices for reducing methane emissions.  Due to modifications on existing equipment and/or removal of existing compressors, the potential emissions of most pollutants at the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations would be reduced from their current potential levels. However, Algonquin completed screening-level air quality modeling for NO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and SO2 using the U.S. EPA’s AERMOD model for the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Station modifications, and using the U.S. EPA’s AERSCREEN model for the Cromwell, Chaplin, and Burrillville Compressor Stations modifications to estimate the potential impacts on air quality as a result of the modifications. Table 4.11.1-14 summarizes the results of the modeling analyses. The modeling analyses for all modeled pollutants at all five compressor stations showed that the Project, combined with background pollutant levels, would not contribute to a violation of the NAAQS.  We reviewed the modeling analyses and agree with these conclusions. As shown in table 4.11.1-6, construction of the AIM Project would result in the generation of approximately 40,096 tons (36,374 metric tons) of GHG emissions, as measured in CO2e. As shown in tables 4.11.1-7 to 4.11.1-11 and 4.11.1-13, operation of the modified compressor stations and non-routine and fugitive emissions from M&R stations and pipeline operation would result in a maximum of 1,038,096 tpy (941,745 metric tons) of GHG emissions, as measured in CO2e, if operated at full capacity (i.e., 8,760 hours per year). Although the GHG emissions appear large, the emissions are very small (0.4 percent) in comparison to the 2000 inventory of GHG emissions in the New England region of the United States of 224.01 metric tons of CO2e (NSCAUM, 2004). Based on the identified estimated emissions from operation of the proposed Project facilities and review of the modeling analysis, we agree that the Project would result in continued compliance with the NAAQS, which are protective of human health, including children, the elderly, and sensitive populations. We received several comments concerning the risk of radon exposure associated with the burning of natural gas at compressor stations and the in-home burning of natural gas originating from the Marcellus shale. In particular, we received comments that natural gas from the Marcellus shale region contains radon at much higher concentrations than gas produced in the Gulf Coast region. The downstream use of natural gas in the market areas, including the effects of burning natural gas and exposure to radoninhomes, is beyond the scopeofthis EIS. Although the impacts oftransportation of natural gas todownstream users are outside the scope of the EIS and beyond our jurisdiction, we have provided general background and a review of the literature on radon. 4-241 TABLE 4.11.1-14 Summary of Predicted Air Quality Impacts for the AIM Project  Project Project Impact + Averaging Background Impact Background 333Pollutant Period (μg/m) (μg/m) (μg/m)  NAAQS 3(μg/m)  NAAQS Consumed by Background and Project Impact (percent)  a Stony Point Compressor Station NO2 1-Hour 77.8 65.6 143.4 Annual 18.1 5.6 23.7 PM2.5 24-Hour 22.5 3.3 25.8 Annual 8.2 0.5 8.7 PM10 24-Hour 39.0 5.5 44.5 CO 1-Hour 1,150 488.2 1,638.2 8-Hour 920 265.2 1,185.2 SO2 1-Hour 23.6 10.1 33.7 3-Hour 30.7 8.2 38.9 24-Hour 13.1 3.1 16.2 Annual 3.3 0.3 3.6 a Southeast Compressor Station NO2 1-Hour 77.8 65.1 142.9 Annual 18.1 6.8 24.9 PM2.5 24-Hour 24.0 3.4 27.4 Annual 9.0 0.5 9.5 PM10 24-Hour 39.0 5.5 44.5 CO 1-Hour 1,150 348.9 1,498.9 8-Hour 920 228.8 1,148.8 SO2 1-Hour 23.6 6.2 29.8 3-Hour 30.7 7.4 38.1 24-Hour 13.1 3.4 16.5 Annual 3.3 0.2 3.5 a Cromwell Compressor Station NO2 1-Hour 87.1 54.3 141.4 Annual -5.1 5.1 PM2.5 24-Hour 22.3 2.0 24.3 Annual 8.8 0.3 9.1 PM10 24-Hour 23.3 2.0 25.3 CO 1-Hour 1,795.4 121.9 1,917.3 8-Hour 1,337.0 109.7 1,446.7 SO2 1-Hour 0.01 0.5 0.5 3-Hour 0.007 0.5 0.5 24-Hour -0.3 0.3 Annual -<0.1 <0.1 a Chaplin Compressor Station NO2 1-Hour 87.1 72.5 159.6 Annual -6.8 6.8 PM2.5 24-Hour 22.0 3.4 25.4 Annual 7.9 0.6 8.5 PM10 24-Hour 23.3 3.4 26.7 CO 1-Hour 1,795.4 162.5 1,957.9 8-Hour 1,337.0 146.3 1,483.3  188 100 35 12 150 40,000 10,000 196 1,300 365 80 188 100 35 12 150 40,000 10,000 196 1,300 365 80 188 100 35 12 150 40,000 10,000 196 1,300 365 80 188 100 35 12 150 40,000 10,000  76.2 23.7 73.7 72.5 29.7 4.1 11.9 17.2 3.0 4.4 4.5 76.0 24.9 78.2 79.2 29.7 3.7 11.5 15.2 2.9 4.5 4.4 75.2 5.1 69.4 75.8 16.9 4.8 14.5 0.3 <0.1 0.1 0.1 84.9 6.8 72.6 70.8 17.8 4.9 14.8  4-242 TABLE 4.11.1-14 (cont’d) Summary of Predicted Air Quality Impacts for the AIM Project  Project Project Impact + Averaging Background Impact Background NAAQS 3333Pollutant Period (μg/m) (μg/m) (μg/m) (μg/m)  Percent of NAAQS Impact  SO2 1-Hour 0.01 1.5 1.5 196 3-Hour 0.007 1.5 1.5 1,300 24-Hour -0.9 0.9 365 Annual -0.2 0.2 80 a Burrillville Compressor Station NO2 1-Hour 78.3 79.5 157.8 188 Annual -7.4 7.4 100 PM2.5 24-Hour 17.7 6.8 24.5 35 Annual 6.6 1.1 7.7 12 PM10 24-Hour 23.0 6.8 29.8 150 CO 1-Hour 2,139.2 175.2 2,314.4 40,000 8-Hour 1,489.8 157.7 1,647.5 10,000 SO2 1-Hour 0.02 4.6 4.6 196 3-Hour 0.01 4.6 4.6 1,300 24-Hour -2.8 2.8 365 Annual -0.4 0.4 80 ____________________ a Three operating scenarios were modeled.

It is produced by the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is found in uranium ores; phosphate rock; shales; igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, gneiss, and schist; and, to a lesser degree, in common rocks such as limestone. Radioactive decay is a natural, spontaneous process in which an atom of one element decays or breaks down to form another element by losing atomic particles (protons, neutrons, or electrons). (USGS, 2014). The decayofeach radioactive elementoccurs at a veryspecific rate. Howfastan elementdecays is measured in terms of the element “half-life," or the amount of time for one half of a given amount of the element to decay to a stable non-radioactive element. The half-life of radon is only 3.8 days, which means that, if a jar was filled with radon, only half of the radon would be left after 3.8 days. But the newly made daughter products of radon would also be in the jar, including polonium, bismuth, and lead (USGS, 2014). The first decay product of radon is Polonium 218, which has a half-life of about 3 minutes. The Polonium decays to Lead 214, which has a half-life of about 27 minutes; Lead 214 decays to Bismuth 214, which has a half-life of 19.7 minutes; and Bismuth 214 decays to Polonium 214, which then quickly decays to stable non-radioactive lead. Radon levels in outdoor air, indoor air, soil air, and groundwater can be very different. Outdoor air radon levels range from less than 0.1 to about 30 picocuries per liter (pCi/L). The EPA identifies the average outdoor radon levels at about 0.4 pCi/L. Radon in soil air (the air that occupies the pores in soil) ranges from 20 or 30 to more than 100,000 pCi/L; most soils in the United States contain between 200 and 2,000 pCi of radon per liter of soil air. The amount of radon dissolved in groundwater ranges from about 100 to nearly 3 million pCi/L (USGS, 2014). Radon in indoor air ranges from less than 1 to about 3,000 pCi/L. The EPA identifies that the average indoor radon level is 1.3 pCi/L and recommends that indoor levels be less than 2 to 4 pCi/L. Also, the U.S. Congress passed the Indoor Radon Abatement Act 4-243 Radon can be entrained in fossil fuels including natural gas. Because radon is not destroyed by combustion, burning natural gas containing radon can increase the level of radon within a home (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2010). While radon is inert, long-term (chronic) exposure to its decay products (progeny) can be carcinogenic (lung cancer), with increased risk to smokers.  Most radon in homes comes from radon in the soil that seeps into homes through cracks in the foundation or slab (EPA, 2014f). Radon is also found in the water in homes, in particular, homes that have their own well rather than municipal water. However, radon from water in the home generally contributes to only a small proportion (less than 5 percent) of the total radon in indoor air in most housing (EPA, 2014f). People may also ingest trace amounts of radon with food and water. However, inhalation is the main route of entry into the body for radon and its decay products. Almost all risk from radon comes from breathing air containing radon and its decay products.  We received comments concerning the potential buildup of decay products within the pipeline and the risk of releasing these products to the environment either during pipeline maintenance or the removal of existing pipe. It should be noted that the half-lives of the radioactive decay products are relatively short (under 1 hour combined) and that, over time, these products would decay to nonradioactive lead.  As a result, only a limited amount ofradioactive decaymaterialwould be in the pipeline at any given time because any material that is within the pipeline for a prolonged period would become non-radioactive.  Algonquin would clean the pipeline to be removed prior to its being reused for another other purpose. Algonquin also conducts annual inspections and regular cleaning of its operational pipelines. Any liquids or solids removed during these cleanings would be collected and treated as hazardous material that would be disposed of at a licensed facility in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. These measures would minimize the risk that any radioactive solids would be released to the environment. In early 2012, a paper raised concern regarding radon levels in natural gas from the Marcellus shale (Resnikoff, 2012). This paper used theoretical calculations to identify that radon concentrations in Marcellus shale natural gas range between 36.9 and 2,576 pCi/L, with a resulting estimated concentrations in the home of 0.0187 to 0.482 pCi/L. However, a subsequent study by the USGS found that concentrations of radon in natural gas samples from the Marcellus shale and overlapping Devonian sandstones, as measured at the wellhead, ranged from 1 to 79 pCi/L and 7 to 65 pCi/L, respectively (Rowan and Kraemer, 2012). These results would be further diluted in household air, which was outside the scope of the study. In July 2012, a study used natural gas samples collected from Texas Eastern and Algonquin pipelines from the Marcellus shale gas fields (Anspaugh, 2012). The samples from this study presented measured radon concentrations in natural gas pipelines ranging from 16.9 to 44.1 pCi/L, with resulting in-home concentrations estimated at 0.0042 to 0.0109 pCi/L. These levels are significantly less than the average indoorand outdoor radon levels. We note that several factors limit the indoor exposure to radon from natural gas. Radon’s half-life, defined as the time it takes for the element to decay to half its initial concentration, is relatively short (3.8 days). The time needed to gather, process, store, and deliver natural gas allows a portion of the entrained radon to decay, which decreases the amount of radon in the gas before it is used in a residence. Additionally, radon concentrations are reduced when a natural gas stream undergoes upstream processing to remove liquefied petroleum gas. Processing can remove an estimated 30 to 75 percent of the radon from natural gas (Johnson et al., 1973). Other research suggests that the cumulative decay of radon from 4-244 wellhead to burner tip is around 60 percent (Gogolak, 1980). Also, radon exposure associated with the combustion of natural gas may be lower now due to the improved ventilation and increased energy efficiency of modern boilers, furnaces, and hot water heaters, as well as new building codes requiring venting of gas-fired stoves and ovens. The levels of radon and its decay products associated with the burning of natural gas at compressor stations would be lower than at the wellhead. As is the case for the burning of natural gas in the home, the levels of radon and its decay products would be reduced due to upstream processing, natural decay, and efficiency of the turbines. Any radon in the compressor station emissions would be vented to the atmosphere and quickly diluted by mixing with the surrounding air. While the FERC has no regulatory authority to set, monitor, or respond to indoor radon levels, many local, state, and federal entities (e.g., the EPA) establish and enforce radon exposure standards for indoor air.  Based on the analysis above, we find that the risk of exposure to radon is not significant. 4.11.2 Noise Noise quality can be affected both during construction and operation of facilities. The magnitude and frequency of environmental noise may vary considerably over the course of the day, throughout the week, and across seasons, in part due to changing weather conditions and the effects of seasonal vegetative cover. Two measures that relate the time-varying quality of environmental noise to its known effect on people are the 24-hourequivalentsound level(Leq)and day-night sound level(Ldn). The Leq is the level of steady sound with the same total (equivalent) energy as the time-varying sound of interest, averaged over a 24-hour period. The Ldn is the Leq plus 10 dBA added to account for people’s greater sensitivity to nighttime sound levels (typically considered between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.). The A-weighted scale is used to assess noise impacts because human hearing is less sensitive to low and high frequencies than mid-range frequencies. The human ear’s threshold of perception for noise change is considered to be 3 dBA; 6 dBA is clearly noticeable to the human ear, and 10 dBA is perceived as a doubling of noise. 4.11.2.1 Existing Noise Levels Algonquin provided ambient noise surveys and acoustical analyses for the five proposed compressor station modifications, the five existing M&R stations with significant proposed modifications, three new proposed M&R stations, and two new mainline regulators (MLR) that would have an NSA within 0.5 mile ofthe station.  Stony Point Compressor Station The Stony Point Compressor Station is located in Rockland County, New York, approximately 2 miles west of Stony Point, New York. The station is located approximately 0.5 mile east of the Palisades Interstate Parkway. The most recent acoustical survey was completed for the Stony Point Compressor Station in 2006. There are several NSAs located in the vicinity, the closest of which are residences located generally west, east, and south of the compressor station site. The distance and direction from the closest existing or proposed compressor building to the NSAs are presented in table 4.11.2-1 and shown on figure 4.11.2-1. Although existing noise levels exceed our 55 dBA Ldn criterion at two NSAs, the four existing compressor units to be abandoned at this station were authorized prior to implementation of noise standards. 4-245 TABLE 4.11.2-1 Noise Levels at the Nearest Noise-Sensitive Areas to the Proposed Modified Compressor Stations for the AIM Projecta  b,c Location/Facility Distance to NSA (feet) Direction to NSA Ambient Noise Ldn (dBA)  NEW YORK Existing Stony Point Compressor Station NSA 1 650 West-southwest 62.9 NSA 2 700 West 63.0 NSA 3 800 South-southeast 49.9 NSA 4 1,000 East 49.6 Existing Southeast Compressor Station d NSA 1 1,200 Northwest 66.0 (37.7) d NSA 2 1,300 South-southwest 52.2 (36.9) d NSA 3 2,200 Southeast 53.3 (31.4) CONNECTICUT Existing Cromwell Compressor Station d NSA 1 850 West 60.6 (48.7) d, e NSA 2 920 Southwest 60.6 (63.2) d, e NSA 3 1,620 North-northwest 60.6 (58.2) Existing Chaplin Compressor Station d NSA 1 1,350 North-northeast 48.0 (37.3) d NSA 2 1,200 Northeast 46.7 (38.5) d NSA 3 1,400 East-northeast 46.7 (36.0) RHODE ISLAND Existing Burrillville Compressor Station NSA 1 2,050 East-northeast 56.9 NSA 2 2,100 Northeast 52.4 NSA 3 3,320 North 52.4 e f NSA 4 3,610 West 45.0 ____________________ NA – not available a The modifications at the existing Oxford Compressor Station would only involve the restaging of an existing compressor unit.

The Connecticut state line borders the station on the east side, and Interstate 84 borders the north property line of the station. The most recent acoustical survey was completed for the Southeast Compressor station in 2009. There are several NSAs located in the vicinity, which are located generally west, southwest, and southeast of the compressor station site and include residences and an apartment complex. The distance and direction from the closest existing or proposed compressor building to the NSAs are presented in table 4.11.2-1 and shown on figure 4.11.2-2.   Cromwell Compressor Station The Cromwell Compressor Station is located in Middlesex County, Connecticut. The property for the station is primarily located in the Township of Cromwell, although there is a small section of the property that is in the Township of Rocky Hill. The property is heavily wooded, except for the station access road and station site. The most recent acoustical survey was completed for the Cromwell Compressor Station on January 23, 2014. Algonquin identified the only NSA as a residence located 850 feet west of the existing compressor building as presented in table 4.11.2-1 and shown on figure 4.11.2-3. However, we also note two additional residences, one of which is located approximately 920 feet southwest of the existing compressor building, and the second of which is located approximately 1,620 feet north-northwest of the proposed new compressor building. We have included these two NSAs in our analysis. Also, existing noise levels exceed our 55 dBA Ldn criterion at two NSAs; however, the majority of the existing compressorunits at this station were authorized prior to implementation ofnoise standards. Chaplin Compressor Station The Chaplin Compressor Station is located in Windham County, Connecticut, approximately 2 miles northwest of the town of Chaplin. The property is heavily wooded, except for the station access road and station site. The most recent acoustical survey was completed for the Chaplin Compressor Station in 2007. The nearest NSAs are residences located along Tower Hill Road north and northeast of the station. The distance and direction to the nearest NSAs from the nearest existing or proposed compressor building are presented in table 4.11.2-1 and shown on figure 4.11.2-4. Burrillville Compressor Station The Burrillville Compressor Station is located in Providence County, Rhode Island, approximately 25 miles from the city of Providence. The property is heavily wooded, except for the station site. The land use in the surrounding area is primarily rural and recreational. The most recent acoustical survey was completed for the Burrillville Compressor Station in 2014. The nearest NSAs are both permanent and non-permanent (i.e., vacation) residences. Algonquin identified the distance and direction to two of the nearest NSAs (representing multiple residences) from the nearest existing or proposed compressor building, which are presented in table 4.11.2-1 and shown on figure 4.11.2-5. We also note a group of residences are located north of the existing compressor building, represented by the closest NSA at 3,320 feet from the facility, and a group of residences west of the proposed new compressor building, represented by the closest NSA at 3,610 feet from the facility. We have included these NSAs in our analysis. Also, existing noise levels exceed our 55 dBA Ldn criterion at one NSA; however, three of the five existing compressor units at this station were authorized prior to implementation of noise standards. 4-248 Figure 4.11.2-2AIM Project Existing Southeast Compressor Station Closest Noise-Sensitive Areas Figure 4.11.2-4AIM Project Existing Chaplin Compressor Station Closest Noise-Sensitive Areas The Project involves modification to two existing M&R stations in New York that involve major changes with the potential to generate additional noise. The Project also involves the addition of one proposed MLR in New York. The existing Peekskill M&R and Cortlandt M&R Stations are both located in Westchester County, New York. The proposed Stoney Street MLR would also be located in Westchester County, New York. Acoustical analyses were completed for the Peekskill and Cortlandt M&R Stations on March 27, 2014 and for the proposed Stoney Street MLR from November 13 to 14, 2013. The nearest NSA to the existing M&R stations and the proposed new MLR site are presented in table 4.11.2-2. The Project involves modification to two existing M&R stations in Connecticut that involve major changes with the potential to generate additional noise. The Project also involves the addition of one proposed M&R station and one proposed MLR in Connecticut. The existing Willimantic M&R Station is located in Windham County, Connecticut. The existing Guilford M&R Station is located in New Haven County, Connecticut. The proposed new Oakland Heights M&R Station would be located in New London County, Connecticut. The proposed new Clapboard Ridge Road MLR would be located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Acoustical surveys were completed for the existing Willimantic and Guilford M&R Stations, the proposed new Oakland Heights M&R Station, and the proposed new Clapboard Ridge Road MLR from November 13 to 14, 2013. The distance and direction to the nearest NSAs from each of these existing or proposed stations are presented in table 4.11.2-2. In Massachusetts, the Project involves modification to one existing M&R stations that involves major changes with the potential to generate additional noise. The Project also involves the addition of two proposed M&R stations. The existing New Bedford M&R Station and the proposed new Assonet M&R Station would be located in Bristol County, Massachusetts. The proposed new West Roxbury M&R Station would be located in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Acoustical surveys were completed for the proposed new Assonet and West Roxbury M&R Stations from November 13 to14, 2013. Due to the commercial/industrial nature of the existing New Bedford M&R Station and relative distance to the nearest NSAs, an acoustical survey was not completed for this station; however, an acoustical analysis was completed using estimated ambient sound levels. The distance and direction to the nearest NSAs from each of these proposed stations are presented in table 4.11.2-2. 4.11.2.2 Noise Regulatory Requirements Federal Noise Regulations In 1974, the EPA published Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety. This document provides information for state and local governments to use in developing their own ambient noise standards. The EPA has indicated an Ldn of 55 dBA protects the public from indoor and outdoor activity interference. We have adopted this criterion and use it to evaluate to potential noise impacts from the proposed Project at NSAs. Due to the 10 dBA nighttime penalty added prior to the calculation of the Ldn, for a facility to meet the 55 dBA Ldn limit, it must be designed such that actual constant noise levels on a 24-hour basis do not exceed 48.6 dBA Leqat any NSA.  The proposed modifications at 19 of the M&R stations associated with the Project, as well as the MLR sites located greater than 0.5 mile from nearby NSAs, would not change or affect noise conditions at nearby receptors; therefore, no further analysis of these facilities is required. 4-253 TABLE 4.11.2-2 Background Noise Levels at the Nearest NSAs to the Existing and Proposed M&R Stations and MLR Sites for the AIM Project  Location/Facility Distance to NSA Direction to NSA Ambient Ldn  a  NEW YORK Existing Peekskill M&R Station b NSA 1 170 feet Southeast 57.9 dBA Existing Cortlandt M&R Station b NSA 1 90 feet Northwest 58.7 dBA Proposed Stoney Street MLR NSA 1 275 feet Northeast 47.5 dBA c CONNECTICUT Existing Willimantic M&R Station b NSA 1 90 feet North 47.4 dBA Existing Guilford M&R Station b NSA 1 350 feet Northeast 49.8 dBA Proposed Oakland Heights M&R Station NSA 1 130 feet North 50.5 dBA c Proposed Clapboard Ridge Road MLR NSA 1 90 feet North 49.2 dBA c MASSACHUSETTS Existing New Bedford M&R Station b NSA 1 2,200 feet South 50.0 dBA Proposed Assonet M&R Station NSA 1 325 feet South-Southeast 59.7 dBA c Proposed West Roxbury M&R Station NSA 1 100 feet Southwest 52.1 dBA c ____________________ a Ambient levels based on noise surveys as described in table 4.11.2-1. b Ambient background noise level (Ldn) including the existing M&R station. c Ambient background noise level (Ldn) of the proposed M&R station or MLR site.  State and Local Noise Regulations New York There are no applicable statewide noise regulations in New York. Chapter 148 of the Town of Stony Point Town Code generally prohibits excessive noise, including operating an internal combustion powered machine without a proper muffler or other noise-deadening device (Town of Stony Point, 2014).  Chapter 96 of the Town of Southeast Code entitled “Noise Ordinance of the Town of Southeast, New York” sets a maximumsound level in light industrial areas to 80 dBA during the day and 70 dBA at night (or impulsive sound is limited to 90 and 80 dBA during the day and night, respectively). Exceptions to these noise standards apply to construction activities occurring Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., and Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. (Town of Southeast, 2014). Accordingly, the FERC noise standards establish more stringent noise requirements for Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations and thus impacts are discussed below based on the FERC standards. Connecticut Connecticut has established noise regulations that apply to the compressor stations, M&R stations, and MLR site. These noise regulations (Title 22a, Part 69, Section 22a-69-1/2/3/4) establish standard noise limits emitting from a sound source, as measured at certain Noise Zones (i.e., land use 4-254 TABLE 4.11.2-3 Summary of Connecticut Noise Zone Standards and Noise Limits  Receptor Class Receptor Class b Noise Zone/Class Emitter Receptor Class C Receptor Class B A/Daya A/Night Class C Emitter 70 dBA 66 dBA 61 dBA 51 dBA Class B Emitter 62 dBA 62 dBA 55 dBA 45 dBA Class A Emitter 62 dBA 55 dBA 55 dBA 45 dBA ________________ a Daytime is defined by Connecticut noise standards as the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. b Nighttime is defined by Connecticut noise standards as the hours between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Notes: Class A Noise Zone = generally defined as residential land use. Class B Noise Zone = generally defined as commercial land use. Class C Noise Zone = generally defined as industrial land use.  According to the Connecticut noise regulations, where mixed land use exists, the least restrictive of the class categories apply. In the case of the compressor stations, M&R stations, and MLR site, the noise level that corresponds to a Class C Emitter to a Receptor Class A would apply. Therefore, the station noise should not exceed 51 dBA Leq at the adjacent Class A Noise Zone (i.e., property line of the adjacent residences). Because these compressor stations are scheduled to operate on a 24-hour basis, the noise level emitted from these stations should not exceed a sound level of 51 dBA Leq at the adjacent Class A Noise Zone (i.e., property line of adjacent residences) to demonstrate compliance with the state standard. Consequently, the FERC sound requirement for a compressor station (i.e., an Ldn of 55 dBA, which corresponds to an Leq of 48.6 dBA at the nearby NSAs) is generally more stringent for residences than the Connecticut state noise requirements (sound level of 51 dBA Leq). However, in the unusual situation of a house set back on a very large parcel of land, the FERC sound level limit could be satisfied at the house and the Connecticut noise limit exceeded at the property line. Upon review of the site and existing NSAs forthe Project, this unusual condition does not exist.  The Town of Cromwell has established noise regulations in Chapter 168 of the town ordinances. Generally, industrial sites cannot exceed noise levels of 70 dBA to other industrial receptors, 66 dBA to other commercial receptors, or 61 dBA (daytime) or 51 dBA (nighttime) to residential receptors (Town of Cromwell, 2014).  Noise generated during construction is exempt from these requirements during daytime hours. As the state code criteria described above is more conservative than the town ordinance, and the FERC standard is more stringent than the state standard, the noise analysis for the Cromwell Compressor Station is based on the FERC standard. Rhode Island Rhode Island does not have any state-level noise regulations, but allows each individual community to regulate noise through community by-laws. No local noise ordinances were identified that would be applicable to the Project. Massachusetts Massachusetts has established noise regulations (310 CMR 7.10). The MADEP provided further guidance in a policy document dated February 1, 1990, which providesthe following noise standards. 4-255 A source of sound will be considered to be violating the MADEP’s noise regulation (310 CMR 7.10)ifthe source: 1. increases the broadband sound level by more than 10 dB above ambient (i.e., 10 dBA above ambient limit), or 2. produces a “pure tone” condition, when any octave band center frequency sound pressure level (SPL) exceeds the two adjacent centerfrequency SPLs by 3 decibels or more. These criteria are measured both at the property line and at the nearest inhabited residence. Ambient is defined as the lowest background A-weighted sound level that is exceeded 90 percent of the time (i.e., L90) (MADEP, 2014b). For the purposes of assessing the “pure tone” condition, the octave-band SPLs of 31.5 to 8,000 hertz were used. Based on review of the noise guideline adopted by the MADEP and site ambient sound surveys, the following summarizes the estimated noise criterion/guideline for Algonquin’s new meter stations in Massachusetts:  the noise attributable to the New Bedford M&R Station should be equal to or less than 50.0 dBA atthe closest residential property lines or nearby residences;  the noise attributable to the Assonet M&R Station should be equal to or less than 59.6 dBA at the closest residential property linesor nearby residences; and  the noise attributable to the West Roxbury M&R Station should be equal to or less than 49.1 dBA atthe property line of the station. In general, the resulting noise criteria for the new meter stations in Massachusetts are considered to be approximately equal to the FERC sound requirement (i.e., Leq of 48.6 dBA at nearby NSA) for the new West Roxbury M&R Station and higher than the FERC sound requirement for the existing New Bedford M&R Station and new AssonetM&R Station. The City of Boston’s Municipal Code (Chapter 16, Section 26) defines unreasonable or excessive noise as noise in excess of 50 dBA between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or in excess of 70 dBA at all other hours. As the state-level noise criteria are more stringent than the City of Boston’s municipal code, the analyses described above are based on the state’s standards. 4.11.2.3 Noise LevelImpacts and Mitigation Construction Noise Noise would be generated during construction of the pipeline and during construction and operation of the aboveground facilities. Pipeline construction would be conducted by a number of separate crews working at different locations along the pipeline route. The rate of progress of each crew would depend on the specific activities they are engaged in but would typically progress between a hundred and several thousand feet per day. An exception to this would be the crews involved in HDD construction, which would be stationary for weeks to months depending on the length of the drill and the hardness of the substrate being drilled. Thus, construction activities in any one area could last from several weeks to several months on an intermittent basis. Construction equipment would be operated on an as-needed basis during this period. While individuals in the immediate vicinity of the construction activities would experience an increase in noise, this effect would be temporary and local. Noise mitigation measures that would be employed during construction include ensuring that the sound muffling devices, which are provided as standard equipment by the construction equipment manufacturer, are kept in good working order. If needed, additional noise abatement techniques and other measures could be implemented during the construction phase to mitigate construction noise disturbances at NSAs. Generally, nighttime noise is not expected to increase during construction because most construction activities would be limited to daytime hours. 4-256 An exception to this would be certain HDD activities, which are expected to continue into the nighttime hours. Because of this and the fact that the equipment involved in the HDDs would be stationary for an extended period of time, there is a greater potential for a prolonged noise impact. Algonquin proposes to use the HDD method at two locations (Hudson River crossing and Interstate 84/Still River crossing). The Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River HDDs are anticipated to occur between March and October 2015, with an estimated duration of 5 and 7 months, respectively. Algonquin performed ambient noise surveys and acoustical assessments of the HDD sites within 0.5 mile of NSAs to determine background noise levels and the predicted noise levels at NSAs. The results of Algonquin’s noise assessments, including the distance and direction of the nearest NSAs from the HDD site, and the predicted noise resulting from each HDD operation are summarized in table 4.11.2-4. Additional NSAs are also present farther from the noise generating sources at the proposed HDD entrance/exit points; however, Project noise levels at further NSAs in each direction would be lower than presented in table 4.11.2-4 due to additional noise attenuation. The acoustical assessments indicate that mitigation would be necessary at all proposed HDD locations to reduce the predicted noise generated by the HDD operations below the FERC noise requirement (i.e., Ldn of 55 dBA) at the closest NSAs.  TABLE 4.11.2-4 Noise Quality Analysis for the Horizontal Directional Drilling Sites Associated with the AIM Project  Estimated Estimated Noise Potential Distance and Ldn of the Reductions Estimated Ldn Change in Ldn of Direction of the HDD from of the HDD HDD + the Planned HDD Site Closest NSA to Ambient Without mitigation with Mitigation Ambient Ambient a (Entry or Exit Point) Site Center Ldn Mitigation (dB) (dBA) Ldn (dBA) Noise (dB)  Hudson River HDD b HDD (west entry 330 feet/west45.9 66.6 13.1 53.5 54.2 8.3 site) southwest 490 feet/south c 45.9 68.8 14.0 54.8 55.4 9.5 610 feet/north 45.9 60.9 12.8 48.1 50.1 4.2 HDD (east entry 240 south 48.1 70.9 16.4 54.5 55.4 7.3 site) Interstate Highway 84/Still River HDD b HDD (south entry 450 57.8 66.9 13.1 53.8 59.3 1.5 site) feet/southeast HDD (north entry 400 feet/east 55.2 68.1 14.6 53.5 57.4 2.2 site) 410 feet/south 55.2 67.9 14.5 53.4 57.4 2.2 610 feet/west 55.2 64.1 14.4 49.7 56.3 1.1 ____________________ a Noise levels are based on ambient monitoring completed in the vicinity of the HDD entrance/exit point. b Both HDDs would be completed using the intersect method, which employs drill rigs on both sides of the crossing. As such, both ends of the HDD are referred to as the entry side. c No attenuation for foliage or land contour was assumed for this NSA based on the lack of vegetative cover between the HDD entrance/exit point and the NSA. Note: dB = decibels, dBA = decibels on the A-weighted scale  4-257  Hudson River HDD crossing (eastand west sides) a. use a “close-fit” partial enclosure for the hydraulic power unit (HPU) associated with the drilling rig (e.g., 16-foot barrier around the HPU); b. partially enclose the unenclosed engines(e.g., high-pressure mud pump); c. employ a “low-noise” generator for the mud/cleaning system (i.e., generator set designed with a factory-installed acousticalenclosure); and d. employ a residential–gradeexhaust silencer on all engines.  Interstate 84/Still River HDD crossing (north and south sides) a. employ a temporary noise barrier along the south side and east side of the South Side HDD site workspace (i.e., constructed of plywood panels or noise barrier blanket material (e.g., 16-foot high); b. use a “close-fit” partial enclosure for the South Side HDD HPU associated with the drilling rig (e.g., 16-foot barrieraround the HPU); c. partially enclose the South Side HDD unenclosed engines (e.g., high-pressure mud pump) and the North Side HPU associated with the drilling rig; d. use a “noise-reduction tent” over the HDD workspace (constructed of a heavy canvas material supported over steel trusses and lined with acoustical soundabsorptive/barrier materialdesigned with a septum mass layer); e. employ a “low-noise” generator for the mud/cleaning systems (i.e., generator set designed with a factory-installed acousticalenclosure); and f. employ a residential–gradeexhaust silencer on all engines. We reviewed Algonquin’s noise assessment and agree that the mitigation measures committed to by Algonquin should result in noise levels in compliance with the FERC’s noise criterion of 55 dBA Ldn at nearby NSAs. However, given the populated nature of the areas surrounding the two proposed HDD crossings, we recommend that:  Algonquin file in the weekly construction status reports the following for the Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River HDD sites: a.  the noise measurements from the nearest NSA for each drill entry site, obtained atthe start of drilling operations; b. the noise mitigation that Algonquin implemented at the start of drilling operations; and c. any additional mitigation measures that Algonquin would implement if the initial noise measurements exceeded an Ldn of 55 dBA at the nearest NSA and/orincreased noiseis over ambient conditions greater than 10 decibels. 4-258 In response to traffic concerns raised by municipalities due to the proposed construction along portions of the West Roxbury Lateral, Algonquin has committed to nighttime construction along Providence Highway and the High Street/East Street intersection along the West Roxbury Lateral to minimize traffic impacts on this roadway. While Providence Highway is a busy commercial street, its intersection with High Street and East Street is within a residential area. There are some NSAs in proximity to this area that could be impacted by noise and vibration generated by nighttime construction. However, we note that the Project construction would be similar to other road construction activities, which would also likely occur at night to avoid similar traffic impacts. Further, Algonquin would be required to use smaller or less equipment to construct in the area due to smaller workspace constraints in the Dedham/West Roxbury area, resulting in lesserimpacts than a major road construction project.  Algonquin has estimated that construction in residential areas would progress about 40 to 200 feet per day, which means construction should last several days or a couple of weeks within any given neighborhood. Therefore, nighttime construction in these residential areas would result in a temporary impact on noise levels to the nearby NSAs. Section 4.8.3.1 describes Algonquin’s Environmental Complaint Resolution Procedure Plan, which would be available in the event of a landowner complaint during construction. Operational Noise The modified compressor stations would generate noise on a continuous basis (i.e., 24 hours per day) once operating. Some noise would also be generated by the operation of modified M&R stations, the proposed new M&R Stations, and the proposed new MLRs. The noise impact associated with the operation of these aboveground facilities would be limited to the vicinity of the facilities. The specific operational noise sources associated with these facilities and their estimated impact at the nearest NSAs are described below. Algonquin completed an acoustical analysis to identify the estimated noise impacts at the nearest NSAs from the proposed changes at the five compressor stations.  The results of these acoustical analyses are presented in table 4.11.2-5 and include various assumed noise control measures. Algonquin assumed the following noise mitigation measuresin its compressor station acousticalanalyses:  compressor building – enclosing the new turbine(s) and compressor(s), including the use of appropriate building materials;  adequate muffler system for each turbine exhaustsystem;  acoustical pipe insulation for outdoor aboveground gas piping;  adequate silencerfor each turbine airintake system;  low-noise lube oil cooler for each compressor unit;and/or  low-noise gas cooler. 4-259 TABLE 4.11.2-5 Noise Quality Analysis for the Compressor Stations Proposed to Be Modified for the AIM Project  Ldn Attributable Potential Change to the Station Ldn + Ldn of in Noise Level Distance and Current Station Modifications Proposed Changes Attributable to the Location/Facility Direction to NSA Ldn (dBA) a (dBA) (dBA) Station (dB)  NEW YORK a Existing Stony Point Compressor Station NSA 1 650 feet (WSW) 62.9 49.4 62.9 0.0 NSA 2 700 feet (W) 63.0 50.7 63.0 0.0 NSA 3 800 feet (SSE) 49.9 41.1 50.9 1.0 NSA 4 1,000 feet (E) 49.6 46.4 51.3 1.7 Existing Southeast Compressor Station NSA 1 1,200 (NW) 66.0 44.1 66.0 0.0 NSA 2 1,300 (SSW) 52.2 45.8 53.1 0.9 NSA 3 2,200 (SE) 53.3 40.7 53.5 0.2 CONNECTICUT Existing Cromwell Compressor Station b NSA 1 850 feet (W) 48.7 45.0 50.3 0.6 b NSA 2 920 feet (SW) 63.2 44.3 63.3 0.1 b NSA 3 1,620 feet (NNW) 58.2 39.4 58.2 0.0 Existing Chaplin Compressor Station NSA 1 1,200 feet (NNE) 48.0 41.7 48.9 0.9 NSA 2 1,100 feet (NE) 46.7 42.8 48.2 1.5 NSA 3 1,350 feet (ENE) 46.7 41.3 47.8 1.1 RHODE ISLAND Existing Burrillville Compressor Station NSA 1 2,050 feet (ENE) 56.9 39.2 57.0 c 0.1 NSA 2 2,100 feet (NE) 52.4 39.2 52.6 0.2 NSA 3 3,320 feet (N) 52.4 35.0 52.5 0.1 d NSA 4 3,610 feet (W) 45.0 34.3 45.4 0.4 ____________________ a Stony Point Compressor Station noise assessment does not account for the removal of 4 older compressor units; therefore, the projected future noise levels are conservative. b The existing compressor station is not the dominant noise source influencing ambient sound levels. The sound contribution from the compressor station only is provided. c Based on the FERC staff’s assessment of the noise data presented by Algonquin, the new station equipment would result in an imperceptible increase in noise at nearby NSAs. d Background noise levels were not measured because FERC staff added this NSA during the evaluation of the Project. Because no similar NSAs for which background levels were measured were available, a background noise level is not provided.  4-260 Although Algonquin evaluated the implementation of various mitigation measures at each compressor station, it is currently evaluating noise control measures needed at the existing compressor stations. We reviewed the compressor station noise analyses and agree that, if properly implemented, these noise control measures would ensure that noise attributable to the modified compressor stations would be either less than 55 dBA Ldn at nearby NSAs, or where the noise currently attributable to the compressor station is greater than 55 dBA Ldn, the noise attributable to the station modifications would cause no perceptible change to station noiselevels. At the Stony Point Compressor Station, existing noise levels are above 55 dBA Ldn as a result of existing compressor station equipment that was installed prior to implementation of the FERC noise criterion. These four units would be abandoned as a result of this project, resulting only in facilities installed after the FERC noise criterion. This would result in noise levels below those projected by Algonquin, as all units would be required to comply with the FERC criterion. However, to ensure noise levels from the Stony Point Compressor Station are not significant, we recommend that:  Algonquin file a noise survey with the Secretary no later than 60days after placing the authorized units at the Stony Point Compressor Station in service. If a full load condition noise survey of the entire station is not possible, Algonquin shall instead file an interim survey at the maximum possible horsepower load and file the full load survey within 6 months. If the noise attributable to the operation of all of the equipment at the Stony Point Compressor Station under interim or full horsepower load conditions exceeds an Ldn of 55 dBA at any nearby NSAs, Algonquin should file a report on what changes are needed and should install the additional noise controls to meet the level within 1 year of the in-service date. Algonquin should confirm compliance with the Ldn of 55 dBA requirement by filing a second noise survey with the Secretary no laterthan 60 daysafteritinstalls the additional noise controls. Because existing noise levels are above 55 dBA Ldn, Algonquin is still completing the final compressor station designs, and to ensure that the noise control measures used are properly implemented at the Southeast, Cromwell, and Burrillville Compressor Stations, we recommend that:  Algonquin should file noise surveys with the Secretary no later than 60days after placing the authorized units at the Southeast, Cromwell, and Burrillville Compressor Stations in service. If a full load condition noise survey of the entire station is not possible, Algonquin should file an interim survey at the maximum possible horsepower load and file the full load surveys within 6 months. If the noise attributable to the operation of the modified compressor station at full or interim power load conditions exceeds existing noise levels at any nearby NSAs that are currently at or above an Ldn of 55 dBA, or exceeds 55 dBA Ldn at any nearby NSAs that are currently below 55 dBA Ldn, Algonquin should file a report on what changes are needed and should install the additional noise controls to meet the level within 1 year of the in-service date. Algonquin should confirm compliance with the above requirement by filing a second noise survey with the Secretary no later than 60 daysafter itinstalls the additional noisecontrols.  Algonquin file a noise survey with the Secretary no later than 60days after placing the authorized units at the Chaplin Compressor Station in service. If a full load condition noise survey of the entire station is not possible, Algonquin shall instead file an interim survey at the maximum possible horsepower load and file the full load survey within 6 months. If the noise attributable to the operation of all of the equipment at the Chaplin Compressor Station under interim or full horsepower load conditions exceeds an Ldn of 55 dBA at any nearby NSAs, Algonquin should file a report on what changes are needed and should install the additional noise controls to meet the level within 1 year of the in-service date. Algonquin should confirm compliance with the Ldn of 55 dBA requirement by filing a second noise survey with the Secretary no laterthan 60 daysafteritinstalls the additional noise controls. 4-261 Algonquin also completed acoustical analyses on the modified M&R stations that would result in additional noise, the proposed new M&R stations, and the MLR sites that are within 0.5 mile of nearby NSAs and to determine what, if any, noise control measures would be needed to ensure compliance with federal and local noise ordinances.  The results of these acoustical analyses are presented in table 4.11.2-6 and indicate that the noise resulting from the operation of these facilities would be in compliance with the applicable noise standards. Algonquin has stated that they are currently evaluating noise control measures to be implemented at the proposed modified and new M&R stations and MLR sites. The acoustical analyses completed for these facilities included detailed recommendations for noise control measures, which, if properly implemented, would ensure that noise attributable to the facilities was less than 55 dBA Ldn. It is our experience that M&R stations and MLRs may vary widely in terms of actual noise impacts after being placed in service relative to predicted noise impacts from these stations. In addition, the number of residences in proximity to the proposed or existing stations further justify the need for post-construction noise surveys for several of the proposed modified and new M&R stations and MLR site to verify that noise would be within acceptable limits at nearby NSAs. To verify compliance with the FERC’s noise standards, we recommend that:  Algonquin file noise surveys with the Secretary no later than 60 days after placing the Guilford, Willimantic, Oakland Heights, and West Roxbury M&R Stations and the proposed new Clapboard Ridge Road MLR in service. If the noise attributable to the operation of any M&R Station or MLR at full load exceeds an Ldn of 55 dBA at any nearby NSA, Algonquin should file a report on what changes are needed and should install the additional noise controls to meet the level within 1 year of the in-service date. Algonquin should confirm compliance with the above requirement by filing a second noise survey with the Secretary no later than 60 days after it installs the additional noise controls. 4-262 TABLE 4.11.2-6 Noise Quality Analysis for the Applicable M&R Stations and the MLR Sites for the AIM Project  Ldn Attributable to Station Ldn + the New Station / Ambient Ldn after Distance and Current Ambient Modifications Proposed Changes Location/Facility Direction to NSA Ldn (dBA) (dBA) (dBA)  Potential Change in Ambient Noise Level (dB)  NEW YORK Existing Peekskill M&R Station NSA 1 170 feet (SE) 57.9 49.4 58.5 Existing Cortlandt M&R Station NSA 1 90 feet (NW) 58.7 53.0 59.7 Proposed Stoney Street MLR NSA 1 275 feet (NE) 47.5 47.3 50.4 CONNECTICUT Existing Willimantic M&R Station NSA 1 90 feet (N) 47.4 50.2 52.0 Existing Guilford M&R Station NSA 1 350 feet (NE) 49.8 39.7 50.2 Proposed Oakland Heights M&R Station NSA 1 130 feet (N) 50.5 46.4 51.9 Proposed Clapboard Ridge Road MLR NSA 1 90 feet (N) 49.2 50.5 52.9 MASSACHUSETTS Existing New Bedford M&R Station NSA 1 2,200 feet (S) 50.0 31.9 50.1 Proposed Assonet M&R Station NSA 1 325 feet (SSE) 59.7 41.7 59.8 Proposed West Roxbury M&R Station NSA 1 100 feet (SW) 52.1 48.5 53.7 ____________________ a Current ambient levels based on noise surveys as described in table 4.11.2-1.  0.6 1.0 2.9 4.6 0.4 1.4 3.7 0.1 0.1 1.6  In addition to the operational noise discussed above, there would also be blowdown events during which the pipeline would generate noise for short periods of time (e.g., 1 to 5 minutes). Algonquin has indicated that these potential blowdown events would be associated with each of the new compressor units, which would each be outfitted with a blowdown silencer to ensure that the noise attributable to these blowdown events would be 60 dBA at a distance of 300 feet. Given the non-routine nature and short-term duration of these blowdown event, we do not believe that they will be a significant contributor to operational noisefrom the Project. We received comments on the draft EIS related to vibration at the Brookfield Compressor Station, which is part of the Iroquois Gas Transmission's pipeline system. We are aware of the vibration issue at this station through an operational complaint addressed through the FERC's dispute resolution service helpline. The gas for the proposed project is 100 percent subscribed for local distribution companies and municipalities along the Algonquin system. The additional volumes are not intended for transport along the Iroquois system. Therefore, the Brookfield Compressor Station would not experience a change in volume or operation as a result of this Project. Further, each of the compressor stations proposed to be modified as part of the proposed Project are existing stations that do not currently result in perceptible vibration at nearby receptors. FERC regulations require that all modifications to existing compressor stations cannot resultin a perceptible increase in vibration at nearby receptors. Based on the analyses conducted, mitigation measures proposed, and our additional recommendations, we believe that the Project would not result in significant noise impacts on residents, and the surrounding communities. 4-263 4.12 RELIABILITY AND SAFETY The transportation of natural gas by pipeline involves some incremental risk to the public due to the potential for accidental release of natural gas. The greatest hazard is a fire or explosion following a major pipeline rupture. Methane, the primary component of natural gas, is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. It is not toxic, but is classified as a simple asphyxiate, possessing a slight inhalation hazard. If breathed in high concentration, oxygen deficiency can result in serious injury or death. The natural gas in Algonquin’s system may contain a chemical odorant that produces the familiar “natural gassmell.” Methane has an auto-ignition temperature of 1,000 °F and is flammable at concentrations between 5 and 15 percent in the air. Unconfined mixtures of methane in the air are not explosive; however, it may ignite and burn if there is an ignition source. A flammable concentration within an enclosed space in the presence of an ignition source can explode. It is buoyant at atmospheric temperatures and disperses rapidly in air. 4.12.1 Safety Standards PHMSA is mandated to provide pipeline safety under 49 USC Chapter 601. The OPS administers the national regulatory program to ensure the safe transportation of natural gas and other hazardous materials by pipeline. It develops safety regulations and other approaches to risk management that ensure safety in the design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency response of pipeline facilities. Many of the regulations are written as performance standards that set the level of safety to be attained and allow the pipeline operator to use various technologies to achieve the required safety standard. PHMSA ensures that people and the environment are protected from the risk of pipeline incidents. This work is shared with state agency partners and others at the federal, state, and local level. PHMSA provides for a state agency to assume all aspects of the safety program for intrastate facilities by adopting and enforcing the federal standards.  A statemay also act as PHMSA’sagent to inspectinterstate facilities within its boundaries; however, PHMSA is responsible for enforcement actions. For the AIM Project, New York and Connecticut are interstate agents that have been delegated authority to inspect interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. OPS federal inspectors perform inspections on interstate natural gas pipeline facilities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. PHMSA pipeline standards are published in 49 CFR Parts 190–199. Part 192 of 49 CFR specifically addresses natural gas pipeline safety issues. Under a Memorandum of Understanding on Natural Gas Transportation Facilities (Memorandum) dated January 15, 1993 between PHMSA and the FERC, PHMSA has the exclusive authority to promulgate federal safety standards used in the transportation of natural gas. Section 157.14(a)(9)(vi) of the FERC's regulations require that an applicant certify that it will design, install, inspect, test, construct, operate, replace, and maintain the facility for which a Certificate is requested in accordance with federal safety standards and plans for maintenance and inspection. Alternatively, an applicant must certify that it has been granted a waiver of the requirements of the safety standards by PHMSA in accordance with section 3(e) of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act.  The FERC accepts this certification and does not impose additional safety standards. If the Commission becomes aware of an existing or potential safety problem, there is a provision in the Memorandum to promptly alert PHMSA. The Memorandum also provides for referring complaints and inquiries made by state and local governments and the general public involving safety matters related to pipelines under the Commission's jurisdiction. 4-264 The pipeline and aboveground facilities associated with the AIM Project would be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with or to exceed PHMSA’s Minimum Federal Safety Standards in 49 CFR 192. The regulations are intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent natural gas facility accidents and failures. PHMSA specifies material selection and qualification; minimum design requirements; and protection of the pipeline from internal, external, and atmospheric corrosion.  We received comments regarding the siting of a high-pressure pipeline in urban or developed settings in close proximity to facilities such as schools, residential areas, and hospitals. PHMSA defines area classifications, based on population density in the vicinity of the pipeline, and specifies more rigorous safety requirements for populated areas. The class locations unit is an area that extends 220 yards on either side of the centerline of any continuous 1-mile length of pipeline. The four area classifications are defined below:  Class 1 – location with 10 or fewer buildings intended for human occupancy;  Class 2 – location with more than 10 but less than 46 buildings intended for human occupancy;  Class 3 – location with 46 or more buildings intended for human occupancy or where the pipeline lies within 100 yards of any building, or small well-defined outside area occupied by 20 or more people on at least 5 days a week for 10 weeks in any 12-month period;and  Class 4 – location where buildings with four or more stories aboveground are prevalent. Class locations representing more populated areas require higher safety factors in pipeline design, testing, and operation. For instance, pipelines constructed on land in Class 1 locations must be installed with a minimum depth of cover of 30 inches in normal soil and 18 inches in consolidated rock. Class 2, 3, and 4 locations, as well as drainage ditches of public roads and railroad crossings, require a minimum cover of 36 inches in normal soil and 24 inches in consolidated rock. All pipelines installed in navigable rivers, streams, and harbors must have a minimum cover of 48 inches in soil or 24 inches in consolidated rock.  Class locations also specify the maximum distance to sectionalized block valves (e.g., 10.0 miles in Class 1, 7.5 miles in Class 2, 4.0 miles in Class 3, and 2.5 miles in Class 4). Pipe wall thickness and pipeline design pressures; hydrostatic test pressures; MAOP; inspection and testing of welds; and frequency of pipeline patrols and leak surveys must also conform to higher standards in more populated areas. A summary of class locations based on current population density along the proposed pipeline segments is provided in table 4.12.1-1.   During operation of the pipeline, if a subsequent increase in population density adjacent to the right-of-way results in a change in class location for the pipeline, Algonquin would reduce the MAOP or replace the segment with pipe of sufficient grade and wall thickness, if required, to comply with PHMSA’s code of regulations for the newclass location. 4-265 TABLE 4.12.1-1 Area Classifications Along the AIM Project  Begin End Length Class Facility County, State MP MP (feet) Location  Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point Rockland, NY 0.0 1.7 9,186 3 Take-up and Relay 1.7 1.9 787 1 1.9 3.3 7,334 3 Stony Point to Yorktown Take-Rockland, NY 0.0 0.9 4,800 3 up and Relay 0.9 1.3 2,270 1 1.3 3.2 9,988 3 3.2 3.5 1,542 1 Westchester, NY 3.5 3.9 1,983 1 3.9 4.6 3,837 2 4.6 4.7 244 3 4.7 5.0 1,776 1 5.0 6.8 9,567 3 6.8 8.0 6,148 1 8.0 10.9 15,335 3 10.9 11.2 1,708 2 11.2 12.3 5,755 1 Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up Putnam, NY 0.0 0.1 792 1 and Relay Fairfield, CT 0.1 0.9 4,105 3 0.9 1.0 724 1 1.0 2.6 8,205 3 2.6 2.9 1,585 1 2.9 4.5 8,354 3 E-1 System Lateral Take-up New London, CT 0.0 0.5 2,579 2 and Relay 0.5 8.5 42,408 1 8.5 8.9 2,123 3 8.9 9.1 938 1 Loop Extension Line-36A Loop Extension Middlesex, CT 0.0 0.7 3,586 1 0.7 0.9 906 3 0.9 1.0 1,034 1 1.0 1.5 2,328 2 1.5 1.8 1,372 1 Hartford, CT 1.8 2.0 1,320 1 E-1 System Lateral Loop New London, CT 0.0 0.3 1,814 3 Extension 0.3 1.2 4,412 1 1.2 1.3 902 2 a New Pipeline West Roxbury Lateral Norfolk, MA 0.0 0.2 900 3 0.2 0.4 1,300 4 0.4 0.6 1,100 3 0.6 1.2 19,600 4 1.2 3.4 11,880 3 Suffolk, MA 3.4 5.1 8,184 3 ____________________ a The length of the pipeline does not match the mileposting system. This is because several route modifications were incorporated into the proposed route after the mileposting system was established. This specifically affects the West Roxbury Lateral where the changes resulted in an overall decrease in total pipeline length. The changes to the other segments did not result in an overall change in the segment lengths.  4-266 Several commentors believed that the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School should be considered a Class 4 area, with corresponding pipeline design requirements. Based on PHMSA's regulations, the area surrounding the pipeline that includes the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School does not meet the qualification criteria for a Class 4 designation and would be classified as a Class 3 location. However, Algonquin has agreed to enhanced mitigation measures for construction near the IPEC, which would also extend to the segment of pipeline near Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School.  These measures include constructing this segment of the pipeline to exceed the most stringent Class 4 design requirements (see section 4.12.3 for additional discussion of the mitigation measures and impacts on the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School). In compliance with Part 192, Algonquin would be required to implement several safety measures during construction and operation of Project facilities. The piping, fittings, and other components containing natural gas under pressure must be designed with a significant margin of safety factor above normal operating parameters. To ensure that the maximum pressure is never exceeded, the system must be equipped with safety relief valves set to release gas that would maintain pressures below the MAOP. The relief valves must be tested periodically for proper operation and set point, and repaired or replaced as required. Also, gas vented to the atmosphere must be directed away from any potential sources of ignition. PHMSA’s pipeline safety regulations require natural gas transmission operators to develop and follow a written integrity management program that contains all of the elements described in 192.911 and addresses the risks on each covered transmission pipeline segment. The rule establishes an integrity management program, which applies to all high consequence areas (HCA). PHMSA published rules that define HCAs where a gas pipeline accident could do considerable harm to people and their property and requires an integrity management program to minimize the potential for an accident. This definition satisfies, in part, the Congressional mandate for PHMSA to prescribe standards that establish criteria for identifying each gas pipeline facility in a high-density population area. The HCAs may be defined in one oftwo ways.  In the first method, an HCA includes:  current Class 3 and 4 locations;  any area in Class 1 or 2 locations where the potential impact radius10 is greater than 660 feet and there are 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy within the potentialimpact circle11; or  any area in Class 1 or 2 locations where the potential impact circle includes an identified site. An identified site is an outside area or open structure that is occupied by 20 or more persons on at least 50 days in any 12-month period; a building that is occupied by 20 or more persons on at least 5 days a week for any 10 weeks in any 12-month period; or a facility that is occupied by persons who are confined, are of impaired mobility, or would be difficult to evacuate (including hospitals, schools, and nursing homes). 10 The potential impact radius means the radius of a circle within which the potential failure of a pipeline could have significant impact on people or property. Thepotential impact radius is calculatedas theproduct of0.69andthesquareroot ofthe MAOP ofthepipeline(in pounds per squareinch) multipliedbythe pipeline diameter in inches. 11 Thepotential impact circleis acircle ofradius equal tothepotential impact radius. 4-267  20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy; or  an identified site. Once a pipeline operator has determined the HCAs along its pipeline, it must apply the elements of its integrity management program to those segments of the pipeline within HCAs. PHMSA’s regulations specify the requirements for the integrity management plan at section 192.911. The HCAs have been determined based on the relationship of the pipeline centerline to other nearby structures and identified sites. Table 4.12.1-2 lists the HCAs by milepost that would be crossed by the pipeline facilities. TABLE 4.12.1-2 Location of High Consequence Areas Along the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Projecta  Begin End HCA Length Facility County, State MP MP (feet)  Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Point Rockland, NY 0.0 0.0 36 Take-up and Relay 0.0 0.1 725 0.3 1.3 5,306 2.2 2.8 3,398 Stony Point to Yorktown Rockland, NY 1.0 3.5 13,393 Take-up and Relay Westchester, NY 3.5 3.6 317 3.8 4.2 2,580 5.9 8.5 13,704 9.7 10.4 3,450 11.1 12.0 4,633 Southeast to MLV 19 Take-Fairfield, CT 0.1 1.0 4,641 up and Relay 1.0 2.8 9,866 3.0 3.4 1,817 4.3 4.4 800 E-1 System Lateral Take-up New London, CT 8.5 8.6 372 and Relay 8.6 8.7 438 8.9 9.0 860 Loop Extension b Line-36A Loop Extension Middlesex, CT 0.5 1.0 2,722 c New Pipeline West Roxbury Lateral Norfolk, MA 0.0 3.4 18,163 Suffolk, MA 3.4 5.1 8,184 ____________________ a HCA designations are based on existing Algonquin pipeline facilities and the most recent annual review of HCAs as defined in Algonquin’s integrity management program. b No HCAs would be located along the E-1 System Lateral Loop. c The length of the pipeline does not match the mileposting system. This is because several route modifications were incorporated into the proposed route after the mileposting system was established. This specifically affects the West Roxbury Lateral where the changes resulted in an overall decrease in total pipeline length. The changes to the other segments did not result in an overall change in the segment lengths.  4-268 The pipeline integrity management rule for HCAs requires inspection of the pipeline every 7 years. Algonquin has implemented a comprehensive integrity management program that meets, and in many cases exceeds, these regulations. While the pipeline integrity management regulations apply only to HCAs, Algonquin would continue to implement the same rigorous practices across its entire pipeline system. Key elements of Algonquin’s integrity management program include data gathering, risk assessment, integrity assessments, response and remediation, and preventative and mitigative measures as described below. Data Gathering – In order to properly identify integrity risks and potential consequences, data is gathered from a number ofsources, including:  original construction records;  pipeline alignment sheet records;  personnel interviews;  quadrangle USGS maps;  digital elevation models;  historical data;  database searches;  leak and incident data/reports;  operating characteristics;  corrosion monitoring;  cathodic protection surveys;  subject matterexperts;  one-call notices; and  aerial photography. Risk Assessment – Each year Algonquin performs a detailed risk analysis for its entire pipeline system to identify potential integrity threats to the pipeline and potential consequences in the event of a pipeline failure. This risk analysis, which allows Algonquin to prioritize integrity management activities, such as integrity assessments and additional prevention measures. The risk assessment is performed by subject matter experts using modern risk management tools and techniques to assure the risk assessment process provides an accurate determination of pipeline risks. Integrity Assessments – Integrity assessments are prioritized based on the risk assessment, and are conducted to find pipeline defects before they could become a threat. The integrity assessment method for each pipeline segment is selected based on the types of potential integrity threats applicable to that segment.  The integrity assessment methods could include:  In-Line Inspection – conducted using an internalinspection tool (commonly referred to as a “smart pig”) that is capable of identifying and classifying pipe defects, including metal loss, dents, gouges, and other types of defects. The smart pig is inserted into the pipeline and is typically pushed by the flow of natural gas in the pipeline.  Direct Assessment – an assessment method that uses a systematic approach to identify potential defects through data review, indirect assessments, and targeted hands-on inspections.  Pressure Testing – an assessment method where the pipeline is filled with an inert substance, typically water, and is tested to a pressure that is well above the normal 4-269 operating pressure to validate the strength of the pipe and identify any smaller defects before they become a threat. Response and Remediation – Pipeline defects identified by the integrity assessments are scheduled for field investigation and repair, if required, in accordance with the integrity management regulations and industry standards and best practices. Algonquin schedules and conducts investigations and repairs for any potential defects that exceed specified thresholds. This is done regardless of whether or not the pipeline is located in a designated HCA.  Preventive and Mitigative Measures – Preventive measures include design specifications, selection of suitable construction materials, development and selection of welding procedures, pipe coatings, and cathodic protection systems. Additionally, manufacturing controls would be used to promote high-quality installation of the pipeline and to limit operating stress. During the installation phase, all welders and radiographic technicians performing work on the facilities would be required to take and pass a qualification test. Qualified oversight inspection staff would be used to monitor the installation of the facilities. After construction and as required by PHMSA’s regulations, the pipeline facilities would be marked at line-of-sight intervals and at crossings of roads, railroads, and other key points. The markers would indicate the presence of the pipeline and provide a telephone number where a company representative could be reached in the event of an emergency or before any excavation in the area of the pipeline by a third party. Algonquin participates in the “Call Before You Dig” and “One Call” programs and other related pre-excavation notification organizations in the states in which they operate. In addition, if there is excavation occurring near one of Algonquin’s pipelines, operational personnel would be on site duringexcavation activities to ensure there is no risk of damage to the pipeline.   The pipeline would be patrolled on a routine basis, and personnel well qualified to perform both emergency and routine maintenance on interstate pipeline facilities would handle emergencies and maintenance related to:  erosion and wash-outs along the right-of-way;  settling, undermining, or degradation of a repaired ditch line in streets or parking lots;  performance of water control devices, such as diversions;  condition of banks at stream and river crossings;  third-party activity along the pipeline right-of-way; and  any otherconditions that could endanger the pipeline. PHMSA prescribes the minimum standards for operating and maintaining pipeline facilities, including the requirement to establish a written plan governing these activities to minimize the hazards in a natural gas pipeline emergency. Key elements of Algonquin’s Emergency Plan (under Part 192.615) include:  receiving, identifying, and classifying emergency events, such as gas leakage, fires, explosions, and natural disasters;  establishing and maintaining communications with local fire, police, and public officials, and coordinating emergency response;  employing an emergency system shutdown and safelyrestoring service;  making personnel, equipment, tools, and materials available at the scene of an emergency; and  protecting people first and then property, and making them safe from actual or potential hazards, including evacuating individuals and rerouting traffic as necessary to avoid any areathatis deemed to be unsafe. 4-270 We received comments during public scoping regarding emergency response procedures and employee training at the Southeast and Stony Point Compressor Stations. Algonquin’s Cromwell, Connecticut Area Office maintains the Emergency Response Plan for the Southeast Compressor Station, and the South Plainfield, New Jersey Area Office maintains the Emergency Response Plan for the Stony Point Compressor Station. The Emergency ResponsePlansfor each of these stations include:  details on how to identify and classify emergencies;  notification and emergency response procedures for events including detection of gas, fire, explosion, natural disaster, or a bomb threat and emergency shutdown steps;  phone numbers for Spectra emergency response personnel, first responders (fire departments and law enforcement), and emergency responsecontractors;  operating maps; and  directions toeach ofthefacilities. The Emergency Response Plans are reviewed annually. All applicable personnel receive annual training on the Emergency Response Plans, and the area offices conduct emergency response exercises on an annual basis. Additionally, Algonquin conducts periodic training sessions to review operating and emergency procedures with their operations staff.  Algonquin’s Gas Control Center monitors system pressures, flows, and customer deliveries on its entire system. The center is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year from Houston, Texas. Algonquin’s AIM Project facilities would also be equipped with remote control shutoff valves. In the event of an emergency, the Gas Control Center would send a command signal to the remote control valves to initiate the closure of the valves. The remote control valves are capable of closing quickly to allow for a section of pipeline to be isolated from the rest of the system.  We received a comment concerning the potential for Algonquin’s monitoring and data acquisition systems to be vulnerable to computer “worms,” such as the Stuxnet Computer worm. Algonquin stated that its controls are tested on a continuous basis and that it has fully staffed Information Technology and Corporate Security groups dedicated to the protection and security of their pipeline control systems.  Additionally, its staff is certified and trained through the Department of Homeland Security and works closely with local, state, and federal agencies reviewing and developing safeguards against cyber threats. We also received comments regarding operational checks and leak detection. Algonquin’s operating personnel would patrol the right-of-way along the new and existing pipeline facilities on a weekly basis. Algonquin would also conduct annual leak detection surveys of its pipeline facilities to identify any potential leaks. These surveys are instrumental in early detection of leaks and can reduce the likelihood for pipeline failure. 4-271 PHMSA requires that each operator establish and maintain liaison with appropriate fire, police, and public officials to learn the resources and responsibilities of each organization that may respond to a natural gas pipeline emergency, and to coordinate mutual assistance. The operator must also establish a continuing education program to enable customers, the public, government officials, and those engaged in excavation activities to recognize a gas pipeline emergency and report it to the appropriate public officials. Algonquin would maintain a liaison with public authorities and local utilities in all locations along the pipeline system. A current list of those to be contacted would be maintained by the Transmission Area Managers at the South Plainfield (New Jersey), Cromwell (Connecticut), and Westwood (Massachusetts) Area Offices. Algonquin would provide the appropriate training to local emergency service personnel before the pipeline is placed in service. We received several comments during the scoping period regarding the tax burden on local emergency services in the event of a pipeline incident. Algonquin would not necessarily compensate the municipalities for anypublic service assistance that might be required to respond to an incident; however, Algonquin would pay taxes (see section 4.9.8), which may be used to offset any required municipal expenses.  4.12.2 Pipeline Accident Data PHMSA requires all operators of natural gas transmission pipelines to notify PHMSA of any significant incident and to submit a report within 20 days. Significant incidents are defined as any leaks that:  cause a death or personal injury requiring hospitalization; or  involve property damage of more than $50,000 in 1984 dollars.12 During the 20-year period from 1994 through 2013, a total of 1,237 significant incidents were reported on the more than 300,000 total miles of natural gas transmission pipelines nationwide. Additional insight into the nature of service incidents may be found by examining the primary factors that caused the failures. Table 4.12.2-1 provides a nationwide distribution of the causal factors as well as the number of each incident by cause. The dominant causes of pipeline incidents are corrosion and pipeline material, weld or equipment failure constituting 48.2 percent of all significant incidents.  The pipelines included in the data set in table 4.12.2-1 vary widely in terms of age, diameter, and level of corrosion control. Each variable influences the incident frequency that may be expected for a specific segment of pipeline. Table 4.12.2-2 provides a distribution of state-specific significant incident data for the past 20 years where the Project would be located. This data shows that over the past 20 years there have been a total of 13 incidents in New York, 0 in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and 2 in Massachusetts. Two of these incidents occurredin 2013 among all four states. 12 $50,000 in 1984 dollars is approximately $115,000 as of March 2014 (CPI, Bureau of Labor Statistics, ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/ special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt, February2014). 4-272 TABLE 4.12.2-1 a Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Significant Incidents by Cause (1994–2013)  Cause Number of Incidents Percentage  Corrosion 292 23.6 b Excavation 211 17.0 Pipeline Material, Weld or Equipment 304 24.6 Failure Natural Force Damage 142 11.5 Outside Forces c 74 6.0 Incorrect Operation 33 2.7 d All Other Causes 181 14.6 TOTAL 1,237 -____________________ a All data gathered from PHMSA Significant Incident files, March 14, 2014 (http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/ safety/SigPSI.html). b Includes third-party damage. c Fire, explosion, vehicle damage, previous damage, intentional damage. d Miscellaneous causes or unknown causes.  TABLE 4.12.2-2 a Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline Significant Incidents by State (1994–2013)  State Number of Incidents Cause(s)  New York 13 Corrosion; Pipeline Material, Weld or Equipment Failure; Third-party Excavation Damage; Natural Force Damage; Miscellaneous Connecticut 0 NA Massachusetts 2 Third-party Excavation Damage Rhode Island 0 NA TOTAL 15 ____________________ a All data gathered from PHMSA Significant Incident files, December 15, 2014 (http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/ safety/SigPSI.html). NA = Not Applicable  The frequency of significant incidents is strongly dependent on pipeline age. Older pipelines have a higher frequency of corrosion incidents and material failure, since corrosion and pipeline stress/strain is a time-dependent process. The use of both an external protective coating and a cathodic protection system,13 required on all pipelines installed after July 1971, significantly reduces the corrosion rate compared to unprotected or partially protected pipe.  As shown in table 4.12.2-1, outside force, excavation, and natural forces are the cause in 34.5 percent of significant pipeline incidents. These result from the encroachment of mechanical equipment such as bulldozers and backhoes; earth movements due to soil settlement, washouts, or geologic hazards; weather effects such as winds, storms, and thermal strains; and willful damage. Table 4.12.2-3 provides a breakdown of outside force incidents by cause. Cathodic protection is a technique to reduce corrosion (rust) of the natural gas pipeline that includes the use of an induced current ora sacrificial anode(likezinc) that corrodes at faster rate to reducecorrosion. 4-273 TABLE 4.12.2-3 Outside Forces Incidents by Cause (1994–2013)a  Cause Number of Incidents  Percent of all Incidents  Third-party excavation damage 176 Operator excavation damage 25 Unspecified equipment damage/Previous damage 10 Heavy Rain/Floods 72 Earth Movement 35 Lightning/Temperature/High Winds 21 Unspecified Natural Force 14 Vehicle (not engaged with excavation) 45 Fire/Explosion 8 Previous mechanical damage 5 Fishing or maritime activity 7 Intentional damage 1 Electrical arcing from other equipment/facility 1 Unspecified outside force 7 TOTAL 427 ____________________ a Excavation, Outside Forces, and Natural Force Damage from table 4.12.2-1.  14.2 2.0 0.8 5.8 2.8 1.7 1.1 3.6 0.6 0.4 0.6 0.1 0.1 0.4 - Older pipelines have a higher frequency of outside forces incidents partly because their location may be less well known and less well marked than newer lines. In addition, the older pipelines contain a disproportionate number of smaller-diameter pipelines; which have a greater rate of outside forces incidents. Small diameter pipelines are more easily crushed or broken by mechanical equipment or earth movement. Since 1982, operators have been required to participate in "One Call" public utility programs in populated areas to minimize unauthorized excavation activities in the vicinity of pipelines. The "One Call" program is a service used by public utilities and some private sector companies (e.g., oil pipelines and cable television) to provide preconstruction information to contractors or other maintenance workers on the underground location of pipes, cables, and culverts. We received scoping comments regarding Spectra’s safety record. Spectra’s reportable incident and leak rates are significantly lower than industry averages, as shown in table 4.12.2-4. In addition, pipeline operator compliance and incident history is publically available on the PHMSA website at www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline. TABLE 4.12.2-4 Average 5-Year Leak and Incident Rates for Spectra and All U.S. Natural Gas Transmission Lines  Spectra Energy Pipelines All U.S. Gas Transmission Lines Category (per 1,000 miles/year) (per 1,000 miles/year)  Onshore Incidents 0.16 0.30 Leaks 0.54 1.97  4-274 4.12.3 Impact on Public Safety Algonquin would implement various public safety measures during construction in residential and commercial areas,including but notlimited to:  fencing the construction work area boundary to ensure equipment, materials, and spoil remain in the construction right-of-way and that the public is excluded from hazardous areas;  ensuring piping is welded and installed as quickly as reasonably possible consistent with prudent pipeline construction practices to minimize the duration of construction within a neighborhood;  backfilling the trench as soon as the pipe is laid ortemporarily installing a steel plate over the open trench; and  completing final cleanup and installation of permanent erosion control measures within 10 days after the trench is backfilled, weatherconditions permitting.  Along the West Roxbury Lateral, the pipeline would primarily be placed within streets in the vicinity of residential and commercial areas. Algonquin would use the in-street construction method to install the pipeline within roadways (see section 2.3.1.2). The work area would be isolated from road and pedestrian traffic, and traffic controls would be used to allow traffic to bypass the work area.  No trenches would be left open overnight. With the exception of the end of the pipe, which would be left exposed within the trench, the pipe trench would be backfilled at the end of the day, and the open trench containing the exposed ends of the pipe would be plated. The work would be accomplished so that emergency vehicles would be able to pass and homeowners would be able to access their driveways. Algonquin has developed an acceptable Traffic Management Plan for the West Roxbury Lateral as well as acceptable site-specific residential construction plans for residences within 50 feet of the construction right-of-way (see sections 4.9.5 and 4.8.3, respectively).  We received several comments regarding the proximity of the Project to high-voltage power lines. It is not uncommon for natural gas pipeline facilities to parallel existing utility rights-of-ways, including electric transmission rights-of-way. Algonquin would comply with all federal, state, and local regulations that apply to construction with regard to structures and underground utilities. Algonquin has conducted surveys and collected information on the location and size of existing power line structures within the proposed right-of-way corridors, tower footing locations and dimensions, and wire heights (lowest point between towers).  Algonquin would design or modify its construction technique on the AIM Project with sufficient offsets to eliminate the risk of heavy construction equipment interfering with overhead high-voltage electric transmission lines during construction and operation. Where possible, Algonquin would offset its pipeline trench by 50 feet to avoid any potential damage to electric transmission towers; and in those areas that this offset could not be achieved, the construction technique would be modified. Algonquin would use a licensed blasting engineer and would follow a Project-specific Rock Removal Plan that includes blasting procedures (see section 4.1.6) to avoid damage to overhead electric transmission lines and structures from blasting. To address potential effects on the pipeline from potential lighting strikes to nearby electric transmission towers, Algonquin would consult with an engineer that specializes in developing alternating current (AC) mitigation systems for pipeline utility companies. An AC mitigation system would be designed and installed to mitigate the steady state induced AC on the pipeline and deal with any fault 4-275 We have also received numerous comments expressing safety concerns about potential interactions between Algonquin’s proposed pipeline facilities and the WPP electric transmission line. Algonquin and WPP have corresponded and met regarding the two projects, and plan to share design drawings. Algonquin has committed to conducting an alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) interference study and incorporating field surveys and comprehensive modeling to identify potential adverse effects on the pipeline from stray currents and from inductive, conductive, and coupling AC/DC effects from nearby AC/DC utilities. The study’s purpose is to indicate specific design measures necessary to mitigate electrical interaction between the pipeline and electric transmission systems. Potential mitigation measures for AC/DC interference could include maximum separation distance, parallel/point mitigation utilizing anodes, potentially controlled impressed current cathodic protection systems, or other measures based on engineering judgment. A properly designed natural gas pipeline and electric transmission line running parallel to each other, even at close distances, would not result in any cumulative operational or public safety hazards. WPP's transmission line, which is a self-contained, buried cable system with associated automatic monitoring and near-instantaneous protection systems, would avoid any operational impacts with the proposed pipeline. The WPP line would also employ a metallic ground sheath so that possible electrical arcing or faults would be self-contained. WPP has committed to installing its cable in accordance with Algonquin’s requirements at any point where it would cross the pipeline. Although we do not anticipate any significant issues, to ensure that safety concerns about potential interactions are adequately addressed, we recommend that:  Prior to construction of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment, Algonquin should file with the Secretary its final AC/DC interference study associated with the West Point Transmission Project, documentation of all consultations with WPP, and any additional mitigation measures to address safety-related issues. Additionally, we received scoping comments and comments on the draft EIS from individuals as well as Entergy concerning the safety of the Project and its proximity to the IPEC facility. Three existing pipelines (24-inch-diameter Northline, 30-inch-diameter L30B pipeline, and 24-inch-diameter Southline) currently cross the Hudson River within Algonquin’s mainline right-of-way and are immediately adjacent to the IPEC-protected security barrier. For the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the proposed Project, Algonquin has identified as its proposed route an alternate crossing location of the Hudson River that is located approximately 0.5 mile south of the three existing pipelines. While the proposed route would still cross a portion of IPEC land, it would be about 2,370 feet from the IPEC-protected security barrier around the main facility sites. Land uses between the proposed route and the IPEC-protected security barrier include commercial and industrial. Algonquin would work with Entergy on any requirements for the storage of construction equipment on these parcels when negotiating easements with Entergy and Con Edison for construction of the proposed pipeline. Algonquin has also shared its operation and maintenance procedures with Entergy and continues to consult with Entergy regarding the use of Entergy-owned or leased land along the proposed route.  Entergy also commented about the potential impacts of the new 42-inch-diameter pipeline crossing the existing pipelines. To minimize potential impacts on the existing line, Algonquin would locate the existing pipeline using above-grade visual cues, electronic pipe locators, probing, and soft digging methods. Once the pipeline is located and identified, pipe stress calculations could be completed for equipment crossings and surface loads. If necessary, Algonquin would provide additional cover; install timber mats, steel plating, or temporary air bridging; utilize a combination of these; or avoid the 4-276 crossing in order to minimize or avoid impacts on existing utilities. During construction, Algonquin would use soft digging methods to excavate utility lines. Excavator buckets without teeth or side cutters would be used, and lines could be shielded with rock shield or plywood. Utility lines would be supported from below or by a beam installed across the top of the trench. For highly sensitive lines, Algonquin would develop a site-specific work plan for working nearthe utility. Entergy commented about concerns on the purging of gas from the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline, Algonquin would not have any purging operations on IPEC property. Blowing down the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline would occur either upstream or downstream of the IPEC facility. A written procedure for blow-down of the pipeline would be drafted in accordance with Algonquin’s standard operation procedures.  Entergy also commented on blasting and HDD inadvertent releases with regard to the IPEC facility. The proposed route would not be located within or adjacent to the main IPEC facilities; therefore, no blasting would occur within or near the IPEC-secured zone. If blasting would be required along the proposed route, Algonquin would first consult with Entergy. Blasting would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E). The Hudson River HDD would be located about 0.5 mile south of the protected security barrier surrounding the IPEC facility. It is not anticipated that inadvertent releases of drilling fluids would affect IPEC property, and HDD construction equipment would not be located on or adjacentto the IPECfacility.  With regard to Entergy’s comment regarding how Algonquin intends to prevent overpressure of the downstream pipeline when adding additional horsepower at existing compressor stations, overpressure protection controls are established at compressor stations on Algonquin’s transmission lines. These controls have been in place for the 26-and 30-inch-diameter pipelines at the Stony Point Compressor Station. The new 42-inch-diameter pipeline segment would have the same overpressure protection measures to ensure safety of the pipeline.  The pressure controls and overpressure devices are reliable and stringent, and the accuracy of set points is verified at periodic time intervals in accordance with PHMSA regulations. Maintenance records of the pressure controls and overpressure devices are audited by internalteams as well as PHMSA auditors to ensure compliance. Given the distance fromthe IPEC generating facilities and the avoidance and mitigation measures described above, the proposed route should not pose any new safety hazards to the IPEC facility. On August 21, 2014, after consultations between Entergy and Algonquin, Entergy filed with the NRC its Safety Evaluation for the AIM Project. The Safety Evaluation incorporates additional design and installation enhancements along approximately 3,935 feet of the AIM Project pipeline where it would lie closest to the IPEC facility (i.e., 0.5 mile from IPEC’s security barrier).  These measuresinclude:  using internally coated 0.720 inch X-70 API 5L line pipe that exceeds the most stringent Class 4 requirements set by the U.S. Department of Transportation (even though this area is predominantly Class 3);  installing two parallel sets of fiber-reinforced concrete slabs (3 feet wide by 8 feet long by 6 inch thick) over the pipeline that would act as a physical barrier over the buried pipe;  installing yellow warning tape above and below the concrete slabs;  burying the pipeline to a minimum depth of 4 feet from the top of the pipeline (and an additional foot deeper when crossing Broadway); and  providing thicker external corrosion protection, including an abrasive resistant overlay, and internal coating of the pipeline. In addition, no blasting for rock removal would be allowed in the region ofthe enhanced design.  4-277 Algonquin would extend these measures to the entire area between MPs 4.6 and 5.3. Algonquin would also maintain traffic flow and access to the IPEC facility during construction. A Direct Current Voltage Gradient or equivalent survey would be undertaken to check coating integrity following pipe installation and partial backfill, and all field welds along the enhanced pipeline section would undergo Non-Destructive Examination radiography. In its Safety Evaluation, Entergy concluded that, “based on the proposed routing of the 42-inchdiameter pipeline further from safety related equipment at IPEC, and accounting for the substantial design and installation enhancements agreed to by [Algonquin], the proposed AIM Project poses no increased risks to IPECand there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.  Accordingly, as documented in its 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50.59 Safety Evaluation, Entergy has concluded that the change in the design basis external hazards analysis associated with the proposed AIM Project does not require prior NRC approval” (Entergy, 2014). The NRC has reviewed the site hazards analysis performed by Entergy and has performed an independent confirmatory analysis of the blast analysis as well. The NRC issued its findings in a report dated November 7, 2014. The NRC’s analysis did not include factoring in the additional pipeline design measures identified by Entergy and committed to by Algonquin and assumed a pipeline catastrophic failure. The review covered everything within the Security Owner Controlled Area, which includes everything inside the outermost fenced area of the facility (including the area with the spent fuel rods). The NRC concluded that a breach and explosion of the proposed 42-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline would not adversely impact the safe operation ofthe facility(NRC, 2014b).  A related matter brought up by some commenters was the concern that a pipeline incident may affect the Buchanan Electric Substation, which connects power generated at the IPEC facility to the electric transmission system serving New York City and its environs. The segment of the AIM pipeline that passes nearest the Substation (approximate MP 5.0) lies within the segment that would be subject to the additional design and installation enhancements agreed to by Algonquin as part of Entergy's Safety Evaluation for the IPEC. These measures would also serve to increase the margin of safety for the BuchananElectric Substation.  We also received many comments regarding safety concerns for the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School, which is located adjacent to the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay segment between MPs 4.9 and 5.0. The Project right-of-way and construction workspace would be about 450 feet from the school facility at its closest point, on property owned by Con Edison, which abuts the school property. The pipeline would lie in a low area separated from the school by a natural berm and a wooded area. Algonquin would utilize standard open cut construction in this area, and would not employ blasting to remove rock that may be encountered during excavation near the school. The enhanced mitigation measures that Algonquin has committed to with Entergy for construction of approximately 3,935 feet of pipeline near the IPEC (see above) would include the pipeline right-of-way crossing near the school property, and would serve to further increase the margin of safety for the school. This segment is also within a HCA, which brings it into Algonquin's integrity management program, which is discussed in section 4.12.1. 4-278 Comments were also received asking about, or requesting, advance notifications of natural gas planned venting of gas (blowdowns), which are occasionally necessary during pipeline operations. Algonquin indicates that a planned blowdown is typically done in connection with scheduled maintenance activities at a compressor station. An unplanned blowdown is a rare event, but may be triggered automatically by pipeline system controls when an abnormal event is detected, which is a necessary safety feature of the system. Blowdowns pass through silencers rated at 55 dBA. All blowdowns must comply with relevant facility air permits, and are reported to state authorities pursuant to Title V air permit conditions. Algonquin provides advance notifications of any planned blowdown to local police and fire departments, along with the non-emergency 911 systems, and to residents in the immediate vicinity of the blowdown event. In Massachusetts, notification of a planned release is also provided to the MassDEP. Notifications for a planned release are typically made at least 1 week in advance. The same local entities are notified as soon as practicable after any unplanned blowdown. These notifications enable local authorities to answer any questions they may receive from nearby residents who may hear the blowdown. This practice is consistent with other pipeline companies operating in residential areas. Natural gas vented to the atmosphere from pipeline facility blowdowns does not pose a health risk. We received numerous comments from residents who were concerned about the consequences of an explosion of a larger, 42-inch-diameter pipeline. The majority of this Project involves replacement of existing pipeline. However, table 4.12.3-1 presents the existing and future potential impact radius for each pipeline segment, calculated using the methodology defined by PHMSA’s regulations.  Although the transportation of natural gas via a pipeline involves some degree of risk to the public in the event of an accident and subsequent release of gas, it is also important to examine the probabilistic level of risks for pipeline-related events. The service incidents data summarized in table 4.12.2-1 include pipeline failures of all magnitudes with widely varying consequences. Table 4.12.3-2 presents the average annual injuries and fatalities that occurred on natural gas transmission lines for the 5-year period between 2009 and 2013. The majority of fatalities from pipelines are due to local distribution pipelines not regulated by FERC.  These are natural gas pipelines that distribute natural gas to homes and businesses after transportation through interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. In general, these distribution lines are smaller diameter pipes and/or plastic pipes that are more susceptible to damage. Local distribution systems do not have large rights-of-way and pipeline markers common to the FERC-regulated natural gas transmission pipelines. The nationwide totals of accidental fatalities from various anthropogenic and natural hazards are listed in table 4.12.3-3 in order to provide a relative measure of the industry-wide safety of natural gas transmission pipelines. Direct comparisons between accident categories should be made cautiously, however, because individual exposures to hazards are not uniform among all categories. The data nonetheless indicate a low risk of death due to incidents involving natural gas transmission pipelines compared to the other categories. Furthermore, the fatality rate is much lower than the fatalities from natural hazards such as lightning, tornados, or floods. 4-279 TABLE 4.12.3-1 Existing and Future Potential Impact Radius for the AIM Project  Begin End Existing PIR Future PIR Facility County, State MP MP (feet) (feet)  Replacement Pipeline Haverstraw to Stony Rockland, NY 0.0 3.3 465.7 844.9 Point Take-up and Relay Stony Point to Yorktown Rockland, NY 0.0 2.6 465.7 844.9 Take-up and Relay a Rockland/Westchester, NY 2.6 5.5 NA 844.9 Westchester, NY 5.5 12.3 465.7 844.9 Southeast to MLV 19 Putnam, NY/Fairfield, CT 0.0 4.5 465.7 844.9 Take-up and Relay E-1 System Lateral New London, CT 0.0 9.1 113.4 302.3 Take-up and Relay Loop Extension b Line-36A Loop Middlesex/Hartford, CT 0.0 2.0 NA 724.2 Extension E-1 System Lateral Loop New London, Ct 0.0 1.3 NA 226.8 Extension New Pipeline West Roxbury Lateral Norfolk/Suffolk, MA 0.0 5.1 NA 302.3 ____________________ a The portion of this segment between MPs 4.6 and 5.3 would be subject to the additional design and installation enhancements agreed to by Algonquin as part of Entergy's Safety Evaluation for the IPEC (see discussion above).

Significant Incidents Summary Statistics: 1994 – 2013, 20-year average (http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/ comm/reports/safety/PSI.html).  The available data show that natural gas transmission pipelines continue to be a safe, reliable means ofenergytransportation. From1994 to 2013, there were an average of62 significantincidents, 10 injuries, and 2 fatalities per year. The number of significant incidents over the more than 303,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines indicates the risk is low for an incident at any given location. Further, the majority of the Project would replace existing, aged pipeline with new pipeline in the same location and would not increase the risk to the nearby public. For the small portion of the Project where lopping or a new pipeline is proposed, based on these numbers, we conclude that the proposed AIM Project would represent a slight increase in risk to the nearby public. 4.12.4 Terrorism We received comments regarding concerns that the pipeline facilities could be used in a terrorist attack. Safety and security concerns have changed the way pipeline operators, as well as regulators, must considerterrorism, both in approving new projects and in operating existing facilities.  The Departmentof Homeland Security is tasked with the mission of coordinatingthe efforts of all executive departments and agencies to detect, prepare for, prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks within the United States. The Commission, in cooperation with other federal agencies, industry trade groups, and interstate natural gas companies is working to improve pipeline security practices, strengthen communications within the industry and extend public outreach in an ongoing effort to secure pipeline infrastructure. The Commission, like other federal agencies, is faced with a dilemma in how much information can be offered to the public, while still providing a significant level of protection to energy facilities. Consequently energy facility design plans and layout location information has been removed from its website to ensure that sensitive information is not readilyavailable. Algonquin stated that through its parent company, Spectra, it would continue to participate in various activities in close collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation 4-281  complying with the TSA’s Pipeline Security Division’s Security Guidelines;  participating in monthly intelligence meetings with both the Department of Homeland Security’s Intelligence Program and the TSA’s Pipeline Security Division’s monthly update conference calls;  attending classified briefings with the Department of Homeland Security for the industry, annually, and as needed;  chairing the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America Security Committee and participating in the American Gas Association SecurityCommittee, as well as the Oil and Natural Gas Sector Coordinating Council’s Pipeline Working Group;  participating in the production of a new video, sponsored by TSA, aimed at training law enforcement officers to respond to security events at pipeline facilities;  participating annually in TSA’s International Pipeline Security Forum;  reporting suspicious incidents to the Transportation Security Operations Center; and  conducting major crisis management drills, atleastannually, within the company. Safety and security are important considerations in any action undertaken by the FERC. The likelihood of future acts of terrorism or sabotage occurring at or along the AIM Project facilities, or at any of the myriad natural gas pipeline or energy facilities throughout the United States, is unpredictable given the disparate motives and abilities of terrorist groups.  Although being sensitive to the history of incidents in the Project area, the continuing need to construct facilities to support the future natural gas pipeline infrastructure is not diminished from the threat of any such future acts. 4.13 CUMULATIVE IMPACTS In accordance with NEPA, we considered the cumulative impacts of the AIM Project and other projects or actions in the area. Cumulative impacts represent the incremental effects of the proposed action when added to other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects. Although the individual impact of each separate project may be minor, the additive or synergistic effects of multiple projects could be significant. The direct and indirect impacts of the AIM Project are discussed in other sections of this EIS. The purpose of this analysis is to identify and describe cumulative impacts that would potentially result from implementation of the AIM Project. This cumulative impacts analysis uses an approach consistent with the methodology set forth in relevant guidance (CEQ, 1997b, 2005; EPA, 1999). Under these guidelines, inclusion of actions within the analysis is based on identifying commonalities of impacts from other actions to potential impacts that would result from the AIM Project. In order to avoid unnecessary discussions of insignificant impacts and projects, and to adequately address and accomplish the purposes of this analysis, the cumulative impacts analysis for the AIM Project was conducted using the following guidelines:  Another project must impact a resource category potentially affected by the proposed Project. These projects are located in the same general area that would be directly affected by construction of the proposed Project. More geographically distant projects are not assessed because their impact would generally be localized and, therefore, would 4-282 not contribute significantly to cumulative impacts in the proposed AIM Project area. However, cumulative impacts on air quality and watersheds are considered on a broader, more regional basis.  The distance into the past and future that other projects could cumulatively impact the area of the AIM Project is based on whether the impacts are short-term, long-term, or permanent. The majority of the impacts related to the AIM Project would occur during the construction phase. Algonquin proposes to place the AIM Project facilities into service by November 2016, and would seek approval to begin construction as soon as all necessary federal approvals can be obtained.  Where a potential for cumulative impacts was indicated, those impacts were quantified to the extent practicable; however, in some cases, the potential impacts can only be described qualitatively (e.g. projects in the planning stages, contingent on economic conditions, availability of financing or the issuance ofpermits).  The criteria listed below define the AIM Project’s region of influence, which is used in this cumulative impacts analysis to describe the general area for which the AIM Project could contribute to cumulative impacts. The region of influence varies depending on the resource being discussed. Specifically, for the various resources our conservative approach considered:  Impacts on geology and soils, land use, residential areas, visual resources, cultural resources, and traffic by the AIM Project would be highly localized and, therefore, we evaluated other projects (e.g. residential development, small commercial development, small transportation projects) within 0.25 mile of the construction work areas for the AIM Project for cumulative impacts on these resources.  The AIM Project pipeline segments are each less than 15 miles long and primarily utilize existing rights-of-way. Waterbody and wetland crossings, as well as impacts on groundwater, vegetation, and wildlife by the AIM Project would be localized and minimized. Therefore, we included cumulative impacts on these resources for other projects within the sub-watersheds crossed by the AIM Project.  The AIM Project compressor stations would result in long-term impacts on air quality in various AQCRs. Therefore, other projects with the potential to result in long-term impacts on air quality (e.g. natural gas compressor stations or industrial facilities) within the AQCRs that would also be impacted by an AIM Project compressor station were considered.  Long-term noise impacts from the AIM Project compressor stations would be localized to within one mile of each station. Therefore, we evaluated other projects that would result in long-term impacts on noise affecting the same NSAs as the AIM Project compressor stations. The anticipated cumulative impacts of the AIM Project and these other actions are discussed below, as are pertinent mitigation measures. Table 4.13-1 lists present or reasonably foreseeable future projects or activities that may cumulatively or additively impact resources that would be affected by the construction and operationof the AIM Project. 4-283 TABLE 4.13-1 Existing or Proposed Projects Evaluated for Potential Cumulative Impacts in Conjunction with the AIM Project  Location Resources Relative to Cumulatively Facility/Project Description Status AIM Project Affecteda  REPLACEMENT PIPELINE Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay Second Ramapo to Establish a second 345-kV In-service 6.5 miles from MP 0.0 None Rock Tavern 345 transmission line from Con Edison’s summer 2016 on the Haverstraw to kV Line Project Ramapo 345-kV substation to the Stony Point Take-up CH Rock Tavern 345-kV substation and Relay along Con Edison’s existing right-ofway, using existing transmission towers, in Orange and Rockland Counties, New York.

These include Algonquin’s Salem Lateral Project in Massachusetts; Tennessee’s Connecticut Expansion Project in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut; Tennessee’s Northeast Energy Direct Project in New York and Massachusetts; National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation’s Northern Access 2015 Project in New York; National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and Empire Pipeline, Inc.’s Northern Access 2016 and Tuscarora Lateral Projects in New York; and Dominion Gas Transmission’s New Market Project in New York.  However, none of these other projects would occur within the same region of influence as the AIM Project and are therefore not discussed further.  Algonquin is also currently evaluating proposals to modify other parts of its existing interstate natural gas pipeline systemto meet the growing market demand for increased energy (Algonquin, 2014d). We are aware of two planned expansions. The first is as the Atlantic Bridge Project and would involve work in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. Similar to the scope of the AIM Project, the planned facility modifications associated with the Atlantic Bridge Project would generally consist of replacing sections of existing pipeline with new larger diameter pipeline, installing pipeline adjacent to sections of existing pipeline, increasing compression at existing compressor stations, and modifying a number of existing meter stations to provide for increased deliveries. The specific details about the Atlantic Bridge Project are currently not fully developed and no applications have been filed. However, Algonquin provided information about the project in its comments on the draft EIS. We note that because this project is still under development, the information provided presents the conservative, larger scope under consideration. Similar to the AIM Project, upon requesting use of the pre-filing process, during the pre-filing process, or upon submitting an application, the Atlantic Bridge Project may be reduced is scope to reflect its purposeand the refined developed facilities. 4-288 The project may include 52.5 miles of new loop and replacement of existing pipeline and additional compression at six existing Algonquin compressor stations and one new compressor station. All 52.5 miles would be within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way, consisting primarily of Algonquin’s pipeline right-of-way, and including small areas of public roadways, railways, and/or other utility rightsof-way. Specifically, the Atlantic Bridge Project may involve:  New Yorkfacilities comprising: a. 8.0 miles of 42-inch-diameter pipeline to replace 8.0 miles of existing 26-inch– diameter pipeline in Rockland (1.2 miles), and Putnam and Westchester (6.8 miles) Counties; and b. additional compression at Algonquin’s existing Southeast and Stony Point Compressor Stations in the Towns of Southeast in Putnam County, and Stony Point in Rockland County;and  Connecticutfacilities comprising: a. 11.9 miles of new 36-inch-diameter loop pipeline to extend the existing 36-inchdiameter loop along its Cromwell system in Hartford, Middlesex, and Tolland Counties; b. 5.8 miles of new 12-and 36-inch-diameter loop pipeline along its Chaplin (3.9miles) and P-1 (1.9 miles)systems in Windham and Hartford Counties; c. 12.0 miles of 16-and 42-inch-diameter pipeline to replace 12.0 miles of existing 6-and 26-inch-diameter pipeline along its E-1 (2.2 miles), Oxford (5.6 miles), and Southeast (4.2 miles) systems in New London, New Haven, and Fairfield Counties; d. additional compression and cooling at Algonquin’s existing Chaplin Compressor Station in the Town of Chaplin in Windham County; and e. additional compression at Algonquin’s existing Cromwell and Oxford Compressor Stations in the Towns of Cromwell in Middlesex Countyand Oxford in New Haven County;and  Massachusetts facilities comprising: a. 10.3 miles of new 16-and 30-inch-diameter loop pipeline along its G-4 and Q-1 systems in Bristol (0.2 mile) and Norfolk (10.1 miles)Counties; b. 1.0 mile of 20-inch-diameter pipeline to replace 1.0 mile of existing 8-inchdiameterpipeline along its G-8 system in Barnstable County; and c. a new Weymouth Compressor Station in the Town of Weymouth in Norfolk County; and  Rhode Island Facilities comprising: a. 3.5 milesofnew 12-and 16-inch-diameter loop pipeline alongits G-2 (2.2miles) and G-4 (1.3 miles) systems in Newport County; and b. additional compression at Algonquin’s existing Burrillville Compressor Station in the Town of Burrillville in Providence County. 4-289 If the Atlantic Bridge Project were to move forward, it does appear that there would be facilities within the same region of influence as the AIM Project. Impacts associated with the Atlantic Bridge Project would be similar to those of the AIM Project (i.e., short term and localized during construction). Although the same region of influence would be affected, the temporal scale of the projects is different. The AIM Project would be constructed in 2015 and 2016. The earliest the Atlantic Bridge Project would be placed into service would be November 2017. If the Atlantic Bridge Project gets constructed, air emissions during operation of compressor stations would overlap with the operational air emissions of the AIM Project. Additional discussion of the Atlantic Bridge Project is included in the cumulative impact assessment by resource below. The other planned Algonquin project is the Access Northeast Project. According to Spectra Energy’s website, this project is being developed in response to the New England governors’ initiative on new energy infrastructure and in anticipation of a request for a proposal from the New England States Committee on Electricity to expand existing natural gas pipeline capacity and meet critical demand for reliable electric power generation. Algonquin claims this project would provide New England power generators with greater fuel certainty and performance flexibility with no-notice, firm, and interruptible natural gas transportation services.  It would also potentially provide LDCs with access to new supplies of natural gas to support initiatives by the LDCs to have customers convert to natural gas for heating. Spectra Energy’s website indicates that the company hoped to secure expression of interest frompotential customers by the end of 2014, but it does not provide any information about the size or location of the proposed facilities. Spectra Energy indicates that, if they receive adequate market support, they would begin seeking regulatory approvals in 2015 with a goal of constructingand placing the facilities in service by the end of 2018. Because the Access Northeast Project would not occur at the same time as the AIM Project, and because details are not known, it is not considered further in this analysis. Marcellus Shale We received numerous comments during scoping for the Project and in response to the draft EIS about cumulative impacts associated with development of natural gas reserves (including hydraulic fracturing) in the Marcellus shale region. Marcellus shale development activities may be considered under the category above for major transportation and energy development projects; however, activities associated with Marcellus shale development would occur well over 10 miles from the AIM Project construction area, outside of the sub-watersheds crossed by the AIM Project facilities, and outside of the AQCRs for the AIM Project compressor stations. As a result, the local resources that may be affected by Marcellus shale development would not be affected by the Project, and local resources affected by the Project would not be affected by development in the Marcellus shale region. Therefore, cumulative impacts associated with Marcellus shale development are not discussed further. Growth-inducing Effects The EPA and commentors requested that we identify any growth-inducing impacts from the AIM Project. Indirect effectsmayincludegrowth-inducing effects andother effects related to induced changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems (40 CFR 1508.8(b)). Typically, the growth-inducing potential of a 4-290 project would be considered adverse if it fosters growth or a concentration of population above what is assumed in local and regional land use plans, or in projections made by regional planning authorities. Growth impacts could also occur if a project provides infrastructure or service capacity to accommodate growth levels beyond those permitted by local or regional plans and policies.  The Project area is already served by various natural gas transmission lines so the Project would not extend public service to areas currently unserved by natural gas transmission lines. However, the new West Roxbury Lateral would support long-term growth in the Boston area, as well as enhance and reinforce the existing Boston gas delivery system and reliability during outage situations. LDCs may build additional lines to serve the new customers, but it is speculative to assume where the new lines would go and the resulting impacts.  The operation of the proposed Project may result in some air quality and climate benefits if a portion of the additional natural gas that is delivered to the region is used to off-set the use of oil-fired electrical generating units during time periods when cleaner-burning natural gas-fired electrical generating units are not able to procure sufficient fuel to meet electrical demands. In addition, economic activity is already taking place. The demand for energy and the proposed Project are a result of, rather than a precursor to, development in this region. Therefore, the Project would not result in adverse growth-inducing effects. 4.13.1 Geology and Soils The facilities associated with the AIM Project are expected to have a direct but temporary impact on near-surface geology and soils. Clearing activities could expose the soil to erosive elements such as precipitation and wind. The potential for impacts due to erosion by water is minimal because less than 4 percent of the soils along the proposed Project pipeline segments would be susceptible to water erosion and are found entirelyalongthe pipeline segments in Connecticut. Similarly, about 4 percent ofAIM’s Project facilities would disturb soils considered to be susceptible to wind erosion. About 8.3 miles of the soils along the proposed pipeline segments are considered prime farmland. Additionally, about 101.0 acres of soils within the proposed pipeline workspaces and 7.4 acres of the soils within the permanent rights-of-way are also considered prime farmland. Impacts on geological and soil resources would be minimized by implementation of Algonquin’s E&SCP. The effects on geology and soils would be highly localized and limited primarily to the period of construction; therefore, cumulative impacts on geology and soils would only occur if other projects are constructed at the same time and place as the proposed facilities. If the Atlantic Bridge project moves forward as currently planned, the impacts of the Atlantic Bridge Project on geology and soils would be similar to those of the AIM Project (i.e., short-term and localized impacts on topography and soils during construction). Although many of the same general areas would be affected, the temporal scale of the projects is different. The AIM Project would be constructed in 2015 and 2016, and the disturbed areas would be restored prior to any start of the Atlantic Bridge Project, which at its earliest would be constructed in 2017. This assumes that Algonquin files an application and that the project is approved by the appropriate federal and state agencies. For this reason, and because we do not anticipate any major long-term effects on geology and soils, there would be no significant cumulative impact on soils associated with the AIM and Atlantic Bridge Projects. The construction of some of the projects listed in table 4.13-1, such as the West Point Transmission Project and Champlain Hudson Power Express Project, could coincide with the schedule proposed for the AIM Project. Projects that require significant excavation or grading would also have temporary, direct impacts on near-surface geology and soils, although, like the AIM Project, the duration and effect of these projects would be minimized by the implementation of erosion control and restoration measures. Construction and restoration activities as well as operation and maintenance activities would 4-291 be monitored throughout the process to ensure compliance. Should hazardous materials or contaminated soils and/or sediments be encountered during construction, they would be disposed of at fully licensed and permitted disposal facilities in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations. Consequently, any potential cumulative effects on geological and soil resources would be minor. Many scoping comments were received regarding the potential cumulative effect of blasting operations associated with the proposed Project and the existing West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry.  Algonquin discussed with the owners of the quarry the anticipated schedule and logistics associated with constructing the West Roxbury Lateral and M&R station, as well as the long-term operations of these facilities. No direct conflicts were identified that would inhibit the construction of the Project or the continued day-to-day operation of the quarry. Further, blasting at the quarry is performed under a permit issued by the City of Boston Fire Department, which specifies a limit on the allowable blast-induced vibration magnitude (e.g., amplitude or peak particle velocity) at any abutting property of 1.0 inch per second. Similarly, if blasting is required for the Project, it would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E) as well as applicable state blasting codes and any local blasting requirements. All blasting activity would be performed by state-licensed professionals according to strict guidelines designed to control energy release. Proper safeguards would be taken to protect personnel and property in the area.  Therefore, we do not anticipate any significant cumulative effects as a resultof blasting in this area. Comments were also received regarding the future plans of the West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry and the potential for closing of the quarry and reclamation of the site. It is our understanding that although preliminary information on the filling of the quarry was provided to the MassDEP in January 2014, no specific plan has been proposed or authorizations requested. The type of soil to be used in the reclamation appears to be under debate. Therefore, any future plans are speculative at this point. In addition, reclamation of the site would likely need to occur over decades. As a result, any overlap with construction of the AIM Project seems unlikely. Further, a filling and closing of the quarry would negate many of the same commentor’s concerns regarding quarry blasting impacts on the of the AIM Project. 4.13.2 Waterbodies, Groundwater and Wetlands Cumulative effects on surface water resources affected by the AIM Project would be limited to waterbodies that are affected by other projects located within the same major watershed. A total of 102 waterbody crossings would be required for the Project, including 36 perennial streams, 62 intermittent streams, 3 ephemeral streams, and one ponded area. Some of the projects listed in table 4.13-1 would be located within the same major watersheds crossed by the AIM Project, but only a small number of these (e.g., the Atlantic Bridge Project, West Point Transmission Project, Champlain Hudson Power Express Project, U.S. Gypsum Company dredging project, which are discussed in more detail in section 4.13.3) would likely involve direct in-stream impacts. Based on current preliminary plans, 77 waterbodies would be crossed during construction of the Atlantic Bridge Project, including the Connecticut River, which would be crossed using the HDD construction method. The AIM Project would not involve the construction of permanent diversions or dams and, therefore, is expected to have only temporary impacts on surface water quality. The greatest potential impacts of pipeline construction on surface waters would result from an increase in sediment loading to surface waters and an increase in internal sediment loading due to channel/floodplain instability as a result of a change in erosion/deposition patterns. The level of impact would depend on precipitation events, sediment loads, stream area/velocity, channel integrity, bed material, and the proposed construction method. The impacts would be avoided or minimized by the use of Algonquin’s E&SCP, BDP Plan for monitoring HDD activities, and SPCC Plan. Cumulative effects on groundwater resources are expected to be limited to areas that are affected by other projects located near the AIM Project facilities. Groundwater impacts could include increased 4-292 turbidity, reduced water levels, and contamination. Nearby water wells could also be damaged by construction. If a water supply well is damaged as a result of Project construction, Algonquin would ensure that a temporary source of water is provided until the damaged water well is restored to its preconstruction capacity and quality, a replacement water source would be provided, or the landowner would be fairly compensated for damages. The impacts on groundwater would be avoided or minimized by the use of both standard and specialized construction techniques, including those specified in Algonquin’s E&SCP and BDP Plan for monitoring HDD activities. Algonquin would hydrostatically test the new pipeline segments in accordance with PHMSA pipeline safety regulations in 49 CFR 192 prior to placing the pipeline facilities into service. Algonquin estimates a need for a total of about 10,082,645 gallons of water to conduct the hydrostatic testing for the Project (9,610,245 gallons for pipeline testing and 472,400 gallons for aboveground facilities). Most of this water would be obtained from municipal sources, but some would be appropriated from the old Verplanck Quarry Lake in New York. However, to our knowledge none of the projects listed in table 4.13-1 would be expected to use water from the Old Verplanck Quarry Lake at the same time or at all. Following testing of the pipeline, the water would be discharged into dewatering structures located in upland areas and within the construction work area in accordance with the AIM Project E&SCP and the hydrostatic testing BMPs provided by agencies. Therefore, long-term impacts on surface water sources would not be anticipated as a result of hydrostatic testing activities, and we expect the cumulative impacts of the projects listed in table 4.13-1 on surface and groundwater resources to be minor. There would be a temporary loss of some existing wetland features as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed AIM Project facilities and the other reasonably foreseeable projects in the States of New York and Connecticut as listed in table 4.13-1. No wetlands would be affected in Rhode Island or Massachusetts from construction or operation of Project facilities. The AIM Project would convert about 2.4 acres of PFO wetlands to non-forested wetlands during operation of the pipeline facilities. There would be no wetland impacts from proposed aboveground facilities, and the Project would not result in any permanent loss of wetlands. Preliminary estimates for the Atlantic Bridge Project are that 45.9 acres of wetlands would be affected during construction. Algonquin would mitigate unavoidable construction-related impacts on wetlands associated with the AIM Project by implementing the wetland protection and restoration measures contained in its E&SCP and by complying with the conditions of the wetland permits that couldbe issued by the USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP as well as compensatory mitigation. Similar mitigation would be required for any unavoidable wetland impacts associated with the Atlantic Bridge Project and the other projects listed in table 4.13-1. Although construction of the AIM Project along with the other projects in the area could result in the conversion or reduction in the amount of existing wetlands in the vicinity, the creation of new wetlands and restoration or enhancement of existing wetlands as required by the USACE are expected to appropriately mitigate for impacts on wetland resources and minimize any cumulative wetland effects. 4.13.3 Vegetation, Wildlife and Habitat, and Aquatic Resources Construction of the Project would temporarily impact about 352.4 acres of forested upland and open upland vegetation. The Project would result in the permanent impact on about 34.7 acres of vegetation, primarily forested upland.  Right-of-way clearing and grading and other construction activities associated with the Project along with some of the other projects listed in table 4.13-1 would result in the removal of vegetation; alteration of wildlife habitat; displacement of wildlife; and other potential secondary effects such as increased population stress, predation, and the establishment of invasive plant species. These effects would be greatest where the other projects are constructed within the same timeframe and areas as the proposed AIM Project, and where the recovery time of the vegetation/habitat takes longer to restore to its preconstruction state. The Atlantic Bridge Project, for example, would include pipeline facilities in many of the same counties as the AIM Project. Given its length of pipeline 4-293 (which includes 15 miles more pipeline than the AIM Project), it would likely result in vegetation, wildlife, and aquatic impacts that exceed the AIM Project. These effects would be separated in time by abouta year, but the long-term effects of tree clearingand associated change in habitats would persist. Algonquin’s proposal to locate the majority of its facilities within or adjacent to existing, previously disturbed rights-of-way (e.g., pipeline utility, road, etc.) would minimize the areas of previously undisturbed vegetation that would be affected, thereby reducing the additional cumulative effects on vegetation communities and wildlife habitats, including migratory birds. The potential for habitat fragmentation resulting from the Project would be further reduced, because the majority of the disturbed areas would be allowed to return to pre-existing conditions following construction. The geographic extent and duration of disturbances caused by construction of the Project would be minimal and further reduced by implementation of Algonquin’s E&SCP and other construction, restoration, and mitigation plans. Based on our understanding of the Atlantic Bridge Project, it would also be entirely located within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way and most disturbed areas would be allowed to return to pre-existing conditions, which would minimize impacts. Construction of the AIM Project at the same time as other projects listed in table 4.13-1 could result in cumulative impacts on aquatic resources within the AIM Project area, including groundwater, surface water, and wetlands. Thirty of the waterbodies that would be crossed by the Project support fisheries of special concern (two would be crossed by HDD, thereby avoiding in-stream impacts). Eight waterbodiesare waters with naturallyoccurringspawningpopulations oftrout. Itis unclearhowmany of these streams could be effected by other projects but, given that the Atlantic Bridge Project would include pipeline facilities in many of the same counties as the AIM Project, there is a potential for cumulative surface water and aquatic resource impacts. Potential impacts on waterbodies within the collective AIM and Atlantic Bridge Project areas include sedimentation and turbidity, destruction of stream cover, introduction of water pollutants, interruption of fish migration and spawning, and entrainment of fish. The potential impacts of each project would be minimized through the implementation of Algonquin’s E&SCP, SPCC Plan, and site-specific crossing plans prepared in consultation with the FERC and other agencies. The potential for cumulative impact would also be minimized due to the short duration of the proposed in-stream activities and the 1-year separation in time between the construction schedules of the AIM and Atlantic Bridge Projects Collectively, these measures would avoid significant cumulative impacts on waterbodies resources. If any of the other projects listed in table 4.13-1 would involve direct in-stream impacts on waterbodies, they would be required to obtain permits from the USACE and appropriate state agencies, and consult with the EPA, the FWS, and NOAA Fisheries as applicable. These agencies would assess the potential for cumulative impacts from these projects and require measures to mitigate impacts on aquatic resources associated with these other projects. Therefore, the cumulative effects on aquatic resources would be minor. One waterbody (the Hudson River) contains threatened and endangered species and anadromous fisheries. Both the proposed West Point Transmission Project and Champlain Hudson Power Express Projects would be buried in the Hudson River for several miles including the areacrossed or very near the proposed AIM crossing location, and the U.S. Gypsum Company conducts ongoing maintenance dredging nearby. Combined, these activities would result in water quality impacts and could potentially affect threatened and endangered species and anadromous fisheries within the river. The AIM Project is not expected to contribute to the cumulative impact of these other projects. Algonquin would avoid impacting the special status species in the Hudson River by using the HDD crossing method. Should an inadvertent release of drilling fluid occur, Algonquin would implement the measures detailed in its BDP Plan for monitoring the HDD program. A total of nine federally listed species, under the jurisdiction of either the FWS or NOAA Fisheries, are known to occur in the Project area. One additional species is a candidate species and one is 4-294 proposed for listing under the ESA. Through consultation with the state agencies, 29 state-listed threatened, endangered, or special concern species were identified as potentially occurring in the New York and Connecticut sections of the Project area.  No state-listed species were identified as a concern for the Project in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Cumulative impacts on these species could result if other reasonably foreseeable future projects listed in table 4.13-1 would affect these same species or their habitat. The AIM Project would have no effect on seven of these species. Four of these species may be affected, but would not be adversely affected or jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Algonquin would adhere to conservation measures to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts on any listed species affected by the Project. Furthermore, Algonquin has committed to an overall conservation plan for state-listed species in Connecticut. Conservation measures would likely be required as well for each of the other projects by the jurisdictional agencies to minimize potential impacts on federally and state-listed species. Overall, the conservation measures would be project-specific and would be expected to reduce impacts such that the projects would not adversely affect special status species or would not jeopardize the continued existence ofa species or cause adverse modification of critical habitat. 4.13.4 Land Use, Recreation, Special Interest Areas, andVisual Resources Land Use The AIM Project in combination with other foreseeable future projects listed in table 4.13-1 would result in temporary and permanent changes on current land uses. Construction of the Project would impact a total of about 575.6 acres. The primary land use types impacted during construction would be forest/woodland (33 percent), open land (28 percent), industrial/commercial land (26 percent), and residentialland (9 percent).  Agricultural land and open water would make up the remaining4 percent of land types impacted during construction of the proposed Project. The majority of land use impacts associated with the AIM Project would be temporary, as most land uses would be allowed to revert to prior uses following construction. However, about 42.4 acres of new land outside of Algonquin’s existing permanent right-of-way would be permanently encumbered by operation of the Project. The primary land use types that would be permanently encumbered would be forest/woodland (64 percent), open land (18 percent), industrial/commercial land (7 percent), and agricultural land (7 percent). Open water and residential land would make up the remaining 4 percent of permanent impacts. The Atlantic Bridge Project would affect about 700 acres of land during construction and operation. Of the 700 acres, about 390 acres would be within existing rights-of-way. About 110 acres of new permanent right-of-way would be required for the Atlantic Bridge Project. Like with the AIM Project, most land use impacts would be temporary and most land would revert to prior uses following construction. If the other utility and commercial/residential development projects planned in the AIM Project area as listed in table 4.13-1 would also affect similar land uses, then cumulative impacts would also result. However, compared to the other proposed projects the permanent change in land use from implementation of the AIM Project (and the Atlantic Bridge Project if it is approved and constructed) would be relatively minor and would not represent a significant cumulative impact. Recreation and Special Interest Areas A number of recreational or areas of special interest would be affected by the AIM Project and cumulative impacts on recreational or special interest areas could result if the other foreseeable future projects listed in table 4.13-1 would affect the same area at the same time. However, at present we are not aware of recreational areas that would be affected by both the AIM Project and one or more of the other projects in table 4.13-1. The Atlantic Bridge Project would include many facilities in the same counties as the AIM Project and some of these facilities would be in the same location as or adjacent to the AIM Project facilities, but we have not identified specific recreational areas that would be directly affected by both projects. In general, Project impacts on recreational and special interest areas occurring 4-295 outside of forest land would be temporary and limited to the period of active construction, which typically lasts only several days to several weeks in any one area. These impacts would be minimized by implementing Algonquin’s E&SCP. Following construction, most open land uses would be able to revert to their former uses. Forest land affected by the temporary construction right-of-way and ATWS areas, however, would experience long-term impacts because of the time required to restore the woody vegetation to its preconstruction condition. Further, forest land within the new permanent right-of-way would experience permanent impacts because it would be precluded from being reestablished within the maintained portion of the right-of-way.  Algonquin would construct the majority of the Project adjacent to its existing pipelines within its existing permanent right-of-way or largely overlapping its existing permanent right-of-way, or within or adjacent to existing roadways. In addition, some of the other projects listed in table 4.13-1 have or would cross federal, state, or local recreation and special interest areas. However, none appear to cross the same areas as those affected by the AIM Project. As a result, although the Project could have significant impacts on recreation and special interest areas, cumulative impacts on those same areas are not anticipated. Visual Resources The visual character of the existing landscape is defined by historic and current land uses such as recreation, conservation, and development. The visual qualities of the landscape are further influenced by existing linear installations such as highways, railroads, pipelines, and electrical transmission and distribution lines. Temporary visual impacts would be evident during Project construction due to clearing, grading, and construction activities. The majority of aboveground facilities associated with the AIM Project would consist of modifications to existing structures. The modifications to the existing compressor stations would be conducted within or adjacent to Algonquin’s existing station buildings and within the footprint of an existing commercial/industrial property. Construction of the new M&R stations, specifically the West Roxbury M&R Station and Oakland Heights M&R Station, would not result in significant visual impacts on the surrounding areas with implementation of site-specific mitigation measures such as maintaining vegetative buffers.  Of the projects listed in table 4.13-1, the proposed transportation and commercial/residential projects would have the greatest cumulative impact on visual resources in the Project area. The majority of the Atlantic Bridge, West Point Transmission Project, and Champlain Hudson Power Express Projects would be buried and all but one of the known aboveground facilities associated with the Atlantic Bridge Project would be located at existing compressor stations. The AIM Project facilities would add incrementally to this impact but the overall contribution would be relatively minor given that the majority of the AIM Project facilities would be buried (i.e., the pipeline) or adjacent to existing facilities of similar appearance (i.e., the aboveground facilities). Additionally, disturbed areas would be revegetated as appropriate after construction, thereby limiting permanent visual impacts on those areas where previously existing forest would not be allowed to reestablish within the new permanent right-of-way due to pipeline safety and operational requirements.  Therefore, cumulative visualimpacts would be minimal. 4.13.5 Socioeconomics Present and reasonably foreseeable future projects and activities could cumulatively impact socioeconomic conditions in the AIM Project area. As described below, employment, housing, infrastructure, and public services could experience both beneficial and negative impacts.  Economy and Employment The projects considered in this section would have cumulative effects on employment during construction if more than one project is built at the same time. Algonquin estimates that the AIM Project would temporarily employ up to 2,693 workers during the peak construction months, of which a peak of 4-296 649 workers would be local hires. These local hires would include surveyors, welders, equipment operators, and general laborers.  The counties affected by the Project have a combined civilian labor force of about 3,750,965 people and an average unemployment rate of 7.3 percent. This suggests that the local labor force could meet much of the employment needs required for construction of these projects, although it is unknown whether a sufficient number of local unemployed persons have the necessary skills to work on these projects. Therefore, if these projects are built at the same time, the demand for workers could exceed the local supply of appropriately skilled labor. The schedule for construction of the Atlantic Bridge Project, if approved, would be a year after the AIM Project facilities would be placed in service. As such, it is not expected to compound any potential shortage of appropriately skilled labor, but because it is in the same area as the AIM Project and could be constructed shortly after the AIM Project, it could extend the term of employment for many temporary workers. Neither project singly or in combination would have a measurable long-term impact on the economy or employment. Three new permanent employees would be hired to operate the proposed AIM Project facilities and it is likely that a similar number of new permanent employees would be hired for the Atlantic Bridge Project. The longterm employment opportunities associated with the other projects in table 4.13-1 is unknown but they are likely to provide a moderate amount of other permanent employment opportunities. In addition to impacts on local employment, these projects would provide an increase in tax revenue for New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts,and other local economies through the payment of payroll tax, sales tax, property tax, and other taxes and fees.  As discussed in section 4.9.8, the estimated payroll for the AIM Project would be about $264,316,027 during the construction phase and annual property taxes attributable to the Project are anticipated to be about $20,070,000 in New York, $5,770,000 in Connecticut, $970,000 in Rhode Island, and $2,360,000 in Massachusetts, which includes construction of the new West Roxbury Lateral. Given the larger size and later start date for the Atlantic Bridge Project (and the likelihood of some inflation over the time period separating the two projects), the estimated construction payroll for the Atlantic Bridge Project may be larger. The annual property taxes attributable to the Atlantic Bridge Project are also likely to be similar. A net increase in payroll and tax revenues is likely to occur from the other projects listed in table 4.13-1 as well. Cumulatively, these projects would have both short- and long-term beneficial impacts on state, county, and local economies. Temporary Housing Temporary housing would be required for construction workers who would be needed for the portion of the workforce not drawn from the local area. Given the current vacancy rates, the number of rental housing units in the area, and the number of hotel/motel rooms available in the cities and towns in the vicinity of the Project, construction workers should not encounter difficulty in finding temporary housing. If construction occurs concurrently with other projects, temporary housing would still be available but may be slightly more difficult to find and/or more expensive to secure. Regardless, these effects would be temporary, lasting only for the duration of construction, and there would be no long-term cumulative impacton housing from the proposed Project. Public Services The cumulative impact of the AIM Project and the other projects listed in table 4.13-1 on infrastructure and public services would depend on the number of projects under construction at one time. The small incremental demands of several projects occurring at the same time could become difficult for police, fire, and emergency service personnel to address. This problem would be temporary, occurring only for the duration of construction, and could be mitigated by the various project sponsors providing their own personnel to augment the local capability or by providing additional funds or training for local personnel. Because no long-term impacts from implementation of the AIM Project would be anticipated on infrastructure and public services, we find no long long-term cumulative effects would occur. 4-297 Construction of the proposed Project would have a temporary impact on road traffic in some areas and could contribute to cumulative traffic, parking, and transit impacts if other projects are scheduled to take place at the same time and in the same area as the AIM Project. Traffic impacts associated with the AIM Project are expected along the new West Roxbury Lateral in Norfolk and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts. Limited traffic impacts would occur at most other proposed railroad, highways, and major road crossings because these would be accomplished by drilling, boring, or other methods that do notaffect the road or rail surface. The addition of traffic associated with construction personnel commuting to and from the Project construction work areas could also contribute to cumulative regional traffic congestion. However, any contribution of the AIM Project to cumulative traffic impacts would be temporary and short term.  Workers associated with the AIM Project would generally commute to and from the pipeline right-ofway, pipe and contractor ware yards, or aboveground facility sites during off-peak traffic hours 6 days a week (e.g., before 7:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m.). The Atlantic Bridge Project would not contribute to the traffic impacts of the AIM Project because it would be constructed a year later than the AIM Project. It is also unlikely that other projects listed in table 4.13.1 would have similar commuting schedules or reach peak traffic conditions simultaneously. Other factors would also minimize the potential for cumulative traffic impacts due to the AIM Project. Algonquin stated that construction work within roadways and specific crossings would be scheduled to avoid commuter traffic and schedules for school buses and local city transit buses to the greatest extent practical. To minimize traffic delays at open-cut road crossings, Algonquin would establish detours before cutting these roads. If no reasonable detours were feasible, at least one traffic lane of the road would be left open, except for brief periods when road closure would be required to lay the pipeline. Impacts associated with in-street construction would be minimized through implementation of Algonquin’s site-specific Traffic Management Plans. Appropriate traffic management and signage would be set up and necessary safety measures would be developed in compliance with applicable permits for work in the public roadway.  Although construction details are not available for all projects listed in table 4.13-1, we know or assume that the Champlain Hudson Power Express Project, West Point Transmission Project, and U.S. Gypsum Company dredging activities, as well as several other possible projects, would involve work in the Hudson River. Some of these projects would likely involve increased barge traffic that would navigate the Hudson River and/or remain stationary within the river during construction of individual projects. The HDD method would involve staging construction equipment on land, thus the AIM Project is not expected to result in cumulative impacts on navigation in the Hudson River with the other projects listed in table 4.13-1. Nonetheless, it is expected that all projects will coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard and USACE to ensure that there areno cumulative impacts on navigationwithin the Hudson River. Overall, the AIM Project would have short term, but positive effects on the economy in the Project area, such as increased employment thus lowering local unemployment rates and increased sales and tax revenues. Other major projects in the area would likely have similar impacts on the economy. Thus, short-term cumulative effects on socioeconomics in the Project area are possible. 4.13.6 Cultural Resources Past disturbances to cultural resources in the AIM Project area are typically related to accidental disturbances; intentional destruction or vandalism; lack of awareness of historical value; and construction and maintenance operations associated with existing roads, railroads, utility lines, and electrical transmission lines. The currently proposed projects listed in table 4.13-1 that are defined as federal 4-298 actions would include mitigation measures designed to avoid or minimize additional direct impacts on cultural resources. Where direct impacts on cultural resources are unavoidable, mitigation (e.g., recovery and curation of materials) would occur before construction. Non-federal actions would need to comply with any mitigation measures required by the affected states. Algonquin has developed Project-specific plans to address unanticipated discoveries of cultural resources and human remains in the event they are discovered during construction. Therefore, the proposed AIM Project may incrementally add to the cumulative effects of other projects that may occur at the same time. However, this incremental increase would not be significant. Indian tribes in the Project area have expressed concern about the cumulative impacts on properties of traditional religious or cultural significance that may be affected by the various undertakings. For the AIM Project, we have engaged in frequent communications with the tribes who have expressed concern about the Project. Other agencies (e.g., USACE) also conduct tribal consultation for projects under theirjurisdiction in order to identify and address any tribalconcerns. 4.13.7 Air Quality and Noise Construction of most of the reasonably foreseeable future projects and activities listed in table 4.13-1 would involve the use of heavy equipment that would generate emissions of air contaminants, fugitive dust, and noise. Construction and operation of the AIM Project would contribute cumulatively to air quality impacts. The combined impact of multiple construction projects occurring in the same airshed and timeframe as the AIM Project could temporarily add to the ongoing air impacts in the Project area. The entire AIM Project area is designated attainment or unclassifiable for SO2, NO2, PM10, and lead. Certain counties within the Project area are designated as nonattainment and/or maintenance for CO, ozone, and PM2.5 as described in section 4.11.1.1. Construction activities for the proposed Project facilities and pipeline replacement activities would result in temporary increases in emissions of some pollutants due to the use of equipment powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Construction activities would also result in the temporary generation of fugitive dust due to land clearing, ground excavation, and cut and fill operations. The construction equipment emissions would result in short-term fugitive emissions that would be highly localized, temporary, and intermittent. Construction of many of the projects listed in table 4.13-1 would not occur at the same time as construction of the AIM Project facilities or are located sufficiently far away as to not result in cumulative air impacts. In addition, Algonquin has consulted with WPP and it has identified that construction of the converter station associated with the West Point Transmission Project, located on the same parcel, would not occur at the same time. Therefore, simultaneous cumulative air impacts of the AIM Project and West Point Transmission Project would not occur. Modifications to the compressor stations and some of the M&R stations would be sources of air emissions during operation of the Project. Non-combustion related emissions would also occur from the pipeline and at the proposed M&R stations during normal operation. The air modeling presented in section 4.11.1 for each of the compressor stations demonstrates that impacts of the stations along with the existing air quality would not be significant. With the mitigation measures proposed by Algonquin, we do not anticipate that the construction and operation of the proposed Project facilities are expected to have a significant impact on air quality in the Project area or in the region itself. The potential emissions associated with the operation of the other projects in table 4.13-1 are unknown, but because the projects listed in the table are located over a large area; have varying construction schedules; and must adhere to federal, state, and local regulations for the protection of ambient air quality, significant cumulative impacts on air quality are not anticipated. The one project that is likely to have a greater impact is the Atlantic Bridge Project. Algonquin has not identified how much compression would be required for this project but it has confirmed that it 4-299 plans to build one new compressor station and add compression at six existing compressor stations. Moreover, the additional compression would be installed at five of the compressor stations where additional compression is proposed as part of the AIM Project. If all of this additional compression is fuelled by natural gas, it is likely the Atlantic Bridge Project would have as much or more operational emissions than the AIM Project. The combined emissions of the two projects would contribute to cumulative impacts on the air quality within the airsheds encompassing these stations, but we do not believe the effect on regional air quality would be significant. Both projects would be subject to federal and state regulations designed to protect ambient air quality (thereby protecting public health and welfare) and prevent significant cumulative impacts. Prior to issuance of air quality permits, the authorities must make a determination that the cumulative effect of both projects would not cause or contribute to an exceedance of ambient air quality standards, that the appropriate level of control of new air emissions would be installed, and that the compressor stations would be in compliance with all applicable federal and state air quality regulations and permit conditions. Additionally, the combined operation of the proposed Project and the Atlantic Bridge Project may result in some air quality and climate benefits if a portion of the additional natural gas that is delivered to the region is used to off-set the use of oil-fired electrical generating units during time periods when cleaner-burning natural gas-fired electrical generating units are not able to procure sufficientfuel to meet electrical demands. Several commentors believe that the emissions from all of the proposed Project compressor stations and M&R stations would cumulatively contribute to air quality impacts. The project facilities are geographically separated and do not all fall within the same region of influence. While all of the compressor station modifications would be part of the same project, they would not all impact the same air quality control regions. Therefore, it is inappropriate to add all compressor station emissions cumulatively. Of the compressor stations located within the same AQCR, the Stony Point and Cromwell Compressor Stations are located about 49 miles apart.  All other compressor stations are located with different AQCRs.  However, because prevailing winds blow in one direction ata time, air quality between facilities would not be affected by two facilities at the same time. Based on modeling analyses completed for the compressor station emissions associated with the proposed Project, emissions from one facility would be at de minimis levels before reaching the airspace of the nextfacility. The AIM Project could contribute to cumulative noise impacts. The analysis in section 4.11.2.1 quantifies future noise levels, which include Project related noise and ambient noise levels. Noise impacts were analyzed by looking at NSAs nearest to the five proposed compressor station modifications, the five existing M&R stations with significant proposed modifications, the three new proposed M&R stations, the two new MLRs, and HDD sites. This analysis included assessing current background noise levels and estimating future noise levels based upon the proposed equipment to be operated. Noise impacts during construction would be highly localized and attenuate quickly as the distance from the noise source increases. The one exception to this would be certain HDD activities at the Hudson River crossing and Interstate 84/Still River crossing. Algonquin performed ambient noise surveys at the HDD sites, and the assessments indicate that mitigation would be necessary at all proposed HDD entrance locations to reduce the predicted noise generated by the HDD operations below the FERC noise requirement (i.e., Ldn of 55 dBA) at the closest NSAs. The AIM Project, together with the other projects listed in table 4.13-1, would all produce noise during construction; however, this noise would be temporary in the vicinity of each of the proposed projects.  Cumulative noise impacts are possible in the areas surrounding the existing compressor stations that would be impacted by the addition of compression associated with both the AIM and Atlantic Bridge Projects (assuming the Atlantic Bridge Project is approved and constructed). These include the Stony Point Compressor station in Rockland County, New York; Southeast Compressor Station in Putnam County, New York; Cromwell Compressor Station in Middlesex County, Connecticut; Chaplin Compressor Station in Windham County, Connecticut; and the Burrillville Compressor Station in 4-300 Providence County, Rhode Island. We reviewed Algonquin’s noise assessment for the AIM Project and found that the proposed facilities could increase the existing noise levels at some NSAs between 0.1 and 1.7 dBA. Generally, these increases would be imperceptible to the human ear. Additionally, the mitigation measures discussed in the assessment and committed to by Algonquin would ensure that the FERC’s noise criterion of 55 dBA would not be exceeded, Algonquin would follow our recommendations outlined in section 4.11.2.3 of this EIS for the AIM Project. Based on the analyses conducted, mitigation measures proposed, and our additional recommendations, we conclude that the Project would not result in significant noise impacts on residents, and the surrounding communities during construction and operation of the AIM Project. We anticipate that the Atlantic Bridge Project would result in noise impacts similar to the AIM Project. As part of its evaluation of the project, we would conduct a noise assessment of the Atlantic Bridge Project facilities. It is likely that this analysis would identify the potential for the Atlantic Bridge Project to increase the noise levels at some NSAs near compressor stations above what is predicted if only the AIM Project is constructed. However, Algonquin would be required, like it was for the AIM Project, to propose mitigation to ensure that the total noise at NSAs from the Atlantic Bridge Project either does not increase or stays below the 55dBA level. For these reasons, we do not anticipate significant noise impacts associated with construction and operation of the AIM Project. 4.13.8 Climate Change Climate change is the change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity, and cannot be represented by single annual events or individual anomalies. For example, a single large flood event or particularly hot summer are not indications of climate change, while a series of floods or warm years that statistically change the average precipitation or temperature over years or decades mayindicate climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international, multi-governmental scientific body for the assessment of climate change. The United States is a member of the IPCC and participates in the IPCC working groups to develop reports. The leading U.S. scientific body on climate change is the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). Thirteen federal departments and agencies14 participate in the USGCRP, which began as a presidential initiative in 1989 and was mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The IPCC and USGCRP have recognized that:  globally, GHGs have been accumulating in the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial era (circa 1750);  combustion of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and natural gas), combined with agriculture and clearing offorests is primarily responsible forthis accumulation of GHG;  these anthropogenic GHG emissions are the primary contributing factor to climate change; and   impacts extend beyond atmospheric climate change alone, and include changes to water resources, transportation, agriculture, ecosystems, and human health. 14 The following departments comprise the USGCRP: EPA, DOE, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Defense, USDA, U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Department of State, PHMSA, Department of Health and Human Services, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, and Agencyfor International Development. 4-301 In May 2014, the USGCRP issued a report, Climate Change Impacts in the United States, summarizing the impacts that climate change has already had on the United States and what projected impacts climate change may have in the future (USGCRP, 2014). The report includes a breakdown of overall impacts by resource and impacts described for various regions of the United States. Although climate change is a global concern, for this cumulative analysis, we will focus on the potential cumulative impacts of climate change in the AIM Project area. The USGCRP’s report notes the following observations of environmental impacts that may be attributed to climate change in the Northeast region:  average temperatures have risen about 2 °F between 1895 and 2011 and are projected to increase another 1 to 8 °F over the next several decades with more frequent days above 90 °F;  areas that currently experience ozone pollution problems are projected to experience an increase in the number of days that failto meetthe federal air quality standards;  an increase in health risks and costs for vulnerable populations due to projected additional heat stress and poor air quality;  precipitation has increased by about 5 inches and winter precipitation is projected to increase 5 to 20 percent by the end of the century;  extreme/heavy precipitation events have increased more than 70 percent between 1958 and 2010 and are projected to continue to increase;  sea levels have risen about 1 foot since 1900 and are projected to continue increasing 1 to 4 feet by 2100 stressing infrastructure (e.g. communications, energy, transportation, water and wastewater);  severe flooding due to sea-level rise and heavy downpours is likely to occur more frequently;  crop damage from intense precipitation events, delays in crop plantings and harvest, and heatstress negatively affect crop yields;  invasive weeds are projected to become more aggressive due to their benefit of higher CO2 levels;  a change in range, elevation, and intra-annual life cycle events of vegetation and wildlife species; and  an increase in carrier habitat and human exposure to vector-borne diseases (e.g. Lyme disease orWest Nile). The GHG emissions associated with construction and operation of the AIM Project are discussed in more detail in section 4.11.1. Several commenters requested that a more in-depth cumulative impact analysis be prepared for GHG emissions, including requesting the prediction of future climate change impacts. FERC staff completed an impact analysis that was appropriate for the scale of the Project. In reference to predicting climate change impacts, FERC staff used guidance provided by the CEQ in their February 18, 2010 memorandum titled "Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of the Effect of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions," which states that "agencies should recognize the scientific 4-302 limits of their ability to accurately predict climate change effects, especially of a short-term nature, and not devote effort to analyzing wholly speculative effects." On December 18, 2014, the CEQ released a revised draft GHG emission guidance memo.  As recommended in this new guidance, to the extent practicable, FERC staff incorporated additional guidance provided by this memo into the GHG analysis completed for the AIM Project.  As such, FERC staff has presented the GHG emissions associated with the Project, potential impacts of GHG emissions, and mitigation proposed by Algonquin to minimize GHG emissions associated with the Project. The GHG emissions from the other projects listed in table 4.13.1 are unknown.  However, based on the relative size of the Atlantic Bridge Project and the number of new or existing compressor stations associated with it, it alone would likely result in as much if not more GHG emissions than the AIM Project. Emissions of GHGs from the proposed Project and other regional projects would not have any direct impacts on the environment in the Project area. Currently, there is no standard methodology to determine how a project’s relatively small incremental contribution to GHGs would translate into physical effects on the global environment. Additionally, natural gas emits less CO2 compared to other fuel sources (e.g., fuel oil or coal).  The CTDEEP issued its Comprehensive Energy Strategy that includes specific recommendations for increasing the use of natural gas in Connecticut (Comprehensive Energy Strategy, 2013). In Massachusetts, the MAEOEEA produced a strategic plan for 2013 to 2015 that includes reliable, clean, and cost-effective energy in their vision statement, and recommends “initiatives to increase availability of low-cost natural gas, like getting more natural gas into distribution systems and more pipeline capacity across the Commonwealth….” (MAEOEEA, 2013). In December 2013, the governors of the six New England states agreed to an energy initiative designed to bring affordable, cleaner, and more reliable power to homes and businesses across the northeast. This would be accomplished through cooperative investments in energy efficiency, renewable generation, natural gas pipelines, and electric transmission (New England Governors, 2013). Also, the USGCRP’s Report states that additional investment into power generating infrastructure may be necessary to offset increasing demand associated with increased temperatures. Because fuel oil is widely used as an alternative to natural gas in the region in which the AIM Project would be located, we find that the Project along with other planned natural gas projects such as the Atlantic Bridge Project would result in the displacement of some fuel oil use, thereby regionally offsetting some GHG emissions. 4.13.9 Reliability and Safety Impact on reliability and public safety would be mitigated through the use of the PHMSA Minimum Federal Safety Standards in Title 49 CFR 192, which are intended to protect the public and to prevent natural gas facility accidents and failures. In addition, Algonquin’s construction contractors would be required to comply with the OSHA Safety and Health Regulations for Construction in Title 29 CFR 1926. We received several comments about potential cumulative impacts relative to safety between the proposed Project and WPP’s proposed West Point Transmission Project. We evaluated the risk associated with constructing and operating transmission lines and natural gas pipelines in close proximity in section 4.12.3. It is not uncommon for natural gas pipeline facilities to parallel existing utility rightsof-ways, including electric transmission rights-of-way and there are established methods for minimizing the risks of these configurations. Algonquin has conducted surveys and collected information on the location and size of existing power line structures within the proposed right-of-way corridors, tower footing locations and dimensions, and wire heights (lowest point between towers) and would design or modify its construction technique on the AIM Project with sufficient offsets to eliminate the risk of heavy construction equipment interfering with overhead high-voltage electric transmission lines during construction and operation. Where possible, Algonquin would offset its pipeline trench by 50 feet to avoid any potential damage to electric transmission towers; and in those areas that this offset could not be 4-303 achieved, the construction technique would be modified. Algonquin would use a licensed blasting engineer and would follow a Project-specific Rock Removal Plan that includes blasting procedures (see section 4.1.6) to avoid damage to overhead electric transmission lines and structures from blasting. To address potential effects on the pipeline from potential lighting strikes to nearby electric transmission towers, Algonquin would consult with an engineer that specializes in developing AC mitigation systems for pipeline utility companies. An AC mitigation system would be designed and installed to mitigate the steady state induced AC on the pipeline and deal with any fault current should one occur. Typically lightning arrestors along with decoupling devices would be employed on the pipeline to protect against any electrical surges. Algonquin and WPP have corresponded and met regarding potential interactions (i.e., cumulative effects) and safety risks between Algonquin’s proposed pipeline facilities and the WPP electric transmission line. Algonquin has committed to conducting an AC/DC interference study and incorporating field surveys and comprehensive modeling to identify potential adverse effects on the pipeline from stray currents and from inductive, conductive, and coupling AC/DC effects from nearby AC/DC utilities (see section 4.12.3). A properly designed natural gas pipeline and electric transmission line crossing or running parallel to each other, even at close distances, would not result in any cumulative operational orpublic safety hazards.   We also received comments about the potential for cumulative safety risks associated with the proximity of the pipeline to the IPEC nuclear facility. Section 4.12.3 of the EIS includes updated information that reflects the results of Entergy's Safety Evaluation for the AIM Project, which was filed with the NRC on August 21, 2014. As a result of consultation between Algonquin and Entergy, Algonquin has agreed to additional design and installation enhancements along approximately 3,935 feet of the AIM Project pipeline where it would lie closest to the IPEC facility (i.e., 0.5 mile from IPEC's security barrier). These measures are described in section 4.12.3. Entergy has concluded that, based on the proposed routing of the 42-inch-diameter pipeline further from safety-related equipment at IPEC, and accounting for the substantial design and installation enhancements agreed to by Algonquin, the proposed AIM Project poses no increased risks to IPEC and there would be no significant reduction in the margin of safety at the facility. The NRC conducted its own, independent review assuming a catastrophic pipeline failure, and concurred with these findings. As such, we find there would not be any significant cumulative impacts on safetyor reliabilityassociatedwith the proximity of the pipeline to the IPEC. 4.13.10 Conclusion Recently completed, ongoing, and planned projects in the AIM Project area were identified for inclusion in this cumulative impact analysis (refer to table 4.13-1). The majority of cumulative impacts would be temporary and minor when considered in combination with past, present, and reasonably foreseeable activities. However, some long-term cumulative impacts would occur on wetland and forested and upland vegetation and associated wildlife habitats. Some long-term cumulative benefits to the community would be realized from the increased tax revenues. Short-term cumulative benefits would also be realized through jobs and wages and purchases of goods and materials. There is also the potential that the Project would contribute to a cumulative improvement in regional air quality if a portion of the natural gas associated with the AIM Project displaces the use of other more polluting fossil fuels. In summary, due to the implementation of specialized construction techniques, the relatively short construction timeframe in any one location, and carefully developed resource protection and mitigation plans designed to minimize and control environmental impacts for the AIM Project as a whole, minimal cumulative effects are anticipated when the impacts of the AIM Project are added to the identified ongoing projects in the immediate area. 4-304 5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 SUMMARY OF THE FERC STAFF’S ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS The conclusions and recommendations presented in this section are those of the FERC environmental staff. Our conclusions and recommendations were developed with input from the EPA, USACE, and PHMSA, as cooperating agencies. The federal cooperating agencies may adopt the EIS per 40 CFR 1506.13 if, after an independent review of the document, they conclude that their permitting requirements and/or regulatory responsibilities have been satisfied. However, these agencies would present their own conclusions and recommendations in their respective and applicable records of decision or determinations. Otherwise, they may elect to conduct their own supplemental environmental analysis, if necessary. We determined that construction and operation of the AIM Project would result in adverse environmental impacts. Most of these environmental impacts would be temporary or short-term during construction and operation, but long-term and potentially permanent environmental impacts on vegetation and individual wildlife species would also occur as part of the Project. However, if the proposed Project is constructed and operated in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, the mitigating measures discussed in this EIS, and our recommendations, most of these adverse impacts would be reduced to less than significant levels. This determination is based on a review of the information provided by Algonquin and further developed from data requests; field investigations; scoping; literature research; alternatives analysis; and contacts with federal, state, and local agencies as well as Indian tribes and individual members of the public. As part of our review, we developed specific mitigation measures that we determined would appropriately and reasonably reduce the environmental impacts resulting from construction and operation of the Project. Therefore, we are recommending that our mitigation measures be attached as conditions to any authorization issued by the Commission. A summary of the anticipated impacts from the Project and our conclusionsregarding impacts are providedbelowby resource area. 5.1.1 Geology andPaleontological Resources Construction and operation of the Project would not materially alter the geologic conditions ofthe Project area. The effects would mostly be limited to construction activities within the right-of-way resulting from grading and trenching operations. Algonquin would minimize the impacts on surface geology by returning contours to preconstruction conditions to the maximum extent practicable. This may not be the case at the aboveground facilities, where grading and filling may be required to create a safe and stable land surface to support the facility. The Project would not cross any active or proposed mines, but the West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry is located adjacent to the West Roxbury Lateral and M&R Station in Massachusetts. No direct conflicts were identified that would inhibit the construction of the Project or the continued day-to-day operation of this quarry. In addition, it should be noted that existing pipelines currently operate in Grove Street between the quarry and the proposed AIM Project facilities. We have found no evidence that these existing pipelines have been impacted by quarry activities. The potential for geologic hazards to significantly affect construction or operation of the proposed Project facilities is low. The Project would not be located in a region that represents a serious seismic risk to the proposed facilities. The USGS has extensively studied the Ramapo Fault system and the level of seismicity in the region. The USGS’s review indicates that there is no clear association between the fault and small earthquakes that do occur in the region. Further, there is insufficient geologic evidence to indicate the existence of a tectonic fault or Holocene-age slip or deformation associated with the fault. In any case, the design of the pipeline takes into consideration site-specific conditions, including earthquakes. The recorded magnitude of earthquakes in the Project area is relatively low and 5-1 the ground vibration would not pose a problem for a modern welded-steel pipeline. The proposed Project facilities would also be located in an area considered to have a low incidence of landslides. Flash flooding has the potential to occur in streams within the Project area, particularly in areas of higher relief and narrower stream valleys in Connecticut; however, no such features are located along the Project route or in proximity to any of the aboveground facilities. We conclude that subsidence due to karst conditions is not anticipated to be a concern for the Project due to the minimal occurrence of calcareous bedrock crossed by the Project and because no mapped karst features have been identified in the Projectarea. The pipeline segments would traverse about 7.2 miles of shallow bedrock that may require blasting. In order to minimize potential impacts from blasting, Algonquin would comply with all federal, state, and local regulations for blasting and has developed an acceptable Rock Removal Plan to be used during construction. With implementation of Algonquin’s E&SCP, Rock Removal Plan, and the additional mitigation measures discussed above, impacts on geological resources would be adequately minimized and would not be significant. 5.1.2 Soils The Project would traverse a variety of soil types and conditions. Construction activities associated with the Project, such as clearing, grading, trenching, and backfilling, could adversely affect soil resources by causing erosion, compaction, and introducing excess rock or fill material to the surface. These effects could hinder restoration of the disturbed areas. Algonquin would implement the mitigation measures contained in its E&SCP to control erosion, enhance successful revegetation, and minimize any potential adverse impacts on soil resources. Contamination from spills or leaks of fuels, lubricants, and coolant from construction equipment could also adversely affect soils. The effects of such contamination are typically minor because of the low frequency and volumes of spills and leaks. In addition, Algonquin has developed an acceptable SPCC Plan that specifies cleanup procedures to minimize the potential for soil contamination from spills or leaks of fuel, lubricants, coolants, orsolvents.  Various locations with potential and/or known sources of soil contamination were identified in the vicinity of the proposed Project facilities in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. To-date, Algonquin has determined that field sampling would be required at two locations (one in Connecticut and one in Massachusetts). The CTDEEP also identified a concern at a third site. To ensure that contamination in the Project area is accurately identified, we are recommending that Algonquin file a Field Sampling Plan for the identification of potential contaminated sites that may be encountered during construction. Excavated contaminated material would be managed in compliance with Algonquin’s acceptable Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures, which specifies measures to ensure that contaminated material is managed in accordance with state and federal regulations. We received comments regarding the potential contamination of PCBs along the Hudson River. Utilizing the HDD method avoids disturbance to river-bottom sediments because all subsurface materials removed along the drill path during the drilling process are removed from the borehole and contained within temporary lined mud pits. Contamination is not expected to be encountered during HDD activities; however, due to the historic presence of PCBs in the area, we are recommending that all subsurface materials recovered from the Hudson River HDD process be appropriately sampled for PCBs prior to disposal of the material. If contamination is found, it should be handled as outlined in the Unanticipated Contamination Encounter Procedures.  With implementation of Algonquin’s E&SCP, SPCC Plan, Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures, and our additional recommended mitigation measure, we conclude that impacts on soil resources would be adequately minimized. 5-2 5.1.3 Water Resources Groundwater resources in the Project area are composed of unconsolidated glacial deposits of sand and gravel underlain by consolidated bedrock aquifer systems. The majority of the Project facilities are not located within a designated SSA. However, the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would cross about 0.5 mile of the Ramapo River Basin SSA in New York. Comments were received on the draft EIS regarding the potential impacts on this aquifer associated with Project construction. AIM Project construction within the drainage basin would occupy only 6.4 acres over the 0.5 linear mile, or just 0.007 percent of the area covered by the drainage basin. The actual construction footprint that could potentially impact the aquifer itself occupies only 2.4 acres. The West Roxbury Lateral crosses a portion of the state-designated Charles River Basin aquifer in Massachusetts and the existing Wellesley M&R Station is also located within the Charles River Basin aquifer. Based on available information, 89 private domestic wells and a public well would be located within 150 feet of Algonquin’s proposed construction work area. Two of the water supply wells would be located within the construction workspace. Construction activities are not likely to significantly impact groundwater resources because the majority of construction would involve shallow, temporary, and localized excavation. These potential impacts would be avoided or minimized by the use of construction techniques described in Algonquin’s E&SCP. The two domestic wells that would be located within the construction workspace would be protected by safety fencing during construction. Algonquin would contact any landowner with water supply wells within 150 feet of the construction workspace and offer to conduct pre-and post-construction monitoring of well yield and water quality. If a water supply well is damaged as a result of Project construction, Algonquin would ensure that a temporary source of water is provided until the damaged water well is restored to its preconstruction capacity and quality, a replacement water source would be provided, or the landowner would be fairly compensated for damages. We are recommending that Algonquin file a report that identifies whether any water supply wells were impacted during construction and how it resolved those impacts. Algonquin would also implement the measures in its SPCC Plan to minimize the potential for groundwater impacts associated with an inadvertent spill of hazardous materials. Algonquin has indicated that there are two sites within the Project area (one in Connecticut and one in Massachusetts) where existing groundwater contamination could be encountered during construction. The CTDEEP has also identified a concern at a third site. These sites would be included in the Field Sampling Plan discussed above. We also received scoping comments related to existing groundwater contamination at the IPEC site.  A hydrogeological analysis of groundwater movement atthe site demonstrated that the proposed AIM Project facilities would not interact with radiologically contaminated groundwater at the IPEC site. Impacts associated with unexpected contaminated groundwater would be avoided or minimized by following the procedures outlined in Algonquin’s Unexpected Contamination Encounter Procedures. Algonquin conducted a review of each of the proposed HDD entry/exit locations, including the modified location on the west side of the river, and found no documented groundwater contamination. Therefore, contamination is not expected to be encountered during HDD activities. We conclude that potentialimpacts on groundwater resources would be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. 5-3 The Project would cross 102 waterbodies, including 36 perennial streams, 62 intermittent streams, 3 ephemeral streams, and a ponded area. The Hudson River is also the only major waterbody (greaterthan 100 feet wide)crossed by the Project.  No waterbodies would be impacted by the work at the existing and proposed aboveground facilities. Five waterbodies would be crossed by the existing access roads. None of the proposed crossings are designated as EFH, though the proposed Hudson River crossing is located north of a designated EFH area. Thirty of the Project waterbody crossings support fisheries of special concern and eight waterbodies are waters with naturally occurring spawning populations of trout. The Hudson River is the only waterbody within the Project area that contains threatened and endangered species and anadromous fisheries. The Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River would be crossed using the HDD method. We are recommending that in the event of an unsuccessful HDD, Algonquin should file with the Secretary an alternative site-specific plan for the crossing of the waterbody, which includes scaled drawings identifying all areas that would be disturbed by construction. Algonquin would file this plan concurrent with the submission of its application to the USACE and other applicable agencies for a permit to construct using this alternative crossingplan.  At both crossings, Algonquin anticipates using the intersect method to complete the pilot hole and has developed an acceptable BPD Plan that describes how the HDD operations would be monitored and measures that it would implement to minimize the potential for inadvertent returns and releases at these two locations. If an inadvertent release were to occur, the appropriate measures outlined in Algonquin’s BDP Plan would be implemented to minimize any resulting impacts. Algonquin has indicated that additional investigation would be required to verify the existence, type, and depth of any existing bridge foundations where the Interstate 84/Still River HDD alignment would cross Ridgebury Road. Therefore, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a revised plan for the Interstate 84/Still River crossing if additional measures are needed to address any existing bridge foundations associated with the alignment across Ridgebury Road. Based on our assessment of the geotechnical conditions at the proposed HDD crossings, we conclude that with the implementation of our recommendation and the mitigation measures Algonquin proposes to employ, impacts associated with these crossings would be sufficiently avoided or mitigated. Algonquin proposes to construct the remaining waterbody crossings using a dry construction technique (i.e., dam and pump, and/or flume) to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation downstream.  Temporary construction-related impacts associated with the dry crossing method would be limited to short periods of increased turbidity before and after installation of the pipeline. Use of the measures identified in the E&SCP would minimize these potential short-and long-term impacts, including minimization of clearing of streamside vegetation, installation and maintenance of temporary and permanenterosion controls, and minimization of the duration of in-stream construction. The Project has the potential to impact the watersheds that supply water to the New York City metropolitan area including the Croton, the Catskill, and the Delaware Water Supply Systems. The Croton Watershed would be crossed by the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment between MPs 10.0 and 12.3 in the Town of Cortlandt and by the Southeast to MLV-19 Take-up and Relay segment between MPs 0.0 and 0.1 in the Town of Southeast. In addition, the proposed Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment crosses the Catskill Aqueduct near MP 10.3. During the scoping process and in response to the draft EIS, we received several comments about the Project’s impact on the aqueduct. Algonquin would remove its existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline and casing, but not disturb the existing protective concrete slab, pending concurrence from the NYCDEP. Algonquin would build the proposed 42-inch-diameter pipeline above the aqueduct at a 50-foot offset from the existing line. This offset would provide sufficient vertical clearance between the new pipeline and the Catskill Aqueduct. Algonquin would also sequence construction activities to minimize the amount and duration of an open 5-4 right-of-way within the watershed. Algonquin would use a separate construction crew to work in the 2.3mile-long stretch within the watershed and has also committed to an environmental inspection and compliance monitoring program to monitor and enforce compliance with all permit conditions to protect the environment during construction. Algonquin is also working with the NYCDEP to develop a SWPPP that addresses NYCDEP’s requirements forconstructing within a New York City watershed. NYSDEC was particularly concerned about trench dewatering and requested that Algonquin commit to isolating shorter portions of trench to reduce the volume of trench water that would need to be handled at one time. Algonquin has provided typical designs for proposed trench dewatering structures and committed to using an alternative trench dewatering structure that involves a geotextile floor surrounded by a minimum of one row of staked hay bales installed around the perimeter of a filter bag dewatering location.  This would provide additional filtration at specific locations if the EI determines the filter bag dewatering structure alone is not adequate. Algonquin also indicated that the amount of trench dewatering would be minimized by limiting the amount of open trench or by installing soil plugs in the open trench to isolate the trench length in need of dewatering in a specific work area. There are nine streams with shallow bedrock that may require blasting during Project construction. Only two of these streams, Susquetonscut Brook and an Unnamed Tributary to Stony Brook, containfisheriesof specialconcern. Algonquin has committedto performin-streamworkin these streams during the appropriate timing windows for warmwater and coldwater fisheries. Also, in accordance with the FERC Procedures, Algonquin would need to file with the Secretary a schedule identifying when blasting would occur within each waterbody greater than 10 feet wide and within any designated coldwater fishery. Pipeline construction activities affecting surface waters would be conducted in accordance with Algonquin’s E&SCP; SPCC Plan; Unexpected Contamination Encounters Procedures; Rock Removal Plan; BDP Plan; and construction stormwater plans and permits, including the SWPPP being developed in consultation with the NYCDEP to address concerns about crossing New York City watersheds. We conclude that with these measures, along with our additional recommended mitigation measures, impacts on surface waters would be effectively minimized or mitigated, and would be largely temporary in duration.  Algonquin is proposing to use both surface water and municipal water sources for hydrostatic testing and municipal water for HDD operations. Algonquin estimates a need for a total of about 10,082,645 gallons of water to conduct the hydrostatic testing of pipeline segments and aboveground facilities. Of this total, about 9,610,245 gallons is required for testing pipeline segments and 472,400 gallons is requiredfortesting aboveground facilities. Impacts associated with the withdrawal and discharge of water would be effectively minimized by the implementation of the mitigation measures outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP and in accordance with all applicable permits. Algonquin is not proposing to use any chemicals for testing or for drying the pipeline following hydrostatic testing. Accidental spills during construction and operation would be prevented or adequately minimized through implementation of Algonquin’s SPCC Plan. Based on the avoidance and minimization measures developed by Algonquin, we conclude that the Project would not have adverseimpacts on groundwater or surface waterresources due to hydrostatic testing activities. 5.1.4 Wetlands Construction of the Project would temporarily impact 52.5 acres of wetlands, about 23.9 acres in New York and 28.6 in Connecticut. There would be no wetland impacts in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. Of the total wetland acreage, approximately 35.5 acres (68 percent) would involve 5-5 herbaceous and shrub-scrub wetlands, and the remaining 17.0 acres (32 percent) would involve forested wetlands. About 2.4 acres of the forested wetlands would be permanently converted to non-forested wetlands during operation of the pipeline facilities. The remaining 14.6 acres of forested wetlands would eventually revert to preconstruction conditions following construction. No wetlands would be affected at any of the aboveground facility sites or access roads. In areas were wetlands are adjacent to an existing access road, construction crews would avoid the wetland. The Project would not result in any permanent loss of wetlands. In addition, two vernal pools would be located within the temporary construction area forthe Project facilitiesin New York. Secondary or indirect impacts could include reduced riparian buffers, disturbance to adjacent habitats, and incremental fragmentation of forested wetlands. In its comments on the draft EIS, the EPA requested additional detail be provided on the types and amounts of secondary impacts on wetlands. In consultation with the USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP, Algonquin calculated potential secondary impact edge effects on wetlands. A total of about 0.8 acre of secondary impacts were identified in New York. Also, a total of 1.9 acres of secondary PEM impacts and 16.3 acres of secondary PSS/PFO impacts were identified in Connecticut. Overall, secondary or indirect impacts would be minimized to less than significant levels through use of our Procedures and Algonquin’s Project-specific E&SCP. As most of the facilities affecting wetlands would be installed within Algonquin’s existing right-of-way, only incremental fragmentation, for example, would occur within PFO wetlands as a result of expanding the existing right-of-way and no new fragmentation would occur in these areas. Importantly, the Project would move the edge, but would not create new edge. The construction right-of-way width in wetlands would generally be 75 feet wide, except in areas where additional width has been requested by Algonquin. Based on our review, we determined that these requests are justified. In accordance with the FERC Procedures, when wetlands are dry enough to support skids and pipe, the pipeline would be assembled in the wetlands. In these instances, Algonquin proposes to excavate the trench prior to the pipeline assembly. This would involve excavating a trench to remove the existing pipe followed by the removal of the pipe.  The removed pipe would then be transported away from the construction work area. The removal activity would be conducted using a distinct construction crew separate from the pipeline installation crew. As the assembly-line construction process continues forward, the pipeline installation crew would expand the trench wider and deeper (as appropriate) to accommodate the new, larger diameter pipeline and install the replacement pipe at about the same location as the existing pipe using standard construction methods. In all wetland areas regardless of type, the existing pipeline must be removed first using wetland crossing procedures (e.g., topsoil/subsoil segregation, use of mats, etc.). Therefore, we agree that section VI.B.2.d of our Procedures would not apply to the take-up and relay segments of the Project. However, due to the potential for water quality effects on wetlands from erosion and sedimentation, we are recommending that, during construction along the take-up and relay portions of the Project, all erosion control devices and sediment barriers be inspected on a daily basis even when active construction and/or equipment operation is not occurring at a specific wetland location. Construction and operation-related impacts on wetlands and vernal pools would be mitigated by implementing the wetland protection and restoration measures contained in Algonquin’s E&SCP, Invasive Plant Species Control Plan, and any additional conditions of the wetland permits that could be issued by the USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP. This includes Algonquin committing to provide compensatory mitigation for the permanent conversion of 0.8 acre of forested wetlands to a non-forested wetland type in New York and 1.6 acres of forested wetlands to a non-forested wetland type in Connecticut. Algonquin’s implementation of a final, agency-approved Wetland Mitigation Plan would further offset any adverse impacts on wetland functions that would result from the permanent conversion of these wetlands. The USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP would review and incorporate the final plan into project permits. We are recommending that Algonquin identify any additional avoidance or 5-6 Based on the avoidance and minimization measures developed by Algonquin, as well as our recommendations, we conclude that impacts on most wetland resources would be minimal and would be temporary in duration. We further conclude that by Algonquin’s implementation of their final, agency-approved Wetland Mitigation Plan, it would further offset any adverse impacts on wetland functions that would resultfrom the permanent conversion of PFO wetlandsto a non-forested wetland type.  5.1.5 Vegetation Impacts on vegetation from the proposed Project would range from short-term to permanent due to the varied amount of time required to reestablish certain community types, as well as the maintenance of grassy vegetation within the permanent right-of-way and the conversion of aboveground facility locations to non-vegetated areas. Construction of the proposed Project facilities would temporarily disturb about 352.4 acres of vegetation (160.9 acres of open land and 191.5 acres of forested vegetation) and permanently affect 34.7 acres (7.7 acres of open land and 27.0 acres of forested vegetation). The Project would also affect vegetation communities of special concern, including chestnut oak forests. The greatestimpact on vegetation would be on forested areas because ofthe time required for tree regrowth in all temporary workspace back to preconstruction condition. Algonquin would limit the amount of disturbance to chestnut oak forests, which are considered a significant natural community in New York, by utilizing the existing pipeline right-of-way during construction to the extent possible. Construction in forest lands would remove the tree canopy over the width of the construction right-ofway, which would change the structure and local setting of the forest area. The regrowth of trees in the temporary workspaces would take years and possibly decades. Moreover, the forest land on the permanent right-of-way would be permanently impacted by ongoing vegetation maintenance during operations, which would preclude the re-establishment of trees on the right-of-way. However, the Project would not contribute significantly to forest fragmentation. Much of the proposed pipeline routes are located along existing rights-of-way and in areas that are already developed and highly fragmented. As a result, the forested areas that are present are predominantly edge habitats that are unlikely to support forest interior species. Multiple invasive species have been identified throughout the Project area. Algonquin would implement its Invasive Plant Species Control Plan to address the spread of invasive plants within the Project rights-of-way and control invasive populations that might prevent successful revegetation. Algonquin is also working with the USACE and CTDEEP on an approach to managing invasive species in Connecticut. This management would include preconstruction mowing, construction phase mitigation measures, post-construction monitoring, and post-construction management. A final management plan would be filed with the USACE and CTDEEP through the permitting process. Following construction, all disturbed areas would be restored. The impact of the Project on open lands would be short term, as these areas would recover within one to two growing seasons. Construction of the proposed pipeline facilities would have a long-term effect on forested wetland and upland vegetation within the construction right-of-way. Maintenance activities would result in permanent conversion of some areas of existing upland forested vegetation to herbaceous or scrub-shrub vegetation. However, because Algonquin has routed the pipeline facilities to use existing utility rights-of-way and road corridors to the extent possible, impacts on forested vegetation would be minimized. We find that Project-specific minimization and mitigation measures, and mitigation measures described in Algonquin’s E&SCP and Invasive Plant Species Control Plan would be sufficient to offset adverse impacts on 5-7 5.1.6 Wildlife and Aquatic Resources The Project could have both direct and indirect impacts on wildlife species and their habitats. Direct impacts of construction on wildlife include the displacement of wildlife from the right-of-way or work sites into adjacent areas and the potential mortality of some individuals. The cutting, clearing, and/or removal of existing vegetation within the construction work area could also affect wildlife by reducing the amount of available habitat for nesting, cover, and foraging. Indirect effects of construction could include lower reproductive success by disrupting courting, nesting, or breeding of some species, which could also result in a decrease in prey available for predators of these species. Some of these effects would be temporary, lasting only while construction is occurring, or short-term, lasting no more than a few years until the preconstruction habitat and vegetation type would be reestablished. Other impacts would be longer termsuch as the re-establishment of forested habitats, which could take decades. Algonquin proposed several measures to minimize or avoid impacts on wildlife and aquatic resources, including collocating the majority of pipeline facilities within or adjacent to existing rights-of-way to the maximum extent possible, using the HDD crossing method at the Hudson River crossing to avoid direct affects to aquatic habitats and adjacent riparian habitats, and treating all vernal pools as wetlands and protecting them through adherence to the measures outlined in Algonquin’s E&SCP and any permit conditions developed through consultation with the applicable federal and state agencies. Algonquin has routed the pipeline to minimize impacts on sensitive wildlife habitats, such as the Lower Hudson River IBA, Harriman State Park, and Blue Mountain Reservation.  Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSOPRHP and PIPC to address impacts on Harriman State Park. Given that consultation with NYSOPRHP and PIPC is not complete, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a site-specific plan that includes any avoidance and mitigation measures developed for Harriman State Park through consultation with these agencies. In an effort to minimize permanent effects on wildlife and to promote the rapid stabilization and revegetation of the disturbed areas, Algonquin would comply with its E&SCP to minimize disturbance to vegetation and provide for stabilization of affected areas to mitigate direct and indirect effects on wildlife. Revegetation would be completed in accordance with permit requirements and consultation with agency and non-agency stakeholders affected by the Project. In addition, maintenance clearing would not be conducted between April 15 and August 1 to avoid direct and indirect effects on wildlife during the nesting and breeding season (e.g., grassland birds). In wetland areas, trees located within 15 feet of either side of the pipeline that are greater than 15 feet in height may be selectively cut and removed from the right-of-way. However, trees and shrubs that become reestablished beyond 15 feet on either side of the pipeline in wetlands would not be disturbed. Algonquin would also retain a riparian strip within 25 feet of a stream as measured from the mean high water mark. This riparian area would be allowed to permanently revegetate with native woody plant species across the entire right-of-way, with exception of a 10-foot-wide corridor centered on the pipeline that would be maintained in an herbaceous state. In the riparian area, trees and shrubs greater than 15 feet in height may also be selectively cut within 15 feet on eitherside of the pipeline. All waterbodies crossed by the pipeline are classified as warmwater or coldwater fisheries with the exception of the Hudson River and Dickey Brook, which support estuarine fisheries. In-stream pipeline construction across waterbodies could have both direct and indirect effects on aquatic speciesand their habitats, including increased sedimentation and turbidity, alteration or removal of aquatic habitat cover, stream bank erosion, impingement or entrainment of fish and other biota associated with the use of water pumps, downstream scouring, and the potential for fueland chemicalspills. 5-8 Algonquin would minimize the effects of its Project on aquatic resources through the use of dry crossing methods, construction timing windows, and restoration procedures. In accordance with the FERC Procedures, Algonquin would conduct in-water work, except that required to install or remove equipment, outside of the cold water fisheries timing restriction window (June 1 through September 30) unless expressly permitted or further restricted by the appropriate federal or state agency in writing on a site-specific basis. The HDD method would be used to cross the Hudson and Still Rivers. Use of the HDDmethod would avoid any in-stream impacts on these waterbodies.  Algonquin would also implement the erosion and sedimentation control measures described in its E&SCP to contain materials within the construction work areas and minimize impacts on fisheries due to changes in water quality. Once construction is complete, streambeds and banks would be quickly restored to preconstruction conditions to the fullest extent possible. Restoration, bank stabilization, and revegetation efforts, which are defined in the AIM Project E&SCP, would minimize the potential for erosion from the surrounding landscape. Some limited blasting in waterbodies could be required along the AIM Project pipeline segments.  Algonquin would mitigate the effects of blasting on fish species by having the blasting contractor use delays and stemming to dampen the shock wave. The nature of the material that would require blasting and the short duration of blasting activities would help minimize the amount of fine-grained material released to the aquatic habitat, which would also minimize blasting-related effects of fish. Algonquin would file a schedule with FERC identifying when blasting would occur within each waterbody greater than 10 feet wide and within any designated coldwater fishery, and provide the schedule to the applicable agencies.  Algonquin would also implement the measuresidentified in its Rock Removal Plan. Algonquin would ensure that hydrostatic test water appropriations and discharges would not result in a significant entrainment of fish, loss of habitat, or an adverse effect to water quality. Discharge would comply with regulatory permit conditions and be controlled to prevent scour and sedimentation, flooding, or the introduction of foreign or toxic substances into the aquatic system. Algonquin would minimize the potential for spills to impact aquatic resources by implementing the measures contained in its SPCC Plan. Through consultation with NOAA Fisheries, we have determined that the only waterbody crossing where EFH species could potentially occur is the Hudson River. Given the proposed use of the HDD construction method, implementation of Algonquin’s proposed BDP Plan, and the factthat no water would be withdrawn from the Hudson River to support Project construction, we conclude that the Project would have minimal, if any, adverse effects on EFH or managed species. NOAA Fisheries has concurred with this assessment. We have also determined that the Project would have no effect on marine mammals protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act because they are not anticipated to occur within the Project area of the HudsonRiver.  Given the impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures proposed by Algonquin, we conclude that the Project would not result in substantial adverse impacts on wildlife and aquatic resources. 5.1.7 Special Status Species To comply with Section 7 of the ESA, we consulted either directly or indirectly (through Algonquin’s informal consultation) with the FWS, NOAA Fisheries, and state resource agencies regarding the presence of federally listed, proposed for listing, or state-listed species in the Project area. NOAA Fisheries identified two federally listed threated or endangered species (Atlantic and shortnose surgeon) undertheirjurisdiction that are known to occur in the Hudson River within the Project area.  The FWS identified seven federally listed threatened or endangered species (piping plover, roseate tern, Puritan tiger beetle, Indiana bat, bog turtle, northern red-bellied cooter, and small whorled pogonia), as 5-9 Based on these consultations, we determined that construction and operation of the AIM Project would have no effect on the shortnose sturgeon, Atlantic sturgeon, piping plover, roseate tern, Puritan tiger beetle, northern red-bellied cooter, and small whorled pogonia; may affect, but would not likely adversely affect the bog turtle and Indiana bat; and would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of the New England cottontail and the northern long-eared bat.  NOAA Fisheries concurred with our determination for the Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon and consultation is complete. The FWS has concurred with our determination for the piping plover, roseate tern, Puritan tiger beetle, northern red-bellied cooter, small whorled pogonia, bog turtle, Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and the New England cottontail, and consultation is complete for these species as well.  The potential impact of the Project on migratorybirds, including BCC-listed birds, would include the temporary and permanent loss of habitat associated with the removal of existing vegetation during construction. The Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment would run adjacent to and across a section of the Harriman and Sterling Forests IBA in Rockland County, New York. About 15.3 acres of forested land would be affected by this segment. The Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment would involve 72.7 acres of tree clearing where it diverges from Algonquin’s existing rights-of-way in Rockland and Westchester Counties, New York. The Project has been designed to minimize potential impacts on migratory birds and Algonquin would take other measures during Project construction and operation to limit migratory bird impacts. Algonquin would conduct surveys prior to clearing along the 4.9-mile West Roxbury Lateral in Massachusetts. Excluding the proposed West Roxbury Lateral, 94 percent of the proposed pipeline facilities are located within or adjacent existing pipeline corridors, and other utility rights-of-way. Thus, tree-clearing activities would be limited in scope and spread over the entire Project area. We find that these measures would minimize the effects of the Project on birds of conservation concern and other migratory birds. The FWS confirmed that Algonquin’s proposed measures are sufficient for minimizing impacts on migratory birds and consultation for migratorybirds protected under the MBTA is complete. Bald eagles are known to occur in portions of Rockland and Westchester Counties in New York.  The Lower Hudson River IBA located in these counties is an important wintering and breeding area for bald eagles in New York State, and the NYSDEC identified the area in and around the Hudson River as their main area of concern for the Project. Additionally, wintering roost locations occur in and around the proposed crossing location of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay including (but not strictly limited to) Bear Mountain,the Hudson Rivershoreline, Lake Meahagh, and Iona Island. During the surveys conducted in March and April 2014, no bald eagle nests were observed within 0.5 mile of the Hudson River crossing area, and the closest active nest is located more than 6,000 feet south of the proposed crossing location. We have concluded, and the FWS concurs, that the Project would not result in harm to bald eagles. Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSDEC to discuss survey results and state-level concerns for bald eagles, and develop and implement any state-level avoidance and mitigation measures, including timing restrictions, as necessary, to avoid impacts on bald eagles. In addition to the federally listed and proposed species, 29 state-listed threatened, endangered, or special concern species were identified as potentially occurring in the New York and Connecticut sections of the Project area. No state-listed species would be affected in Rhode Island or Massachusetts. According to NYSDEC, timber rattlesnakes (a state-listed threatened species) are known to occur within 5-10 the Project area. Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSDEC to discuss the results of the timber rattlesnake habitat assessment survey and determine the appropriate conservation measures to address the potential occurrence of timber rattlesnakes in the Project area and their habitat adjacent to Algonquin’s right-of-way. We are recommending that Algonquin file all permit requirements and avoidance or mitigation measures developed in consultation with the NYSDEC. Based on the information provided by Algonquin and comments provided to FERC from the CTDEEP on the draft EIS, we conclude that the Project would not affect Connecticut state-listed plants because Algonquin would implement protective measures for species identified near the Project area, including the climbing fern and field paspalum. Based on the same information sources and Algonquin’s proposed conservation measures for several Connecticut state-listed animals, we have concluded that the Project would not affect the American bittern, pied-billed grebe, savannah sparrow, red bat, eastern cougar, and ground beetle; and would not have a significant effect on the American kestrel, eastern box turtle, eastern hognose snake, Jefferson salamander“complex,” and pine barrens tiger beetle. 5.1.8 Land Use, Recreation, Special Interest Areas, andVisual Resources Construction of the Project would affect about 575.6 acres. Approximately 78 percent of this acreage would be utilized for the pipeline facilities.  Of the remaining acreage impacted, 16 percentwould be associated with the aboveground facilities, 5 percent would be for the pipe and contractor ware yards, and less than 1 percent would be for access roads. The primary land use types impacted during construction would be forest/woodland (33 percent), open land (28 percent), industrial/commercial land (26 percent), and residential land (9 percent). Agricultural land and open water would make up the remaining4 percent of land types impacted during construction ofthe proposed Project. During operation, the permanent pipeline right-of-way, aboveground facilities, and permanent access roads would newly encumber about 42.4 acres of land. The primary land use types that would be permanently encumbered would be forest/woodland (64 percent), open land (18 percent), industrial/commercial (7 percent), and agricultural land (7 percent). Open water and residential land would make up the remaining 4 percent of permanent impacts. To facilitate pipeline inspection, operation, and maintenance, the entire permanent right-of-way in upland areas would be maintained in an herbaceous/scrub-shrub vegetated state. This maintained right-of-way would be mowed no more than once every 3 years, but a 10-foot-wide strip centered over the pipeline may be mowed annually to facilitate operational surveys. Algonquin’s proposed construction work areas would be located within 50 feet of 332 residential structures (i.e., houses and apartment buildings) and 94 non-residential structures (i.e., commercial or industrial facilities, sheds, garages). To address impacts on residences within 50 feet of construction work areas, Algonquin developed Residential Construction Plans to inform affected landowners of proposed measures to minimize disruption and to maintain access to the residences during construction. We have reviewed the revised Residential Construction Plans submitted on September 29, 2014 and conclude that the plans are sufficient to minimize, to the extent possible, potential impacts on residences within 10 feet of the construction workspace and are acceptable overall. However, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a revised set of Residential Construction Plans that incorporate and address any comments Algonquin received from affected landowners, prior to construction. Following construction, all residential areas would be restored to preconstruction conditions or as specified in written landowner agreements. Several planned residential and commercial developments were identified within 0.25 mile of AIM Project facilities. However, most would not be crossed by any Project facilities and would not experience any direct effects. Algonquin would continue to coordinate with the developers and 5-11 In general, Project impacts on recreational and special interest areas would be temporary and limited to the period of active construction, which typically lasts only several days to several weeks in any one area. These impacts would be minimized by implementing the measures in Algonquin’s E&SCP, traffic management plans, Fugitive Dust Control Plan, as well as measures to ensure that noise is mitigated. Areas requiring additional site-specific considerations, such as Harriman State Park, Camp Bullowa, and Sylvan Glen Tower Reserve, would be mitigated with appropriate monitoring, use of safety devices, and signage. As mitigation for crossing the Blue Mountain Reservation, Algonquin would pay rentto Westchester County for its ATWS, and would pay compensation fortrees removed along the rightof-way. Algonquin developed site-specific measures to further minimize impacts on the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School in New York; Dodd Stadium in Norwich, Connecticut; the Norfolk Golf Club in Westwood, Massachusetts; Gonzalez Field in Dedham, Massachusetts; and St. Theresa of Avila School in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, all of which would sufficiently minimize impacts on these areas. Algonquin also developed site-specific measures to minimize impacts on St. Patrick’s Church in Verplanck, New York; however, we are recommending that a revised site-specific plan be developed incorporating additional mitigation measures. With implementation of the measures proposed by Algonquin, and our additional recommendation, we conclude that impacts on these recreation and public interest areas would be adequately avoided and minimized. Visual resources along the proposed pipeline routes are a function of geology, climate, and historical processes, and include topographic relief, vegetation, water, wildlife, land use, and human uses and development. The majority of the proposed pipeline facilities (approximately 93 percent) would be installed within or adjacentto existing pipeline, roadway, railway, and/or other utility rights-of-way.  As a result, the visual resources along the majority of the Project have been previously affected by pipeline or other operations. The new aboveground facilities associated with the AIM Project would be the most visible features and would result in long-term impacts on visual resources. Only minor, temporary construction disturbance would occur outside the existing fence line for the modified aboveground facilities. New aboveground facilities for the AIM Project would include three new M&R stations.  With the exception of the West Roxbury M&R Station, the new M&R stations would be constructed adjacent to existing facilities so no new impacts on visual resources would occur. At the West Roxbury M&R Station, Algonquin would maintain an existing wooded buffer to minimize impact on visual resources in the area. However, due to the location of the site in a dense residential area, visual impacts from the construction and operation of the station could occur. We are recommending that Algonquin file a detailed sitespecificlandscaping plan for mitigation of visual impacts at the station priorto construction. A new launcher/receiver and pressure regulating facility would be constructed and operated at MP 12.3 on a parcel within Granite Knolls West. The installation of the launcher/receiver facility on the west side of Stony Street would introduce a new, low profile visual impact in a viewshed otherwise unaffected by aboveground structures. The launcher/receiver facility may be visible to passing motorist and pedestrians on or adjacent to Stony Street but would not have a significant impact on the overall visual character ofthe parks. With adherence to Algonquin’s proposed impact avoidance, minimization, and mitigation plans, and our recommendations, we conclude that overall impacts on land use and visual resources would be adequately minimized. 5-12 5.1.9 Socioeconomics Construction of the AIM Project would not have a significant adverse impact on local populations, housing, employment, or the provision of community services. Secondary socioeconomic effects include increased sales and property tax revenue, job opportunities, income associated with local construction employment, increased vehicle traffic, and impacts on roads.  There would be temporary to short-term increases in traffic levels due to the commuting of the construction workforce to the area of the Project as well as the movement of construction vehicles and delivery of equipment and materials to the construction work area. To address traffic impacts related to road crossings and in-street construction in densely populated areas, Algonquin has prepared separate Traffic Management Plans for the West Roxbury Lateral and pipeline segments in New York. The plans include measures to address motor vehicles, including parking, and considerations for pedestrians, bicycles, and construction workers during construction. We have reviewed these plans and found them acceptable with the exception of a portion of the Traffic Management Plan for the New York pipeline segments. Several road crossings in New York were identified as needing further site-specific details; therefore, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a revised plan that includes the site-specific details for these crossings prior to construction. Impacts on traffic during construction along the West Roxbury Lateral would result in significant adverse impacts at one intersection. However, with the implementation of Algonquin’s Traffic Management Plan for the West Roxbury Lateral, impacts resulting from in-street construction would be minimized to the extent possible and would be reduced to less than significant levels at all other locations along the West Roxbury Lateral. Algonquin’s traffic management plans continue to be refined pursuant to inputfrom the municipalities.  Prior to constructing across town roads, furtherrefinements are expected based on the municipality conditions, which often depend on the time period proposed for construction. Algonquin has indicated that the details of working hours and times and dates of restricted work hours would be developed with local municipalities as part of the road operating permits or other similar approvals. We are recommending that Algonquin develop a detailed construction schedule for each segment of the West Roxbury Lateral that includes the proposed construction timeframes, working hours, and times and dates of any restricted work hours. The detailed construction schedules would be shared with each affected municipality and updated on a biweekly basis and included in Algonquin’s required construction status reports. After construction, Algonquin has committed to repaving the Town of Dedham’s roadways affected by pipeline construction from curb-to-curb. No impacts on traffic would occur during operation of the Project. We received some comments regarding the potential effect of the Project on property values. Algonquin would acquire easements for both the temporary (construction) and permanent rights-of-way where applicable. With the exception of the West Roxbury Lateral, most of the remaining pipeline segments would be installed within Algonquin’s existing right-of-way and would replace existing pipeline. Algonquin would compensate the landowners for any new easements, the temporary loss of land use, and any damages. Several studies have looked at the effect of pipelines on sales and property values. We acknowledge that most were conducted on behalf of the project developers. However, our analysis did notidentify any relevant studiesto refute theirconclusions.  Similarly, regarding the potential impacts on mortgage rates associated with pipeline proximity, we are not aware of any practice by mortgage companies to re-categorize properties nor are we aware of federally insured mortgages being revoked based on proximity to pipelines. In relation to the AIM Project, the existing pipelines have been in place for over 50 years and, according to Algonquin, new residences have been built closer to the existing pipelines since the 1950s without property values or mortgage concerns being raised. We conclude that the AIM Project would not negatively impact property values or influence mortgage rates outside ofthe pipeline rights-of-way or aboveground facility boundaries. 5-13 The primary impacts on the environmental justice communities in both Connecticut and Massachusetts associated with the construction of the AIM Project would be the temporary increases in noise, dust, and traffic from Project construction. These impacts would occur along the entire pipeline route and in areas with a varietyofsocioeconomic backgrounds. As partof the Project, Algonquin would implement a series of measures to minimize such impacts. Conversely, the AIM Project would bring economic benefits to the region via added tax revenues and jobs associated with construction and operation of the pipeline facilities in these and other areas along the right-of-way. Based on our research and analysis, there is no evidence that the Project would result in disproportionately high and adverse health or environmental effects on minority or low-income communities. In its comments on the draft EIS, the EPA concurred with this determination. However, Algonquin has agreed to prepare fact sheets in Spanish to be posted on the Project website and would prepare notices regarding public meetings and, in the future, notices regarding construction information in Spanish for the identified communities. Construction of the Project would result in minor positive impacts due to increases in construction jobs, payroll taxes, purchases made by the workforce, and expenses associated with the acquisition of material goods and equipment. Operation of the Project would have a minor to moderate positive effect on the local governments’ tax revenues due to the increase in property taxes that would be collected. 5.1.10 Cultural Resources Algonquin conducted archival research and walkover surveys of the proposed Project area to identify historic aboveground properties and locations for additional subsurface testing in areas with potential for prehistoric and historic archaeological sites. Algonquin then conducted field surveys for aboveground properties and archaeological sites. Algonquin identified a total of 43 archaeological sites within the Project’s APE. Of these, 28 require additional testing to determine eligibility for listing on the NRHP; 13 are not eligible; 1 is eligible for listing but would be avoided by the Project; and 1 is listed on the NRHP but would also be avoided by the Project. In addition, 388 historic aboveground resources were identified within the APE, the majority of which (359) are not eligible for listing on the NRHP and no further work is recommended.  The Project would not result in any adverse effects on the remaining29 identified historic aboveground resources.   We consulted with nine tribes to provide an opportunity to identify any concerns about properties of traditional religious or cultural significance that may be affected by this undertaking. Eight of the tribes have contacted FERC staff to express an interest in the Project, request additional information, request to be kept apprised of the Project, and/or to accompany the archaeological field crews. In addition, four tribes have been participating in regular conference calls hosted by FERC staff.  Consultations with several other governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, non-federally recognized tribes, and municipal historic preservation commissions in New York and Massachusetts were also conducted to provide them an opportunity to comment on the proposed Project.  Algonquin has prepared procedures to be used in the event any unanticipated historic properties or human remains are encountered during construction. The Procedures Guiding the Discovery of Unanticipated Cultural Resources and Human Remains provide for the notification of interested parties, including Indian tribes, in the event of any discovery. The Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island SHPOs agreed with the procedure’s provisions.  To ensure that our responsibilities under section 106 of the NHPA are met, we are recommending that Algonquin not begin construction until any additional required surveys are completed, remaining survey reports and treatment plans (if necessary) have been reviewed by the appropriate parties, and we provide written notifications to proceed. 5-14 5.1.11 Air Quality and Noise Air quality impacts associated with construction of the Project would include emissions from fossil-fueled construction equipment and fugitive dust. Such air quality impacts would generally be temporary and localized, and are not expected to cause or contribute to a violation of applicable air quality standards. In addition, Algonquin proposes to employ proven construction-related practices to control fugitive dust such as application of water. Algonquin has prepared a Fugitive Dust Control Plan that describes the mitigation measures that would be implemented to control fugitive dust during Project construction, especially in sensitive areas such as road crossings, residences, and nonattainment areas.  We have reviewed the Fugitive Dust Control Plan and find it acceptable.  Modifications to the five compressor stations, modifications to five existing M&R stations, and three new M&R stations would be sources of air emissions during operation of the Project. The modifications at the sixth compressor station would not result in impacts on air quality. Non-combustion related emissions would also occur from the pipeline and at the proposed M&R stations during normal operation. Based on the current design of the M&R stations in New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, state-level permits would not be required forthese activities. Due to modifications on existing equipment and/or removal of existing compressors, the potential emissions of most pollutants at the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations would be reduced fromtheir currentpotentiallevels. Further, based on the identified estimated emissions fromoperation of the proposed Project facilities and review of the modeling analysis for all compressor stations, the Project compressor station modifications would result in continued compliance with the NAAQS, which are protective of human health, including children, the elderly, and sensitive populations. Therefore, with the mitigation measures proposed by Algonquin, we do not anticipate that construction and operation of the proposed Project facilities would have a significant impact on air quality in the Project area or in the region itself.  We received several comments concerning the risk of radon exposure associated with in-home burning of natural gas originating from the Marcellus shale. While the FERC has no regulatory authority to set, monitor, or respond to indoor radon levels, many local, state, and federal entities (e.g., the EPA) establish and enforce radon exposure standards for indoor air. Studies have demonstrated that levels of radon in interstate pipelines carrying gas from the Marcellus shale would be below average indoor and outdoor radon levels. We also received comments concerning the potential buildup of decay products within the pipeline and the risk of releasing these products to the environment either during pipeline maintenance or the removal of existing pipe. It should be noted that the half-lives of the radioactive decay products are relatively short and that, over time, these products would decay to non-radioactive lead. As a result, only a limited amount of radioactive decay material would be in the pipeline at any given time because any material that is within the pipeline for a prolonged period would become non-radioactive. Algonquin would clean the pipeline to be removed prior to it being reused for another purpose. Algonquin also conducts annual inspections and regular cleaning of its operational pipelines. Any liquids or solids removed during these cleanings would be collected and treated as hazardous material that would be disposed of at a licensed facility in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. These measures would minimize the risk that any radioactive solids would be released to the environment. Noise would be generated during construction of the pipeline and aboveground facilities. Noise impacts during construction would be highly localized and attenuate quickly as the distance from the noise source increases. The one exception to this would be certain HDD activities at the Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River crossings. Ambient noise assessments performed at the HDD sites indicate 5-15 that mitigation would be necessary at all proposed HDD entrance locations to reduce the predicted noise generated by the HDD operations below the FERC noise requirement of 55 dBA Ldn at the closest NSAs.  We reviewed Algonquin’s noise assessment and agree that the mitigation measures committed to by Algonquin should result in noise levels in compliance with the FERC’s noise criterion of 55 dBA Ldn at nearby NSAs. However, given the populated nature of the areas surrounding the two proposed HDD crossings, we are recommending that Algonquin file the noise measurements at the nearest NSA to the HDD entry sites obtained at the start of drilling operations, any noise mitigation measures implemented at the start of drilling operations, and any additional mitigation measures implemented at the Hudson River and Interstate 84/Still River HDD sites in its weeklyconstruction status reports.  The modified compressor stations would generate noise on a continuous basis (i.e., 24 hours per day) once operating. Some noise would also be generated by the operation of modified M&R stations, the proposed new M&R Stations, and the proposed new MLRs. Algonquin completed an acoustical analysis to identify the estimated noise impacts at the nearest NSAs from these facilities. We reviewed the compressor station noise analyses and agree that, if properly implemented, these noise control measures would ensure that noise attributable to the modified compressor stations would be either less than 55 dBA Ldn at nearby NSAs, or where the noise currently attributable to the compressor station is greater than 55 dBA Ldn, the noise attributable to the station modifications would cause no perceptible change to existing station noise levels. Algonquin has stated that they are currently evaluating noise control measures to be implemented at the proposed modified and new M&R stations and MLR sites. To ensure that the actual noise levels produced at the aboveground facilities are not significant, we are recommending that Algonquin submit noise surveys and add noise mitigation until noise levels are below our acceptable thresholds. In response to traffic concerns raised by municipalities due to the proposed construction along portions of the West Roxbury Lateral, Algonquin has committed to nighttime construction along Providence Highway and the High Street/East Street intersection along the West Roxbury Lateral to minimize traffic impacts on this roadway. While Providence Highway is a busy commercial street, there are some NSAs in proximity to this area that could be impacted by nighttime construction. However, we note that the Project construction would be similar to other road construction activities, which would also likely occur at night to avoid similar traffic impacts. The Providence Highway/High Street/East Street intersection is within a residential area. Construction noise would be clearly noticeable for residences in these locations during nighttime construction. However, Algonquin has estimated that construction in residential areas would progress about 40 to 200 feet per day, which means construction should last several days or a couple of weeks within any given neighborhood. Therefore, nighttime construction in these residential areas would result in a temporary impact on noiselevels to the nearby NSAs.  Based on the analyses conducted, mitigation measures proposed, and our additional recommendations, we conclude that the Project would not result in significant air or noise impacts on residents and the surrounding communities during construction and operation of the AIM Project.  5.1.12 Reliability and Safety The pipeline and aboveground facilities associated with the AIM Project would be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with or to exceed the PHMSA Minimum Federal Safety Standards in 49 CFR 192. The regulations are intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent natural gas facility accidents and failures. The PHMSA specifies material selection and qualification; minimum design requirements; and protection of the pipeline from internal, external, and atmospheric corrosion. 5-16 We received comments regarding the siting of the pipeline in close proximity to schools and residential areas; the consequences of an explosion of a larger, 42-inch diameter pipeline; and Algonquin’s emergency response procedures. The majority of the Project would replace existing, aged pipeline with new pipeline in the same location and would not increase the risk to the nearby public. For the small portion of the AIM Project where looping or a new pipeline is proposed, we conclude that the Project would represent a slight increase in risk to the nearby public. Based on available data, natural gas transmission pipelines continue to be a safe, reliable means of energy transportation. All applicable Algonquin personnel receive annual training on the Emergency Response Plans, and the area offices conduct emergency response exercises on an annual basis. In the event of an emergency, the Algonquin’s Gas Control Center would send a command signal to the remote control valves to initiate the closure of the valves. The remote control valves are capable of closing quickly to allow fora section ofpipeline to be isolated from the rest of the system.  Algonquin representatives would meet with the emergency services departments of the municipalities and counties along the proposed pipeline facilities on an ongoing basis as part of their liaison programs. Algonquin would provide these departments with emergency contact information and verbal, written, and mapping descriptions of the pipeline systems. This liaison program would identify the appropriate fire, police, and public officials and the responsibilities of each organization that may respond to a gas pipeline emergency, and coordinate mutual assistance in responding to emergencies. We received several scoping comments concerning the safety of the Project and its proximity to the IPEC, a nuclear facility on the east bank of the Hudson River in Westchester County, New York.  Given the distance of the proposed Project from the IPEC generating facilities and the avoidance and mitigation measures that would be implemented by Algonquin, the proposed route should not pose any new safety hazards to the IPEC facility. Based on our consultation with NRC, Entergy is required to assess any new safety impacts on its IPEC facility and provide that analysis to the NRC. Algonquin coordinated with Entergy to provide information about the proposed pipeline and Entergy performed a Safety Evaluation. The Safety Evaluation incorporates additional design and installation enhancements along approximately 3,935 feet of the AIM Project pipeline where it would lie closest to the IPEC facility (i.e., 0.5 mile from IPEC’s security barrier). Algonquin would extend the mitigation measures outlined in the Safety Evaluation to the entire area between MPs 4.6 and 5.3 along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment. The Safety Evaluation concluded that the AIM Project poses no increased risks to the IPEC facility. On August 21, 2014, Entergy filed its Safety Evaluation for the AIM Project with the NRC. The NRC has reviewed the site hazards analysis performed by Entergy and has performed an independent confirmatory analysis of the blast analysis as well. The NRC concluded that a breach and explosion of the proposed 42-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline would not adversely impact the safe operation of the IPEC facility. We also received many comments regarding safety concerns for the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School, which is located adjacent to the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment between MPs 4.9 and 5.0. The Project right-of-way and construction workspace would be about 450 feet from the school facility at its closest point, on property owned by Con Edison, which abuts the school property. The pipeline would lie in a low area separated from the school by a natural berm and a wooded area. Algonquin would utilize standard open-cut construction in this area, and would not employ blasting to remove rock that may be encountered during excavation near the school. The enhanced mitigation measures that Algonquin has committed to with Entergy for construction of approximately 3,935 feet of pipeline near the IPEC facility would include the pipeline right-of-way crossing near the school property, and would serve to further increase the margin of safety for the school. This segment is also within an HCA, which brings it into Algonquin's integrity management program. 5-17 In addition, we received several comments expressing safety concerns about potential interactions between Algonquin’s proposed pipeline facilities and the WPP transmission line. Algonquin has committed to conducting an AC/DC interference study. To ensure that safety concerns about potential interactions are adequately addressed, we are recommending that Algonquin provide its AC/DC interference study associated with the West Point Transmission Project, documentation of all consultations with WPP, as well as any additional mitigation measures that may be required to address safety-related issues or conflicts identified in the study.  Comments were also received asking about, or requesting, advance notifications of planned venting of gas (blowdowns), which are occasionally necessary during pipeline operations. Algonquin provides advance notifications of any planned blowdown to local police and fire departments, along with the non-emergency 911 systems, and to residents in the immediate vicinity of the blowdown event. In Massachusetts, notification of a planned release is also provided to the MassDEP. Notifications for a planned release are typicallymade at least1 week in advance.  The same local entitiesare notified as soon as practicable after any unplanned blowdown. These notifications enable local authorities to answer any questions they may receive from nearby residents who may hear the blowdown. This practice is consistent with other pipeline companies operating in residential areas. Natural gas vented to the atmosphere from pipeline facility blowdowns doesnot pose a health risk. We conclude that Algonquin’s implementation of the above measures and those described in the Entergy Safety Evaluation, would ensure public safety and the integrity of the proposed facilities.  5.1.13 Cumulative Impacts Three types of projects (past, present, and reasonably foreseeable projects) could potentially contribute to a cumulative impact when considered with the proposed AIM Project. These projects include transmission projects;residential, commercial, or industrial developments; transportation projects; water and drainage systems; maintenance dredging; and reconstruction of trails and parkways. Projects and activities included in our cumulative impact analysis are located within the same counties and major watersheds that would be affected by the AIM Project. We received numerous comments during scoping for the Project about cumulative impacts associated with development of natural gas reserves (including hydraulic fracturing) in the Marcellus shale region. Activities associated with Marcellus shale development would occur well over 10 miles from the AIM Project construction area, outside of the sub-basin watersheds crossed by the AIM Project facilities, and outside of the AQCRs for the AIM Project compressor stations. As a result, the local resources that may be affected by Marcellus shale development would not be affected by the Project, and local resources affected by the Project would not be affected by development in the Marcellus shale region.  We also received numerous comments about cumulative impacts of the planned Atlantic Bridge Project. Preliminary details about the Atlantic Bridge Project have been provided by Algonquin but no application has been filed. If this project moves forward as currently planned, it would impact resources in many of the same areas as the AIM Project and the level of impacts would be similar to those of the AIM Project. The AIM Project would be constructed in 2015 and 2016, and the disturbed areas would be restored prior to any start of the Atlantic Bridge Project, which at its earliest would be constructed in 2017. This assumes that Algonquin files an application and that the project is approved by the appropriate federal and state agencies. The other planned Algonquin project is the Access Northeast Project. Spectra Energy’s website indicates that the company hoped to secure expression of interest from potential customers by the end of 2014, but it does not provide any information about the size or location of the proposed facilities. Spectra Energy indicates that, if they receive adequate market support, they 5-18 would begin seeking regulatory approvals in 2015 with a goal of constructing and placing the facilities in service by the end of 2018. The Access Northeast Project would not occur at the same time as the AIM Project, and project detailsare not known at this time. Comments were also received regarding the future plans of the West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry and the potential for closing of the quarry and reclamation of the site. It is our understanding that although preliminary information on the filling of the quarry was provided to the MassDEP in January 2014, no specific plan has been proposed or authorizations requested. The type of soil to be used in the reclamation appears to be under debate. Therefore, any future plans are speculative at this point. In addition, reclamation of the site would likely need to occur over decades. As a result, any overlap with construction of the AIM Project seems unlikely. Further, a filling and closing of the quarry would negate many of the same commentor's concerns regarding quarry blasting impacts on the operation of the AIM Project. Impacts associated with the proposed Project in combination with the other projects in the AIM Project area would be relatively minor overall, and we included recommendations in the EIS to further reduce the environmental impacts associated with the AIM Project, as identified in section 5.2. Algonquin’s proposal to locate the majority of its facilities within or adjacent to existing, previously disturbed rights-of-way (e.g., pipeline utility, road, etc.) would minimize the areas of previously undisturbed vegetation that would be affected, thereby reducing the additional cumulative effects on vegetation communities and wildlife habitats. Similarly, each of the other projects considered in our cumulative impacts analysis would have been designed to avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources. Any adverse impacts on sensitive resources resulting from these projects would be avoided or effectively minimized or mitigated through project design, BMPs, and regulatory agency permitting. Therefore, we conclude that the cumulative impacts associated with the AIM Project would be effectively limited.  The Project area is already served by various natural gas transmission lines so the Project would not extend public service to areas currently unserved by natural gas transmission lines. In addition, economic activity is already taking place. The demand for energy and the proposed Project are a result of, rather than a precursor to, development in this region. Therefore, we do not expect the Project to resultin adverse growth-inducing effects. 5.1.14 Alternatives We evaluated the No Action Alternative, energy alternatives, system alternatives, facility design and siting alternatives, alternative compressor units, route alternatives and variations, and aboveground facility site alternatives. The No Action Alternative would eliminate or delay the short and long-term environmental impacts identified in this EIS, but the objectives of the Project would not be met. Algonquin would be unable to supply an additional 342,000 Dth/d of natural gas to its existing mainline system; increase deliveries to the Project Shippers at existing delivery points in southern New England; or provide three new delivery points for the Project Shippers. We evaluated the use of alternative energy sources and the potential effects of energy conservation, but these measures similarly would not satisfy the objectives of the Project, provide an equivalent supply ofenergy, or meet the demands of the Project Shippers. 5-19 Our analysis of system alternatives included an evaluation of the existing Tennessee and Iroquois systems as well as the planned Connecticut Expansion and Northeast Energy Direct Projects. None of the existing, proposed, or planned natural gas pipelines reach the delivery points required by the Project Shippers in southern New England. To provide service to these delivery points, the existing and planned systems would need to be modified by constructing hundreds of miles of new pipeline, much of which would duplicate the existing Algonquin system. This would result in greater environmental impacts than the Project. For this reasons, none of the existing or planned pipelines provide an environmental advantage over the Project. We evaluated Algonquin’s proposed design for the Project to determine if any alternative designs would be feasible and environmentally preferable to the Project. We determined that alternative designs would result in operational inefficiencies associated with flow characteristics of natural gas within the system, and would shift, but not avoid, environmental impacts from one location to another. For these reasons, we concluded that alternative designs would not be practical or provide an environmental advantage over the Project. We also considered the feasibility of electric-driven compressor units in lieu of gas-fired units at each of the existing compressor station sites. We concluded that use of electric-driven compressor units would result in additional environmental impacts during construction and operation due to the installation of non-jurisdictional facilities, such as electric transmission lines and substations. Although electric-driven units would result in lower operating emissions, Algonquin would be required to comply with its existing air permits for air emissions at each site. Therefore, electric-driven compressors would not be preferable to or provide a significantenvironmental advantage over the proposed Project. Prior to the issuance of the draft EIS, we evaluated route alternatives for the Hudson River crossing of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment and for the West Roxbury Lateral; several minor route variations along different segments of the Project; and site alternatives for M&R stations at the new delivery points in Connecticut and Massachusetts. With the exception of the Catskill Aqueduct Variation on the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment, we determined that none of the route or site alternatives would offer significant environmental advantages over the Project, and we eliminated them from furtherconsideration. Following the issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin evaluated several route variations it incorporated into its proposed route and we received comments requesting that we evaluate other alternatives and variations to the proposed route. The final EIS includes a more detailed analysis of these nine route variations including Hudson River HDD Variation, Blue Mountain Reservation Variation, Catskill Aqueduct Variation, Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook State Reservation Alternative, Norfolk Golf Club Variation, MBTA Variation, Gonzalez Field Variation, Mother Brook Variation, and St. Theresa Parish and School Variation. With the exception of the Blue Mountain Reservation and Neponset River State Park and Stony Brook State Reservation alternatives, all alternatives were determined to be advantageous to the proposed route and were incorporated into the Project. Following the issuance of the draft EIS, Algonquin also evaluated 23 minor pipeline shifts, workspace adjustments, and design modifications. The final EIS includes a more detailed review of these proposed changes. Nineteen of these proposed changes were determined to be advantageous and were incorporated into the Project. We also evaluated alternative construction methods for several waterbody and wetland crossings; however, none were found to be feasible or preferable to the proposed construction methods. 5-20 5.2 FERC STAFF’S RECOMMENDED MITIGATION If the Commission authorizes the AIM Project, we recommend that the following measures be includedasspecific conditions intheCommission’s Order. We believe that thesemeasureswould further mitigate the environmentalimpact associated with construction and operation of the proposed Project. 1. Algonquin shall follow the construction procedures and mitigation measures described in its application, supplemental filings (including responses to staff data requests), and as identified in the EIS, unless modified by the Commission’s Order.  Algonquin must: a. request any modification to these procedures, measures, or conditions in a filing with the Secretary; b. justify each modification relative to site-specific conditions; c. explain how that modification provides an equal or greater level of environmental protection than the originalmeasure; and d. receive approval in writing from the Director of OEP before using thatmodification. 2. The Director of OEP has delegated authority to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the protection of all environmental resources during construction and operation of the Project. This authority shall allow: a. the modification ofconditions ofthe Commission’s Order; and b. the design and implementation of any additional measures deemed necessary (including stop-work authority) to ensure continued compliance with the intent of the environmental conditions as well as the avoidance or mitigation of adverse environmental impact resulting from construction and operation ofthe Project. 3. Prior to any construction, Algonquin shall file an affirmative statement with the Secretary, certified by a senior company official, that all company personnel, EIs, and contractor personnel will be informed of the EIs’ authority and have been or will be trained on the implementation of the environmental mitigation measures appropriate to their jobs before becoming involved with construction and restoration activitiesforthe Project. 4. The authorized facility locations shall be as shown in the EIS, as supplemented by filed alignment sheets. As soon as they are available and before the start of construction, Algonquin shall file with the Secretary any revised detailed survey alignment maps/sheets for the Project at a scale not smaller than 1:6,000 with station positions for all facilities approved by the Order. All requests for modifications of environmental conditions of the Order or site-specific clearances must be written and must reference locations designated on these alignment maps/sheets. Algonquin’s exercise of eminent domain authority granted under NGA section 7(h) in any condemnation proceedings related to the Order must be consistent with these authorized facilities and locations. Algonquin’s right of eminent domain granted under NGA section 7(h) does not authorize it to increase the size of its natural gas facilities to accommodate future needs or to acquire a right-of-way for a pipeline to transport a commodity otherthan natural gas. 5. Algonquin shall file with the Secretary detailed alignment maps/sheets and aerial photographs at a scale not smaller than 1:6,000 identifying all route realignments or facility relocations, and staging areas, pipe storage and ware yards, new access roads, and other areas for the Project that 5-21 would be used or disturbed and have not been previously identified in filings with the Secretary.  Approval for each of these areas must be explicitly requested in writing.

was 2 weeks past the close of the comment period (September 29, 2014).  An additional 173 comment letters were received between October 10, 2014 and when this final EIS went to print.  We continued to accept and review these comment letters, but they are not included in this volume because no new substantive issues were raised that weren’t already addressed by previous comment letters and associated responses or in the text of the final EIS.II-xv FEDERAL AGENCIES FA1 – U.S. Senate, Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed FA1-1 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) staff issued a notice and held a public meeting at the Crystal Lake Golf Club in Mapleville, Rhode Island on Tuesday, September 16, 2014 to accept comments on the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Algonquin Incremental Market Project (AIM Project or Project). The Commission also accepts and considers written comments on the draft EIS from any interested stakeholder. The Commission gives equal consideration to written comments and comments received at a public meeting. FA2 – U.S. Department of Interior, Andrew Raddant, Regional Environmental Officer FA2-1 Comment noted. FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA3-1 Section 3.5 of the EIS has been revised to include an evaluation of these modifications. FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA3-2 The FERC's Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures (Procedures) requires that low ground-weight construction equipment and/or construction mats be used in wetland areas where standing water or saturated soils are present to avoid rutting and topsoil/subsoil mixing, and that the top 12 inches of topsoil over the trenchline be segregated and then restored to its original location during backfill activities. Section 4.4.3 of the EIS has been updated to make this more clear. FA3-3 Since the issuance of the draft EIS, a Final Wetland Mitigation Plan, developed in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP), has been submitted by Algonquin. The USACE, the NYSDEC, and the CTDEEP would review and incorporate the Wetland Mitigation Plan into Project permits. Section 4.4.5 of the EIS has been revised accordingly. We are recommending that Algonquin identify any additional avoidance or mitigation measures for the two vernal pools through the permit review process with the applicable agencies, prior to construction. FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA3-4 Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC (Algonquin) is working with the USACE and CTDEEP to develop an approach to managing invasive species in Connecticut. Section 4.5.4 of the EIS has been updated to reflect the most current information available on this approach. FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA3-5 Improper segmentation is usually concerned with projects that have reached the proposal stage, which is not the case here. Algonquin has not filed an application with the Commission for the Atlantic Bridge Project. Rather, Algonquin is still evaluating the potential Atlantic Bridge Project based on interest for additional natural gas supplies in New England and the Canadian Maritime provinces. The Atlantic Bridge Project is still in the development phase and precedent agreements are under consideration. Even so, the AIM Project is an unconnected single action that has independent utility irrespective of any other projects, including the Atlantic Bridge Project. As discussed in section 1.1 of the EIS, Algonquin has executed precedent agreements with 10 shippers who account for the entire AIM Project capacity of 342,000 dekatherms per day (Dth/d). These are firm commitments proposed to meet a discrete market in southern New England beginning in November 2016. Moreover, the cumulative effects discussion in section 4.13 of the EIS has been revised to include the additional preliminary information on the Atlantic Bridge Project that has become available since the draft EIS for the AIM Project was published. In the event that Algonquin files an application for the Atlantic Bridge Project, or another project in the area, the impacts of the AIM Project will be included in the discussion of cumulative impacts in the environmental review for that project, if relevant. FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA3-6 Comment noted. FA3 – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District (cont’d) FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-1 In most instances where additional information was requested prior to the end of the comment period, we were able to make a conclusion on the significance of an impact with the information available at the time the draft EIS was published. The recommendation that additional information be provided for the final EIS was in an effort to reduce the significance of the impact, not to introduce new, previously undisclosed impacts. The information we required Algonquin to provide prior to the end of the comment period was put into the public record at the time it was filed and, therefore, was available for the public to review and comment on before the final EIS was issued (i.e., the final EIS is not the first time the public has access to this information). In no instance would the requested additional information provide a substantial change to the proposed action. Of the 42 recommendations in section 5.2 of the draft EIS, 28 related to measures recommended as conditions to any Order to ensure the effectiveness of Algonquin's mitigation and compliance with FERC's criterion, resulting in the impacts identified. We also continued to accept and review comments on the draft EIS beyond the close of the comment period, which are addressed in this volume. For these reasons, we believe the analysis in the draft EIS and the revised analysis in the final EIS is appropriate. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-2 Section 4.4.3.1 of the EIS states that impacts on PEM and PSS wetlands would be temporary and short term while impacts on PFO wetlands would be longterm. This is consistent with the definitions provided in section 4.0. Section 4.4.5 and appendix M discuss compensatory mitigation and what types of impacts were included. Section 4.4.3.1 of the EIS clearly indicates that 1.5 acres of forested wetland in FA4-3 Connecticut would be permanently converted to non-forested wetland as a result of routine vegetation maintenance during operation of the pipeline. These impacts would be mitigated through proposed construction-period mitigation measures, improved invasive species plan, and compensatory measures required by the Clean Water Act (CWA) section 404 permitting process, and paid for by Algonquin. We consider backfill in wetlands to be a temporary impact as there would be no loss of wetland function with post-construction restoration. FA4-4 The EIS is a summary document intended to disclose the potential impacts of a proposed action. The document incorporates by reference all of the material filed in support of the permits and other regulatory clearances required to construct the facilities, should the Commission issue a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (Certificate) for the Project. As such, the presentation of potential wetland impacts provided in the EIS is sufficient for the public and decision makers to assess the potential impacts of the Project. FA4-5 Section 4.4 of the EIS has been updated to further discuss types of secondary wetland impacts and proposed mitigation. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-6 As a summary document, the EIS adequately presents the potential effects of pipeline construction and operation on wetland communities across the proposed Project. The direct impacts of pipeline construction on wetlands described in the EIS are based on the Project construction footprint within the boundary of each wetland crossed by the proposed pipeline routes. The direct impact of clearing vegetation, excavating the pipeline trench, temporary storage of dredged material within the wetland, backfilling the trench, and other wetland impacts related to construction activities are described in section 4.4.3.1 of the EIS. Additionally, secondary or indirect impacts, such as reduced riparian buffers, disturbance of adjacent habitat, and incremental fragmentation of forested wetlands are also described in section 4.4.3.1. Additional discussion of indirect effects on wetland vegetation and vegetation in adjacent habitats is included in section 4.5. Detailed, site-specific impacts are included in the Project permit applications included in the EIS by reference. FA4-7 Section 4.4.1 of the EIS states that "Algonquin would use existing roads for temporary and permanent access along the Project route and would not impact any wetlands." FA4-8 Section 4.4 of the EIS has been updated to expand upon secondary impacts on vernal pools. Table 4.4.3-2 lists the locations of vernal pools along the pipeline study corridor. Based on information received from Algonquin, the discussion regarding vernal pools in the draft EIS lists the only two vernal pools that would be directly affected by the Project. After surveys were conducted for the Project, it was found that VP9 (in Connecticut) did not support the needed physical and biological characteristics to be defined as a vernal pool. FA4-9 As noted in sections 3.5.4 and 4.3.2.3 of the EIS, Algonquin determined that using the horizontal directional drill (HDD) method would not be feasible at other waterbody crossings when compared to the dry crossing method. The reasons varied from site to site but, in general, included new temporary impacts on nearby residences, direct impacts on residential homes, including noise from drills, and the need to acquire new easement rights for the permanent right-of-way for operation and maintenance of the pipeline. Factors in HDD design include the availability of a straight and relatively low relief laydown area for the pullback pipe section; the availability of large work areas at the HDD entry and exit points; surrounding terrain; land use; and operation concerns. Based on information from Algonquin, our review of Project mapping, and information we obtained during visits to the Project area, we conclude that the use of the HDD method at any additional waterbody crossings would be either technically infeasible, impractical, or would not result in a clear environmental advantage to the proposed dry crossing methods. FA4-10 See the response to comment FA3-4. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-11  See the response to comment FA3-3.  FA4-12 FA4-13  The placement of direct impact mitigation measures (i.e., construction mats) were not included as a secondary impact as they are mitigating more prevalent potential impacts on a wetland. Comment noted.  FA4-14  See the response to comment FA4-1.  FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-15 As noted in the comment, there would be no disproportionate impacts on low income or minority populations as a result of the Project. Therefore, there is no need or requirement for additional measures, beyond those already proposed, to mitigate an impact that is not significant. The extensive outreach efforts conducted by both Algonquin and FERC for the Project are described in sections 1.4 and 4.9.10 of the EIS. Section 1.4 of the EIS has been revised to include the additional outreach conducted since publication of the draft EIS. These outreach efforts included all stakeholders, including Environmental Justice communities, associated with the Project. FA4-16 See the response to comment FA4-15. Section 4.9.10 of the EIS has been updated to include Algonquin's additional commitment to preparing fact sheets in Spanish to be posted on the Project website and preparing notices regarding public meetings and, in the future, notices regarding construction information in Spanish for the identified Environmental Justice communities. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-17 See the responses to comments FA4-15 and FA4-16. FA4-18 Impacts and mitigation from blasting in waterbodies is discussed in section 4.3.2.6 of the EIS and the Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E). As noted in section 4.3.2.6, in-stream work in Susquetonscut Brook and an unnamed tributary to Stony Brook would occur within the appropriate timing windows for warmwater and coldwater fisheries. Algonquin would file a schedule identifying when blasting would occur within each waterbody greater than 10 feet wide and within any designated coldwater fisheries. Mitigation measures listed in the EIS include: restoring stream beds, inspecting the trench for significant bedrock cracks or fissures and filling with bentonite to prevent infiltration of stream flow into the ground, backfilling the trench with sand to protect the pipe and then replacing with appropriate trench spoil, and replacing native stream bed material and restoring original stream bed contours. Algonquin is in continuing consultation with the CTDEEP and NYSDEC to address impact minimization or mitigation measures and to evaluate other potential methods of construction. FA4-19 Comment noted.  As stated in section 4.3.1 of the EIS, Algonquin would contact landowners with water supply wells within 150 feet of the construction workspace and offer to conduct pre-and post-construction monitoring of well yield and water quality. As stated in the Rock Disposal Plan (appendix E to the EIS) water quality testing would consist of turbidity and bacteriological analysis (total coliform).  Specifics on water quality testing would be available to the landowners. If a water supply well were to be damaged as a result of Project construction, Algonquin would provide a temporary water source until the damaged well is restored or replaced or the landowner is compensated for damages.  Replacement water and compensation would be determined on an individual landowner basis. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-20 See the response to comment FA4-19. In addition, Algonquin has developed and provided an Environmental Complaint Resolution Procedure Plan as part of its application. It identifies procedures that Algonquin would take to address landowner calls received during construction and how the procedures would be implemented. Algonquin would provide this procedure to landowners via letter prior to construction. The letter would include a toll free telephone number to contact with questions or concerns and the commitment that a response to the question or concern would be provided no later than 48 hours after receiving the initial call.  In the event the response is not satisfactory, the proposed letter would identifythe FERC’s Dispute Resolution Service Helpline contact information. As discussed in the Rock Disposal Plan (appendix E to the EIS), there are several possible methods to remove rock from within an excavation. Each method is best suited for specific situations due to individual advantages and limitations. Methods in addition to blasting include excavation, hammering, and drilling and are described in more detail in section 5.0 of the Rock Disposal Plan. FA4-21 In response to comments received on the draft EIS, Algonquin has committed to using ultra low sulfur diesel and best available technology on non-road engines where feasible. Section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS has been updated to reflect Algonquin's commitment. FA4-22 Section 4.13.7 of the EIS has been updated to include a qualitative discussion of potential air pollution and climate benefits associated with increased natural gas deliveries to the region. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-23 Comment noted. FERC staff acknowledges that disparate sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions individually contribute to the global climate change issue. However, to keep this global topic in perspective, we provide a comparison with regional GHG emissions that are seemingly large in comparison to other potential criteria pollutants or hazardous air pollutants (HAP). Algonquin provided a summary of practices that would be implemented at modified compressor stations associated with the Project and practices that are currently in place at Algonquin facilities to minimize methane emissions. Algonquin would use highly efficient turbine technology at the modified compressor stations, which would minimize emissions by being appropriately sized and efficient, and would include dry seals to minimize fugitive emissions. Algonquin also has a program in place for minimizing methane emission at all of their facilities, which includes participating in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Natural Gas Star Program to share best practices for reducing methane emissions. Section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS has been updated to discuss mitigation measures for GHG emissions. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-24 The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations require agencies to consider the environmental effects of their proposed actions, including: (1) direct effects, which are caused by the action and occur at the same time and place; and (2) indirect effects, which are caused by the action and are later in time or farther removed in distance, but are still reasonably foreseeable (40 CFR § 1508.8). Agencies are also required to consider the cumulative impacts of proposed actions, which are defined as “the impact on the environment which results from the incremental impact of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions….” (40CFR§1508.7). The fourthprinciple ofCEQ's general principles governing cumulative effects analyses emphasizes that “it is not practical to analyze the cumulative effects of an action on the universe; the list of environmental effects must focus on those that are truly meaningful” (ConsideringCumulative Effects Under the National Environmental Policy Act {CEQ 1997}). Impacts that mayresult from additionalshale gas development are not “reasonably foreseeable” as definedby the CEQ regulations. Nor is such additionaldevelopment, or any correlative potentialimpacts, an “effect” of the project, as contemplated by the CEQ regulations, for purposes of a cumulative impact analysis. The development of the Marcellus shale, which is regulated by the states, continues to drive the need for takeaway interstate pipeline capacity to allow the gas to reach markets. Therefore, companies are planning and building interstate transmission facilities in response to this new source of gas supply. In addition, many production facilities have already been permitted and/or constructed in the region, creating a network through which natural gas may flow along various pathways to local users or the interstate pipeline system, includingAlgonquin’s existingsystem. Algonquin would receive natural gas through its interconnection with other natural gas pipelines. These interconnecting pipeline systems span multiple states with shale formations in the northeast, as well as conventional-gas, plays. Algonquin cannot estimate how much of the project volumes will come from current/existing gas production and how much, if any, will be new production “attributable” to the project. We also note that EPA and states have imposed regulations within the past 2 to 3 years on natural gas production to minimize leaks and methane emissions. Therefore, past studies on production leaks and methane emissions cannot be used to appropriately predict future methane emissions. Predicting methane emissions and associated climate impacts is speculative given the new required minimization efforts. The project does not depend on additional shale gas production that may occur for reasons unrelated to the project and over which the Commission has no control, such as state permitting for additional gas wells. An overall increase in production of shale-gas may occur for a variety of reasons, but the location and subsequent production activity is unknown, and too speculative to assume based on the interconnected interstate natural gas pipeline system. Accordingly, the factors necessary for a meaningful analysis of when, where, and how shale-gas development would occur are unknown at this time. It is simply impractical for the Commission to consider impacts associated with additional shale gas development, in separate geographic areas as the proposed Project, as cumulative or indirect impacts resulting from the Project which must, under CEQ regulations, be meaningfully analyzed by this Commission. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-25 Section 4.12.3 of the EIS has been updated to reflect Algonquin's agreed upon additional design and installation enhancements, the results of Entergy's site hazards analysis for the AIM Project, as well as the results of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission’s (NRC) independent review and conclusion on Entergy's evaluation. Algonquin has agreed to additional design and installation enhancements along approximately 3,935 feet of the AIM Project pipeline where it would lie closest to the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) facility. These measures include: using internally coated pipe that exceeds the most stringent Class 4 requirements set by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT); installing two parallel sets of fiber-reinforced concrete slabs (3 feet wide by 8 feet long by 6 inch thick) over the pipeline that would act as a physical barrier over the buried pipe; installing yellow warning tape above and below the concrete slabs; burying the pipeline to a minimum depth of 4 feet from the top of the pipeline (and an additional foot deeper when crossing Broadway Street); and providing thicker internal and external corrosion protection, including an abrasive resistant overlay and internal coating of the pipeline. Entergy concluded that the proposed AIM Project poses no increased risks to IPEC and there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety. Accordingly, as documented in its 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50.59 analysis, Entergy has concluded that the change in the design basis external hazards analysis associated with the proposed AIM Project does not require prior NRC approval. However, the NRC conducted its own independent, confirmatory blast analysis that did not allow any credit for the additional mitigation measures and assumed a catastrophic pipeline failure. The review covered everything within the security owner controlled area, which includes everything inside the outer most fenced area of the facility, including the generating facilities as well as other office buildings/structures and the spent fuel storage areas. Based on its review, the NRC came to the same conclusion that Entergy did in its 50.59 submission. FA4 – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (cont’d) FA4-26 Comment noted. FERC directed Algonquin to informally consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) regarding migratory birds during the pre-filing process and prior to issuance of the draft EIS. FERC requested that the FWS consider the draft EIS the draft Biological Assessment for the Project. Section 4.7 of the EIS has been revised to include the conclusions on consultation with the FWS, including regarding migratory birds. FA5 – U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission FA5-1 Comment noted. FA5-2 Comment noted.  The EIS has been updated to reflect these edits. FA5 – U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (cont’d) FA5-3 See the response to comment FA4-25. FA5 – U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (cont’d) FA5-4 The text of section 3.2.2.1 of the EIS has been revised. FA6 – U.S. Congressman Stephen Lynch  FA6-1  There is no proposed compressor pump station in West Roxbury, Massachusetts. The  Project includes the West Roxbury Meter and Regulating (M&R) Station, which would  be located adjacent to an active quarry. An engineering analysis of potential impacts of  blasting in the quarry on the West Roxbury Lateral and West Roxbury M&R Station is  provided in section 4.1.4 of the EIS. We note that the M&R station would be an  industrial facility constructed of materials capable of withstanding nearby blasting. A  third-party geotechnical consultant concluded that ground vibrations from blasting at the  quarry would not be disruptive or damaging to the M&R station or the pipeline.  FA6-2  Section 4.12 of the EIS discusses the properties of natural gas as they are related to  safety concerns.  FA6-3  Section 4.12.1 of the EIS discusses pipeline safety concerns associated with locating the  pipeline in High Consequence Areas (HCA). In addition, Algonquin has provided a  site-specific construction details for Gonzalez Field, which is discussed in section  4.8.5.3 of the EIS.  FA6-4  Comment noted.  FA6-5  We disagree. All notices of FERC sponsored public meetings were mailed to federal,  state, and local government representatives and agencies; elected officials;  environmental and public interest groups; Native American tribes; potential affected  landowners and other interested individuals and groups on the environmental mailing  list; newspapers and libraries in the Project area; and parties to this proceeding, with at  least 2 weeks advance notice. Section 1.4 of the EIS describes the public review and  comment process for the Project and has been revised to reflect the outreach activities  conducted after issuance of the draft EIS. Opportunities for public comment have  included: 15 landowner informational meetings and 10 public open house meetings  held by Algonquin, and 4 scoping and 5 public comment meetings held by FERC staff,  within all four states covering the AIM Project area, beginning in August 2013. Also,  FERC staff held several interagency meetings, conference calls, and site visits for the  Project. Stakeholders could provide their comments in multiple ways, not just by  attendance at meetings. The Commission also accepts and considers written comments  from any interested stakeholder. The Commission gives equal consideration to written  comments and comments received at a public meeting. We received 639 comment  letters from stakeholders during the scoping period for the Project and through the  publication of the draft EIS. Prior to the end of the comment period, the draft EIS was  available for comment for 54 days. We also continued to accept comment letters past  the close of the comment period. Those comments submitted through 2 weeks after the  close of the comment period are also included in this appendix. Comments received  after October 10, 2014 were reviewed for any new substantive issues, but the comments  continued to reiterate issues already raised by other commentors. We received 484  comment letters on the draft EIS.  Therefore, anyone wishing to comment on the Project  who was not able to attend a comment meeting in person could do so. The comments  and our responses are comprehensive in covering the potential environmental issues  associated with the Project. We do not believe that extending the comment period,  notifying additional individuals, or holding additional public meetings would result in  the identification of any new, substantive issues not already covered in the EIS.  FA6-6  Comment noted.  FA6 – U.S. Congressman Stephen Lynch (cont’d) FA7 – U.S. Congresswoman Elizabeth H.

If the field sampling plan is inadequate, the Notice to Proceed would be delayed until a plan meeting the requirements listed in the EIS is submitted. SA1-6 On September 2, 2014, the New York State Department of State (NYSDOS) sent a letter concurring with Algonquin's New York Coastal Management Program consistency certification. On October 21, 2014, Algonquin provided an update to the NYSDOS regarding the revised alignment of the Hudson River Crossing. On October 30, 2014, the NYSDOS confirmed via email that the revised alignment does not change the Project's effect on coastal policies, and that the September 2 concurrence letter remains valid. Section 4.8.4 of the EIS has been revised accordingly. SA1-7 See the response to comment FA4-1. The scope of work at each of the M&R stations included as part of the Project is provided in table 2.1.2-1 of the EIS. The specific design modifications for those stations to be modified or constructed in 2015 have been advanced to the point that Algonquin has determined that no air permits or any other air permit registration documentation would be required. All combustion and non-combustion sources and emissions at the 2015 M&R stations would either be less than permit thresholds or categorically exempt from permitting. For those M&R stations to be modified for construction in 2016, Algonquin also does not anticipate any air permit requirement or other authorization. SA1-8 Section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS has been revised to include additional site-specific details for construction near St. Patrick's Church. The workspace associated with the Project would be located partially within two parking lots associated with the church. Church officials have indicated that most parishioners use on-street parking; nonetheless, Project construction would temporarily reduce the area available for off-street parking near the church. In addition to weekend masses, the church conducts weddings, baptisms, funerals, and holiday services throughout the week, as well as holding 9:00 a.m. masses each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Algonquin has agreed to avoid construction activities during weekend services, thereby reducing some impacts on church activities during construction. However, during weekday functions the church would experience temporary impacts from construction noise, dust, and traffic, similar to those impacts experienced by other landowners and businesses in the Project area. We are recommending that Algonquin revise its site-specific construction plan for St. Patrick's Church to avoid construction activities during the scheduled morning weekday masses as well as to include other measures to reduce impacts on the church. We conclude that the measures Algonquin proposes to implement and our additional recommended measures are sufficient to minimize impacts on St. Patrick's Church to less than significant levels. See also the response to comment FA4-1. SA1 – New York Assemblyman Thomas J. Abinanti (cont’d) The Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School would be located adjacent to the SA1-9 Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay segment of the AIM Project between MPs 4.9 and 5.0. The Project right-of-way and construction workspace would be about 450 feet from the school facility at its closest point on property owned by Con Edison, which abuts the school property. Section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS has been revised to include additional site-specific details for construction near the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. Algonquin has committed to enhanced mitigation measures for construction and operation near the IPEC; these measures would also extend to the segment of pipeline near Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. Algonquin has agreed to avoid rock blasting in the vicinity of the school, and would also attempt to complete construction of this segment during the summer months when school is not in session. However, due to Indiana and northern long-eared bat tree clearing timing restrictions, construction may be delayed until the fall. Even so, the intervening wooded land and natural berm between the construction workspace and the school would provide a buffer to visual, noise, and dust impacts associated with construction activities. We conclude that impacts on Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School would be sufficiently minimized.

We believe the analysis in the draft EIS and the revised analysis in the final EIS are appropriate and does not warrant the need for a supplemental draft EIS. SA2 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef SA2-1 See the response to comment FA4-25. SA2-2 Through the AIM Project, Algonquin proposes to provide 342,000 Dth/d of natural gas to 10 project shippers as specified in section 1.1 of the EIS. That is the scope of the Project analyzed in this proceeding. See also the response to comment FA3-5. SA2 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef (cont’d) SA2-3  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA4-25, SA4-9, SA4-10, SA4-15, and  LA4-6.  SA2-4  See the response to comment SA2-2.  SA2 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef (cont’d) SA2-5 Since the AIM Project is an expansion project, Algonquin designed the necessary facilities to be able to flow both the current and incremental capacities. The Commission does not speculate on potential projects and evaluates each project as filed. The Commission, therefore, is only examining in this docket the proposed facilities to create the contracted incremental capacity. Algonquin has not filed an application with the Commission for either a potential Atlantic Bridge or Access Northeast Projects. Rather, it appears that Algonquin is still evaluating interest for additional natural gas supplies in New England and Canada. Any potential projects are still in the development phase. Moreover, if the Atlantic Bridge, Access Northeast, or any other projects are further developed and filed with the Commission, the Commission will then evaluate each project on its merits. Each project will have discrete contracts, with varying rates, terms of service, and timelines. Further, the cumulative effects discussion in section 4.13 has been revised to include the additional preliminary information on the Atlantic Bridge Project that has become available since the draft EIS for the AIM Project was published. In the event that Algonquin files an application for the Atlantic Bridge Project, or another project in the area, the impacts of the AIM Project will be included in the discussion of cumulative impacts in the environmental review for that project, if relevant.  See also the responses to comments FA3-5 and SA2-2. SA2 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef (cont’d) SA2-6 Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) includes information concerning proposed or existing critical infrastructure (physical or virtual) that: (1) relates to the production, generation, transmission, or distribution of energy; (2) could be useful to a person planning an attack on critical infrastructure; (3) is exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA); and (4) gives strategic information beyond the location of the critical infrastructure. The FERC has implemented guidelines to applicants to ensure that they are properly designating pertinent information as CEII (http://www.ferc.gov/help/filing-guide/file-ceii/ceii-guidelines/guidelines.pdf). The Commission has established procedures for the public to gain access to CEII that would otherwise not be available under the FOIA (http://www.ferc.gov/legal/maj-ord-reg/land-docs/ceii-rule.asp). SA2-7 See the responses to comments FA3-5 and FA4-1. Section 1.2.1 of the EIS describes the purpose and role of the FERC in evaluating applications for authorization to construct and operate interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. SA2-8 Algonquin must comply with the DOT's regulations regarding pipeline design and operation. The “ultimate capacity” that Mr. Vaughey requested is dependent on several factors, including location and maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP). The class, as defined by DOT, limits the pressure of pipelines based on population density. A pipeline company is not required to operate up to, and may operate below, the MAOP of the pipeline. The engineeringdesign for the AIM Project is detailed in Algonquin’s application. Commission staff reviews and analyzes the engineering data and hydraulic flow models to ensure that the project is properlydesigned to meet the Project’s objectives. SA2-9 See the response to comment SA2-8. SA2-10 See the responses to comments FA3-5, FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12. The schedule for this Project has not been accelerated. The Project was in our pre-filing process for 8 months instead of our standard 6 months. The comment period was consistent with other draft EIS comment periods the Commission has issued for natural gas pipeline projects. Further, Commission staff ensured adequate time was allotted to acquire additional information and perform the additional reviews needed to complete the document. This resulted in a revised Notice of Schedule for the Project, with an issuance date of the final EIS 5 weeks later than originally identified. SA2 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef (cont’d) SA2 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef (cont’d) SA3 – New York Assemblyman Steve Otis SA3 – New York Assemblyman Steve Otis (cont’d) SA3-1  See the response to comment FA4-1.  SA3-2  See the response to comment FA6-5.  SA3-3  See the response to comment FA4-1.  SA3-4  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA4-25.  SA3-5  See the response to comment SA1-5.  SA3-6  See the response to comment SA1-6.  SA3-7  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-7.  SA3-8  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-8.  SA3-9  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-9.  SA3-10  See the responses to comment letters LA1, LA2, LA4, LA5, LA8, LA9, LA22,  LA31, and LA32.  SA3-11  See the responses to comments FA3-5 and FA6-5.  SA3-12  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.

As presented in tables 4.11.1-7 and 4.11.1-8 of the EIS, the modifications  to these two compressor stations would, in some cases, result in lower overall  station emissions. Additionally, as presented in air permit application filings  for these two stations summarized in table 4.11.1-14 of the EIS, the operating  emissions from these two stations would not result in any exceedances of  national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), which are designed to protect  public health.  SA4-2  See the response to comment FA4-25. As noted in section 4.1.5.1 of the EIS,  specific-site conditions, including earthquakes, are considered in the design of  the pipeline. The recorded magnitude of earthquakes in the Project area is  relatively low and the ground vibration would not pose a problem for a modern  welded-steel pipeline.  SA4-3  Planned venting of gas (blowdowns) are typically done in connection with  scheduled maintenance activity at a compressor station. Unplanned  blowdowns, which seldom occur, may be automatically triggered by the  pipeline system controls when an abnormal event is detected, which is a  necessary safety feature of the system. Algonquin does provide advance  notifications of planned blowdowns to local police and other emergency  responders. The same local entities are notified after the fact of unplanned  blowdowns. These notifications enable local authorities to answer any  questions they may receive from nearby residents who may hear the  blowdowns. This practice is consistent with other pipeline companies operating  in residential areas. Operation of the pipeline and compression facilities,  including blowdowns, must be performed in accordance with DOT regulations.  As identified in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, DOT's regulations require, and  Algonquin currently has in place, an Emergency Plan, which includes  notification and emergency response procedures.  SA4-4  Radon's properties, potential concentration in natural gas, and health risks are  discussed in section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS. The text of this section has been  revised to acknowledge the byproducts of radium decay.  The half-lives of the  radioactive decay products are relatively short and that, over time, these  products would decay to non-radioactive lead. As a result, only a limited  amount of radioactive decay material would be in the pipeline at any given time  because any material that is within the pipeline for a prolonged period would  become non-radioactive. In addition, Algonquin would clean the pipeline to be  removed prior to its reuse for another other purpose. Algonquin also conducts  annual inspections and regular cleaning of its operational pipelines. Any  liquids or solids removed during these cleanings would be collected and treated  as hazardous material that would be disposed of at a licensed facility in  accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. These measures would  minimize the risk that any radioactive solids would be released to the  environment.  SA4 – New York Assemblyman David Buchwald (cont’d)  SA4-5  It is not uncommon for large-diameter, high-pressure pipelines to be located  in densely populated urban environments and in proximity to high rise/high-density buildings, as well as schools and hospitals. Section 4.12.1  of the EIS discusses how DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration (PHMSA) pipeline safety standards apply to specific  segments of the AIM Project, including a summary of the higher safety  standards applicable to HCAs, such as residential neighborhoods and  schools.  SA4-6  Comment noted. Sections 4.3.2.6 and 4.4.3 of the EIS discuss potential  impacts and mitigation measures for surface waters and wetlands.  SA4-7  The potential effects of the Project on public service infrastructure, public  utilities and related infrastructure, and emergency response are discussed in  sections 4.9.3, 4.9.4, and 4.12.1 of the EIS, respectively.  SA4-8  Comment noted.  SA4-9  Section 4.11.1.1 of the EIS provides the air quality attainment status of all  areas in which Project activities would be completed, and section 4.11.1.2  provides ambient air quality concentrations in the vicinity of the proposed  compressor station modifications obtained from monitoring stations  operated by independent agencies. Algonquin completed air quality  modeling using models developed by the EPA to assess potential future air  quality impacts that we independently reviewed. The impacts of the  emissions from the modified compressor stations, when combined with  existing background emission levels, would not result in any exceedances of  NAAQS, which are designed to protect public health and welfare.  SA4-10  We disagree. As indicated in section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS, the Project would  result in continued compliance with the NAAQS, which were establish by  the EPA to be protective of human health, including children, the elderly,  and sensitive populations. The NAAQS criteria pollutants are implemented  and enforced by the states in which the Project facilities would be  constructed and operated. The EPA has also established standards for HAP  emissions for specific source categories under the Clean Air Act. The  Project's facilities would be designed, constructed, and operated in  compliance with these applicable standards and regulations. In addition,  per the guidance in NYSDEC's Policy DAR-1, Algonquin conducted a  screening analysis and provided the results in its air permit application.  This analysis showed that the model-predicted output concentrations from  the two compressor stations located in New York are below New York's  health effect-based annual and short-term (1 hour) guideline concentrations  that were established for the purpose of protecting public health. We have  also found that the risk of exposure to radon is not significant and section  4.12 of the EIS provides a full analysis of potential impacts on public safety  and the measures to reduce those risks.  SA4 – New York Assemblyman David Buchwald (cont’d)  SA4-11  Section 3.4.6 of the EIS evaluates the use of electric-driven compressors and  concludes that their use would not be preferable to or provide a significant  environmental advantage over Algonquin's proposed gas-fired turbines. Algonquin  has not proposed to install any gas dehydrators as part of the Project. Blowdowns  of natural gas from the pipeline and compressor or meter stations are infrequent,  but are a necessary component in the safe operation and maintenance of any natural  gas pipeline system. See also the response to comment SA4-3.  The proposed modifications to the Stony Point Compressor Station would trigger  Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) review for GHG emissions only.  Algonquin completed a Best Available Control Technology (BACT) analysis, to  demonstrate that the GHG emissions associated with the proposed modifications to  the Stony Point Compressor Station would comply with BACT standards as  defined by the NYSDEC and the EPA. A copy of the BACT analysis is included  in the Air Permit Application prepared for the Stony Point Compressor Station  modifications dated June 2014. For further details regarding Algonquin's current  practices related to minimizing methane emissions, see the response to comment  FA4-23.  SA4-12  See the response to comment FA4-25.  SA4 – New York Assemblyman David Buchwald (cont’d) SA5 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef SA5 – New York Assemblywoman Sandra Galef (cont’d) SA4-13  Comment noted.  SA4-14  We note that the Commission has jurisdiction for federal projects regarding the authorization of siting interstate natural gas facilities under the federal Natural Gas Act (NGA). As stated in section 4.8.5.1, the decision whether to seek legislative parkland alienation would be made by the relevant local park management agencies. However, if the Project is approved by the Commission, the alienation process could not prohibit or unreasonably delay its construction.  SA4-15  The Project is not subject to New York's State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) because it is subject to the NGA and, therefore, is reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Federal and state courts have held that the NGA preempts the environmental review under SEQRA. However, the Project would be subject to all permit conditions and mitigation measures that would be required by NYSDEC for wetlands, stream crossings, and stormwater runoff, by the USACE for wetlands and the crossing of the Hudson River, and by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) for erosion control and stormwater runoff within the New York City watershed.  SA4-16  Section 2.5 of the EIS describes the environmental inspection that would be conducted during construction of the Project, including a Third-party Environmental Compliance Monitoring Program managed by the FERC staff.  SA4-17  Comment noted.  SA5-1  See the response to comment FA4-1.  SA5-2  See the response to comment FA6-5.  SA5-3  See the response to comment FA4-1.  SA5-4  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA4-25.  SA5-5  See the response to comment SA1-5.  SA5-6  See the response to comment SA1-6.  SA5-7  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-7.  SA5-8  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-8.  SA5-9  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-9.  SA5-10  See the responses to comment letters LA1, LA2, LA4, LA5, LA8, LA9, LA22, LA31, and LA32.  SA5-11  See the responses to comments FA3-5 and FA6-5.  SA5-12  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.

Section 5.2 of the EIS has been revised to reflect the fact that the  information requested prior to the end of draft EIS comment period has now been provided  by Algonquin and incorporated into the analysis within the final EIS. We are recommending  that the remaining mitigation measures of the final EIS be attached as conditions to any  authorization issued by the Commission.  SA7-3  See the response to comment SA4-15.  SA7-4  See the response to comment FA4-25. With respect to the high voltage power lines  mentioned, section 4.12.3 of the EIS discusses safety concerns associated with placement of  natural gas pipelines next to transmission lines. In addition, sections 4.8.3.2 and 4.12.3 of  the EIS have been revised to reflect the current status of West Point Partners (WPP) West  Point Energy Transmission Project as it relates to the proposed AIM Project. A properly  designed natural gas pipeline and electric transmission line running parallel to each other,  even at close distances, would not result in any cumulative operational or public safety  hazards. WPP's transmission line, which is a self-contained, buried cable system with  associated automatic monitoring and near-instantaneous protection systems, would avoid any  operational impacts with the proposed pipeline. The WPP line would also employ a metallic  ground sheath so that possible electrical arcing or faults would be self-contained. Algonquin  would also construct the pipeline to avoid interference based on the results of its alternating  current/direct current (AC/DC) interference study, as discussed in section 4.12.3 of the EIS.   SA7-5  Section 4.9.5 of the EIS includes a discussion of measures proposed to minimize traffic  impacts on communities potentially affected by the Project. In response to the FERC staff's  recommendation in the EIS, Algonquin provided a Fugitive Dust Control Plan that identifies  measures that would be implemented to minimize fugitive dust emissions from construction  activities. Section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS has been updated to describe the dust control  measures proposed by Algonquin. Additionally, Algonquin developed site-specific  mitigation measures for construction activities that would occur in proximity to St. Patrick's  Church and the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. Section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS has  been updated to further describe the mitigation measures that would be implemented to  minimize impacts on these two gathering places. See also the responses to comments SA1-8  and SA1-9.  SA7-6  See the responses to comments SA4-10 and SA4-16.  SA7-7  Section 5.2 of the EIS includes several recommendations that enable FERC staff to ensure  compliance with all of its mitigation measures. This includes the recommendations for an  implementation plan prior to construction that identifies how Algonquin would implement  the construction procedures and mitigation measures (recommendation number 6), for  Algonquin to follow its construction procedures and mitigation measures as authorized  (recommendation number 1), and for the Director of Office of Energy Projects o have  delegated authority to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the protection of the  environment during construction and operation, including stop-work authority  (recommendation number 2).

This section of the EIS has also been revised to include reference to Algonquin's agreement to implement the avoidance and minimization measures recommended by the CTDEEP for these species. SA10-10 Comment noted. As stated in section 4.3.2.6 of the EIS, Algonquin would file a schedule identifying when blasting would occur within each waterbody greater than 10 feet wide and within any designated coldwater fishery. This schedule would be made available to applicable agencies. SA10 – Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (cont’d) SA10-11  Comment noted. As stated in the FERC Procedures, "unless expressly permitted or further restricted by the appropriate federal or state agency in writing on a site-specific basis, instream work, except that required to install or remove equipment, must occur during the following time window: coldwater fisheries -June 1 through September 30." Algonquin must comply with in-water construction work windows as identified in the Procedures or as indicated in applicable permits.  SA10-12  See the response to comment FA3-5.  SA10-13  Comment noted. The text in the appropriate sections of the EIS has been revised.  SA10-14  As noted in table 4.3.2-4, the majority of water used for hydrostatic testing would be obtained from a municipal water source; however, a portion would be obtained from Old Verplanck Quarry Lake. The text in section 4.6.2.1 on hydrostatic test water has been updated to state "intake hoses from non-municipal water sources would be fitted with intake screens..."  SA10-15  Comment noted. The text in section 3.2.2 of the EIS has been revised.  SA10 – Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (cont’d) SA11 – New York State Department of Environmental Conservation SA11-1 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12. SA11 – New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (cont’d) SA11-2  See the response to comment FA4-1.  SA11-3  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12.  SA11-4 SA11-5  See the response to comment SA1-7. The draft EIS included a conservative estimate of air emissions associated with equipment at the modified or new M&R stations based on potential equipment. Section 4.11 of the EIS has been updated to reflect the most current design information and permitting requirements. Section 3.5.1.1 of the EIS has been expanded to include additional information about the need to maintain all three existing pipelines across the Hudson River.  SA11 – New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (cont’d) SA11-6 As stated in section 4.3.2.3 of the EIS, "if an HDD in its proposed location proves unsuccessful, Algonquin would be required to identify a new location for the crossing or new methodology, and request approval for the new location or methodology with all applicable agencies."  In the event of an unsuccessful HDD, we are recommending that Algonquin file a site-specific plan for review and approval concurrent with its application to the USACE and other applicable agencies (see section 4.3.2.3 of the EIS). SA11-7 As statedin section 4.1.5 of the EIS, “Seismic risk can be quantified by the motions experienced by the ground surface or structures during a given earthquake, expressed in terms of gravity. For reference, peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 10 percent of gravity is generally considered the minimum threshold for damage to older structures or structures not made resistant to earthquakes.” The section then goes on to provide the seismic risk present along the Project pipeline segments as a PGA with a 2 percent incidence per 50 years and a PGA with a 10 percent incidence per 50 years. Site specific conditions, including earthquakes, are considered in the design of the pipeline. See also the response to comment SA4-2. SA11-8 See the response to comment SA1-5. SA11-9 Section 4.3.2.1 of the EIS has been revised to include the latest information on the Catskill Aqueduct crossing. SA11-10 Section 4.3.2.6 of the EIS has been revised to include the additional measures Algonquin has proposed in response to NYSDEC's comments and our recommendation in the draft EIS. SA11-11 See the response to comment FA3-3. SA11-12 This issue is beyond the scope of FERC's NEPA review. The use of eminent domain is discussed in section 4.8.2 of the EIS. SA11 – New York State Department of Environmental SA11-13 Comment noted. Algonquin sent the Indiana Bat survey results, including the proposed Conservation (cont’d) avoidance/minimization measures for the species, to Lisa Masi at the NYSDEC on September 2, 2014 for review and comment. Sections 4.7.1 and 4.7.1.2 of the EIS have been revised to include the results of the Indiana bat surveys and the results of consultations with the FWS. Any additional avoidance or minimization measures required by the NYSDEC would be addressed during the NYSDEC permitting process. SA11-14 Comment noted.  See the response to comment FA4-26. Algonquin consulted with the NYSDEC New York Natural Heritage Program regarding the documented occurrences of state protected species, continues to coordinate with the NYSDEC regarding the proposed facilities with regards to protected species, and has consulted with the FWS with regards to migratory birds. Any additional avoidance or minimization measures required by the NYSDEC would be addressed through consultation with the NYSDEC and during the NYSDEC permitting process for the Project. SA11-15 Comment noted. Algonquin sent the bald eagle survey results to Lisa Masi at the NYSDEC on September 2, 2014 for review and comment. Section 4.7.3 of the EIS has been revised to include the results of consultations with the FWS regarding bald eagles. Any additional avoidance or minimization measures required by the NYSDEC for bald eagles would be addressed during the NYSDEC permitting process. SA11-16 Comment noted. Algonquin sent the timber rattlesnake habitat assessment survey results to Lisa Masi at the NYSDEC on July 28, 2014 for review and comment. Section 4.7.5.1 of the EIS has been revised to present the results of the habitat assessment surveys for the timber rattlesnake. Any necessary permits and additional avoidance or minimization measures required by the NYSDEC for the timber rattlesnake would be addressed through consultation with the NYSDEC and during the NYSDEC permitting process. SA11-17 Section 4.8.1.2 accurately states that, with the use of the HDD method, no construction right-ofway would be required within the Hudson River. Only the nominal 10-foot-wide permanent right-of-way would exist across the river during operation. Algonquin would seek an easement for the use of lands underwater from the New York State Office of General Services (see table 1.3-1 of the EIS). SA11-18 We disagree. The minimum filing requirements for an application with the Commission includes describing the typical mitigation measures for each residence that is within 50 feet of the edge of the construction work area as well as any proposed residence-specific mitigation. We find that the residential site-specific plans for residences within 50 feet (see appendix H of the EIS) are sufficient to ensure that potential impacts on residences are minimized. However, general measures to minimize construction-related impacts would also be implemented in residential areas (not solely residences within 50 feet of the construction right-of-way), including a traffic management plan, fugitive dust control plan, and restoration measures specific to residential property. SA11-19 Table 4.8.3-1 in the EIS provides the most current information available to the FERC regarding these projects. The FERC has determined this information is sufficient for it to complete the final EIS for the AIM Project. SA11-20 See the response to comment SA1-6. SA11-21 Temporary and permanent impacts on each of the identified areas is provided in appendix P to the EIS. See also the responses to comments SA1-8, SA1-9, SA4-14, CO3-8, and CO14-28. SA11 – New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (cont’d) SA11-22  The FERC will continue to consult with the New York State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) regarding compliance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, including review and comment on all remaining cultural resource surveys, evaluation reports, and if necessary, treatment plans.  SA11-23  See the response to comment SA11-4.  SA11-24  See the response to comment SA7-5.  SA11-25  See the response to comments FA3-5.  SA11-26  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA4-15.  SA12 – New York Public Service Commission SA12 – New York Public Service Commission (cont’d) SA12 – New York Public Service Commission (cont’d) SA12 – New York Public Service Commission (cont’d) SA12-1 Comment noted. SA12 – New York Public Service Commission (cont’d) SA12-2 In September 2014, WPP proposed an alternative location for the electric transmission line. The EIS has been updated to reflect the current alignment of the WPP Project in relation to the AIM Project and to address any cumulative or safety impacts. SA12 – New York Public Service Commission (cont’d) SA12 – New York Public Service Commission (cont’d) SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13-1  Subsequent to the draft EIS, Algonquin proposed a route variation and other modifications in the vicinity of Legacy Place Properties. Our evaluation of the route variation and other modifications is included in sections 3.5.2.2 and 3.5.3 of the EIS.  SA13-2  The length of the West Roxbury Lateral was correct at the time the draft EIS was published. Since then, Algonquin has filed minor route changes that have been incorporated into the proposed route. These changes have shortened the West Roxbury Lateral and reduced impacts. The EIS has been revised to reflect these changes.  SA13-3  Comment noted. Several route and workspace changes were filed by Algonquin on September 19 and 29, 2014. This information was posted on the FERC's eLibrary website shortly thereafter. Our analysis of the proposed changes, including maps of the route variations, is included in sections 3.5.2 and 3.5.3 of the EIS.  SA13-4  Comment noted. Section 4.9.5.2 of the EIS has been updated to reflect  Algonquin's continued coordination with local municipalities, stakeholders (i.e.,  Legacy Place Properties and National Amusements), and the Massachusetts  Department of Transportation (MassDOT) as well as our additional  recommendation regarding the timing of construction along the proposed West  Roxbury Lateral (see recommended condition in section 5.2 of the EIS).  SA13-5  The route and design changes proposed by Algonquin in the vicinity of  Gonzalez Field are evaluated in section 3.5.2 of the EIS. PHMSA is the  regulatory authority mandated to develop pipeline safety standards to ensure the  safe transportation of natural gas. The Project would be constructed in  compliance with PHMSA's regulations. Also, see response to comment FA6-3.  SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13-6 See the response to comment SA11-18. SA13-7 Section 4.12 of the EIS identifies that PHMSA is the regulatory authority mandated to develop pipeline safety standards to ensure the safe transportation of natural gas. PHMSA's regulations include setting the maximum allowable operating pressure, the distance of valve spacing based on class location, requirements for inspections of welds, burial depths within streets, and determination of a potential impact radius. The Project would be constructed, operated, and maintained in compliance with PHMSA's regulations. SA13-8 See the response to comment FA6-1. SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13-9  Section 4.13 of the EIS has been revised to address the potential future plans of  the quarry.  SA13-10  Section 4.13 of the EIS has been revised to include additional information on the  status of the quarry. Section 3.6.2.3 includes an analysis of alternatives sites  evaluated for the West Roxbury M&R Station.  SA13-11  Algonquin stated it has discussed the anticipated schedule and logistics  associated with constructing the West Roxbury Lateral and M&R station with  the owners of the quarry and has committed to continuing to consult with the  quarry. Algonquin's geotechnical investigation, which included an analysis of  blasting as well as ground vibrations, air vibrations, hydrogeological  disturbance, and projectiles, was conducted with information from various  sources, including the owners of the quarry. In addition, since the draft EIS was  issued, Algonquin has hosted and/or attended 13 meetings with various  agencies, landowner groups, stakeholders, and/or the public in Massachusetts  (see section 1.4 of the EIS, which has been revised).  SA13-12  We recognize that the new act could impose restrictions on the West Roxbury  Crushed Stone operations. However, the act does not differentiate between  natural gas transmission and distribution lines. As noted by the Massachusetts  Energy Facility Siting Board in its comments, there is already an existing  natural gas distribution pipeline located within the road right-of-way between  the proposed pipeline/M&R station and the quarry, within 500 feet of the  quarry. The AIM Project facilities (pipeline and M&R station) would be  located further than the existing pipeline. Therefore, the new act appears to  have created an issue for the quarry operations regardless of the AIM Project  and the AIM facilities would not be the cause of any new restrictions on  operation of the quarry or increased or changed restrictions on the quarry. The  act also allows for the quarry to seek approval of blasting activities within 500  feet with written approval by the department of public utilities. Section 4.1.4 of  the EIS has been revised to include this information. See also the response to  comment FA6-1.  SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13-13 Although we believe maintaining a wooded buffer around the M&R station would provide a substantive visual screening, we are recommending that Algonquin provide a landscaping plan for additional mitigation of visual impacts at the West Roxbury M&R Station for our review and approval before construction of the station may begin. Sections 4.8.7.2 and 5.2 of the EIS have been revised to include this recommendation (see recommended condition in section 5.2 of the EIS). SA13 – Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board (cont’d) SA13-14  See the response to comment FA6-5.  SA13-15 SA13-16 SA13-17 SA13-18  Councilor Wu submitted a separate letter with her comments, which has been coded as LA14.

We also note that the Commission did not require Sabine Pass to utilize or comply with the selection of turbines with a better thermal efficiency and reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. During the state's air permit review process, Sabine Pass was required to consider the BACT for reducing CO2 emissions. The Sabine Pass facility design already included the selection of turbines with a better thermal efficiency. Enforcement with this mitigation is through the air permitting authority. The environmental assessment for Sabine Pass identified the applicable mitigation technology that was proposed to be implemented. The Stony Point Compressor Station would similarly be subject to PSD air permitting and BACT review by the air permitting authority, including consideration of turbines with a better thermal efficiency. SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14-9 We disagree. The use of "Indian Point Energy Center" or IPEC is consistent with how Entergy, the operator of the facility, has referred to the site in its correspondence with FERC. We have also confirmed with the NRC that use of this terminology is correct and appropriate for the purposes of the analysis in the EIS. SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14-10 Comment noted. This statement has been retained in the final EIS. SA14-11 See the response to comment FA4-25. The hazards analysis most recently conducted was for any new safety hazards associated with the proposed AIM Project pipeline. The existing pipelines have already been reviewed and studied on multiple occasions, including as recently as 2008.

MB8090 and MB8091) dated April 25, 2003, as well as NRC's response to Mr. PaulBlanchdated April 12, 2010 (available online from NRC’s electronic ADAMS database, Accession No. ML101020487). Therefore, the focus on any new potential safety issues associated with the proposed route is appropriate. The alternative northern route was determined to be technically infeasible and not preferable to the proposed southern route. We disagree with requesting Entergy to perform a detailed hazards analysis on an alternate route that has already been dismissed and the proposed route poses no additional risk. SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14-12 Section 4.12.3 of the EIS includes additional discussion about the proximity and risk of the proposed pipeline to the IPEC nuclear facilities. See also the response to comment FA4-25. We did not consider the relocation of all of the existing pipelines an alternative to the proposed pipeline. The relocation of these existing pipelines would be an independent action to the AIM Project and, therefore, is beyond the scope of the EIS. Moreover, any relocation of the existing pipelines would increase the impacts on the Project area. SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14-13 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA4-25. SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14 – New York State Office of the Attorney General (cont’d) SA14-14 Algonquin would sequence construction activities to minimize the amount and duration of an open right-of-way. Algonquin would use a separate construction crew to work in the 2.3-mile-long portion within the watershed. Algonquin has also committed to an environmental inspection program involving a full-time monitor and reporting of construction activities.  Section 4.3.2.1 of the EIS has been updated to include this information. Algonquin would also comply with the permit requirements issued by the NYSDEC and NYCDEP, as applicable.

However, Algonquin has committed, and currently offers, to provide training every 3 years in all of the municipalities where the proposed Project facilities are to be located and, if requested, is available to provide more frequent training or a specific class. In addition, Algonquin would pay ad valorem taxes annually over the life of the Project (see section 4.9.8 of the EIS) that may be used to offset any such expenses.  LA1-5  See the response to comment LA1-4.  LA1-6  See the response to comment SA4-9. Further, each of the compressor stations proposed to be modified as part of the Project have existing air emission permits, as summarized in section 4.11.1.2 of the EIS, which includes monitoring, recordkeeping, and requirements to report information to the NYSDEC to ensure that stations continue to comply with applicable air quality regulations.  LA1 – Philipstown Town Board (cont’d) LA1-7 See the response to comment FA4-23 for additional information regarding BACT and mitigation for methane emissions. As summarized in section 4.11.1.2 of the EIS, the modifications to the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Stations are currently being evaluated by the NYSDEC. The BACT is only required for sources that would exceed the applicable air permitting threshold. In New York, only the modifications to the Stony Point Compressor Station exceed this threshold for GHG, and must consider BACT. The NYSDEC air permit program allows for public hearings at the discretion of the agency. LA1-8 See the response to comment SA4-10. LA1-9 See the response to comment LA1-4. Section 4.12 of the EIS discusses emergency training and response. Company personnel are responsible for the pipeline in the event of an emergency. Local public safety officials (fire, police) would be responsible for protecting the public during an emergency situation and making the determination of the necessary emergency steps to take, notifying or evacuating residents if necessary. Algonquin's Emergency Response Plans provide for training of local emergency responders, and related safety liaison work with local communities. Algonquin currently offers to provide training every 3 years in all of the municipalities where the proposed Project facilities are to be located, and if requested, is available to provide more frequent training or a specific class as needed. We also note that the about 81.5 percent of the pipeline facilities in New York are replacement of existing pipeline and therefore, existing emergency supplies and equipment would continue to be applicable to the new facilities. LA1-10 Algonquin has indicated that they carry insurance commensurate with similarly sized corporations and similar types of assets, to appropriately respond in the event of a pipeline incident. The liability and the extent of liability for the pipeline owner/operator would be determined by the laws of the state in which an event occurs. There is no accident liability cap for the operator of a natural gas pipeline. LA1-11 See the responses to comments SA4-1, SA4-9, SA4-10, and LA1-10. LA1 – Philipstown Town Board (cont’d) LA2 – Town of Cortlandt LA2 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA2 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA3 – Yorktown Councilman Terrence Murphy LA3 – Yorktown Councilman Terrence Murphy (cont’d) LA2-1  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, and SA7-4.  LA2-2  The impacts noted, as well as mitigation measures, are discussed throughout the EIS.  LA2-3  The impacts on St. Patrick's Church are discussed in section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS.  LA2-4  Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the EIS address impacts on forested areas.  LA2-5  The impacts on residential areas, schools, and parks are discussed in section 4.8 and 4.12 of the EIS.  LA2-6  The segment of the AIM pipeline that passes nearest the Buchanan Electrical Substation (approximate milepost (MP) 5.0) lies within the segment that would be subject to the additional design and installation enhancements agreed to by Algonquin as part of Entergy's hazards analysis for the IPEC (see the response to comment FA4-25). These measures would also serve to increase the margin of safety for the Buchanan Substation. Section 4.12.3 of the EIS has been updated to reflect these design and installation enhancements.  LA2-7  The impacts noted, as well as mitigation measures, are discussed throughout the EIS.  LA2-8  Alternatives to facility design and siting are discussed in section 3.4 of the EIS.

The FERC is not aware of any practice by mortgage companies to re-categorize properties, nor are we aware of any federally insured mortgages being revoked, based on proximity to natural gas pipelines. No mortgage concerns have been identified since the 1950s when the existing pipelines were put into service.  LA5 – Town of Yorktown (cont’d) LA5-26 The impacts noted, as well as mitigation measures, are discussed throughout the EIS. LA5 – Town of Yorktown (cont’d) LA6 – Peekskill Councilwoman Kathleen Talbot LA6-1 See the responses to comments LA1-4, LA1-9, and LA1-10. LA7 – Cortlandt Councilman Seth Freach LA7 – Cortlandt Councilman Seth Freach (cont’d) LA7-1  Section 3.5.1 of the EIS, which compares the proposed Hudson River crossing to an alternative crossing location, has been updated to include the St Patrick’s Church and Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. Also see the responses to comments SA1-8, SA1-9, and LA7-2.  LA7-2  While we have calculated the Potential Impact Radius (PIR) for all segments of the proposed pipeline, we do not consider the number of residences within the PIR to be a meaningful criterion for purposes of comparing alternative pipeline routes. As discussed in section 4.12.3 of the EIS, the risk of an incident is low at any given location. In contrast, the number of residences within 50 and 100 feet from the pipeline represent a much more important basis of comparison, in our experience. These nearby residences are very likely to experience some level of disruption/impact during construction, and to a lesser degree operation, of the pipeline. We find it reasonable that these shorter distance criteria based on high-probability impacts should significantly outweigh a PIR-based criterion associated with a low-probability occurrence, and therefore disagree with the comment recommending a PIR-based criterion be used in the alternatives comparison.  LA7-3  See the responses to comments SA1-8, LA7-1, and LA23-19.  LA7-4  See the responses to comments SA1-9 and LA7-1.  LA7-5  See the responses to comments LA7-1 and LA7-2.  LA7-6  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, SA7-4, and CO7-6. We also note that safety impacts that do not exist would not ultimately result in a different cumulative impact because of any other infrastructure. The NRC's hazard analysis for the IPEC nuclear facility assumed a rupture in the pipeline, regardless of the cause (e.g., other cumulative projects or natural causes).  LA7-7  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.  LA8 – Hendrick Hudson School District, Superintendent Joseph Hochreiter LA8-1  Cumulative impacts associated with the proposed Project and other projects in  the vicinity of the Hamlet of Verplanck are evaluated in section 4.13 of the  EIS.  LA8-2  Economic impacts associated with the Project, including public service  infrastructure are discussed in section 4.9.3 of the EIS. We have determined  that, in the event of a pipeline incident during construction, the anticipated  demand for police, fire, and/or medical services would not exceed the  capabilities of the emergency service infrastructure in the Project area. See  also the responses to comments SA4-5, LA1-4, and LA1-9.  LA8 – Hendrick Hudson School District, Superintendent Joseph Hochreiter (cont’d) LA8-3  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, and SA7-4.  LA8-4  See the response to comment LA2-6.  LA8-5  Section 3.5.1 of the EIS evaluates an alternative to the proposed Hudson River in the vicinity of the IPEC nuclear facility that would follow Algonquin’s existing right-of-way instead of the proposed route. We determined, as described more fully in section 3.5.1, that this alternative would not be preferable to the proposed route. We did not identify any other alternatives along the Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment where a deviation from the existing right-of-way would be preferable. In general, and with the exception of the Hudson River crossing area, we conclude that Algonquin’s use of its existing right-of-way and installation of the new pipeline within its existing permanent right-of-way (generally in the same trench as the pipeline to be removed) would reduce impacts on wetlands, waterbodies, residences, and other resources. This is because it would avoid the creation of a new permanent pipeline corridor, impacts on new previously unaffected landowners, and the amount of forest clearing and new wetland impacts. We acknowledge the concerns about safety, but note that the risk of a pipeline incident at any location is low (see section 4.12.2 of the EIS).

Algonquin provided a revised acoustical analysis based on the revised entrance/exit locations, which resulted slightly higher impacts as compared to those presented in the draft EIS. Table 4.11.2-4 of the EIS has been revised to reflect the revised acoustical analysis, which is available for review as part of the FERC docket for the Project. Algonquin has committed to providing mitigation measures as summarized in section 4.11.2.3 of the EIS, which would ensure that noise resulting from the HDD activities would not exceed the 55 decibels on the A-weighted scale (dBA) day-night average sound level (Ldn) and would result in a noise increase of less than 10 decibels (dB) above ambient noise. Additionally, FERC staff have recommended additional measures during construction to ensure that the proposed noise mitigation measures are successful and actions to be taken in the event that noise levels exceed either 55 dBA Ldn or 10 dB above ambient noise. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-9 Our evaluation of route alternatives to the proposed Hudson River crossing is included in section 3.5.1 of the EIS. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-10  As discussed in section 4.3.2.3 of the EIS, there is a high likelihood of success with the proposed HDDs. If the HDDs are not successful, Algonquin would be required to identify a new location for the crossing or new methodology, and request approval for the new location or methodology with all applicable agencies.  LA23-11  Section 3.5.1 has been revised to include additional analysis of the Hudson River Northern Route Alternative.  LA23-12  See the responses to comments SA1-12 and SA12-2. The draft EIS identified the potential cumulative impacts associated with WPP's project along with the proposed Project and other projects in section 4.13 based on the current information available at the time of issuance. The cumulative impacts of these projects in the final EIS has been updated based on the current construction schedules and facility locations.  LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-13 See also the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, SA7-4, and FA4-1. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-14 See the responses to comments FA3-5 and LA23-16. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-15 See the responses to comments FA3-5 and SA2-2. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-16 See the responses to comments FA3-5, FA4-24, and IND193-5. Algonquin has not filed an application with the Commission for the Access Northeast Project. Rather, Algonquin is still evaluating the potential Access Northeast Project based on interest for additional natural gas supplies in New England in response to the New England governors' initiative on new energy infrastructure and in anticipation of a request for proposal from the New England States Committee on Electricity to expand existing natural gas pipeline capacity and meet critical demand for reliable electric power generation. The Access Northeast Project is still in the development phase and information about any planned facilities associated with the project that would inform a cumulative impacts analysis are not available. Spectra's current schedule for the Access Northeast Project would result in an in-service by November 2018, 2 years after the target date for the AIM Project facilities and 1 year after the target date for the Atlantic Bridge Project facilities. The cumulative impacts section of the final EIS has been updated to identify the information available for the Access Northeast Project, based on publically available information on Spectra’s website. LA23-17 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA4-25, SA4-2, and LA2-6. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-18 See the responses to comments FA4-25 and LA2-6. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-19 See the responses to comments FA4-1, SA1-8, SA1-9, and SA4-5. The Project avoids impacting historic properties near St. Patrick's Church and Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. LA23-20 As discussed in section 4.9.1 of the EIS, Algonquin anticipates hiring up to 76 percent of the construction workers for the Project locally, which would offset the strain of additional new people requiring services. While we acknowledge that short-term, temporary impacts on certain public services are possible, we conclude that overall there are ample services available in the area to meet the needs of the AIM Project. See also the responses to comments LA1-4 and LA1-9. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-21 Section 4.9.8 of the EIS has been updated to include additional discussion of the Project's potential impacts on property values. In summary, several studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of pipelines on property values and all have concluded that there is no significant impact on property values located along natural gas pipelines and associated infrastructure. LA23-22 Although new permanent right-of-way would be required in the Town of Cortlandt, an existing wooded buffer would be maintained between existing residential areas and the new permanent easement; therefore, the Project would not impact the natural buffer between and within existing residential neighborhoods in Cortlandt. Regarding Cortlandt's "essential residential character," the cited section of the Cortlandt Master Plan presents a policy of focusing higher residential densities in already built-up areas. The proposed pipeline would not impact the Town's ability to plan residential densities in order to preserve its existing character. The EIS has been updated to include discussion of any conflicts with the residential land uses in Cortlandt's Master Plan. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-23  See the responses to comments LA23-21 and LA23-22.  LA23-24  See the response to comment FA4-8. FERC recognizes that site-specific crossing plans for the two vernal pools in New York are needed and has requested revised site-specific crossing plans that incorporate any additional avoidance or mitigation measures required through the permit review process with applicable agencies prior to issuing a Notice to Proceed for construction.  LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-25 As described in section 4.4.3.2 of the EIS, Algonquin has applied to the NYSDEC and USACE for CWA permits for the Project. As part of the permitting process, Algonquin included site-specific crossing plans for the vernal pools in New York that would be impacted by Project construction. Because the permits are currently under review, we included a recommendation in the EIS that prior to construction Algonquin provide copies of the final site-specific crossing plans and required mitigation for these features for review and approval by the Director of the Office of Energy Projects (OEP). No construction would be permitted in these areas without final approval of the Director of the OEP.  See also the response to comment SA4-15. LA23-26 As shown in in table 4.11.2-6 of the EIS, the existing noise attributable to the Cortland M&R Station and other ambient noise is above the 55 dBA Ldn criterion. However, the modifications proposed would result in a 1 dB increase above the existing ambient levels. This increase would be imperceptible; therefore, this potential impact is considered less than significant. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23-27 As noted in section 4.2.2.6 of the EIS, contamination may be present within surficial soils at locations where a HDD is proposed. Algonquin conducted a review of each of the planned HDD entry/exit locations and found no documented soil contamination. In utilizing the HDD crossing method, the pipeline would be installed at a depth of approximately 160 feet below the Hudson River bed. Utilizing the HDD method avoids disturbance to river-bottom sediments, as all subsurface materials removed along the drill path during the drilling process is removed from the borehole and contained within temporary lined mud pits. Contamination is not expected to be encountered during HDD activities; however, due to the historic presence of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) in the area, we are recommending that all subsurface materials recovered from the Hudson River HDD process be appropriately sampled for PCBs prior to disposal of the material (see recommended condition in section 5.2 of the EIS). If contamination is found it would be handled as outlined in the Unanticipated Contamination Encounter Procedures. LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA23 – Town of Cortlandt (cont’d) LA24 – Dedham Board of Selectmen LA24 – Dedham Board of Selectmen (cont’d) LA23-28  Impacts related to the potential release of drilling fluid are discussed in  section 4.3.2.6 of the EIS. These impacts include effects on fisheries or other  aquatic organisms by causing turbidity in a waterbody and/or temporarily  coating the waterbody bed with a layer of clay. Mitigation measures for  these potential impacts are also listed in this section and are further discussed  in appendix J.  LA23-29  PCBs are addressed in section 4.8.6.2 of the EIS. In the unlikely and  unforeseeable event of an inadvertent release of PCBs to the environment,  response and remediation would be conducted in accordance with all  applicable federal and state regulations.  LA23-30  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12.  LA24-1  Comment noted.  LA24-2  With respect to the purpose and need for the Project, which is discussed in section 1.1 of the EIS, Algonquin included with its application to the FERC copies of precedent agreements with its shippers, including Boston Gas. This allowed us to verify that the proposed facilities are sited to meet the contracted volumes. In most cases, the shipper of the gas is not regulated by the FERC, as is the case with Boston Gas. Further, as identified in Algonquin's Resource Report 1 to its Application, the precedent agreement with Boston Gas was approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in September 2013.  LA24-3  Section 3.4.3 of the EIS has been revised to include additional information on the reasons why Algonquin sited the West Roxbury Lateral and M&R station at the proposed locations. Section 3.5.1.3 of the EIS has been revised to address the MassDOT's policy.  LA25 – Rockland County Legislator Alden Wolfe LA25-1 See the responses to comments FA4-25 and SA4-2. LA25-2 See the responses to comments SA4-5 and LA5-14.

Therefore, specific distances cannot be given at this time. However, Algonquin would be required to implement the measures in its Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (E&SCP), which incorporates measures from FERC's Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan (Plan) and Procedures, to ensure that erosion control measures are installed and properly maintained until the rightof-way is effectively restored. Inspections would be conducted of these measures to ensure their effectiveness. See also the response to comment SA14-14.  LA26-7  The EIS has been revised to reflect that Algonquin no longer proposes use of the pipe and contractor ware yard at the Granite Knolls West Park in the Town of Yorktown.  LA26 – New York City Department of Environmental Protection (cont’d) LA26-8  See the response to comment SA14-1.  LA26-9  See the response to comment SA14-1.  LA26-10  Details on the size on the potential dewatering structures are provided in Algonquin's Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (E&SCP). Workspaces needed to establish the structures are shown on the Project alignment sheets.  LA26-11  As noted in Algonquin's E&SCP, dewatering structures would be located in a well-vegetated and stabilized area, with an attempt to maintain at least a 50foot vegetated buffer from wetlands and waterbodies. If an adequate buffer is not available, sediment barriers or other erosion control measures would be installed.  LA26-12  The Project would comply with the FERC Procedures, which states "unless expressly permitted or further restricted by the appropriate federal or state agency in writing on a site-specific basis, instream work, except that required to install or remove equipment bridges, must occur during the following time windows: coldwater fisheries -June 1 through September 30; and coolwater and warmwater fisheries -June 1 through November 30." In addition, during a dam-and-pump installation, screen pump intakes to minimize entrainment of fish would be used.  LA26-13  The Project would comply with the FERC Procedures, which states "revegetate disturbed riparian areas with native species of conservation grasses, legumes, and woody species similar in density to undisturbed lands.”  LA26-14  Section 4.3.2.5 states that hydrostatic test water would be discharged into dewatering structures located in upland areas and within the construction work area in accordance with the E&SCP. Algonquin would comply with the hydrostatic best management practices (BMP) provided to them by the NYSDEC. As shown in table 4.3.2-4, the majority of water used for hydrostatic testing would come from municipal sources (with the exception of Old Verplanck Quarry Lake). Therefore, any potential issues with adequate downstream flow would be avoided.  LA26-15  Comment noted.  Section 4.4.3.1 of the EIS has been updated.  LA26-16  Section 4.7.12 of the draft EIS states that Algonquin consulted with the FWS regarding potential habitat locations and identified six areas of concern in the Project area. Botanical surveys for small whorled pogonia were conducted between July 1 and July 3, 2014, which is a time when the plant is considered easily identifiable. No small whorled pogonia plants were observed during these surveys.  LA26 – New York City Department of Environmental Protection (cont’d) LA26-17 Comment noted. Section 4.5.4.1 of the EIS provides additional information regarding revegetation, invasive species control, and post-construction monitoring. Additional methods of revegetation would include seeding to allow revegetation to preconstruction cover types. In summary, Algonquin would implement the measures in its E&SCP and Invasive Plant Species Control Plan to minimize impacts on vegetation within the construction and permanent rights-of-way to improve revegetation success. LA26-18 The coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fisheries terms referenced in section 4.6.2.1 of the EIS are general fisheries classifications described in the FERC’s Procedures anddo not have specific defined temperature ranges. FERC defers to the state water quality or fisheries departments for state-specific fisheries classifications, which are discussed in section 4.6.2.1 of the EIS. LA26-19 Comment noted. LA26-20 Comment noted. LA26-21 Sections 4.5.2 and 4.7.1 of the EIS have been revised for consistency. Surveys for the small whorled pogonia were conducted in six areas of concern during July 1 to 3, 2014 and that the results of these surveys have been submitted to the FWS and NYSDEC documenting that no small whorled pogonia plants were observed. Survey reports for all federally listed and state-listed species were sent to the appropriate federal and state agencies for review and are not included as an appendix in the EIS due to the sensitive nature of protected species occurrence information. LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen (cont’d) LA27-1  Section 3.4.3 of the EIS has been revised to include additional information on the location of the West Roxbury Lateral and associated M&R station. Route variations and alternatives considered along the West Roxbury Lateral are described in sections 3.5.1.3 and 3.5.2.2. Additional modifications evaluated are described in section 3.5.3. M&R station alternatives are discussed in section 3.6.2.3.  LA27-2  Comment noted.  LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen (cont’d) LA27-3 See the response to comment LA24-3. LA27-4 See the responses to comments LA24-3 and LA27-1. LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen (cont’d) LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen (cont’d) LA27-5 Section 4.9.5.2 and appendix G of the EIS have been updated to include additional information on potential traffic-related impacts and measures to be implemented to prevent unnecessary delays to the motoring public during construction of the West Roxbury Lateral. See also the response to comment SA13-4. LA27-6 Section 4.11.2.3 of the EIS has been revised to address noise associated with nighttime construction along the West Roxbury Lateral. LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen (cont’d) LA27-7  Sections 2.3.1.2 and 4.9.5.2 of the EIS have been revised to reflect Algonquin's commitment to repave the town's roadways impacted by the pipeline construction from curb-to-curb.  LA27-8  Section 4.8.5.3 of the EIS has been updated to reflect the current proposed route alignment at Gonzalez Field. The modified route would be located closer to the outer edge of Gonzalez Field and would reduce the land area temporarily affected during construction and permanently affected during operation. Algonquin has committed to construct this segment of the pipeline after the conclusion of the Town of Dedham's soccer program in order to minimize impacts on recreational use of the field during construction. An updated evaluation of the pipeline alternative route across Gonzalez Field is included in section 3.5.2.2 of the EIS.  LA27-9  Section 4.9.5.2 of the EIS has been revised to include a recommendation that Algonquin develop a detailed construction schedule for the West Roxbury Lateral and share it with the town.  LA27 – Town of Dedham, Town Counsel, John Goldrosen (cont’d) LA27-10  In accordance with PHMSA's safety regulations, as part of the construction process, the pipeline would be hydrostatically tested to ensure the pipeline is safe to sustain the operating pressure of the pipeline. PHMSA's Office of Pipeline Safety performs inspections of interstate natural gas pipeline facilities in Massachusetts and PHMSA's regulations establish the requirements of an integrity assessment. As identified in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, PHMSA's integrity management rules for HCAs require an inspection of the pipeline every 7 years. This requirement is not based on pipeline age.  LA27-11  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.  LA27-12  Sections 4.8 and 4.9 of the EIS have been revised to include additional information on mitigation measures related to land use and traffic associated with the Project. In addition, several route variations were incorporated into the proposed route to minimize impacts along with West Roxbury Lateral as described in section 3.5 of the EIS.  LA28 – Boston Mayor, Martin J. Walsh LA28-1 See the responses to comments FA6-1 and FA6-2. LA28-2 Comment noted. LA28-3 See the response to comment FA6-5. LA28 – Boston Mayor, Martin J. Walsh (cont’d) LA28-4 Comment noted. LA29 – Westchester County Legislative Counsel Christopher Crane LA29-1  Algonquin's Rock Removal Plan (see appendix E of EIS) states that pre-blast  surveys would assess the condition of structures, wells, springs, and utilities  within 150 feet of the proposed construction right-of-way. It goes on to state  that determination of the existence and location of site specific structures  (including septic systems) would be part of the survey.  LA29-2  Consistent with FERC guidelines, Algonquin would have its own  Environmental Inspectors (EI) during construction of the Project. In addition  to those EIs, FERC would oversee Third-party Compliance Monitors who  would provide daily reports to the FERC staff on compliance issues in New  York. Additional details on the environmental inspection program is  provided in section 2.5 of the EIS. See also the response to comment SA4 16.  LA29-3  The Project has commitments from customers for an additional  342,000 Dth/d of natural gas. In order to meet the objectives of the Project,  any alternative or combination of alternatives would need to be able to  provide an equivalent amount of energy. The fact that some of the natural  gas delivered by the Project could be used for heat versus electric generation  does not alter this. It is impossible to say exactly what would happen if the  Project is not constructed, but the demands of the Project’s customers,  including the need by some for natural gas to heat homes, would either need  to be met by some other means (other energy sources or conservation), which  would not eliminate their demand but rather defer it until some other means  or combination of means to satisfy it could be found. We have not identified  any alternative or combination of alternatives that would meet the objectives  of the Project as described in section 3.0 of the EIS.  LA29-4  In addition to the recommendation regarding water supply wells, Algonquin  has developed an overall Environmental Complaint Resolution Procedure  Plan that identifies steps Algonquin would take to address landowner calls  received during construction. The plan also identifies the FERC's Dispute  Resolution Service Helpline contact information (see section 4.8.3.1 of the  EIS).  LA29 – Westchester County Legislative Counsel Christopher Crane (cont’d) LA29-5  See the response to comment FA3-5.  LA29-6  The NYPSC does not have jurisdiction for the siting and construction of interstate natural gas pipelines. The NGA gives FERC that exclusive authority. In addition, under the Pipeline Safety Act, the DOT has exclusive authority to establish national standards for the safe construction, operation, and maintenance of, interstate natural gas pipelines and their appurtenant facilities. The order limiting Algonquin's pipeline to 650 psig is from the early 1950s and applied to the existing 26-inch-diamater pipeline. The law is now clear that the NYPSC does not have jurisdiction over these types of facilities.  LA29-7  Table 1.3-1 in the EIS identifies the major federal, state, and local permits, approvals, and consultations for construction and operation of the Project.

Mr. Kohlhase has filed with the Commission numerous comments related to noise and vibration from natural gas transmission pipelines and compressor stations. These are identified in his comment letters as low frequency sound from pipelines, and noise impacts specific to the Brookfield Compressor Station that he identifies as a frequency varying "flutter." Mr. Kohlhase identifies natural gas pipelines as generating a low frequency hum that can induce vibration in enclosed spaces. Through the FERC's dispute resolution service helpline, we are aware that this induced vibration has occurred at a limited number of natural gas facilities in the over 300,000 miles of transmission pipeline in the United States. However, we are unaware of wide-scale cases of this occurring due to low frequency noise from natural gas transmission pipelines. In addition, Mr. Kohlhase claims that a hum is affecting many residents in western Connecticut and identifies numerous purported physiological effects. Again, with hundreds of thousands of residents near natural gas pipelines, we have seen no systemic evidence that natural gas pipelines are inducing these effects in local residents. The flutter that Mr. Kohlhase references is a unique issue to the Brookfield Compressor Station owned by Iroquois Gas Transmission. The Commission’s Office of Energy Projects has worked with Iroquois Gas Transmission on the vibration issues from the Brookfield Compressor Station, and while the issue is ongoing, it is isolated to the Brookfield Compressor Station. The gas for the proposed Project is 100 percent subscribed for local distribution companies and municipalities along the Algonquin system. The additional volumes are not intended for transport along the Iroquois Gas Transmission system. Therefore, the Brookfield Compressor Station would not experience a change in volume, operation, or noise/vibration as a result of this Project. Further, each of the compressor stations proposed to be modified as part of the proposed Project are existing stations and we are unaware of any perceptible vibration at nearby receptors. FERC regulations require that modifications to existing compressor stations cannot result in a perceptible increase in vibration at nearby receptors. Section 4.11.2.3 of the EIS has been updated to include a discussion regarding vibration. LA35 – North Salem Councilwoman Amy Rosmarin LA35-1 See the responses to comments SA4-1, SA4-9, SA4-10, and LA4-6. LA36 – Cortlandt Councilman Seth Freach LA36 – Cortlandt Councilman Seth Freach (cont’d) LA36-1  See the response to comment FA4-1.  LA36-2  See the response to comment FA6-5.  LA36-3  See the response to comment FA4-1.  LA36-4  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA4-25.  LA36-5  See the response to comment SA1-5.  LA36-6  See the response to comment SA1-6.  LA36-7  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-7.  LA36-8  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-8.  LA36-9  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-9.  LA36-10  See the responses to comment letters LA1, LA2, LA4, LA5, LA8, LA9, LA22, LA31, and LA32.  LA36-11  See the responses to comments FA3-5 and FA6-5.  LA36-12  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.

The proposed pipeline on land owned by Vertical Associates would be installed within Algonquin's existing right-of-way, in the same location as the existing-replaced pipeline; no additional restrictions to use or development of the property would occur as a result of the Project. Some additional temporary workspace would be located outside the existing right-of-way on Vertical Associates' property; however, impacts associated with these workspace areas would be temporary. CO3 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion CO3-1  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12.  CO3-2  See the response to comment FA4-1.  CO3-3  See the response to comment FA4-25.  CO3-4  See the response to comment SA1-5.  CO3-5  See the response to comment FA4-8.  CO3-6  Appendix K of the EIS has been updated to identify saturated and non-saturated  wetlands.  CO3 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO3-7 See the response to comment FA3-3. CO3-8  FERC recognizes that a site-specific plan for crossing Harriman State Park (including a tree survey), developed in consultation with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (NYSOPRHP) and Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC) is needed and has requested submittal of the plan prior to the FERC giving approval for a Notice to Proceed for construction of the Project.  CO3-9  See the response to comment SA11-6.  CO3-10  See the response to comment SA11-9.  CO3-11  See the response to comment SA11-10.  CO3-12  See the response to comment SA11-13.  CO3-13  The Northern long-eared bat was surveyed concurrently with the Indiana bat.

Section 4.11.1 of the EIS recognizes methane as a GHG and includes the amount of total GHGs the Project would emit over construction and operation.  See the responses to comments FA4-22 and FA4-23 for additional information regarding the Project's potential benefits to air quality and climate change, and Algonquin's efforts to minimize methane emissions. As noted in section 4.11.1.1 of the EIS, a global warming potential of 25 was used for methane based upon a 100-year time period to allow for a consistent comparison with air quality regulatory requirements. Further, section 4.13.8 of the EIS addresses the impacts of the Project with respect to climate change.  CO7-4  Comment noted.  CO7-5  Renewable energy sources are, and we expect will continue to be, important in helping to diversify the electricity market and decrease the need for traditional fossil fuel energy sources, but we do not find that these energy sources preclude the need for additional natural gas delivery points or long-term supply. Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of the EIS discuss federal and state energy conservation programs and initiatives and the existing and growing use of renewable energies.

As currently planned, the two projects would be separated in  time and since each project would be required to implement temporary and  permanent erosion controls including stabilizing and revegetating disturbed soils  (see sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.1.7 of the EIS) there would be little potential for  cumulative stormwater or pollution impacts.

Section 3.1 of the EIS addresses the no-build alternative.  CO9-10  See the response to comment FA4-23. The potential for spills and leaks of  hazardous materials during construction is addressed in section 4.3 of the EIS.   Algonquin has developed a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure  Plan/Preparedness, Prevention, and Contingency Plan for the Algonquin  Incremental Market Project (SPCC Plan) that identifies preventive measures to  reduce the likelihood of a spill, such as secondary containment for petroleum  products, daily equipment inspections for leaks, and restrictions on the transport  of potentially hazardous materials to the construction work area. The SPCC Plan  also specifics measures to contain and clean up a spill should one occur.  CO9-11  An evaluation of the air and noise-related impacts of the Project relative to state  and local regulations is provided in sections 4.11.1 and 4.11.2, respectively.  CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9-12 The no action alternative is discussed in section 3.1 of the EIS. As described, one of the effects of the no action alternative would be the avoidance of the impacts of the Project, which are fully described in the EIS. Another effect of the no action alternative would be the likely implementation of alternatives to provide the equivalent energy that would be provided by the AIM Project. This conclusion is based on the assumption of a need for additional energy supply, whichis supportedbyAlgonquin's customer’s commercial support of the Project. As described in section 1.1 of the EIS, Algonquin developed the Project in response to customers’ demands. Although the EIS considers whether alternative actions might meet the customers’ demands, the EISdoes not consider or reach a conclusion on whether there is a need for the proposed Project. Section 1502.13 of the CEQ regulations implementing NEPA requires that an EIS “brieflyspecify the underlyingpurpose and need to which the agency is responding in proposing the alternatives including the proposed action.” In other words, the EIS states the purpose of and need for a proposed project in order to define the range of alternative actions that the agency can legitimately consider. The determination of whether there is a “need” for the proposed facilities for the purpose of issuing an authorization under section 7 of the NGA will be made in the subsequent Commission Order granting or denying Algonquin's request for certificate authorization and is based on a balancing of the benefits of the Project against any adverse impacts. The EIS explores various alternatives to determine if they would be preferable to the proposed Project. The analysis includes a description of existing programs and systems and future projects. We conclude that the existing infrastructure associated with these alternatives is currently inadequate and would be unable to provide the demands of Algonquin's customers without significant upgrades. We also concluded that the necessary upgrades for these alternatives would be unlikely to occur within the requested timeframe of Algonquin's customers. While the specific response of the market to the no-action alternative is unknown, new infrastructure would be needed, which we believe would have at least a comparable impact if not more impact than the AIM Project, which would have mainly temporary impacts in previously disturbed areas. See revised section 1.1 of the EIS regarding the Commission’s Certificate Policy Statement. CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9-13 Renewable energy alternatives are collectively the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the projection, with annual growth rates that exceed the growth rate for natural gas-fired generation. The reference case in the U.S. EnergyInformation Administration’s (EIA) 2014 annual report projects that renewable electricity generation will grow by 69 percent from 2012 to 2040, including an increase of more than 140 percent in generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources. According to the EIA, the renewable energy policy landscape is particularly dynamic compared to that of more-established energy sources, as new and existing policies continue to be created and adjusted at the federal, state, and local levels.  Projections for generation with renewables are sensitive to the prices of competing generation sources and other market factors.  In addition, policies that affect competing sources of generation, such as natural gas and coal, can have significant impacts on renewable generation projects (EIA, 2014). For example, the EIA indicates that placing an explicit or implicit value on carbon dioxide emissions would make the cost of operating fossil-fueled capacity higher, improving the relative economics of renewables.  However, renewable energy consumption is not expected to fall muchbelow the EIA’s reference case in large part because state renewable portfolio standards (RPS) effectively establish a floor for generation with renewables.  RPS policies generally require that a minimum share of generation must come from renewable sources, and even with slow load growth or competition from low-cost alternative generation resources, renewable generation must be sufficient to meet the RPS target. CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Peter Galvin (cont’d) CO9-14  See the responses to comments FA4-23, CO9-2 and CO9-8.  CO9-15 CO9-16  Comment noted.

As stated in section 4.11.2.3 of the EIS, acoustical analyses have been completed for the new and proposed modified M&R Station that identifies noise control measures that would ensure that the noise attributable to these stations was less than 55 dBA Ldn. FERC staff typically requires post-construction noise surveys at new and modified M&R stations located in proximity to noise sensitive areas, which is the case for the Guilford, Willimantic, Oakland Heights, and West Roxbury M&R Stations to ensure compliance with the 55 dBA Ldn criterion. The growth-inducing effects of the Project are discussed in section 4.13 of the EIS.  CO12-8  The purpose and need for the Project is described in section 1.1 of the EIS. The demand for the Project, as well as any future projects, is determined by the needs of project shippers to serve their respective markets.  Algonquin has executed precedent agreements with 10 shippers for firm transportation service to deliver new natural gas supplies to the Northeast region.  CO12 – Earthworks, Nadia Steinzor (cont’d) CO12-9 See the response to comment CO12-8. CO12-10 The project facilities are geographically separated and many facilities would be located in different air quality control regions. While all of the compressor station modifications would be part of the same Project, they would not all impact the same air quality control regions. Therefore, it is inappropriate to add all compressor station emissions cumulatively. However, we have updated the cumulative impacts analysis in section 4.13.7 of the EIS to address those compressor stations that are in the same air quality control region. CO12 – Earthworks, Nadia Steinzor (cont’d) CO12-11 Section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS presents potential impacts associated with the operation emissions of the proposed Project, including HAPs. The existing permitted emissions for the compressor stations associated with the Project are not within the scope of this EIS. The proposed modifications to the compressor stations associated with the Project would result in significantly less HAP emissions from the Stony Point Compressor Station, and between 0.7 and 1.8 tons per year (tpy) of additional HAPs at the remaining four compressor stations. These levels are less than major source thresholds for HAPs and do not trigger any additional mitigation. CO12-12 See the response to comment FA3-5. CO12-13 We disagree. An analysis of GHG emissions associated with the Project is presented in section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS, including fugitive emissions, and a cumulative impacts analysis related to climate change is presented in section 4.13.8 of the EIS. In reference to predicting climate change impacts, FERC staff followed guidance provided by the CEQ in their February 18, 2010 memorandum titled Draft NEPA Guidance on Consideration of the Effect of Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which states that "agencies should recognize the scientific limits of their ability to accurately predict climate change effects, especially of a short-term nature, and not devote effort to analyzing wholly speculative effects." On December 18, 2014, the CEQ released a revised draft GHG emission guidance memo. As recommended in this new guidance, to the extent practicable, FERC staff incorporated additional guidance provided by this memo into the GHG analysis completed for the AIM Project. As such, FERC staff has presented the GHG emissions associated with the Project, potential impacts of GHG emissions, and mitigation proposed by Algonquin to minimize GHG emissions associated with the Project.

The risk that single-lane roads may pose with respect to firefighter access is already present, for a fire of any cause. Moreover, the AIM Project would replace an existing older pipeline, and so represents little if any incremental risk.  CO13-6  See the response to comment SA4-5.  CO13-7  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, and SA7-4.  CO13-8  Comment noted. The Project would be built in accordance with the FERC Plan and Procedures and Algonquin's E&SCP, which mitigate for potential impacts on wetlands and waterbodies. Additional mitigation measures for protecting waterbodies and wetlands are described in sections 4.3.2.6 and 4.4.3 of the EIS.  CO13-9  The Project would be built in accordance with the FERC Plan and Procedures,  which includes various requirements to restoring waterbodies and wetlands  impacted by the Project to their original pre-construction state. The Procedures  and Algonquin's E&SCP include mitigation measures for minimizing erosion,  sedimentation, and soil compaction during construction. No gravel would be  placed around the pipe. As indicated in the FERC Plan and Procedures, trench  breakers would be used to prevent the creation of a "conduit" for water to travel  around the pipe.  CO13-10  Section 4.4.3.1 of the EIS describes wetlands impacts and proposed mitigation.   See also the responses to comments SA11-14, SA11-13, and CO3-13.

Section 4.12.1 of the EIS discusses federal safety standards for natural gas pipelines and how these standards are applied in HCAs. Section 4.12.3 of the EIS discusses safety-related concerns and other specific measures that Algonquin has proposed or that we are recommending to further address public safety concerns. We have updated section 4.12.2 of the EIS to also include the state-specific incident data for the past 20 years where the Project would be located. This data shows that over the past 20 years there have been a total of 13 incidents in New York, 0 in Connecticut and Rhode Island, and 2 in Massachusetts; and a total of two incidents in 2013 among all four states. Further, as stated in the EIS, the frequency of significant pipeline incidents in strongly dependent on pipeline age, primarily because pipelines installed pre1971 were not required to use external protective coatings and a cathodic protection system and are more prone to corrosion. About 81.5 percent of the pipeline facilities in New York would replace pipeline that was installed pre1971. Available data show natural gas transmission pipelines to be a safe, reliable means of energy transportation. CO14-26 See the response to comment FA4-25. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-27 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-5. Algonquin has developed an acceptable SPCC Plan that specifies cleanup procedures to minimize the potential for soil contamination from spills or leaks of fuel, lubricants, coolants, or solvents. Algonquin and its contractors would use the SPCC Plan to minimize accidental spills of materials that may contaminate soils, and to ensure that inadvertent spills of fuels, lubricants, or solvents are contained, cleaned up, and disposed of as quickly as possible and in an appropriate manner. Also, the Field Sampling Plan recommended by the FERC staff would be put into the public record at the time it is completed and filed; therefore, it would be available for public review. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-28 Potential impacts on Harriman State Park, Blue Mountain Reservation, Sylvan Glen Park Preserve, Cheesecote Mountain, the Washington-Rochambeau National Historic Trail, and the Village of Buchanan's Village Park are discussed in section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS. There would be no new permanent easement within Harriman State Park, Blue Mountain Reservation, Sylvan Glen Park Preserve, or Cheesecote Mountain; therefore, there would be no permanent impacts on these public lands. Some new permanent easement would be required on lands designated as part of the Washington-Rochambeau National Historic Trail, however, these areas are not on National Park Service-managed lands and are already collocated with modern paved roads, and the Project would not alter their character. Approximately 0.3 acre of new permanent easement would be required within Buchanan's Village Park; this new easement would be located on a portion of the property not used for public recreation, and an existing wooded area would provide a visual buffer between the new easement and the recreational facilities. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-29 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and CO14-8. CO14-30 Appendix K of the EIS has been updated to identify saturated and non-saturated wetlands.

Even given the relatively high  potential for hydraulic fracture in the soft sediments of the Hudson River, the  HDD crossing method would have far fewer impacts on the river and wildlife  than alternative crossing methods (i.e., an open-cut crossing). In addition, given  the existing river current, if a hydraulic fracture were to occur the non-toxic  drilling fluid would be quickly dispersed to a level where, given the river’s  existing turbidity, would likely be unnoticeable.  CO14-37  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA11-6.

Algonquin and FERC have consulted with the FWS for the New England Cottontail. As discussed in section 4.7.1.3 of the EIS, the FWS indicated that the final rule and list status for New England Cottontail would not likely occur until after the AIM Project completed construction and indicated that the federal Candidate species was not an issue for the Project. CO14-45 See the response to comment FA4-1. Section 4.7.1 of the EIS has been revised to clarify that survey reports for all federally listed and state-listed species were sent to the appropriate federal and state agencies for review. Due to the sensitive nature of protected species occurrence information and specific recommendations from the FWS for some species, these survey reports will not be included as an appendix in the EIS for the protection of the species. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-46  Comment noted. Section 4.7.1.2 of the EIS has been revised to explain that  Algonquin retained FWS and NYSDEC approved bog turtle surveyors for the  Hudson Valley, used the accepted FWS protocols for conducting bog turtle  Phase 1 and 2 surveys in New York, and that the surveys were conducted in  close coordination with the FWS.  The FWS specifically requested that  Algonquin file the bog turtle survey results with FERC as confidential to protect  the species potential locations as a protection against threats of illegal collection  and trade. The results of consultations with the FWS are presented in section  4.7 of the EIS.   CO14-47  See the responses to comments CO3-13, CO14-45, and CO14-45.  CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-48 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA4-26, and SA11-14. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-49 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA11-15. CO14-50 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA11-16. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-51 See the response to comment SA1-6. CO14 – Stop the Algonquin Pipeline Expansion (cont’d) CO14-52 See the responses to comments SA4-1, SA4-9, and CO12-11. CO14-53 We disagree with the commentors characterization of emission increases at the Southeast and Stony Point Compressor Stations.

Not only are pipelines a safe, reliable means of energy transportation, but the risk of an incident at any given location is very low. However, table 4.11.1-13 of the EIS presents an estimate of emissions from pipeline operations, which includes fugitive emissions and non-routine emissions, including unintended releases, such as blowdown events. Section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS has been updated to clarify that this table also includes non-routine pipeline emissions.

There are  currently several proposals to export natural gas from the U.S. to neighboring or  overseas countries. However, Algonquin is not constructing the AIM Project  for the purpose of supporting the export of natural gas from the United States.  As discussed in section 1.1 of the EIS, Algonquin is proposing to transport  natural gas to meet the demand for natural gas based on commitments from the  Project shippers, which include local distribution companies and two municipal  utilities. These entities have statutory, regulatory, and/or contractual obligations  to serve natural gas customers within their respective service areas in New  England. Additionally, even if precedent agreements were not in place for the  entire proposed capacity, to be exported, the natural gas would need to be  transported by pipeline across the Canadian border or be liquefied for  transportation in specialized container ships to overseas markets. Such a  proposal would require the FERC's approval under section 3 of the NGA (as  well as many other federal and state approvals) and would be subject to a full  environmental review. The process of liquefying the gas involves specialized  equipment at a specific export facility. Currently, no existing liquefied natural  gas (LNG) export facilities or infrastructure exists on the east coast. In addition,  the timing and need as expressed through the precedent agreements greatly  proceeds the development of any potential nearby LNG export facility as the  facilities take several years to develop, advance through the regulatory process,  and be constructed.  CO15 – Sierra Club Lower Hudson Group, William Meyer (cont’d) CO15-5 See the response to comment FA3-5. CO15-6 See the response to comment CO7-5. CO15-7 An assessment of the health and safety concerns related to the Project is provided in sections 4.11 and 4.12 of the EIS.

Facilities may exceed the thresholds, which prompts further review, emission controls, and permitting requirements by the applicable air permitting authority. The Clean Air Act and air permitting program, allows facilities to use air emission offsets during permitting. In order to achieve improved air quality within a nonattainment area, reductions are required throughout the entire air quality control region. However, the only Project-related PSD or Nonattainment New Source Review (NNSR) permitting threshold exceeded was for the Stony Point Compressor Station and for GHGs only. The Project results in overall decreases in emissions of most pollutants at this compressor station. The Southeast Compressor Station did not exceed the PSD or NNSR permitting threshold for any pollutants and would result in an overall decrease in emissions of several pollutants. We are not aware of any offsets required under NNSR permitting or general conformity for any facilities associated with the Project.  CO16-10  Comment noted.  CO16-11  See response to SA4-3.  CO16 – Hands Across the Border, Suzannah Glidden (cont’d) CO16-12 See the response to comment SA4-4. CO16-13 See the response to comment CO7-5. CO16-14 Comment noted. CO16 – Hands Across the Border, Suzannah Glidden (cont’d) CO16 – Hands Across the Border, Suzannah Glidden (cont’d) CO16 – Hands Across the Border, Suzannah Glidden (cont’d) CO16 – Hands Across the Border, Suzannah Glidden (cont’d) CO16 – Hands Across the Border, Suzannah Glidden (cont’d) CO17 – Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc.

General impacts and mitigation measures for protecting wetlands are described in section 4.4.3 of the EIS.  As noted in section 4.1.5.1  of the EIS, specific site conditions, including earthquakes, are considered in the design of the pipeline. The recorded magnitude of earthquakes in the Project area is relatively low and the ground vibration would not pose a problem for a modern welded-steel pipeline. As such, the Project is not anticipated to have an impact on federally listed species, wildlife, or sensitive resources as a result of seismic activity.  CO17-3  See the responses to comments FA4-15, FA4-16, and LA9-16.  CO17-4  Comment noted. An evaluation of renewable energy alternatives to the proposed Project is provided in section 3.2.2 of the EIS.  CO17-5  The Hudson River would be crossed using the HDD crossing method, which minimizes impacts on fish and wildlife habitat as no in-water would be conducted. All wetlands, even those not subject to regulation by other agencies, are regulated by FERC. Algonquin and FERC consulted with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) regarding Essential Fish Habitat, Essential Fish Habitat Species, anadromous fish, marine mammals, and both the shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon.

Consistent with CEQ and EPA guidance, we make a practical delineation of the spatial and temporal scales, in order to include all potentially significant effects on resources of concern. We consider the extent of the AIM Project's impact, which varies according to the resource being discussed, as well as the temporal element, to delineate a boundary within which other activities should be captured in the analysis. The shale gas production wells the commentors identify are located over 80 miles away from the nearest AIM Project facilities and local resources that may be affected by shale development, which lie well over 10 miles away from the AIM Project facilities, would not be affected by the AIM Project. Local resources affected by the AIM Project would not be affected by development in the shale regions. We, therefore, disagree that unspecified shale gas activities occurring beyond the range of the AIM Project impacts should be included in the cumulative impact analysis. CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO20 – Allegheny Defense Project (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-1 See the response to comment FA4-1. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-2 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA4-6, and SA4-15. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-3  Algonquin has completed surveys for multiple federally listed and state-listed  species and submitted those results to the FWS and appropriate state agencies  for review. See also the responses to comments SA10-6 through SA10-9,  SA11-12 through SA11-16, LA26-21, and CO3-13.  CO21-4  We have reviewed the wetland areas that would be crossed in Croton and the  potential impacts on these wetlands and we do not believe an alternative away  from the existing pipeline right-of-way is warranted.  Depending on the route  selected, a deviation from the existing right-of-way could potentially reduce the  acreage of wetland impacts, but it would also create a new pipeline corridor.  Compared with the proposed route that would locate the pipeline within the  same permanent right-of-way as the existing pipeline, and utilize the existing  cleared right-of-way corridor for construction, a new corridor would increase  both the temporary and permanent impacts of the Project, including impacts on  new previously unaffected landowners, increased land disturbance, and  increased tree and other vegetation clearing. Moreover, any deviation from the  existing corridor would undoubtedly cross new wetlands and thus would result  in new wetland impacts in areas where none previously existed.  CO21-5  See the response to comment FA3-5.  CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-6 As indicated in section 4.4.3.1 of the EIS, soil that is excavated from a wetland would be temporarily stored along the right-of-way in spoil piles with the top 12 inches of topsoil segregated from the remaining soil. Sediment barriers would be in place to contain the spoil within the right-of-way and protect adjacent off right-of-way wetland and waterbody areas.  Wetland soil would be backfilled and restored to its original location. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-7 Wetland surveys were conducted along the right-of-way during the appropriate growing season for wetland plants. Algonquin consulted with the USACE and appropriate state and local agencies regarding wetland surveys and continues to consult with them regarding obtaining appropriate permits for the Project. Survey reports were reviewed by agencies and the appropriate regulatory agencies would make the final jurisdictional determination prior to construction of the Project. CO21-8 As explained in section 4.7.5.1 of the EIS, Algonquin consulted with the NYSDEC New York Natural Heritage Program regarding the documented occurrences of state protected species and continues to coordinate with the NYSDEC regarding the proposed Project in New York.  Algonquin would coordinate with the Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition to evaluate the findings of rare plant species as identified by Dr. Kiviat and described in this comment. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-9 Comment noted.

Further, Algonquin’s E&SCP complies with the requirements of our Plan and Procedures that require the use of environmental inspectors to inspect construction activities and ensure compliance with project environmentalprotection requirements. Algonquin’s E&SCP specifies the requirements for inspection and repair of erosion and sedimentation control devices in areas of active construction and other portions of the Project. Silt fence, staked hay bales and other comparable erosion and sedimentation control devices are standard mitigation measures to minimize and mitigate the potential water quality effects of construction. The CWA section 401 water quality certification that may be issued for the Project would further specify measures to be implemented to meet New York state water quality standards. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-15 Section 4.3.2.1 of the EIS has been revised to include a discussion of phosphorus within the Croton Watershed and measures Algonquin would implement to minimize impacts during construction. As indicated in table 1.3-1 of the EIS, Algonquin would obtain State Pollution Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) Program permits from the NYSDEC, including the development of a SWPPP. The EIS is a summary document intended to disclose the potential impacts of a proposed action. The document incorporates by reference all of the material filed in support of the permits and other regulatory clearances required to construct the facilities, should the Commission issue a Certificate for the Project. As such, the presentation of potential wetland and water quality impacts provided in the EIS is sufficient for the public and decision makers to assess the potential impacts of the Project. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-16 Comment noted. Sections 4.3.2.6 and 4.4.3 of the EIS discuss impacts and mitigation to surface waters and wetlands, and section 4.3.2.2 specifically discusses sensitive waterbodies including waters that do not meet state water qualitystandards associated with the water’s designatedbeneficial uses and surface waters that have been designated for intensive water quality management. Section 4.3.2.1 of the EIS explains that the Cortlandt M&R Station in New York is located adjacent to an unnamed tributary to Hunter Brook, and the proposed construction activity and operation of this facility would not directly affect the tributary to Hunter Brook or Hunter Brook and its associated aquatic organisms, including trout. As further explained in section 4.3.2.3 of the EIS, waterbodies within the Croton River Watershed would be crossed using the dry crossing method, which isolates trench spoil and sediment from stream flow and that spoil removed during the trenching would be stored awayfrom the water’s edge and protectedby sediment containment structures. As explained in section 4.4 of the EIS, section 401 of the CWA requires that proposed dredge and fill activities under section 404 of the CWA be reviewed and certified by the designated state agency so that the proposed Project would meet state water quality standards. Algonquin has submitted a 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC) application to the NYSDEC and all water quality concerns will be addressed through the 401 WQC application process with the NYSDEC. As further explained in the conclusion of section 4.3.2.6 of the EIS, Algonquin is developing a SWPPP in consultation with the NYCDEP to address concerns about crossing New York City watersheds. Applicable construction stormwater best management practices would be implemented to prevent runoff from contaminated and non-contaminated sites to impaired waters. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-17  See the responses to comments FA3-5, SA2-2, and SA2-5. See also the additional discussion in section 1.1 of the EIS regarding the Commission's Policy Statement. Pipeline companies are not required to operate at the MAOP of the pipeline. A company designs and engineers a project to meet contractual demands, using pressure determined by such demand and system operating constraints.  CO21-18  Algonquin is not proposing to increase the pressure along the existing 26-inch pipeline. Algonquin must comply with PHMSA rules regarding operating pressures, which are designed to ensure an adequate margin of safety for high pressure gas pipelines.  CO21-19  See the response to comment FA3-5.  CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-20 See the response to comment FA3-5. Also, section 4.13 of the EIS discusses the criteria for including activities within the scope of the cumulative impacts analysis. Consistent with CEQ and EPA guidance (as well as with the commentor's cited court decisions), we make a practical delineation of the spatial and temporal scales, in order to include all potentially significant effects on resources of concern. While an Atlantic Bridge Project would likely be within the spatial range of the AIM Project's impacts, we do not know whether such a project will be proposed (i.e., an application filed with the Commission), nor its exact scope and timing if it is proposed. Nonetheless, we have expanded the cumulative impacts assessment in section 4.13 of the EIS to include supplemental information about that potential project. CO21-21 See the response to comment FA3-5. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-22 Section 3.4.1 of the EIS provides a discussion on the facility design and siting for the proposed replacement pipeline segments (i.e., why they are where they are). Because this segment of the Project is a replacement where the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline would be replaced with a 42-inch-diameter pipeline, the proposed alignment would maximize the use of existing right-of-way, which would minimize impacts on the environment during construction. Factors in HDD design include the availability of a straight and relatively low relief laydown area for the pullback pipe section; the availability of large work areas at the HDD entry and exit points; surrounding terrain; land use; and operation concerns. In addition, for the larger diameter pipeline segments (i.e., 42-inch), the minimum drill length is quite long (around 2,000 feet or more). Some of the other major limiting factors in the more densely populated areas of the Project included new temporary impacts on nearby residences, direct impacts on residential homes, and the need to acquire new easement rights for the permanent right-of-way for operation and maintenance of the pipeline. Based on information from Algonquin, our review of Project mapping, and information we obtained during visits to the Project area, we conclude that the use of the HDD method in other areas, including the Croton Watershed, would be either technically infeasible, impractical, or would not result in a clear environmental advantage to the proposed methods. However, Algonquin would implement several other measures to minimize impacts on the Croton Watershed (see section 4.3.2 of the EIS). CO21-23 We disagree. The EIS has been updated to reflect additional information and to respond to comments, including the resources identified by the commentor. However, in no instance would the requested additional information provide a substantial change to the proposed action or to the resulting impacts previously identified in the draft EIS. In many instances, impacts have been further reduced due to additional mitigation commitments by Algonquin. Also, FERC accepts comments on its final EISs and addresses those comments in its decision on whether to approve or deny a project. For these reasons, we believe the analysis in the draft EIS and the revised analysis in the final EIS is appropriate. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-24 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and CO21-23. Also, the EIS is not a permitting document. It is a summary document that provides decision makers with sufficient information to decide if, from an environmental perspective, the Project may be approved. In addition to the EIS, the permit applications provide the detailed information to the applicable agencies to support the section 401 permitting, and the section 401 permits would provide the specific mitigation measures required to support its issuance. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-25 See the response to comment CO21-7. CO21-26 See the response to comment CO21-7. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-27 See the response to comment CO21-11. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-28 See the response to comment CO21-9. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-29 See the responses to comments CO21-6 and CO21-14. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-30 Comment noted. Algonquin would implement sediment and erosion controls and would restore and revegetate disturbed areas following construction, which would minimize the impacts of the Project and any associated cumulative impacts. CO21-31 Right-of-way configurations are discussed in sections 2.2.1 and 4.8.1.2 of the EIS. Construction right-of-way widths would be narrowed from 100 to 75 feet in sensitive areas such as wetlands. Permanent right-of-way widths vary. In some areas, additional temporary workspace (ATWS) is needed beyond the nominal construction right-of-way, for example at road or railroad crossings. However, the Project does not entail a simple "increase in transmission capacity of the pipeline" as the commentor suggests, that could be performed within the existing right-of-way. Based on FERC staff's experience inspecting hundreds of pipeline projects across the United States, including the Northeast region, safely constructing a 42-inch diameter pipeline, such as the replacement that would occur in New York, necessitates the identified construction right-of-way widths. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-32  See the response to comment CO21-7.  CO21-33  See the response to comment CO21-31.  CO21-34 CO21-35  Several planned or proposed projects are addressed in the cumulative impact assessment in section 4.13 of the EIS. See also the responses to comments FA3-5, and LA23-16. See the responses to comments CO3-8 and CO21-11.  CO21-36 CO21-37  Comment noted.  Algonquin consulted with the NYSDEC New York Natural Heritage Program regarding the documented occurrences of state protected species, the NYSDEC Bureau of Wildlife, and the FWS to plan and coordinate the appropriate protected and sensitive species surveys for the Project. As part of the FERC Procedures, Algonquin would consult with the appropriate federal or state agencies to develop a project-specific wetland restoration plan. The restoration plan would include measures for re-establishing herbaceous and/or woody species, controlling the invasion and spread of noxious weeds, and monitoring the success of the revegetation and weed control efforts. If native plant salvage is possible for a specific wetland crossing it would be addressed by the appropriate agencies in this plan.  CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-38  Section 4.5.3 of the EIS provides a description of the noxious weeds documented along the Project rights-of-way. Algonquin would implement its Invasive Plant Species Control Plan to address the spread of invasive plants within the Project rights-of-way and control invasive populations that might prevent successful revegetation. Algonquin has indicated that as a matter of course, it does not use herbicides/pesticides for general right-of-way vegetation maintenance practices along any of its pipeline facilities.  CO21-39  See the response to comment SA4-16.  CO21-40  Compensatory mitigation for impacts on wetlands resulting from Project construction are described in section 4.4.5 of the EIS. Final wetland mitigation would be determined through the CWA permitting process in consultation with the USACE, NYSDEC, and CTDEEP. See also the response to comment FA3-3.  CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-41 See the response to comment CO21-15. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-42 See the response to comment CO21-14. CO21-43 See the responses to comments CO21-14, CO21-16, and LA26-14. CO21-44 2a -The majority of water used would be obtained from municipal sources with the exception of Old Verplanck Quarry Lake. Algonquin would consult with local municipal water suppliers prior to construction to ensure that water needs for hydrostatic testing would not impact customer use. 2b -Hydrostatic test water obtained from municipal sources within the Croton watershed would likely come from the Northern Westchester Joint Waterworks. This facility supplies municipal drinking water to the Town of Cortlandt. Based on the 2013 Water Quality Report for the Town of Cortlandt, the municipal drinking water contained an average chlorine residual of 0.32 mg/L. As described in Table 4.3.2-4 in the EIS, hydrostatic test water that would likely be obtained from municipal sources for the portions of the Project within the Croton watershed could range up to 4,734,559 gallons. Discharge of the hydrostatic test water would occur through discharge structures designed to provide filtration of particulate matter followed by discharge to well vegetated upland areas for infiltration to the ground and indirect discharge to nearby waterbodies following additional filtration accomplished by overland flow across additional well vegetated areas. The NYSDEC will require a SPDES permit for hydrostatic test water discharge, ensuring that the receiving water quality criterions are met while discharging chlorinated waters. In the environment, chlorine is neutralized upon reaction with air, sunlight and other contacting surfaces. The chlorine concentration in stored water gradually decreases with time due to aeration, reaction with sunlight/surfaces of holding tanks.  Furthermore, chlorine readily reacts with organic and inorganic impurities in soil, paved surfaces, water and wastewater. Therefore, disposal of chlorinated water passively by discharge through holding time in the test section, discharge structures and then release to vegetated soil surfaces is expected to dissipate chlorine to achieve regulatory discharge limits prior to reaching receiving waters. 2c: Hydrostatic test water discharge permits typically require grab sampling of test water as it is discharged.  Analysis of the discharge samples typically includes pH, oil and grease, dissolved oxygen, and total suspended solids. 2d: Site-specific designs for hydrostatic test water discharge may be included in the SPDES permit required for the Project by NYSDEC. The EIS is not a permitting document. It is a summary document that provides decision makers with sufficient information to decide if, from an environmental perspective, the Project may be approved. In addition to the EIS, the SPDES permit that needs to be obtained to construct the Project would provide the specific mitigation measures required to support the issuance of the permit. 2e: The flow rate of the discharge would be adjusted as needed to allow the discharge/filtration structures to perform as required. The discharge volume from hydrostatic testing of the pipeline segments in the East of Hudson drainage would be less than that of a typical 1 year return period storm of 30 minutes duration. The SPDES permit required by the NYSDEC would likely address discharge conditions and capacity of receiving waters. Continued on next page. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James CO21-44 continued Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO21-44 2f:Site-specific designs for hydrostatic test water discharge may be included in the SPDES permit required for the Project by NYSDEC. 2g: Pipeline safety regulations make provision for the use of compressed air or inert gas to pressure test pipelines. Hydrostatic testing is the long-standing method employed for pressure testing new natural gas transmission pipelines due to the readily available sources of test water, the ease and safe handling of the test media (compared with inert gasses or compressed air), and the cost-effectiveness of the method. In addition, the use of hydrostatic testing increases the likelihood of locating construction defects because leaking water is easier to track than air or inert gasses. CO21-45 Comment noted. CO21-46 See the response to comment CO21-22. CO21 – Community Watersheds Clean Water Coalition, James Bryan Bacon (cont’d) CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate CO22-1 We disagree.

As explained in section 4.6.1.5 EIS, Algonquin continues to consult with the NYSOPRHP and PIPC to address impacts on Harriman State Park. Appropriate requirements associated with Algonquin's proposed construction and operation of facilities in Harriman State Park would be addressed through this consultation prior to construction. In this section of the EIS, FERC staff has recommended that Algonquin file with the Secretary, for review and approval of the Director of OEP, a site-specific plan for Harriman State Park, including any avoidance or mitigation measures developed with the NYSOPRHP and PIPC. See also the response to comment CO3-8.  CO22-13  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-12.  CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-14 Wetland impacts, including impacts on wetland buffer areas, would be mitigated through implementation of Algonquin’s E&SCP, and the conditions of CWA permits that may be issued for the Project. Following construction, the right-ofway would be revegetated to restore vegetated buffers at wetlands disturbed by the Project. Additionally, where topographic conditions warrant, permanent erosion and sediment control measures would be installed along the right-ofway to reduce stormwater velocity, reduce sediment concentrations, and redirect stormwater to well vegetated, upland areas adjacent to the right-of-way, thereby reducing the potential for sedimentation and nutrient loading effects on wetlands. Algonquin’s E&SCP and our Procedures require post-construction restoration of vegetation as well as monitoring of the success of those restoration measures. Additionally, it is anticipated that any CWA permits issued for the Project would also include conditions requiring restoration of wetland communities and upland buffers. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-15 See the responses to comments FA4-4, SA14-1, and CO21-16. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-16 See the response to comment LA23-24. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-17 Section 4.3.1.7 of the EIS has been revised to include additional information on the Ramapo River Basin. CO22-18 See the responses to comments FA3-5 and CO22-1. We also note that applicants frequently modify the scope of a project in the pre-filing process, while the project is still under development and contracts with customers are still under consideration. Upon filing its application, Algonquin reduced the size of the AIM Project to reflect the facilities needed to support the proposed volumes of natural gas. Similar to the AIM Project, other Algonquin projects in the future may begin the pre-filing process or project development with facilities in common with the AIM Project or that were removed from the AIM Project. However, given the frequency of facility changes during project development before an application is filed, it is speculative to assume that all current Atlantic Bridge facilities or any other future project facilities will exist, as is, should Algonquin file an application. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-19 See the response to comment FA3-5. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-20 Planned residential and other developments near the Project area were identified and provided in table 4.8.3-1 of the EIS. Table 4.13-1 of the EIS has been revised to reference these planned developments, which have been incorporated into the analysis. CO22-21 See the responses to comments FA4-24 and CO12-7. The EIS correctly dismisses cumulative impacts with shale development, which occurs outside of the same airsheds, sub-watersheds, and resource areas that would be impacted by the proposed Project, as outlined in section 4.13 of the EIS. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-22 See the response to comment FA4-23 for additional information regarding Algonquin's efforts to minimize GHG emissions from Project facilities. See the response to comment CO12-13 for additional information regarding the GHG impact analysis prepared for the Project, including cumulative impacts. The commentor references using a social cost of carbon protocol. While such a tool exists, we believe that it would not be appropriate to use for this Project. The tool referenced by the commentor does not calculate methane emissions, which represent a portion of the Project's GHG emissions. Further, the tool referenced by the commentor is more useful for comparing alternatives using a cost/benefit analysis, which is not being done for the Project, and does not measure the incremental impacts by a Project on the environment. For these reasons, we do not feel this tool would be appropriate for estimating Project impacts, nor would its use inform our analysis of the Project. CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-23  Comment noted.  CO22-24  Among the recommendations in the EIS is that Algonquin file status reports on a weekly basis for the Project until all construction and restoration activities are complete under the Project docket (i.e., CP14-96). With the exception of certain confidential information regarding locations of sensitive resources, this information would be publicly available on FERC website (www.ferc.gov) using the eLibrary link.  CO22-25  Algonquin would implement its Best Drilling Practices, Monitoring, and Cleanup of Horizontal Directional Drilling Inadvertent Returns Plan for monitoring the HDD crossing of the Hudson River. This plan identifies monitoring of the drilling operation by the HDD operator and procedures for anticipating and addressing the potential for inadvertent releases as mitigation. The plan also states that the appropriate construction personnel would implement installation of containment structures and additional response measures if an inadvertent release were to occur.  CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-26  Per the FERC Procedures, revegetation on the construction right-of-way with annual ryegrass is a temporary revegetation only to be implemented until a Project-specific wetland restoration plan is developed and/or implemented. See the response to comment CO21-37.  CO22-27  Algonquin agreed on the record that it would not use additives in hydrostatic test water; therefore, no further conditions are required.  CO22-28  See the response to comment FA4-19. Of the 47 wells within 150 feet of the construction workspace in the New York portion of the Project, only 18 wells are located close to areas that may require blasting to deepen the existing trench sufficiently to accommodate the new 42-inch-diameter pipeline. Algonquin would conduct pre-and post-construction testing of well yield and water quality at landowner request. Further, Algonquin would file the results of water supply well complaints within 30 days of placing the Project facilities in service. Those results would be filed in the Project docket as public records.  CO22 – Riverkeeper, New York’s Clean Water Advocate (cont’d) CO22-29  Algonquin conducted pre-construction waterbody surveys that documented  existing stream conditions. The methodologies employed for the surveys were  developed in consultation with the appropriate jurisdictional agencies. The  survey reports included photo documentation of each waterbody proposed to be  crossed by the Project. The survey reports were filed in support of Algonquin’s  application to the Commission and were also submitted as part of the various  CWA permits included by reference in the EIS. Algonquin’s E&SCP and our  Procedures require post-construction monitoring and reporting of restoration of  areas affected by Project construction.

Also, the EIS considers the construction emissions for all aspects of the project, aggregated per calendar year in each non-attainment or maintenance area for comparison to the general conformity thresholds. This analysis provides for careful consideration of construction emission impacts on air quality.  CO28 – Clean Air Council (cont’d) CO28-5 Section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS presents detailed estimates of construction emissions associated with the proposed Project, which include HAPs and fugitive dust emissions. Algonquin has proposed mitigation measures to be implemented during construction, as presented in section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS, which include fugitive dust controls, the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, and the use of BACT on non-road engines where feasible to limit emissions from diesel combustions. The construction emissions are less than General Conformity de minimis thresholds, as presented in table 4.11.1-5 of the EIS; therefore, no additional mitigation, beyond the mitigation proposed by Algonquin, is required for construction emissions. Construction emissions associated with the Project would not result in a significant impact on regional air quality. CO28-6 See the response to comment FA4-23. CO28 – Clean Air Council (cont’d) CO28-7  See the response to comment SA11-4. Regarding GHG emissions from M&R  stations, table 4.11.1-13 of the EIS includes estimated GHG emissions from  non-combustion and fugitive sources at the M&R stations. Section 4.11.1.3 and  table 4.11.1-12 of the EIS have been updated to include GHG emissions from  combustion sources at M&R stations. Based upon these estimates, the GHG  emissions at M&R stations would be significantly less than any applicable  permitting thresholds.  CO28-8  See the responses to comments SA4-1, SA4-9, and SA11-4. Also, the EIS  includes an extensive analysis of the various air quality control regions and the  applicability of the general conformity rule to any non-attainment or  maintenance areas.  CO28-9  See the responses to comments FA4-24 and CO12-7.  CO28 – Clean Air Council (cont’d) CO28-10 We disagree. See the response to comment SA11-4, which explains that although the design of the M&R stations was not complete, the draft EIS included a conservative estimate of emissions. The West Roxbury and Assonet M&R Stations would result in de minimis emissions. Therefore, it was appropriate to base the cumulative impacts analysis on other projects that would result in long-term impacts in the same air quality control region as the compressor stations. CO28 – Clean Air Council (cont’d) CO28-11 See the responses to comments FA3-5 and LA23-16. CO28 – Clean Air Council (cont’d) CO28-12 See the response to comment CO12-13. CO28-13 See the response to comment FA4-1. CO28 – Clean Air Council (cont’d) CO29 – Sierra Club Rhode Island Chapter, Robert Malin CO29-1  Comment noted.  CO29-2  Impacts on noise, air quality and health, safety, and water resources, as well as mitigation measures, are discussed throughout the EIS.  CO29-3  We disagree.

Compensatory mitigation is in addition to, not in lieu of, requirements for restoration of wetlands and waterbodies required in the FERC Procedures. See also the responses to comments FA3-3 and CO13-8.  CO31-8  The proposed crossing of Dickey Brook is located in an area where Algonquin would remove the existing pipeline and install the new pipe using take-up and relay techniques. The new pipeline would be located within the existing pipeline right-of-way and no new permanent easement is proposed. Algonquin proposes to use a dry crossing method to cross the brook and would employ other mitigation measures to avoid or minimize wetland and waterbody impacts. For these reasons, we do not believe an alternative route is warranted in this area. Any alternative would likely cross the creek in an area outside of the existing right-of-way and would require new right-of-way and disturbance that would increase the impact of the crossing.  CO31-9  The proposed crossing of the Reynolds Hills property is located in an area where Algonquin would remove the existing pipeline and install the new pipe using take-up and relay techniques. The new pipeline would be located within the existing pipeline right-of-way and no new permanent easement is proposed. For these reasons, we do not believe an alternative route is warranted in this area. Any alternative would likely cross this or another property in an area outside of the existing right-of-way and would require new right-of-way and disturbance that would increase the impact of the Project.  CO31-10  See the responses to comments FA3-5 and LA23-16.  CO31-11  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.  CO31-12  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.  CO32 – Fossil Free Rhode Island CO32-1 Comment noted. CO32-2 See the response to comment FA4-24. CO32-3 See the responses to comments FA4-24, CO7-3, and CO12-13. Regarding the global warming potential (GWP), at present, the EPA accepted the GWP value for methane is 25 over a 100-year period. FERC appropriately selected this value because this is the value the EPA established on November 29, 2013 for reporting of GHG emissions. The EPA supported the 100-year time period over the 20-year period in its summary of comments and responses in the final rulemaking, 2013 Revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule and Final Confidentiality Determinations for New or Substantially Revised Data Elements, establishing the methane GWP at 25 (78 Fed. Reg. 71,904). Similarly, in this final rulemaking, the EPA supported the adoption of the published IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report GWP values over the Fifth Assessment Report values. The EPA acknowledged the Fifth Assessment Report could lead to more accurate assessments of climate impacts in the future; however, when balanced with the benefit of retaining consistency across national and international programs, the potential gain in accuracy does not justify the loss of consistency in reporting and likely would cause stakeholder confusion among the various GWPs used in different programs. The EPA identified that it may consider adoption of the Fifth Assessment Report GWPs in the future, at which time we will ensure that FERC staff request the use of any revised EPA GWP values in future NEPA evaluations. CO32 – Fossil Free Rhode Island (cont’d) CO32 – Fossil Free Rhode Island (cont’d) CO32-4  See the response to comment FA4-24.  CO32-5  See the response to comment FA4-24.

Property owners who install some form of enhanced fire  protection (and we are not aware what that might be) would do so at their own  expense.  FL8-6  See the responses to comments SA4-4 and SA4-10.  FL8-7  See the responses to comments SA7-4, CO19-4, and FL4-4.  FL8-8  Section 4.12.4 of the EIS discusses threats from terrorism.  FL8 – Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School Parents (cont’d) FL8-9 See the response to comment FA4-25. FL8-10 See the responses to comments FA4-15 and LA9-16. FL8-11 See the response to comment LA1-10 regarding insurance in case of a pipeline accident. Pipeline coatings and cathodic protection, the two principle corrosion preventative measures, are among the numerous safety components covered by federal regulations and standards, as discussed in section 4.12.1 of the EIS. Also, pipeline inspection tools can measure for internal corrosion. Should internal corrosion be detected, pipeline operators would perform maintenance on their pipeline. New York State, through agreement with PHMSA, inspects interstate gas pipelines and PHMSA's Office of Pipeline Safety enforces federal pipeline safety regulations, which include corrosion prevention elements. Violations of safety standards under the Pipeline Safety Act are subject to monetary penalties. FL8-12 See the responses to comments CO13-1 and CO13-8. Algonquin is no longer proposing a contractor ware yard at Granite Knolls West. As indicated in section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS, there is an existing 6-foot-wide permanent easement and an existing 75-foot-wide maintenance easement associated with Algonquin's existing pipeline within the Blue Mountain Reservation. During construction, some additional workspace would be required outside the existing 75-foot-wide maintenance easement. This workspace would generally be 100 feet wide. Algonquin would coordinate with Westchester County to obtain approval for workspace outside the existing 75-foot-wide easement and for revegetation efforts. Impacts on these workspace areas would be temporary but could be long-term due to tree clearing. Some temporary impacts on wildlife species may occur during construction and interim recovery periods, especially for those species associated with upland forests.  Measures would be implemented to minimize impacts on birds and habitat during construction and operation of the Project, including limiting routine right-of-way maintenance clearing and prohibiting clearing during the migratory bird nesting season (April 15 to August 1).  These measures are addressed in section 4.7.2 of the EIS. Algonquin would not apply herbicides for general right-of-way maintenance. The maintained permanent rights-of-way would be subjected to mowing every 3 years. To facilitate periodic corrosion surveys, a 10-foot-wide strip centered on the pipeline would be mowed annually to maintain herbaceous growth. FL8 – Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School Parents (cont’d) FL8-13  See the responses to comments FL8-12, CO22-26, and FA3-4.  FL8-14  Section 4.7.2 of the EIS describes potential impacts on migratory birds and  section 4.7.5.1 discusses state protected species. As explained in section 4.7.1 of  the EIS, Algonquin consulted with the FWS for federally protected species.  Survey results are included in the final EIS, but specific survey locations for  sensitive species are not identified due to the sensitive nature of the information.  See also the responses to comments FA4-1, FA4-26, and SA11-14.  FL8-15  See the response to comment LA23-24 on vernal pools and the responses to  comments FL8-12, CO22-26, and FA3-4 for invasive species. As explained in  section 4.7.5.1 of the EIS, Algonquin consulted with the NYSDEC New York  Natural Heritage Program regarding the documented occurrences of state  protected species, including amphibians, and continues to coordinate with the  NYSDEC regarding the proposed Project in New York.  As explained in section  4.7.1 of the EIS, Algonquin consulted with the FWS for federally protected  species.

The proposed Project is a natural gas transmission project. Table 4.12.3-2 of the EIS presents natural gas transmission pipeline incident data based on required reporting to PHMSA. Further, the EIS states that the majority of fatalities from pipelines are due to local distribution pipelines not regulated by FERC because the pipelines are generally smaller diameter pipes and/or plastic pipes that are more susceptible to damage and often are not identified with pipeline markers.

Blowdowns of natural gas are infrequent; they are typically performed when major maintenance work is planned at a facility or the pipeline, and nearby residents and public officials are notified when this happens (see the response to comment SA4-3 for notification procedures). Section 4.12 of the EIS describes the constituents of natural gas. An engineering analysis of potential impacts of blasting in the quarry on the West Roxbury Lateral and West Roxbury M&R Station is summarized in section 4.1.4 of the EIS. The third-party geotechnical consultant examined the potential impacts on both the pipeline and the M&R station and concluded that ground vibrations from blasting at the quarry would not be disruptive or damaging to either component of the system. IND7 – Royal Graves IND7-1 See the response to comment FL2-5.

The recorded magnitude of earthquakes in the Project area is relatively low and the ground vibration would not pose a problem for a modern welded-steel pipeline.  IND50-3  See the response to comment SA7-4.  IND50-4  See the response to comment SA4-4.  IND51-1  See the response to comment FA4-25.  IND51-2  See the response to comment IND50-2.  IND51-3  See the responses to comments FA4-25 and IND50-2.  IND52-1  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA1-9, and SA4-5.  IND52-2  The Project would cross the Hudson River using the HDD method;  therefore, there would be no direct impacts on the river or its recreational  use.  IND52-3  See the response to comment SA4-4.  IND52-4  See the response to comment SA2-10.  IND52-5  See the response to comment LA1-10.  IND53-1  See the responses to comments FA6-5 and LA3-2.  IND53-2  The concern that the gas would not be needed if the local distribution company repaired all its leaks is an issue more appropriately brought up with the state agency that regulates local gas distribution companies, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. See section 1.1 of the EIS for a discussion of the purpose and need for the Project.  IND53-3  We do not agree with the characterization of natural gas pipelines as "extremely unsafe." See the responses to comments CO14-25 and LA5-12 regarding PHMSA's safety standards and the data showing transmission pipelines to be a safe, reliable means of energy transportation.  IND53-4  Natural gas is considered neither toxic nor carcinogenic.  IND53-5  See the response to comment FA6-5.  IND53-6  See the responses to comments IND53-2 and CO15-4. Further, the export of natural gas requires an authorization under section 3 of the NGA from the U.S. Department of Energy for the commodity and the Commission for the infrastructure. The facilities required to liquefy and export natural gas do not currently exist in Boston. Also, as stated in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, the Project would be designed to meet or exceed the minimum safety requirements.  IND53-7  With respect to the quarry, see the response to comment FA6-1.  IND54-1  Comment noted.  IND54-2  Section 4.12 of the EIS discusses federal pipeline safety standards applicable to this Project, and how they are specifically applied in HCAs.  IND54-3  The gas to be transported by the AIM Project is pipeline quality gas, which must meet the Algonquin’s tariff specifications, and contains no “unspecified (trade secret) chemical additives.”  IND54-4  The police station is one among several structures that are considered in determining the class location of a given location along the West Roxbury Lateral. Section 4.12.1 of the EIS discusses the safety standards applicable to various class locations.  IND54-5  Algonquin has consulted with local governments in Massachusetts regarding the placement of the proposed pipeline relative to roadways to minimize traffic disruption. The Updated Traffic Management Assessment and Plans for the West Roxbury Lateral can be found in appendix G of the EIS.  IND54-6  See the responses to comments SA4-5, SA13-5, and IND54-3.  IND54-7  See the response to comment FA6-1.  IND54-8  PHMSA collects data on the causes of pipeline incidents. A study entitled "Impact Assessment of Traffic-Induced Vibration on Natural Gas Transmission Pipeline" published in November 2012 in the Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industry concluded that while traffic-induced vibration on a given natural gas pipeline is detectable, this vibration, compared to other factors that are influencing the pipeline's structural integrity, does not have a significant impact on the pipeline's lifetime period. Note also that pipe segments would be joined by welding, not with rivets.  IND54-9  We evaluated two alternatives along the West Roxbury Lateral in the draft EIS. We have updated sections 3.5 to include an evaluation of other alternatives and variations identified subsequent to the issuance of the draft EIS.  IND54-10  Economic benefits of the Project are discussed in section 4.9.9 of the EIS.  Taxes generated from the operation of the Project would result in an annual  tax revenue increase for the affected communities in the Project area.  IND54-11  Nighttime construction could occur during the HDDs of the Hudson and  Still Rivers. The work at these crossings must continue round-the-clock  until completed. Nighttime construction could also occur along portions of  the West Roxbury Lateral, particularly along commercial roads or at highly  trafficked intersections, in an effort to minimize traffic-related impacts (see  sections 4.9.5.2 and 4.11.3 of the EIS).  IND54-12  Project construction would temporarily generate additional noise and  vibration of a scale similar to road construction activities.  However, due to  smaller workspace constraints in the Dedham/West Roxbury area,  Algonquin would be required to use smaller or less equipment to construct  in the area, resulting in lesser impacts than a major road construction project  (see section 4.11.2.3 of the EIS, which has been revised to address this  issue). Section 4.8.3.1 of the EIS describes Algonquin's Environmental  Compliant Resolution Procedure, which would be available in the event of a  landowner complaint during construction activities.  IND55-1  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA1-9, and SA4-5.  IND55-2  See the response to comment LA1-10.  IND55-3 IND55-4  See the response to comment LA1-10. Also, as discussed in section 4.9.9 of the EIS, Algonquin would pay taxes that may be used to offset any municipal expenses. See the response to comment SA1-9. Construction disturbance near the school would be temporary. The construction right-of-way is 450 feet from the school at its nearest point and a wooded area and natural berm lies between the right-of-way and the school, reducing any distractions to students.  IND56 – John Louis Parker IND56-1 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5 IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND56-2 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-12. IND56-3 The existing Algonquin pipeline continues under Stony Street and onto the Kopple property; however, the take-up and relay segment for the AIM Project stops at the west side of Stony Street and construction and operation of the Project would not impact the Kopple property. See also the response to comment SA4-16 regarding compliance monitoring. IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND56-4 IND56-5  While the commentor is correct that "there is no legal requirement mandating that the final EIS be issued on December 19, 2014," the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires FERC to establish a schedule for its review process and that of related federal authorizations. In addition, the issuance of the final EIS was delayed as a result of additional information needed from Algonquin to complete the analysis. See the response to comment FA4-1.  IND56-6  See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5.  IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND56-7 See the response to comment FA6-5. IND56-8 See the responses to comments FA3-5 and FA6-5. IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND56-9  Algonquin is no longer proposing a pipe and contractor ware yard at this  location. Section 4.8.5.1 and table 4.8.1-1 have been revised accordingly.  IND56-10  Algonquin would construct a new launcher and receiver facility and pressure  regulating facility within Granite Knolls Park West on the land parcel with  tax map identification number 26.09-1-22. These facilities would be  permanent. However, they would be located entirely within Algonquin's  existing right-of-way on the parcel. Therefore, operation of the launcher and  receiver and pressure regulating facilities would not permanently impact any  additional parkland outside Algonquin's existing easement.  IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND56-11 See the response to comment FA4-1. IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND56-12 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and FA6-5. IND56-13 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12. IND56 – John Louis Parker (cont’d) IND57 – Jesus Becerra IND57-1 Comment noted. IND58 – Pablo Reyes IND58-1 Comment noted. IND59 – Jay Forgosa IND59-1 Comment noted. IND60 – Arthur Gaddist IND60-1 Comment noted. IND61 – Thomas Weaver IND61-1 Comment noted. IND62 – Keith Franklin IND62-1 Comment noted. IND63 – Carlos Flores IND63-1 Comment noted. IND64 – Steve Genovesi IND64-1 Comment noted. IND65 – Victor Becerra IND65-1 Comment noted. IND66 – Rogelio Valdovinos IND66-1 Comment noted. IND67 – Ruben Jimenez IND67-1 Comment noted. IND68 – Richard Oakes IND68-1 Comment noted. IND69 – Roy Ribeiro IND69-1 Comment noted. IND70 – Edward Ryan IND70-1 Comment noted. IND71 – William Huston IND71 – William Huston (cont’d) IND72 – Joshua Schwartz IND71-1  Section 4.13 of the EIS includes our assessment of potential cumulative impacts associated with the proposed Project and other projects. See also the response to comment FA4-24.  IND71-2  As discussed in section 4.13 of the EIS, hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus shale would occur well outside of the AIM Project construction area, and outside of the sub-watersheds crossed by Project facilities. These potential impacts are beyond the scope of the EIS.  IND71-3  See the responses to comments FA4-24 and IND4-1.  IND71-4  See the response to comment FL4-4.  IND71-5  See the responses to comments FA4-25 and SA4-5. Also, the PIR calculation methodology was established by PHMSA under its pipeline safety regulations for operating natural gas pipelines. PHMSA has determined that the potential failure of a pipeline could have significant impacts on people or property within a PIR under this methodology. A disagreement with this calculation methodology is more appropriately addressed through PHMSA.  IND71-6  Section 1.1 of the EIS discusses the purpose and need for the project.  IND71-7  We disagree. Kinder Morgan has not currently filed an application with the Commission. Further, simply because gas on the Algonquin system, an entirely different company and system than Kinder Morgan as shown in figure 3.3.1-1 of the EIS, does not indicate that the gas for the proposed project is intended for export on this Project. See also the response to comment CO15-4.  IND72-1  Some temporary impacts on wildlife species may occur during construction  and interim recovery periods, especially for those species associated with  upland forests. Algonquin would coordinate the Project schedule with  Westchester County officials and implement construction timing as required.  IND72-2  The Project would comply with the FERC's Plan and Procedures and  Algonquin's E&SCP to minimize disturbance to vegetation and wetlands and  waterbodies, including the adjacent pond. The new 42-inch-diameter pipeline  would replace the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline within a 6-foot-wide  permanent easement granted in 1952 by the Westchester County Park  Commission and the Westchester County Board of Supervisors. That  easement also provides for a 75-foot-wide maintenance easement. The new  pipeline would be installed in the same trench as the existing pipeline to be  removed. The AIM Project would require ATWS outside the existing 75 foot-wide maintenance easement within the Blue Mountain Reservation for  up to a 6-month period; the total temporary construction right-of-way would  generally be 100 feet wide. After construction, all impacted areas within the  Reservation would be returned to their preexisting use, and although long term temporary impacts would occur as a result of tree clearing, no permanent  impacts would occur. The permanent right-of-way would remain 6 feet wide  within the Blue Mountain Reservation.  IND72-3  Algonquin has indicated that as a matter of course, it does not use  herbicides/pesticides for general right-of-way vegetation maintenance  practices along any of its pipeline facilities.  IND72-4  Section 3.5 of the EIS has been revised to include an analysis of a potential  variation to the north of the current pipeline right-of-way in the Blue  Mountain Reservation.  IND73 – Andrew Coleman IND73-1 See the response to comment FA4-24. IND73-2 Comment noted.

Further, the  commentor appears to inappropriately cite all pipeline incident data  (including natural gas distribution and gathering pipelines and hazardous  liquid pipelines). The proposed Project is a natural gas transmission  project. Table 4.12.2-1 of the EIS presents natural gas transmission  pipeline incident data over the past 20 years based on required reporting to  PHMSA. Natural gas transmission pipelines have resulted in  1,237 incidents over this time period.

National Bald Eagle  Management Guidelines require a 660-foot buffer of no activity around active  nests to avoid disturbance to nesting eagles.  The 0.5-mile distance is the  management guideline disturbance buffer for explosives/blasting. In this  instance, there is no significance to 0.5 mile, just that it is much farther than the  required 660-foot avoidance buffer.  IND84-3  See the response to comment FA4-26. Section 4.7 of the EIS has been revised  to include the results of consultations with the FWS and update on  consultations with the NYSDEC.  IND84-4  Measures would be implemented to minimize impacts on birds and habitat  during construction and operation of the Project, including limiting routine  right-of-way maintenance clearing and prohibiting clearing during the  migratory bird nesting season (April 15 to August 1). These measures are  addressed in section 4.7.2 of the EIS. Algonquin would not apply herbicides  for general right-of-way maintenance. The maintained permanent rights-of way would be subjected to mowing every 3 years. To facilitate periodic  corrosion surveys, a 10-foot-wide strip centered on the pipeline would be  mowed annually to maintain herbaceous growth.

Further, see the response to comment LA1-10 regarding insurance. Also, Algonquin would pay taxes that may be used to offset any municipal expenses. IND84-6 See the response to comment SA4-10. As discussed in section 4.8.6.2 of the EIS, Algonquin's removal of pipe or equipment that has been in contact with natural gas would be in accordance with EPA's PCB rules and regulations, as well as associated federal and state operating procedures. Construction air emissions are discussed in section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS. Also, see the response to comment SA1-9 for Algonquin's proposed construction schedule near the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School. IND84-7 The area surrounding the pipeline that includes the Buchanan-Verplanck Elementary School does not meet the qualification criteria for a Class 4 designation; it meets the criteria for a Class 3 location. However, see the responses to comments SA1-9 and FA4-25 regarding Algonquin's commitment to construct a segment of the pipeline to exceed the most stringent Class 4 design requirements. IND84 – June Jacobson (cont’d) IND84 – June Jacobson (cont’d) IND84 – June Jacobson (cont’d) IND84-8  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA1-9, and FL8-2 regarding the additional mitigation measures Algonquin has committed to implementing on its pipeline and the information about the PIPA report. Further, see the response to comment LA1-10 regarding insurance. Also, Algonquin would pay taxes that may be used to offset any municipal expenses.  IND84-9  Algonquin must receive FERC approval prior to placing the Project into service and must also notify FERC on the public record that the facilities have been placed in service (see recommendations 9 and 10 in section 5.2 of the EIS). See also the response to comment SA4-3 regarding notifications of planned blowdowns.  IND84-10  See the response to comment LA1-10.  IND84-11  Table 2.4-1 in the EIS provides the preliminary construction schedule for the Project facilities.

See the response to comment IND84-24. IND84-20  The permanent right-of-way would remain 6 feet wide within the Blue Mountain Reservation. The temporary right-of-way would include restoration and revegetation to preconstruction cover types in order to avoid long-term significant habitat changes. See also the response to comment IND72-2.  IND84-21  See the responses to comments CO13-1 and CO13-8.  IND84-22  Comment noted. Sections 4.3.2.6 and 4.4.3 of the EIS discuss impacts on and mitigation for surface waters and wetlands.  IND84-23  The pig launcher/receiver facility would be located entirely within the existing permanent right-of-way, and Algonquin is no longer proposing this contractor ware yard. The new launcher/receiver facility would have a minor but permanent impact on the visual character of the parcel of Granite Knolls West where it would be installed. There would be no other  permanent impacts on Sylvan Glen or Granite Knolls West; however, the impacts associated with the tree clearing would be long term. The temporary right-of-way would include restoration and revegetation to preconstruction cover types in order to minimize long-term significant habitat changes.  IND84-24  Algonquin would minimize habitat impacts in these areas to the extent practicable.  Temporary habitat impacts would occur within the construction right-of-way during construction and interim recovery periods.  Permanent habitat impacts would not occur because existing right-of-way would be utilized. Revegetation of temporary right-of-way would include restoration and revegetation to preconstruction cover types. Algonquin would implement the measures in its E&SCP to minimize impacts on vegetation within construction right-of-way and improve revegetation success in order to minimize long-term significant habitat changes.  IND84-25  We have reviewed Algonquin's routing studies performed to analyze avoiding habitat to the extent practicable. If habitat cannot be avoided or restored on site, off-site mitigation would be provided to offset impacts as determined and required through ongoing consultations with jurisdictional agencies.  IND84-26  Section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS provides permanent right-of-way widths for New York preserves crossed by the Project. The temporary right-of-way would include restoration and revegetation to preconstruction cover types in order to avoid long-term significant habitat changes.  IND84-27  See the response to comment IND84-4.  IND84 – June Jacobson (cont’d) IND84-28 See the response to comment IND84-2. IND84-29 See the response to comment IND84-3. IND84-30 See the response to comment IND84-4. IND84 – June Jacobson (cont’d) IND84-31 Algonquin expects construction within the Blue Mountain Reservation to occur between March and October 2016.  However, clearing would be prohibited during the migratory bird nesting season (April 15 to August 1) to avoid and minimize impacts on nesting/breeding. Short-term impacts may occur to individual foraging/food sources but would not be expected to impact populations of species due to adequate food sources and foraging habitat outside of the construction area. IND84-32 See the response to comment IND84-4. IND85 – Susan Gitlitz IND85-1 Section 4.12.3 of the EIS concludes that for the majority of the Project where older pipe would be replaced, the Project would not increase the risk to the nearby public. For the small portion of the Project involving looping or a new pipeline, the Project would result in a slight increase in risk to the nearby public. Section 4.12.1 of the EIS discusses federal safety standards for natural gas pipelines and how these standards are applied in HCAs. Section 4.12.3 of the EIS discusses safety-related concerns and other specific measures that Algonquin has proposed or that we are recommending to further address public safety concerns. IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85-2 See the response to comment IND84-31. IND85-3 See the response to comment IND84-4. IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85-4 See the responses to comments IND84-20, IND84-21, IND84-22, IND8423, and IND84-24. IND85-5 See the responses to comments IND84-24. IND85-6 Section 3.5 of the EIS has been revised to include an analysis of a potential variation to the north of the current pipeline right-of-way in the Blue Mountain Reservation. IND85-7 See the response to comment IND84-26. IND85-8 See the response to comment IND84-4. IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85-9  Algonquin is not proposing to open a Transmission Area Manager's office in New York as part of the proposed Project to accommodate the temporary increase in population during construction and the addition of three full-time permanent workers for operation of the proposed and modified facilities.  IND85-10  The AIM Project does not represent a new pipeline system, but expands and mostly replaces a system that has been operating for many years under federal pipeline safety rules, which mandate development of emergency response plans. Consequently, Algonquin has emergency response plans in place, and regularly communicates/coordinates with local emergency responders. Algonquin would review its operating procedures, emergency response plans, etc. in light of the modifications to its existing system, and adjust its plans if and where necessary.  IND85-11  See the response to comment IND85-10.  IND85-12  See the responses to comments LA1-9 and IND85-10.  IND85-13  As stated in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, PHMSA prescribes the minimum standards for operating and maintaining pipeline facilities, including the requirement to establish a written plan governing these activities to minimize the hazards in a natural gas pipeline emergency. The EIS also includes key elements of Algonquin's Emergency Response Plan.  IND85-14  See the response to comment LA1-4.  IND85-15  It is unknown at this time whether the over $20 million in taxes in New York per year would fully cover the expenses of public service response of an individual incident, as each incident is unique. However, as shown in section 4.12 of the EIS, the likelihood of an incident is very low. Further, Algonquin would continue to pay taxes on a yearly basis, regardless of whether an incident occurs and public service response is required.  IND85-16  See the response to comment LA1-10.  IND85-17  The potential effect of the Project on public utilities and related infrastructure is discussed in section 4.9.4 of the EIS. Algonquin would be responsible for the repair/replacement of any damaged existing sewer or water infrastructure in consultation with the city/utility owner and to ensure the impacts on residences or businesses as a result of any such damage are minimized.  IND85-18  See the response to comment IND85-17. Further, Algonquin has established a landowner complaint resolution procedure. This process allows landowners to immediately inform Algonquin of any service disruptions for prompt attention and provides for timely response. The process also provides an outlet for landowners to contact the FERC's dispute resolution service helpline if Algonquin does not respond timely or effectively resolve the problem.  IND85-19  Traffic-related impacts during construction of the proposed Project facilities are discussed in section 4.9.6 of the EIS. Any needed repairs to the roadways resulting from Project construction would be the responsibility of Algonquin.  IND85-20  The potential effect of the Project on local roadways including municipal streets is discussed in section 4.9.5 of the EIS. Road crossing permits would be obtained by Algonquin prior to construction. These permits would dictate the specific requirements of Algonquin including the restoration and repairs to roads after construction. See also the response to comment IND85-17.  IND85-21  The potential effect of the Project on public utilities including existing utility lines is discussed in section 4.9.4 of the EIS.  IND85-22  See the response to comment IND84-2.  IND85-23  See the response to comment IND84-2.  IND85-24  See the response to comment IND84-3.  IND85-25  See the response to comment IND84-3.

See the responses to comments SA11-4 and SA1-7 regarding emissions and permitting requirements for M&R stations and other aboveground facilities. See the response to comment CO12-10 regarding cumulative facility air impacts. See also the response to comment IND85-57 regarding this commentor's statement about the Project's toxic emissions. IND85-55 See the responses to comments SA4-4 regarding radon and SA4-3 for information regarding blowdown notifications. Natural gas, or methane, the primary component of a blowdown is considered neither toxic nor carcinogenic. See tables 4.11.1-7 to 4.11.1-11 and 4.11.1-13 of the EIS for estimates of fugitive emission from compressor stations and non-routine and fugitive operating emissions, which include blowdown emissions from compressor stations, the pipeline, and proposed M&R stations. See the response to comment FA4-23 regarding Algonquin's fugitive minimization efforts. Also, although electric-driven compressors would prevent air emissions from combustion of natural gas during their operation, they would not avoid the venting of natural gas during a blowdown. IND85-56 See the response to comment FA4-23 for additional information regarding Algonquin's methane emission minimization efforts.  See the response to comment CO12-13 for additional information regarding GHG impact assessments prepared for the Project. IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND85-57 The commentor mischaracterizes the Project's impact for the Stony Point and Southeast Compressor Station. At the Stony Point Compressor Station, table 4.11.1-7 of the EIS demonstrates that the existing emissions at this compressor station are already above the EPA permitting threshold and that the Project would result in a decrease in emissions of volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The Project would result in an increase of 77,935 tons of CO2 and would be required to modify its existing PSD permit. See also the response to comment CO16-9. At the Southeast Compressor Station, table 4.11.1-8 of the EIS demonstrates that the existing emissions at this compressor station are already above the EPA permitting threshold and that the Project would result in a decrease in emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. The Project would result in increased emissions of volatile organic compounds and CO2 at the Southeast Compressor Station. However, these increases would be below the EPA threshold and, therefore, Algonquin would not be required to modify its PSD permit. See the tables identified in this response for all existing and potential new emissions. IND85 – Susan Gitlitz (cont’d) IND86 – Courtney Williams et al. IND86 – Courtney Williams et al.

Section 4.12 of the EIS addresses both general and specific safety-related concerns.  IND91-2  See the response to comment CO19-11.  IND91-3  Comment noted.  IND92-1  See the response to comment FA6-5 regarding the opportunities for public involvement.  IND92-2  See the responses to comments FA6-5 and LA3-2. The purpose of the comment meetings is to offer the public an opportunity to voice their comments on the draft EIS on the public record to FERC (i.e., not for elected officials or citizen activists to garner support or opposition to a project). These meetings are scheduled geographically and temporally to allow a wide audience in the Project area to attend. We do not believe that a meeting the night before a primary election prevented/obstructed the ability for the majority of the public to attend. Further, many elected officials or staff representatives attended the meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts and presented comments.

As stated in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, PHMSA's regulations include measures to be implemented by the pipeline operator if an increase in population density adjacent to its pipeline occurs. Also, as noted throughout the EIS, 81.5 percent of the pipeline facilities proposed in New York would replace existing facilities installed pre-1970. Therefore, there would be no increase in risk to the public. See the responses to comments SA4-1, SA4-9, and LA1-6. Comment noted.  IND102-1  See the response to comment FA4-25.  IND102-2  See the response to comment CO15-4.  IND102-3  Algonquin would recover its costs for the AIM Project through the proposed rates that would be paid by the Project shippers. Algonquin does not receive tax money from the areas its pipeline crosses; in fact, Algonquin pays all applicable taxes in those communities.  IND102-4  See the response to comment FA4-25.  IND102-5  Comment noted.  IND103-1  See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA1-12.  IND103-2  See the responses to comments FA4-25 and CO7-6.  IND103-3  See the response to comment SA4-2.

Algonquin would be required to request an increase in capacity through the FERC regarding its pipelines. Any potential future increase in MAOP of its pipeline would be required to adhere to PHMSA's testing criteria to ensure safe operation of the pipeline. At this time, it is speculative to assume whether Algonquin would ever request to increase the MAOP of its pipeline. Our cumulative impacts review of the currently planned (but not yet proposed) Atlantic Bridge Project components does not include an increase in the MAOP of the 42inch-diameter pipeline. That project includes additional pipeline and compression facilities to accommodate its additional volumes. IND118 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND118-9 See the responses to comments FA3-5, SA1-12, SA2-10, and LA23-16. IND118 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND119 – Laura Danna IND119-1  See the response to comment FL2-5.  IND119-2  See the response to comment FA3-5.  IND119-3  Section 4.3.2.1 of the EIS has been revised to include additional information  relative to the crossing of the Catskill Aqueduct.

See also the responses to comments LA23-21 and IND85-51. Further, the article referenced repeatedly supports the EIS conclusion that insurance rates would not be affected (the article contains quotes from insurance companies and a state insurance agency that a natural gas pipeline would not change insurance categories or rates). IND126 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND126 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND126 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND127 – Lauren Niedel-Gresh IND127 – Lauren Niedel-Gresh (cont’d) IND128 – Liberty Goodwin IND128 – Liberty Goodwin (cont’d) IND128 – Liberty Goodwin (cont’d) IND129 – James Root IND127-1  The AIM Project does not include any new or expanded pipeline in Rhode Island. The only Project component in Rhode Island is the expansion of the existing Burrillville Compressor Station.  IND127-2  One or more shippers on the AIM Project serve markets in Rhode Island.  IND127-3  Algonquin, not taxpayers, bears responsibility for leaks on its system.  IND127-4  See the response to comment CO15-4.  IND127-5  Economic benefits of the Project are discussed in section 4.9.9 of the EIS. Taxes generated from the operation of the Project would result in annual tax revenue increases for the affected communities. See also the response to comment LA1-10.  IND127-6  The Project does not include an increase in pressure on any of the existing pipelines.  IND127-7  See the response to IND71-1. Production and the use of chemical additives for fracking is an industry not regulated by the FERC and is outside the scope of this EIS. Commentors may seek this information from the appropriate state agency responsible for authorizing these facilities.  IND127-8  As discussed in section 4.9.1 of the EIS, Algonquin anticipates that about 15 to 76 percent of the construction workers would be local hires, depending on the type of activity (i.e., HDD crossings). Algonquin would add three full-time permanent workers for the operation of the proposed and modified facilities.  IND127-9  See the response to comment CO29-3 for additional information regarding compressor station noise. See the responses to comments SA4-1 and SA4-9 for additional information regarding air emissions and emission impact analyses.  IND127-10  See the response to comment IND127-2.  IND127-11  Table 2.4-1 of the EIS presents the preliminary construction schedule for each segment.

Conventional sources of gas are often mixed with unconventional (hydraulic fracturing) sources through the interconnected transmission systems. IND134 – Ethel Reese IND135 – Elisabeth Radow IND134-1  The Project is only proposed at this point, not approved. The Commission will take the results of this EIS along with other non-environmental information to make a determination on whether to approve the Project. Further, Algonquin would be required to obtain other federal authorizations and approvals as outlined in table 1.3-1 of the EIS. See also the response to comment LA5-12 regarding material selection and pipeline design.  IND134-2  Comment noted.  IND135 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND135-1 See the response to comment IND126-1. IND135 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND135 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND135 – Elisabeth Radow (cont’d) IND136 – Anita Babcock IND136-1 As noted in the EIS, Algonquin has developed and provided an Environmental Complaint Resolution Procedure Plan as part of its application. It identifies procedures that Algonquin would take to address landowner calls received during construction and how the procedures would be implemented.  Algonquin would provide this procedure to landowners via letter prior to construction. The letter would include a toll free telephone number to contact with questions or concerns and the commitment that a response to the question or concern would be provided no later than 48 hours after receiving the initial call.  In the event the response is not satisfactory, the proposed letter would identify the FERC’s Dispute Resolution Service Helpline contact information. FERC's Dispute Resolution Service Helpline number is also available online at the FERC website. A discussion of seismicity, faults, and their location is provided in section 4.1.5.1 of the EIS. IND136-2 Section 4.8.3 of the EIS identifies that the Champlain Hudson Power Express Project would be installed within the bed of the Hudson River. The AIM Project would cross this proposed transmission line at the proposed HDD of the Hudson River. Therefore, the AIM Project pipeline would be well below the bed of the Hudson River, avoiding construction conflicts. Section 4.8.3 also addresses timing of construction for these two projects. IND136 – Anita Babcock (cont’d) IND136 – Anita Babcock (cont’d) IND136 – Anita Babcock (cont’d) IND137 – Jennie Sunshine IND137-1 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-12. IND137-2 Comment noted. IND137-3 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, and SA14-1. IND138 – Andrew Fischer IND138-1 Section 4.12 of the EIS includes an extensive safety analysis, identifying incidents, causes, and the impact on the public. See also the response to comment LA5-12 regarding pipeline design requirements. IND138-2 Information regarding emergency training and response is provided in section 4.12.1 of the EIS. See also the responses to comments LA1-4 and LA1-9. IND138 – Andrew Fischer (cont’d) IND139 – Lori Krane IND138-3  As discussed in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, PHMSA regulates pipeline  safety, setting requirements that have been established to ensure safety in  design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance, and emergency  response of pipeline facilities. The FERC does not impose standards  beyond what the PHMSA requires. Section 4.11 of the EIS addresses  compliance with FERC's noise criterion, as well as air quality impacts.  IND138-4  New York State, through agreement with PHMSA, inspects interstate gas  pipelines in New York and PHMSA's Office of Pipeline Safety enforces  federal pipeline safety regulations.  IND138-5  See the response to comment SA4-4.  IND138-6  See the response to comment SA4-15.  IND138-7  In accordance with the FERC Plan and Procedures and those additional  mitigation measures outlined in the EIS, Algonquin would restore and  mitigate (as described) potential impacts on wetlands and waterbodies.  IND138-8  The AIM Project is a federally regulated project. Federal safety standards  apply. As discussed in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, New York State, through  agreement with PHMSA, inspects interstate gas pipelines and enforces  federal pipeline safety regulations. See also the response to comment  SA4-15. We also note that table 1.3-1 in the EIS identifies the major  federal, state, and local permits, approvals, and consultations for  construction and operation of the Project.  IND138-9  Comment noted.  IND139-1  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA1-9, and SA4-5.  IND139-2  See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, and SA7-4.  IND139-3  Comment noted. Section 4.7 of the EIS has been revised to include the results of consultation with the FWS. Potential impacts and mitigation measures to minimize impacts on wetlands are discussed in section 4.4.3. See the responses to comments CO12-13 and CO14-55 for additional information regarding GHG impact assessments prepared for the Project.  IND139 – Lori Krane (cont’d) IND139-4 See the response to comment FA3-5. IND139-5 See the response to comment SA3-5. We also note that while the overall schedule for the AIM Project is about 1.5 years of construction, pipeline construction generally proceeds at rates ranging from several hundred feet to 1 mile per day. Due to the assembly-line method of construction, construction activities in any one area would last from several weeks to several months on an intermittent basis. IND139-6 Section 5.2 of the EIS contains FERC staff's recommended mitigation measures. If the FERC Commissioners decide to authorize the AIM Project, they will consider whether to include staff's recommendations as conditions of approval. IND139-7 See the responses to comments SA4-1 and SA4-9. IND139 – Lori Krane (cont’d) IND139-8 See the responses to comments FL2-2 and IND94-1.

Site-specific residential plans for residences within 50 feet of the proposed construction work area are provided in appendix H, including residences near the intersection of Grove Street and Centre Street. A traffic management plan is provided in appendix G.  IND157-8  See the responses to comments FA6-1 and IND54-5.  IND157-9  See the response to comment FA6-1. The 100 to 150 trucks identified in the Traffic Management Plan for the West Roxbury Lateral in the draft EIS was a reference to the current volume of trucks that visit the quarry on a typical day, which, as indicated in the plan, translates into roughly 200 to 300 truck trips on a typical weekday. This is meant to reflect the current conditions at the site. It is our understanding that although preliminary information on the filling of the quarry was provided to the MassDEP in January 2014, no specific plan has been proposed or authorizations requested. The type of soil to be used in the reclamation appears to be under debate. Therefore, any future plans are speculative at this point. In addition, reclamation of the site would likely need to occur over decades. As a result, any overlap with construction of the AIM Project seems unlikely. Further, a filling and closing of the quarry would negate many of the same commentor’s concerns regarding quarry blasting impacts on the of the AIM Project.  IND157-10  Environmental studies have been conducted on the property.

Section 4.12.3 of  the EIS discusses safety-related concerns and other specific measures that  Algonquin has proposed or that we are recommending to further address  public safety concerns. As indicated in section 4.12 of the EIS, the  available data show natural gas transmission pipeline infrastructure to be a  safe, reliable means of energy transportation.  IND168-3  Comment noted.  IND169-1  Appendix F of the EIS identifies all roads that would be crossed by the Project and the crossing method. Transportation and traffic-related impacts associated with the construction of the New York pipeline segments are described in section 4.9.5.1 and appendix G of the EIS.  IND169-2  Section 1.1 of the EIS describes the purpose and need for the Project. Section 2.0 describes the proposed facilities, including their location. Gas transmission pipelines typically ship gas for local gas distribution companies, who in turn provide gas service to individual homes and businesses; they are a necessary link in getting gas to the end users. Among the direct benefits include ad valorem taxes paid on the facilities and short-term economic boosts during construction, as described in section 4.9.9 of the EIS.  IND169-3  As discussed in section 4.9.1 of the EIS, Algonquin anticipates hiring a substantial number of local construction workers with the requisite experience for the installation of the natural gas facilities. Algonquin would add three full-time permanent workers for the operation of the proposed and modified facilities.  IND169-4  The Algonquin pipeline system may contain low levels of an odorant to aid in the detection of natural gas leaks. This odorant is added by other transmission pipeline companies before interconnecting with Algonquin. The downstream distribution systems would add additional odorant, as necessary, to ensure the detection of natural gas leaks.  IND170 – Jessica Roff IND170-1 See the responses to comments FA4-1 and SA1-12. IND170-2 See the responses to comments FA4-24, SA4-4, SA4-10, and FL2-2. IND170-3 See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-4, and FL7-4. IND170-4 See the responses to comments SA4-1 and SA4-9 regarding air quality impacts, SA4-3 regarding blowdown notification, and IND1-3 regarding noise impacts (the analysis of noise impacts includes consideration of the various frequencies noise would be emitted along each octave band). IND170 – Jessica Roff (cont’d) IND170-5 Comment noted. IND170-6 See the responses to comments FL2-2 and IND131-2. IND170-7 Comment noted. IND171 – John Cadogan IND171-1  None of the AIM Project components are located near the Three Mile Island Plant (which is located in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania).

See also the response to comment LA23-21. We also note that about 81.5 percent of the pipeline facilities in New York are replacement of existing pipeline and, therefore, would not result in significant new energy infrastructure that is not already present and considered part of a community. Further, there is no evidence to support the commentor's assertion that property values near pipelines carrying Marcellus shale gas are likely to decline based on property values near production wells and infrastructure. IND173-5 Comment noted. As discussed in section 4.9.1 of the EIS, Algonquin anticipates that about 15 to 76 percent of the construction workers would be local hires, depending on the type of activity (i.e., HDD crossings). IND173 – Jannette Barth (cont’d) IND173 – Jannette Barth (cont’d) IND173 – Jannette Barth (cont’d) IND173 – Jannette Barth (cont’d) IND173-6  Comment noted. See the response to comment CO7-5.  IND173-7  Comment noted. The purpose and need for the Project is discussed in  section 1.1 of the EIS. It is beyond the scope of this EIS to assess the  potential change in the future price of natural gas due to changing demand  and potential exports, and the exact future price of natural gas to the  consumer is unknown. However, it should also be noted that the future  consumer price of energy derived from wind, water, and sunlight and other  renewable energies is also unknown.  See also the response to comment  FL2-2.  IND173-8  See the response to comment CO7-3. We also note that since entering the pre-filing process, the AIM Project has incorporated numerous additional mitigation measures and adopted alternate routes/variations and construction methods to accommodate the concerns of the public and agencies.  IND173-9  We disagree that the EIS does not adequately address the impacts associated with the Project.

While the gas transported by the Project is destined for New England markets (including Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts) rather than New York, there would be some local benefits from ad valorem taxes and construction-related spending, as discussed in section 4.9.9 of the EIS.  IND179 – Tomislav Djurdjevich IND179-1 See the responses to comments FA4-25, SA4-2, SA7-4, and CO7-6. While the IPEC is along the flight route of American Airlines flight no. 11, it was not the intended target of this attack (nor did any of the flights hijacked during the 9/11 attack target nuclear facilities).  This further supports the EIS conclusion that the likelihood of future acts of terrorism along any of the AIM Project facilities is unpredictable and does not diminish the need for natural gas infrastructure. IND180 – Laura Szandyba IND180-1 See the response to comment FA4-24. IND180-2 See the response to comment FA3-5.

As described in that section, Algonquin was granted a 50-foot-wide permeant easement by the Loyola Seminary in 1952, prior to the acquisition of the property by the town of Yorktown in 1981, when the property was turned into parkland. Algonquin’s easement was not negated by the acquisition of the property by the town. Algonquin would install the new pipeline and launcher/receiver facility within the existing permanent easement and no new permanent rightof-way would be acquired. However, construction would require the clearing of a strip of mostly upland forest between 30 to 40 feet wide on the north side of the existing right-of-way. Some additional tree clearing would be required for a roughly 350 feet by 85 feet extra workspace on the west side of Stony Street and for nine ATWSs, roughly 100 feet by 35 feet, throughout the parks. The installation of the launcher/receiver facility on the west side of Stony Street would also introduce a new, low profile visual impact in a viewshed otherwise unaffected by aboveground ground structures. The launcher/receiver facility may be visible to passing motorist and pedestrians on or adjacent to Stony Street but would not have a significant impact on the overall visual character of the parks.  IND182 – Mark Michaels (cont’d) IND182-7 See the response to comment FA4-1. IND183 – Jennifer Klein IND183-1  Comment noted.

We also note that each of the shipper's precedent agreement has been approved or considered in a hearing by the applicable shipper's state regulatory authority. IND193 – Susan Van Dolsen (cont’d) IND193-15  Regulatory requirements for utility companies vis a vis contracting for  transportation services are determined by the state public utilities  commission or similar regulatory authority at the state level, not by the  FERC. As indicated in section 1.1 of the EIS, Algonquin has executed  precedent agreements with 10 shippers, including 8 local distribution  companies and two municipal utilities, for firm transportation service to  deliver new natural gas supplies to the Northeast region.  IND193-16  Your comment about alleged market manipulation of electricity associated  with constraints on the Northeast's power grid are noted but beyond the  scope of the EIS, which addresses the environmental impact of a natural gas  project.  IND193 – Susan Van Dolsen (cont’d) IND193-17 We disagree. As indicates in section 1.1 of the EIS, Algonquin has executed precedent agreements for firm transportation service to 10 shippers.

Further, section 4.12.1 of the EIS identifies that some states may also act as PHMSA’s agent to inspect interstate facilities within its boundaries; however, PHMSA is responsible for enforcement actions. For the AIM Project, New York and Connecticut are interstate agents that have been delegated authority to inspect interstate natural gas pipeline facilities. IND194 – David Brunetti (cont’d) IND194-5  We disagree with the commentor's characterization of compressor station  emissions. FERC staff performed a thorough evaluation of each compressor  station and section 4.11.1.3 of the EIS presents the existing emissions at each  compressor station, the proposed increases and decreases in emissions, and  the resulting final compressor station emissions. Section 4.11.1 of the EIS  also clearly states that the modifications at the Oxford Compressor Station in  Connecticut would involve the restaging of one existing compressor unit.  This work would not result in impacts on air quality or noise.

The customers for the AIM Project chose Algonquin to provide the requested volumes. This does not mean that the natural gas would necessarily flow exclusively on Algonquin's system from the supply areas. In addition, our analysis indicates that none of the existing systems (Algonquin's or otherwise) are adequate either singly or in combination to provide the requested volume, hence new facilities would be required. Our review of the other companies that could provide comparable service either singly or in combination (i.e., partnership) indicates that these alternatives would result in greater environmental impacts than the AIM Project, and thus would not be environmentally preferable. IND197 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND197-2 See the responses to comments FA3-5, FA4-24, and LA23-16. IND197-3 See the response to comment IND197-1. IND197 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND197-4 See the responses to comments FA4-1, SA1-12, and SA2-10. IND197 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND198 – Bernard Vaughey IND198-1 See the response to comment SA7-4. IND198-2 See the responses to comments FA4-25 and SA7-4.

Utilizing the HDD method avoids disturbance to river-bottom sediments, as all subsurface materials removed along the drill path during the drilling process is removed from the borehole and contained within temporary lined mud pits. Contamination is not expected to be encountered during HDD activities; however, due to the historic presence of PCBs in the area, we are recommending that all subsurface materials recovered from the Hudson River HDD process be appropriately sampled for PCBs prior to disposal of the material (see section 4.2.2.6 of the EIS, which has been revised). IND201 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND201 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND201 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND201-2 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, SA1-12, and SA2-10. IND201 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND202 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND203 – Rebecca Shamson IND202-1  Transportation and traffic-related impacts associated with the construction of  the New York pipeline segments, including traffic management strategies,  are described in section 4.9.5.1 and appendix G of the EIS.

Section 2.3.1.2 of the EIS describes  the construction methodology for road crossings. The Route 9A crossing in  Buchanan is one of the crossings listed in the Traffic Management Plan for  the New York Pipeline Segments as needing further site-specific details.  Therefore, we have recommended that Algonquin file a revised traffic  management plan prior to construction that includes the site-specific details  for this crossing. The EIS also includes recommendation number 1 (section  5.2) to the Commission requiring Algonquin to follow the commitments  made in its application and supplements. With the exception of portions of  the Project along the West Roxbury Lateral where nighttime construction is  proposed to minimize traffic-related impacts, most construction would occur  during daytime hours. Section 1.3 of the EIS identifies all of the federal,  state, and local permits or consultations for the Project. Section 4.11.3 of the  EIS identifies the noise regulations and compliance with these regulations.  While we encourage the applicant to obtain and comply with state and local  permits/regulations, if the project is approved by the Commission, these  permits/regulations cannot unreasonably delay construction of the Project.  As discussed in section 4.8.3.1 of the EIS, access to homes and businesses  would be maintained at all times during construction. Traffic control signage  would be installed in accordance with the Traffic Management Plan for the  New York Pipeline Segments and applicable state and local requirements.  See also the responses to comments FA4-1, SA1-12, SA2-10, and IND202-1.  IND203-1  See the responses to comments CO15-4 and IND102-3.  IND203-2  See the response to comment FL4-11.  IND203-3  Comment noted.  IND204 – Paul Blanch IND204-1 We assume that the commentor has incorrectly referenced the Minimum Filing Requirements for Environmental Reports Under the Natural Gas Act in 18 CFR Part 380.

As explained in section 4.7.2 of the EIS, Algonquin has planned the Project to minimize tree clearing, impacts on migratory birds and wildlife, and other sensitive resources by using their existing rights-ofway to the maximum extent possible. See also the responses to comments FA4-26, SA11-14, and CO22-12.  IND215-3  Section 1.1 of the EIS states that the purpose of the Project is to increase capacity. Algonquin would accomplish this in New York by replacing a segment of the existing 26-inch-diameter pipeline with a larger, 42-inchdiameter pipeline.  IND215-4  This Project has been evaluated as a new pipeline. The existing 26-inchdiameter pipeline does not "need" replacement for safety purposes. Algonquin proposes to replace a segment of this pipeline because the existing pipeline cannot accommodate the additional capacity. See also the responses to comments FA4-25 and IND215-3.  IND215-5  As discussed in section 4.7 of the EIS, Algonquin has consulted with the FWS and NOAA Fisheries for federally listed species under their jurisdiction, as well as the appropriate state agencies for state listed species and other sensitive resources under their respective jurisdictions.

Impacts would be temporary due to planned restoration and revegetation efforts.  IND218-3  See the responses to comments FA4-25 and SA1-9.  IND218-4  The FERC's assessment of alternatives evaluates the potential impacts and benefits of a number of different alternatives. However, as described in section 3.0 of the EIS, not all conceivable alternatives are technically feasible or practical. Some may be incapable of being implemented due to limits on existing technologies, constraints of system capacities, or logistical considerations, while others may be impractical because sites are unavailable or cannot be developed for the proposed use. Other alternatives may not be able to meet the objectives of the Project. The Project timeline is part of the objectives of the Project because shippers have requested additional capacity by a specified date.

If the AIM Project is denied, the shippers would not receive the gas and their need for the proposed volumes would not be met. The shippers existing need for natural gas would need to be met by other means. Two potential options would be for the shippers to contract with either Tennessee Gas Pipeline or Iroquois Gas Transmission for the proposed volumes. Our evaluation of these alternatives in section 3.3.1 of the EIS concluded that the expansion necessary for either Tennessee Gas Pipeline or Iroquois Gas Transmission to deliver the gas to the locations required by the Project shippers would result in much greater environmental impact than the AIM Project, and therefore we do not consider use of either the Tennessee Gas Pipeline or Iroquois Gas Transmission systems to be reasonable alternatives. IND222-2 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, SA1-12, and SA2-10. IND222 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND223 – Bernard Vaughey IND223-1 Section 4.12 of the EIS discusses federal safety standards for natural gas pipelines, incident rates, and the impact on the public.

The EIS is a summary document of the studies and information reviewed for the Project. Algonquin submitted a revised HDD noise analysis for the Hudson River crossing, which is available for review on the FERC website (www.ferc.gov). FERC staff reviewed this analysis and believes that it adequately characterizes the 24hour per day HDD activities proposed for this crossing. The EIS states that HDD operations would occur 24-hours per day. Applicable federal, state, and local noise regulations are identified in section 4.11.2.2 of the EIS. IND225 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND225 – Bernard Vaughey (cont’d) IND225-2 See the responses to comments FA4-1, FA6-5, SA1-12, and SA2-10. IND226 – Jennifer Lahey IND226-1  Comment noted.  IND226-2  See the responses to comments SA4-9, LA19-3, and CO12-10.  IND226-3  The commentor inappropriately includes natural gas distribution pipeline mileage data. The proposed Project is a natural gas transmission project. Table 4.12.3-2 of the EIS presents natural gas transmission pipeline incident data based on required reporting to PHMSA. Further, the EIS states that the majority of fatalities from pipelines are due to local distribution pipelines not regulated by FERC, because the pipelines are generally smaller diameter pipes and/or plastic pipes that are more susceptible to damage and often do not have large rights-of-way with pipeline markers.

Economic impacts associated with the Project, including selected demographic and socioeconomic conditions for the communities that would be affected by the proposed Project are discussed in section 4.9.1 of the EIS.  IND230-4  The need to replace aging pipelines is determined by Algonquin's pipeline integrity program, which is subject to federal regulations and discussed in section 4.12.1 of the EIS. Within such programs, the condition of the pipe is regularly monitored. Pipe replacements can also be driven by class location changes, for instance, when the number of dwellings in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline increases above certain thresholds after the line is put into service. As a result, the exact timing of when pipe replacements may be necessary is difficult to predict.

Hydrostatic test water would be discharged into well vegetated, stabilized areas and situated and designed in a way to prevent sedimentation in water resources or degradation of water quality. There are currently four hydrostatic test fill/dewatering locations proposed along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment of the Project; however, the exact number of dewatering structures and amount of volume expected to be discharged at each site is not known at this time. More specific information (including site-specific drawings) would be included in the final SWPPP. The flow of 1,000 to 1,200 gallons per minute is how quickly the water would go into the dewatering structure and would appear similar to filling a small swimming pool. Water would leave the dewatering structure at a much slower rate.

Sections 4.5 through 4.7 of the EIS discuss the impacts on vegetation, wildlife, and threatened and endangered species, respectively. See also the response to comment FA4-23.  IND233-3  As stated in section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS, no new permanent easement would be required within Blue Mountain Reservation; therefore, there would be no permanent impacts on the reservation or its recreational use for horseback riding. Section 4.8.5.1 of the EIS has been updated to indicate that horseback riding is one of the recreational uses of the reservation. Horseback riders may experience short-term noise and visual impacts during construction within the reservation.  IND233-4  See the response to comment FL8-12.  IND233-5  See the response to comment FL8-12.  IND233-6  See the response to comment FA4-26. Clearing would be prohibited during the migratory bird nesting season (April 15 to August 1) to avoid and minimize impacts on nesting/breeding. Short term impacts may occur to individual foraging/food sources but would not be expected to impact populations of species due to adequate food sources and foraging habitat outside of the construction area.  IND233-7  The 0.5 mile distance is taken from the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines issued by the FWS in 2007, and is the disturbance buffer for explosives/blasting. To develop these guidelines the FWS relied on existing state and regional bald eagle guidelines, scientific literature on bald eagle disturbance, and recommendations of state and Federal biologists who monitor the impacts of human activity on eagles.  IND233 – Theresa Kardos (cont’d) IND233-8 Section 4.6.2.3 of the EIS describes general impacts and measures that would be implemented to minimize impacts on aquatic resources in the Project area. See also the response to comment IND159-24. IND233-9 As discussed in section 4.7.1 of the EIS with regards to the federally protected Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon, Algonquin selected the HDD method to avoid in water work in the Hudson River, thus minimizing impacts on aquatic organisms in the Hudson River, including benthic organisms. Based on implementation of the HDD method for crossing the Hudson River with the associated Best Drilling Practices Plan and existing turbidity levels in the Hudson, impacts on benthic organisms would not be significant. IND233-10 See the responses to comments SA1-7, SA4-1, SA4-3, SA4-9, SA4-11, SA11-4, CO12-10, CO16-9, and IND85-57. IND233-11 See the response to comment FA4-23 for additional information regarding Algonquin's methane emission minimization efforts.

See the maps in appendix B of the EIS (page 3 of 5 of the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay segment).  IND233-17  As discussed in section 4.9.1 of the EIS, workforce numbers during construction would range from a low of 10 workers to a peak of 2,693 across all Project components. See also the responses to comments LA1-10, LA1-4, and LA1-9.  IND233-18  See the response to comment CO7-5.  IND233 – Theresa Kardos (cont’d) IND233-19 See the response to comment IND138-4. Also, section 4.12.1 of the EIS states that Algonquin would patrol its pipeline right-of-way on a routine basis. PHMSA's regulations require that the patrolling and leakage surveys be performed at least two times a year in Class 3 areas, four times a year in Class 4 areas, and four times a year at highway and railroad crossings. The potential cumulative effects of the proposed facilities along with other existing, planned, or proposed projects are evaluated in section 4.13 of the EIS. IND234 – Eileen Tresler IND234-1 See the response to comment FA6-5.

The analysis identifies and describes cumulative impacts that would potentially result from implementation of the AIM Project. Projects by Algonquin or other natural gas transmission companies are discussed; however, many have been determined to be outside of the same region of influence as the AIM Project and would not result in cumulative impacts. See also the responses to comments FA3-5 and FA4-24.  IND236-3  Section 1.1 of the EIS discusses the purpose and need for the Project. We are responsible for reviewing all projects that submit applications. See the response to comment SA2-2.  IND236-4  The gas shipped on the AIM Project facilities would be serving demands from local utilities, among other entities, whose role it is to assess natural gas needs in their respective service areas. Whether the gas transportation contracts result in cost savings for individual shippers, and how any such savings are allocated or passed on to consumers, is more appropriately addressed through the state public utilities commission or applicable agency with jurisdiction over the local distribution agency. Economic benefits of the Project, including tax revenues generated from operation of the Project are discussed in section 4.9.9 of the EIS.  IND236-5  We evaluated one alternative to the proposed West Roxbury M&R Station (see section 3.6.2.3 of the EIS) but did not identify any other viable alternative M&R sites. We determined that this alternative site was not environmentally preferable to the proposed site. We evaluated safety concerns associated with the proximity of the proposed M&R station to the quarry (see section 4.1.4 of the EIS) and did not identify any significant safety concerns associated with the construction or operation of the M&R station near the quarry at this location.

It would not change the availability of land or change the current use of the overall compressor station site.  IND248-2  See the responses to comments FA1-1, FA4-1, and FA6-5. Section 1.4 of the EIS also identifies the open house meetings sponsored by Algonquin, which FERC staff attended to collect scoping comments and introduce the FERC process. These meetings included two meetings in Rhode Island in August and September 2013. The Notice of Intent, issued on September 13, 2013 for the Project that announced the scoping process included the affected landowners and federal, state, and local agencies in Rhode Island.  IND248-3  See the responses to comments FA3-3 and LA23-24.  IND248-4  Economic impacts associated with the Project, including projected workforce numbers and economic benefits are discussed in sections 4.9.1 and 4.9.9 of the EIS, respectively. See also the response to comment IND233-17.  IND248 – Dana Goodman (cont’d) IND248-5 Section 4.11.1.2 of the EIS identifies the facilities that are currently subject to BACT under the PSD air permitting program, and those facilities that would require a modification or new permit under this program. We note that BACT under the air permitting program is not an analysis of the lowest emissions achievable. Section 3.4.6 of the EIS provides the detailed discussion (i.e. not the summarized conclusion of the Executive Summary) of the zero emission option of electric driven units. This option would result in additional impacts on other resources and is not considered further. Natural gas is considered a cleaner option for operating the compressor stations over other fuel options (e.g. diesel and fuel oil). IND248-6 Comment noted.  See the response to comment FA3-4 for information on invasive species management. IND248-7 The exact chemical make-up differs depending on which type of epoxy coating is selected for the pipeline. This coating is bonded to the pipe (typically heat or fusion bonded). This bonding would occur at the pipeline coating mill.  To prepare an epoxy coating, the external surface of the pipe is thoroughly cleaned, the pipe is heated to a prescribed temperature, and the epoxy powder is applied. The powder fuses with the heated pipe and forms a water-tight barrier. Once the epoxy coating is applied, it becomes part of the pipe. The pipeline would have to be heated to the extreme temperature used to apply the coating for the coating to un-fuse from the pipe and potentially contaminate soil and groundwater. These coatings are an industry norm and have safely been used for years. IND248 – Dana Goodman (cont’d) IND248-8 As described in section 1.4 of the EIS, the FERC also conducted considerable outreach and required the same of Algonquin to notify and inform the public about the Project and its potential affects and solicit comments regarding the scope of its analysis.  Pursuant to its responsibilities under NEPA, the FERC also evaluated a number of alternatives including the no-action alternative, energy conservation, renewable energy, and other alternatives (see sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 of the EIS).  See also the response to comment CO7-5. IND248-9 Comment noted. The text of the EIS has been revised to acknowledge that it may be possible to construct solar arrays on existing infrastructure such as buildings that would preclude the need for new permanent land impacts. IND248 – Dana Goodman (cont’d) IND248-10  A corridor database search is not necessary in Rhode Island because  Algonquin already owns the property on which the existing Burrillville  Compressor Station is located, and this is the only location in Rhode Island  where work would occur associated with the Project (i.e., a corridor database  search would not identify any sites not already known to Algonquin). In  order to identify any known contamination at the Burrillville Compressor  Station site, we conducted a search of the Rhode Island Department of  Environmental Management Office of Waste Management's site inventories,  the EPA's Cleanups in My Community database, and the EPA's EnviroFacts  database. Based on these sources, no known contaminated soil or  groundwater is present at the Burrillville Compressor Station site. Section  4.2.1.5 of the EIS has been revised to reflect this information.  IND248-11  See the response to comment IND248-10.  IND248-12  The purpose and need for the Project is discussed in section 1.1 of the EIS.  The focus of the EIS is to evaluate the environmental impacts of the  proposal. The Commission will take into account the evaluation in the EIS,  along with non-environmental information, to determine whether to issue a  Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. Significant efforts have  been made to notify those affected by the Project. See also the response to  comment FA6-5.  IND248 – Dana Goodman (cont’d) IND248-13 The purpose of the EIS is to identify the impacts of the proposed Project. Conclusions that some impacts are less than significant or negligible are justified throughout the EIS. IND249 – Pramilla Malick IND249-1 The Project does not include any modifications to facilities or operational capacity through the Millennium Pipeline or Minisink Compressor Station. IND250 – Pramilla Malick IND250-1 See the responses to comments FA4-25 and SA7-4.

While the possibility of human error exists in most human undertakings, we do not agree that human error in itself represents an impact; we believe human error is accounted for in the development of pipeline safety regulations and practices to incorporate conservative margins of safety. Natural gas transmission lines and railroads cross one another throughout the country, and the crossings are designed to ensure mutual compatibility and safety. We do not consider pipeline crossings of railroads to have an impact on public safety.  IND256-2  Comment noted. As explained in section 4.7.2 of the EIS, Algonquin has planned the Project to minimize tree clearing, impacts on migratory birds and wildlife, and other sensitive resources by using their existing rights-ofway to the maximum extent possible.  IND256-3  See the response to comment CO7-6.  IND256-4  See the responses to comments LA1-4, LA1-9, and LA8-2.  IND256-5  See the responses to comments SA1-8 and SA4-5.  IND256-6  See the response to comment SA4-4.  IND256-7  Comment noted.

See the responses to comments FA6-5 and SA4-5.  IND332-4  Table 4.12.3.1 of the EIS provides the PIR along the proposed pipeline facilities. The PIR formula is accepted by the PHMSA as an accurate and valid model for determining the distance beyond which a person standing outside in the vicinity of a pipeline rupture and fire would have a 99 percent chance of surviving. The number of residents and homes that would be affected in the event of a pipeline rupture depends upon the location of the rupture and numerous other factors such as whether an individual is sheltered or outside, topography, other structures or landscape features between the individual and the site of the rupture. The PIR along the West Roxbury Lateral is 302.3 feet, as shown in table 4.12.3.1 of the EIS. As discussed in section 4.12.1 of the EIS, PHMSA is responsible for pipeline safety; FERC does not have a "service level objective." The MAOP for the facilities are provided in section 2.1 of the EIS. Pressure relief valves are set to prevent MAOPs from being exceeded.  Air emissions from the West Roxbury M&R Station are provided in table 4.11.1-2 of the EIS. We do not agree that providing a list of M&R stations near quarries is a meaningful way to identify safety impacts.

We have instead focused on site-specific, engineering-oriented analysis, as described in the response to comment FA6-1.  IND340-2  Meter stations and natural gas pipeline infrastructure are commonly located in residential and/or urban areas to provide an interconnection with local distribution companies who deliver the gas to users. See also the responses to comments FA6-1, SA4-5, and IND340-1.  IND340-3  See the response to comment SA4-10.  IND340-4  No, the West Roxbury M&R Station would be an aboveground facility, not an underground, vaulted facility.  IND340-5  The M&R station would be constructed to all applicable regulations and in accordance with a SWPPP.  IND340-6  We are not aware from whom Algonquin purchased the site of the proposed M&R Station, but that information does not appear relevant to our impact analysis. See the response to comment FA6-1.  IND340-7  See the response to comment FA6-1.  IND340-8  A pipeline rupture is a serious event no matter what the cause. Our analysis concludes that blasting at the quarry would not jeopardize the pipeline system's integrity.  See the response to comment FA6-1. Section 4.12.1 of the EIS discusses federal safety standards for natural gas pipelines and how these standards are applied in HCAs. Section 4.12.3 of the EIS discusses safety-related concerns and other specific measures that Algonquin has proposed or that we are recommending to further address public safety concerns.  IND340-9  Section 4.8.7.2 of the EIS has been updated to recommend that Algonquin provide a site-specific landscaping plan to minimize visual impacts at the West Roxbury M&R Station. This plan would depict the specific location of the proposed facility within the property. See also the response to comment SA13-13.  IND340-10  Yes, FERC staff conducted a site visit of the area in August 2013.

Section 4.12 of the EIS describes the safety measures that would be implemented, including depth of burial, for the pipeline. Section 4.8.6.2 of the EIS discusses the process by which Algonquin proposes to remove and dispose of potentially contaminated piping or equipment in New York and Connecticut. However, we note that Algonquin does not own or operate any existing pipelines along the West Roxbury Lateral.  The West Roxbury Lateral is a new pipeline that would not replace any existing infrastructure. Comment noted. The majority of the West Roxbury Lateral would be located within streets, avoiding impacts on most residential property and septic systems. All other utilities in the vicinity of where the Project facilities would be installed would be identified before construction. Section 2.3.1.2 of the EIS discussing construction methods near existing utilities. We are not sure we understand this comment. If the comment refers to placing the pipe across ledges of rock, excavation of the trench would ensure that the pipe is laid in a flattened trench bottom. See the response to comment SA4-4. See the response to comment LA1-10. All stakeholders have had the opportunity to participate in the review process. See also the response to comment SA4-5. See the responses to comments LA1-4, LA1-9, and LA1-10. Urban environments are characterized by a low diversity of wildlife species that are tolerant of human development and activity.  Impacts on protected species would be coordinated with the FWS and state and local jurisdictional agencies, as required. Comment noted. Potential impacts and mitigation measures to minimize impacts on wetlands (including vernal pools) are discussed in section 4.4.3 of the EIS. Algonquin completed a cultural resources survey of the Project, which was reviewed by a number of State Historic Preservation Officers, including the Massachusetts Historical Commission (see section 4.10.2.4 of the EIS).  The FERC consulted with federally-recognized Indian tribes to identify concerns and areas of traditional religious or cultural significance within the project area (see section 4.10.1.3 of the EIS). Surficial geology crossed by the Project is discussed in section 4.1.2 and the bedrock geology in section 4.1.3 of the EIS. IND340 – Joanne Tisei (cont’d) IND340-26 Comment noted. IND341 – Judy Jose-Roddy IND342 – Ruifeng Li IND343 – Linda Denekamp IND341-1  Comment noted.

Section 3.2.1 of the EIS discusses energy conservation as an alternative to the proposed Project. Impacts on groundwater and geology are discussed in sections 4.3.1 and 4.1 of the EIS, respectively. There are no identified impacts from the Project related to toxic chemical poisoning.  PM1 – Public Meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts (cont’d) PM1-7 FERC regulates the transmission of interstate natural gas. FERC has no jurisdiction over the local distribution system, so we cannot comment on gas service to Dedham. PM1 – Public Meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts (cont’d) PM1-8  The town of Dedham is free to conduct its own study. We believe the EIS fairly and accurately assesses the impacts on the communities within which the Project lies.  PM1-9  See the response to comment FA6-5.  PM1-10  The impacts of the West Roxbury Lateral by itself are readily ascertained within the EIS. We have not studied the AIM Project without the West Roxbury Lateral, as Algonquin's application included it, and Algonquin's demonstration of the need for this component of the Project meets our criteria for consideration in the EIS.  PM1 – Public Meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts (cont’d) PM1-11 The PIR is provided for all segments of the pipeline in table 4.12.3-1 of the EIS. Identifying the total numbers of dwellings or structures within the PIR would present an inaccurate characterization of the risks involved with a natural gas pipeline in a residential setting. In a hypothetical pipeline rupture, only the dwellings and/or individuals within a single PIR emanating from the site of the rupture would potentially be exposed, not every dwelling/individual within every PIR along the entire pipeline segment. Presenting the total number of structures that fall within the PIR along the West Roxbury Lateral would not be a meaningful illustration of the risk to the public, and in fact, would mischaracterize the risk to the public. Further, the number of homes within the PIR does not accurately reflect the consideration of the probabilistic level of risks to the public. In contrast, all the residents within 50 (or in some cases 100) feet of the pipeline are expected to be affected by construction in some form or another, so presenting these numbers in the aggregate does in fact provide a meaningful way to characterize these impacts. PM1 – Public Meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts (cont’d) PM1 – Public Meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts (cont’d) PM1-12 See the response to comment CO7-6. PM1-13 See the response to comment LA24-3. PM1 – Public Meeting in Dedham, Massachusetts (cont’d) PM1-14 We agree that all natural gas pipelines involve some degree of public safety risk, as do gas distribution systems, highways, rail transport, power generation and transmission, and so forth. As discussed in section 4.12 of the EIS, natural gas pipeline safety is regulated by stringent safety rules, and natural gas pipelines continue to be a safe, reliable means of energy transportation.

Also, as section 1.1 of the EIS explains, even if precedent agreements were not in place for the entire proposed capacity, to be exported, the process of liquefying the gas involves specialized equipment at a specific export facility. Currently, no existing export facilities or infrastructure exists on the east coast. In addition, the development of any potential nearby export facility would take several years to develop, advance through the regulatory process, and be constructed.

Information on shallow-to-bedrock soils and bedrock outcroppings is taken from the local published soil maps (and unpublished maps in progress) as acquired from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (“NRCS”). General bedrock type is also discussed. A map depicting the location of the AIM Project pipeline route is provided in Figure 1.1-1. Information on the characteristics of the bedrock may be evaluated at least in a general sense, and applied towards an appropriate bedrock excavation method. The bedrock properties were developed using historical and observational data; Algonquin will continue this approach while assessing the pipeline route. The hard and intact nature of the unweathered igneous bedrock (basalts and granites) and metamorphic bedrock (slates, phyllites, schists and quartzites) dictate what removal methods will be utilized. Soft bedrock, such as sedimentary or weathered igneous and metamorphic rock, may possibly be removed by ripping. Other geologic features may also control the effects of removal. Rock fabric, or the arrangements of minerals, determines intrinsic rock strength, and thus influences rock excavation. Joint spacing, bedding, and foliation also influence rock excavation. Lithologic generalizations of the AIM Project area rock type include:  granitic rock is invariably resistant, except where weathered;  granulitic (high temperature-high pressure metamorphic rock with gniessic texture) and migmatitic (cooled rock having reached the boundary between metamorphism and magmatism) rock are also equally resistant;  ultramafic (rich ferromagnesium) rocks are highly fractured and almost always require blasting. Other metamorphic rock along the geothermal gradient may have a wide range of susceptibility to blasting or ripping. It is the most difficult to predict of the hard rocks. Degrees of intensity of metamorphism can be further deduced from the minerals that schists contain; and  weathered orthinly bedded sedimentary rock is generally amenable to ripping. These generalizations have been further grouped into two bedrock contact types: Lithic contact and Paralithic contact. The material below a lithic contact is either strongly cemented or the material is indurated and cannot be removed by conventional machinery. The materials below the Paralithic contact are partially weathered bedrock or weakly consolidated bedrock, such as sandstone, siltstone, or shale and is generally considered rippable by machinery.

Resource Report 6 providesadditional information on geology. Project facilities located in New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island are within the New England Upland section of the New England province. This section is often described as a complex sequence of terrains, which are the result of land masses accreted to North America during the formation of Pangea and continental rifting during Pangea’s separation. This resulted in mountainous areas with adjacent ranges having varied and distinct lithologies. These mountains were eroded and are now represented by the Ramapo Mountains in New York and the Bolton Range and Mohegan Range in Connecticut. Project facilities in Massachusetts are located in the Coastal Lowland section of the New England province. The section was largely inundated by ocean water as the Laurentian ice sheet receded at the close of the Wisconsin glaciation. Erosion by wave action lowered the relief of these areas so that, once the land rebounded, the coastal areas had lower reliefthan areas furtherinland.  3.2 Topography The pipeline route from Haverstraw to Stony Point traverses gentle slopes, hills of moderate relief (<200 feet), and slopes that are moderate. From Algonquin’s existing Stony Point Compressor Station, the pipeline traverses moderate to steep relief and ascends and descends the moderate to steep slopes of Buckberg Mountain (approximately 450 feet of relief). It descends to the western shore of the Hudson River, comes ashore on the east bank of the Hudson River and continues along gentle to moderate slopes. In Connecticut, the pipeline segment traverses rolling hills with steep, moderate, and gentle slopes including a series of drumlins. In Massachusetts, the West Roxbury Lateral traverses gently sloping land along existing roadways. There is no pipeline proposed in Rhode Island. 3.3 Surficial Geology Surficial geology of the AIM Project area is dominated by glacial till with discontinuous bedrock outcroppings, sand and gravel deposits, and fine grained deposits consisting of lacustrine and swamp sediments. Quaternary deposits can be broken out into three general categories, based on their depositional environment: deposits laid down by advancing ice sheets (moraines and most tills); glacial melt deposits (stratified deposits from glacial streams and lakes); and postglacial deposits (alluvium in existing floodplains and swamp deposits). Quaternary geologic materials may be categorized by their depositional environment (e.g., swamp), grain size (e.g., sand and gravel), formation type (e.g., moraine), or a combination of these (e.g., lacustrine sand). The NRCS data collected for Resource Report 7 reveals that all soils with shallow-to-bedrock and bedrock outcroppings that are found within the AIM Project are glacial tills. See the table in Appendix A which lists the surficial geology associated with areas with shallow-to-bedrock and bedrock outcroppings by MP. Rock Removal Plan E-4 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 3.4 Subsurface Geology Bedrock geology of the AIM Project area is dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks with carbonate rock in limited areas. These rocks are characterized as having a lithic contact and will mostly require blasting for removal. A review of bedrock geology maps provided information regarding the nature of units expected in the Project area.

With regards to rock removal, there are areas identified along the AIM Project that are prone to introduction of rocks into topsoil during excavation and backfilling. Other issues of potential soil hazards include areas along the pipeline route that are prone to severe erosion, are designated as prime farmland, hydric, prone to compaction, and soils with poor or very poor revegetation potential. These soilhazards are further discussed in Section 7.3 of Resource Report 7. Soils with shallow-to-bedrock soils and bedrock outcroppings are shown by pipeline segment and MP in Appendix A.  Soil descriptions of each soiltype can be crossreferenced by the Soil Map Unit in Resource Report 7. Rock Removal Plan E-8 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 4.0 ROCK REMOVAL CONSIDERATIONS This Rock Removal Plan will be utilized for each site when solid rock is encountered as part of the pipeline trench excavation, the grading to prepare a level linear work area, or the excavation for above ground facilities. Refer to the table in Appendix A which identifies areas of the pipeline route where bedrock is expected within sixty inches of natural grade by MP. Construction within these areas may encounter solid rock while excavating or grading. If rock is encountered, the experienced contractor will analyze the rock type and hardness, and consider all other contributing factors – such as location, surrounding environment, nearby facilities, residences, and/or resources. The procedures outlined in the Rock Removal Plan will then be utilized to determine a suitable rock removal procedure, subject to Algonquin approval. Should rock be encountered during grading or trench excavation, the contractor will assess the rock properties and attempt to remove rock using simple mechanical processes, such as a bull dozer mounted rock ripping attachment, or rock teeth on an excavatorbucket.  If alternative methods are considered, such as an excavator mounted hydraulic breaker, line drilling and ripping, or drilling and blasting, approval fromAlgonquin will be required. For rock removal adjacent to other utilities, information will be gathered on the depth oftrench, proximity to the existing utility, the type of rock, and other factors. Following an evaluation by Algonquin, the contractor will be notified of all approved rock removal methods for the site that adhere to Algonquin specifications. The contractor will then assess proximity to structures, resources, facilities, and residences. Federal, state, and local regulations will be consulted to determine acceptable removal methods within the area. If blasting is allowed, all necessary steps will be taken to protect existing conditions -such as pre/post blast surveys at residences and structures, water well testing as applicable, and utilization of blastingmats. The contractor will make a reasonable effort to first mechanically remove the rock in congested or densely residential areas. If the mechanical methods of removal fail to properly fragment the rock, then blasting will be used (where allowed by Algonquin and applicable regulations). For all other areas, the contractor will ultimately select the rock removal method from the methods approved by Algonquin and applicable regulations. The decision will be based upon the factors listed above, as well as others. These additional factors are inclusive of, but are not limited to: volume of rock to be removed, availability of equipment and personnel, and site specific considerations. If blasting is selected, then site-specific detailed blasting plans will be developed for each site to meet Algonquin’s specifications and standard practices. Rock Removal Plan E-9 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 5.0 ROCK REMOVAL METHODS There are severalpossiblemethods to remove rock from within an excavation.  Each methodisbest suited forspecific situations due to individual advantages and limitations.  As per Algonquin specifications, all forms of mechanical rock removal will occur between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. (unless otherwise specified by Algonquin or restricted by permit). Additionally, a fragmentation rate of at least 75 percent oftrench rock to less than 6 inches in diameter is required.  Provided belowis a general overview of each method.  5.1 Excavation During normal trenchingactivities, the contractor willbe using excavators to remove soil from the path of the pipeline. If the excavator encounters small to medium boulders, then it may be possible for the machine to remove the rock. However, it is expected that the excavator may encounter bedrock while trenching. The contractor may be able to “rip” the bedrock using rock teeth on an excavator bucket excavator or a rippingattachment on a bull dozer.  When ripping of the rock is not practical or possible, other means of rock fragmentation are necessary as described below. 5.2 Hammering Hammering is the use of any tool that fragments rock using a percussion hammer. Two common pieces of construction equipment used in hammering are hand held jack-hammers and hydraulic breakers attached to excavators (referred to as a “hammer hoe”). Hand held jack-hammers can be useful for fragmenting pavement, concrete, or rock. However, they are only practical for small amounts of rock removal because the process is labor intensive and has limited percussive strength. Hydraulic breakers are more useful in fragmenting rock due to the increased size, efficiency, and power. Rock removal progress for hydraulic breakers is generally slow for large amounts of rock.  Hammer hoe or jack-hammer operations require planning and execution of applicable precautionary measures. Initially, all adjacent utilities must be verified and protected, including Algonquin pipelines and facilities. Fortunately, the rock immediately adjacent to existing utilities would have already been removed during their installation. Proper Personal Protective Equipment (“PPE”) including hearing protection, breathing protection, and eye protection in conjunction with standard PPE will be required. Hand signals or other alternative plans/methods must be used to mitigate complications with heightened noise and dust levels. 5.3 Drilling Drilling will be integral to achieving proper bedrock fragmentation. Two main types of rock drills may be used during construction. The primary rock drilling equipment will be an excavator mounted drill. The second possible piece of equipment is a crawler drill, which is a mobile rock drill. These machines use a rotating drill bit as well as a percussive force to create a cylindrical hole within the bedrock. The fragmented rock is then flushed out of the hole by an air compressor within the drill.  Rock Removal Plan E-10 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT These drilling machines are integral in creating a hole within rock for blasting, as they are both quick and efficient. However, the drilling machines can also drill a formation of holes to weaken the rock. When the rock is properly drilled,hammering or ripping maythen be attempted to fragmentthe rock.  While this approach is typically the most successful form of mechanical removal, the approach still has several limitations. It increases the number and variety of equipment running at the job site to maximize the progress from this method. Production is much slower than if blasting was used. As with other mechanical methods, proper fragmentation ofthe rock cannot be guaranteed. 5.4 Blasting Blasting is another method of rock removal that may be utilized. This method is supported by drilling, which is described above. After the hole is drilled, blasting operations are carried out as described within a site-specific blasting plan that addresses all of the specifications below. Rock Removal Plan E-11 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 6.0 BLASTING PLAN 6.1 Pre-Blast Inspection As required by the FERC, Algonquin shall conduct pre-blast surveys, with landowner permission, to assess the conditions of structures, wells, springs, and utilities within 150 feet of the proposed construction ROW. Should local or state ordinances require inspections in excess of 150 feet from the work, the more stringent ordinances shall prevail.  The survey willinclude:  Informal discussions to familiarize the adjacent property owners with blasting effects and planned precautions to be taken on this Project;  Determination of the existence and location of site specific structures, utilities, septic systems, wells and springs;  Detailed examination, photographs, and/or video records ofadjacent structures and utilities; and  Detailed mapping and measurement of large cracks, crack patterns, and other evidence of structural distress.  Samplingof wells or springs will consist ofturbidity and bacteriological analysis(total coliform). The results will be summarized in a condition report that will include photographs and be completed prior to the commencement of blasting.  6.2 Monitoring of Blasting Activities During blasting, Algonquin contractors will take precautions to prevent damage to adjacent areas and structures. Precautions include:  Display warningsignage, signals, flags, and/or barricades;  Use of matting or other suitable cover, as necessary;  Following Federal, State, and Local procedures and regulations for safe storage, handling, loading, firing, and disposal of explosive materials; and  Staffing existing utilities with Operations personnel during blasting operations. Blasting will be performed only by state licensed experts (where required) and monitored by experienced blasting inspectors. As appropriate, the effects of each discharge will be monitored at the closest adjacent facilitiesby seismographs.  6.3 Post-Blast Inspection To maximize its responsiveness to the concerns of affected landowners, Algonquin will evaluate all complaints of well or structural damage associated with construction activities, including blasting. A toll-free landowner hotline will be established by Algonquin for landowners to use in reporting complaints or concerns. An independent contractor engaged by Algonquin will examine, with landowner permission, the condition of structures, wells, springs, and utilities within 150 feet, or as required by federal, state, or local ordinances, of the construction area after completion of blasting operations to identify any changes in the conditions of these properties or confirm any damages noted by the landowner. Algonquin will conduct pre-blasting yield and quality testing of any well or spring within 150 feet of the blast site, and document these conditions. Like pre-blast inspection, post-blast sampling of wells or springs will consist of turbidity and bacteriological analysis (total coliform). Should any damage or change occur during the blasting operations, Algonquin willcoordinate with the landownerto seek corrective action. Rock Removal Plan E-12 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 6.4 Waterbody Crossing Blasting Procedures To facilitate planning for blasting activities for waterbody crossings, rock drills or test excavations may be used in waterbodies to test the ditch-line during mainline blasting operations to evaluate the presence of rock in the trench-line. The excavation of the test pit or rock drilling is not included in the time window requirements for completing the crossing. For testing and any subsequent blasting operations, stream flow will be maintained through the site. When blasting is required, the FERC timeframes for completing in-stream construction begin when the removal of blast rock from the waterbody is started. If, after removing the blast rock, additional blasting is required, a new timing window will be determined in consultation with the Environmental Inspector. If blasting impedes the flow of the waterbody, the contractor can use a backhoe to restore the stream flow without triggering the timing window. The complete waterbody crossing procedures are included in the Algonquin’s E&SCP. 6.5 Blasting Specifications The potential for blasting along the pipeline to affect any wetland, waterbody, municipal water supply, waste disposal site, well, septic system, or spring will be prevented by controlled blasting techniques and by using mechanical methods for rock excavation where reasonable. Controlled blasting techniques have also been effectively employed for decades by Algonquin and other companiesto protect active utilities.  The following text presents details of Algonquin’s procedures for blasting. Ultimately, the contractor is responsible for securingand complying with all necessarypermits required for the transportation, storage, and use ofexplosives. The contractor will also be responsible forfollowing the specifications below. 6.5.1 Pre-requisites for Use of Explosives Prior to the use of any explosives, the contractor shall submit a blasting procedure and receive Algonquin approval. The blasting procedure shall take into account adjacent pipelines and specific requirements outlined in the Contract Documents and shall include as a minimum:  Storage of explosives.  Transportation of explosives.  Inspection of drilling areas.  Loading ofexplosives.  Non-electric detonation methods.  Electric detonation methods are not acceptable.  Prevention of fly-rock during blasting, including mat placement ifused.  Security procedures.  Sequence of events leadingup the detonation of explosives.  Proposed hours of blasting.  True distancesto buildings or operating pipelines.  Maximum charge mass per delay interval.  Borehole diameters.  Hole pattern, burden, and spacing.  Borehole depth, subgrade depth, and unloaded collar length.  Sketch showing borehole loading details.  Explosive names, properties, and delay sequences.  Calculated powder factor (weight per volume of rock), based on explosive energy of 1000 calories per gram.  Geology description.  Borehole stemming depth. Rock Removal Plan E-13 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT  Special conditions or variations for grade rock, trench rock, underwater blasting, and blasting at undercrossings of existingutilities.  Blast to open face.  Obtain Algonquin approval and provide a notice of 72 hours prior to detonation of any explosives.  Obtain approval from Algonquin if the blasting parameters vary from the requirements set out in this specification or the Contract Documents.  Use of Explosives  The Contractor shall secure and comply with all the applicable permits required for the handling, transportation, storage, and use of explosives.  The Contractor shall not endanger life, livestock, or adjacent properties.   The Contractor shall minimize inconveniences to the property owners or tenants during all phases of blasting.  The Contractor shall provide physical protection to any above-grade utilities and equipment in the areaofthe blast.  Algonquin shall set up required monitoring equipment.   The Contractor shall provide monitoring equipment to ensure vibrations are limited to two inches per second (50 mm/s) PPV, when measured at dwellings, buildings, structures, and power line towers. For power line towers, this limit applies to the greatest of the three vectors; otherwise this limit is the vector sum of the three planes. The Contractor limits vibrations to one inch per second (25 mm/s) PPV for vibration-sensitive structures specified by Algonquin. In no case shall vibration amplitude exceed 0.004 in (0.15 mm).  Any blasting in close proximity to existing in-service piping is to be in accordance with the Contract Documents.  Charge loading is to be spread in order to obtain the optimum breakage of rock. The Contractor shall attempt to achieve a fragmentation rate of at least 75% of the trench rock to less than 6 in (150 mm) in diameter.  All delay connectors used shall have a delay interval of at least seventeen milliseconds.  There are to be no loaded holesleft overnight, and the site is inspected after each blast for any undetonated charges. The Contractor shall discuss the blasting plan with Algonquin prior to each blast, including the maximum charge weight per delay, hole sizes, spacing, depths and layout. Algonquin will employ a qualified Blasting Inspector to confirm and document that the Contractor is following the approved blasting plan at each blast site. Upon completion of blasting each day, the Contractor shall provide Algonquin with the following for each blast:  Blasting Contractor license number.  Date, time, and location ofblast.   Hole sizes, spacing, depths, layout, and volume of rock in blast.  Delay type, interval, total number of delays, and holes per delay.  Explosive type, specific gravity, energy release, weight of explosive perdelay, and total weight of explosive per shot.  Powder factor.  Copiesof any seismographic data 6.5.2 Evaluation of Close-In Blasts The following additional limitations apply for blasting at distances of less than 25 feet from the pipeline. These criteria were extrapolated from a 1970 U.S. Bureau of Mines Study (“USBOM”) on cratering in granite, and refined based on a 2004 failure investigation. Other blasting limitations based upon Rock Removal Plan E-14 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT extensive research by the Pipeline Research Committee International (“PRCI”), blasting consultants, and the USBOM regarding blasting adjacent to pipelines is also included in the Spectra Energy blasting criteria. 6.5.3 Blasting on Pipeline Right-of-Way Blasting should not be allowed on the pipeline right-of-way except when conducted for the benefit of the Company and under the supervision of a Company representative or qualified Blasting Inspector familiar with the Company’s blasting requirements. 6.5.4 Minimum Offset From Blast Holes to Pipeline No blast holes should be loaded at an offset of less than 25 feet from the centerline of an in-service pipeline except in cases where precise measurements are taken to ensure that the pipeline will have at least one foot of clearance from the theoretical area surrounding the blast hole in which the ground could be permanently deformed by the blast under worst case conditions. This theoretical area is a conical shape originating at the bottom of the blast hole and extending out atan angle up to the ground surface. When blast holes are angled from the vertical, this can have the effect of directing the disruption from the blast in one direction (the surface acts as a free face, allowing movement in that direction). For this reason, blast holes within 25 feet of an existing pipeline must be drilled vertically or angled away from the pipeline as the hole gets deeper. In all cases, the absolute minimum horizontal offsetfrom the blast hole to the side of the pipe is 12 feet. Rock Removal Plan E-15 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Rock Removal Plan E-16 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT APPENDIX A SHALLOW BEDROCK LOCATIONS ALONG THE AIM PIPELINE FACILITIES Rock Removal Plan E-17 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Rock Removal Plan E-18 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Rock Removal Plan E-19 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Rock Removal Plan E-20 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Rock Removal Plan E-21 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Areas With Bedrock Less than 60 inches Below Grade by MP  Bedrock Contact Type  Overburden Material  Range of Slope (%) a/  Soil Map Unit  BeginningMilepost  EndingMilepost  Approximate Crossing Length (ft) b/  Depth -Bedrock (inches) g/  NEW YORK  Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay  Lithic  Till  15-30  CkD  1.19  1.49  1597.81  0  Lithic  Till  15-25  CoD  1.49  1.57  423.35  20  Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay  Lithic  Till  15-25  CoD  0.31  0.36  279.84  0  Lithic  Till  15-25  CkD  0.36  0.41  269.28  0  Lithic  Till  8-15  CkC  0.41  0.51  522.72  0  Lithic  Till  15-25  CkD  0.72  1.29  3041.28  0  Lithic  Till  25-45  HlF  1.29  1.36  359.04  20  Lithic  Till  15-25  CkD  1.36  2.12  3970.56  0  Lithic  Till  15-25  CkD  2.79  3.14  1832.16  0  Lithic  -

A slope range of 0 to 8 % was assigned to these developed areas. b/ Soil crossing lengths were simplified by rounding to the nearest whole number. The crossing lengths may differ slightly from actual lengths due to rounding. No soil data is provided between MP 2.62 and MP 4.94 as the route across the Hudson River has not been determined at this time. c/ Water erosion potential was determined by averaging the K factor values of horizons of each soil type. Based on the average K factor, each soil type was grouped into a water erosion class of “Low”, “Moderate”, and “High”. Refer to Section 7.3.1.1. d/ WEGs were obtained from the NRCS Soil Data Mart. WEGs range from one to eight, with one being the highest potential for wind erosion, and eight the lowest. Refer to Section 7.3.1.2. e/ “Urban Land” and “Udorthents” map units do not have a NRCS designated hydric soil status. These map units were considered to be non-hydric soils. Map units comprised of complexes of hydric and non-hydric soil types were considered to be partially hydric. f/ Compaction potential was determined by drainage class. High compaction potential includes very poorly drained and poorly drained soils, moderate compaction potential includes somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained soils, and low compaction potential includes well drained soils. g/ Depth to bedrock is not defined by the NRCS for the “Pavement and Buildings” map unit. A depth to bedrock of >60” was assigned, which is consistent with NRCS designations for other natural and fill soils in the AIM Project area. h/ The ability of soils within the AIM Project area to support successful revegetation were determined by evaluating range of slope, erosion potential, drainage class, and presence of fill materials. Refer to Section 7.3.5. i/ Drainage class abbreviations are as follows: VPD, very poorly drained; PD, poorly drained; MWD, moderately well drained; WD, well drained; ED, excessively drained.  APPENDIX F PUBLIC ROADS AND RAILROADS CROSSING TABLE APPENDIX F TABLE F-1 Public Roads and Railroads Crossed by the AIM Project  Facility, County, Road State, Milepost Roadway Surface  Municipality  Proposed Construction Method  Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay Rockland County, NY 0.3 Call Hollow Road Paved 0.5 Wolf Road Paved 1.0 Call Hollow Road Paved 1.2 Willow Grove Road Paved 1.5 Irish Mountain Court Paved 2.2 Palisades Interstate Parkway (inbound Paved and outbound) 2.3 Pierce Drive Paved 2.4 Zachary Taylor Street/Pierce Drive Paved intersection 2.5 Pyngyp Road Paved 3.0 Gate Hill Road (Highway 210) Paved 3.0 Cedar Flats Road Paved Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay Rockland County, NY 0.4 Bulson Town Road (Route 65) Paved 0.7 Franck Road Paved 1.4 Soluri Lane Paved 1.6 Soluri Lane Paved 2.1 Route 53/Buck Berg Mountain Road Paved 2.4 Mott Farm Road (Route 118) Paved 3.0 Highway 9W (N.

The installation of the new 42-inch pipeline will begin at the existing Algonquin Mainline Valve Site (“MLV”) 13B (MP 0.0) located west of Call Hollow Road in the Town of Haverstraw and end at the Stony Point Compressor Station located northeast of Cedar Flats Road in the Town of Stony Point (MP 3.3). Downstream (northeast) of the Stony Point Compressor Station, Algonquin will construct  approximately 12.3 miles of 42-inch diameter mainline pipeline in the Towns of Stony Point and Cortlandt (including the Hamlet of Verplanck and the Village of Buchanan), the City of Peekskill, and the Town of Yorktown (Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay).  This pipeline section includes two segments of take-up and relay pipeline construction and one section of pipeline construction within a new permanent ROW across the Hudson River.   In response to comments from the FERC, landowners and other stakeholders, Algonquin has retained Hatch Mott MacDonald, NY LLC. (“HMM”) to provide traffic engineering consulting services in support of the proposed Project facilities in New York. Algonquin is committed to working with each municipality along the Project limits to address potential transportation-related impacts associated with constructing the proposed pipeline. This document includes a summary of roadways where the construction will take place and information regarding general traffic management strategies. Based on the research conducted to date, this report summarizes the currently proposed construction schedule, hours of operation, and provides representative traffic management plans that will be implemented during construction.  1 15 U.S.C. § 717f(c) (2006). New York Traffic Management Plan 1 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION The projected in-service date of the AIM Project is November 2016.  Construction of the Project pipeline facilities, new M&R stations, and modifications to the Algonquin’s existing compressor stations and M&R stations is expected to occur over a 1½ year period to accommodate multiple work locations and the need for scheduled system outages for the numerous tie-ins along the existing system.  The work is scheduled to start in the 1st Quarter of 2015 and be completed by October 2016. Table 2-1 provides a preliminary construction schedule. TABLE 2-1 Preliminary Construction Schedule for AIM Project Facilities in New York  Facilities Start  Finish Length (miles)  PIPELINE FACILITIES Mainline Take-up & Relay a/ March 2016 Oct. 2016 12.8 Horizontal Directional Drill/New Pipe b/Hudson River March 2015 Oct. 2015 2.9 ABOVEGROUND FACILITIES Existing Compressor Station Modifications Stony Point c/ March 2016 Oct. 2016 N/A Southeast c/ March 2016 Oct. 2016 N/A Existing M&R Station Modifications Stony Point M&R Station April 2016 Oct. 2016 N/A Peekskill M&R Station April 2015 Oct. 2015 N/A Cortlandt M&R Station April 2016 Oct. 2016 N/A  Notes:a/  Certain complex pipeline crossings (e.g., road, streams, railroads) may be constructed during the April – October 2015 construction season.  Winter clearing in Nov. 2015 – Feb. 2016 may be necessary to address time of year restrictions. b/  The length shown for the Hudson River HDD is also included in the total length shown for the mainline take-up and relay. c/  Civil site work at these two compressor stations will begin in the April – October 2015 time frame.  To expedite the completion of the Project, weekday working hours between 7 AM and 7 PM are desirable. However, Algonquin recognizes that these hours may not be possible for all portions of the Project due to traffic management in consideration of abutting residential and commercial properties, and that night working hours may be required. The exact timeframe for the completion of the Project is dependent on weather conditions, extent of restricted work hours and other factors. For construction planning purposes, the Project is being viewed in eighteen distinct sections. To minimize the duration of construction, work may occur simultaneously in multiple areas as three dedicated construction crews are expected to be working on the Project. For each portion of the Project involving work in public roadways traffic management plans will be required to help ensure general public safety and to maintain appropriate traffic flow. In addition to measures to address motor vehicles, considerations also will be made for pedestrians, bicycles, and construction workers. As such, Algonquin will continue to work closely with the various municipalities and public agencies involved, as well as residential and commercial stakeholders that may be affected by the Project.  New York Traffic Management Plan 2 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 3.0 REPRESENTATIVE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS General traffic management plans have been developed and included as part of this TMP. The plans were developed following standards contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)2, New York State Supplement to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, and the New York State Work Zone Traffic Control Standard Details. While not all of the affected roadways are under New York State Department of Transportation (“NYSDOT”) jurisdiction, NYSDOT’s “Work Zone Traffic Control Standard Details” also were applied to local and residential roadways. These resulting plans are expected to be implemented for the majority of the work areas. The following tables provide a summary of where the attached traffic management plans are applied at each road crossing along the project.  A meeting with the NYSDOT was held on April 14, 2014 to discuss the locations and crossing methods of the proposed AIM Pipeline installations across NYSDOT jurisdictional roadways.  The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the AIM Project, discuss pipeline crossing methods, required geotechnical boring work, and license vs. easement options pertaining to pipeline occupation at the road crossings. The TMP’s outlined in this document are being provided to each of the affected municipalities crossed by the proposed AIM Project and will be part of continuing communications.   Table 1: New York Roadways Affected by Construction (Haverstraw to Stony Point) &#3;  MP&#3;  Road&#3; Name&#3;  Road&#3; Surface&#3;  Proposed&#3; Crossing&#3; Method&#3;  County&#3;  Municipality  TypicalDetail#&#3;  MainlineTakeupandRelay&#3; (HaverstrawtoStonyPoint)&#3;  0.3  CallHollow Rd.

The West Roxbury Lateral will consist of approximately 4.09 miles of new 16-inch diameter pipeline in the Towns of Westwood and Dedham and the West Roxbury section of the City of Boston and approximately 0.80 miles of new 24-inch diameter pipeline in West Roxbury. In order to respond fully to comments from the FERC, the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board, landowners and other stakeholders, Algonquin retained Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. (“VHB”) to provide traffic engineering consulting services in support of the proposed Project facilities in Massachusetts. Algonquin is committed to working with each municipality, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (“MassDOT”), homeowners and other stakeholders along the Project limits to address potential transportation-related impacts associated with constructing the proposed pipeline. This document includes a summary of existing traffic conditions along the roadways where the construction will take place and information regarding general traffic management strategies. Based on the research conducted to date, this report summarizes the currently proposed construction schedule, hours of operation, and provides representative traffic management plans that will be implemented during construction. There also has been a significant ongoing community outreach program by Algonquin with regular coordination with the various municipalities and agencies involved with this process as well as other stakeholders. The traffic analysis prepared to date and the comprehensive traffic management plans provided in Attachment A are intended to help ensure that traffic is safely and efficiently managed throughout the duration of the Project. These plans and information have been prepared for use in the coordination efforts noted above. As the Project design advances and more detailed information becomes available, and factoring in the comments received during Algonquin’s continuing coordination efforts, the Traffic Management Program can be modified and refined as necessary. 1 15 U.S.C. § 717f(c) (2006). Traffic Management Plan 1 AIM PROJECT 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION The work on the West Roxbury Lateral is planned to commence as early as April of 2015 at selected locations, particularly in the Westwood and Dedham areas, following the issuance of all necessary approvals, and is expected to be completed by November 2016.  To expedite the completion of the Project, weekday working hours between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM are desirable.  However, Algonquin recognizes that these hours will not be possible for all portions of the Project due to traffic management considerations, and that night working hours will be required, primarily in non-residential areas.  For example, in discussions with MassDOT, that agency has indicated that nighttime construction will be required along Providence Highway in Dedham.  The exact timeframe for the completion of the Project is, therefore, dependent on weather conditions, the extent of restricted work hours and other factors.  To minimize the duration of construction, work may occur simultaneously in various areas as multiple dedicated construction crews are expected to be working on the Project.  For each portion of the Project involving work in public roadways, traffic management plans will be required to help ensure general public safety and to maintain appropriate traffic flow.  In addition to measures to address motor vehicles, considerations also will be made for pedestrians, bicycles, and construction workers.  As such, Algonquin will continue to work closely with the various municipalities and public agencies involved, as well as residential and commercial stakeholders that may be affected by the Project.  Traffic Management Plan 2 AIM PROJECT 3.0 EXISTING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS This final Traffic Management Study supplements both an initial evaluation which was prepared in February 2014 for this Project, and a prior version of this assessment dated June 2014.  This current updated version reflects the final alignment as proposed and includes detailed current traffic counts at key locations along the Project corridor with associated analysis.  The traffic management plans to be implemented during construction were developed based on observed traffic volumes and patterns, existing roadway geometry and traffic control, and measures to maintain appropriate access to abutting residents and businesses.  The first step in conducting this traffic data collection effort was to review currently available data to help determine the most critical locations within the Project limits in terms of traffic management.  This preliminary traffic count information was obtained from a variety of sources, including the MassDOT traffic count database, municipal websites and recent traffic studies prepared for development projects or roadway improvements in the area.  Due to the age of some of this information, updated traffic counts were required at multiple key locations within the Project study area as described in the following section.  The updated traffic count data and expected roadway configurations during construction have been reviewed to identify the general operating conditions that can be expected.  This effort includes evaluating level-of-service for key study area roadways or intersections both under existing conditions and during construction.  As part of this effort, data from MassDOT’s “Standard Details and Drawings for the Development of Traffic Management Plans”2 have been reviewed to determine how the observed volumes compare to the expected roadway capacities during construction. 3.1 Traffic Volumes Traffic volumes (i.e., vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists) for the study area roadways and intersections were collected manually and mechanically by VHB to provide a basis from which to evaluate traffic conditions. In May 2014, VHB conducted Automatic Traffic Recorder counts (ATRs) for a 72-hour period along the following study area roadways: x Elm Street (Dedham) - between Providence Highway and Legacy Place driveway x Providence Highway (Dedham) - between Legacy Boulevard signal and Best Buy/Star signal x East Street (Dedham) - north of High Street x High Street (Dedham) - east of East Street x Washington Street (Dedham/Boston) - between Lower East Street and Oak Street x Grove Street (Boston) - south of Centre Street x Centre Street (Boston) - south of Spring Street The observed volumes on these roadways, and the manner in which the volumes vary over the course of a typical weekday and Saturday, are summarized in Table 1.  2 MassDOT “MassHighway Standard Details and Drawings for the Development of Temporary Traffic Control Plans”; http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/portals/8/docs/flaggers/tcp.pdf.

Volumes for  northbound and southbound sections of Providence Highway do not necessarily add up to match total, as low- and high-volume conditions for the  median-divided roadway may occur at different times.  3  volumes expressed in vehicles per hour and report commuter peak hour traffic between 7:00 AM – 9:00 AM (AM Peak) and between 4:00 PM –  6:00 PM (PM Peak).  Manual turning movement counts (“TMCs”) also were collected at key signalized study area intersections where traffic flow may be affected by some travel lanes being temporarily unavailable during daytime construction hours.  The TMCS were collected at the study area intersections on a typical weekday from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM.  Additional TMCs also were conducted during a midday off-peak period, 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, for use in evaluating the feasibility of conducting construction during regular daytime working hours, but outside of the typical peak commuter time periods. 3.2 Traffic Management Strategy Based on the automatic traffic recorder (“ATR”) counts noted in the previous section, traffic flow within the study area remains relatively constant throughout the day. However, these counts indicate that the volumes on Providence Highway decrease significantly following the weekday evening commuter peak period.  See Figure 1.  Given the consistently high volumes of traffic along this and other study area Traffic Management Plan 4 AIM PROJECT roadways, it is important to maintain reasonable traffic flow in all directions throughout the day. The traffic management plans accompanying this submittal do not propose any detours, and all turning movements at intersections shall be maintained so that businesses and traffic patterns are not significantly impacted. However, these plans have been developed with the understanding that detours potentially could be required at some locations (such as at the Providence Highway/Eastern Avenue and Washington Street/Grove Street intersections) if necessitated by field conditions during construction.  While the currently proposed alignment does not require any detours, Algonquin will continue to coordinate with MassDOT and the respective municipalities during the permitting process in the event that any subsequent alignment changes or conditions should require detours.  Lane closures and lane shifts are expected to occur at various times throughout the duration of construction for the Project. Therefore, the Traffic Management Plan for this Project has been developed with the goal of minimizing the number of lanes to be closed within the existing roadway cross-sections for most phases of construction.  The primary goal of this strategy is to prevent unnecessary delays to the motoring public.  However, work along certain sections of Providence Highway will require the temporary closure of two lanes of travel. Likewise, some phases of the Traffic Management Plan will require that two of the westbound Elm Street lanes approaching its signalized intersection with Providence Highway be closed.  These temporary multi-lane reductions will be required only for some phases of the proposed Traffic Management Plan, and that work only will occur during evening hours. Based on ongoing discussions with MassDOT it is understood that construction along the Providence Highway corridor will need to occur during evening hours and not during the typical 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM working hours planned for most of the Project.  Any work that is to occur during or near peak traffic hours (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM) on roadways not under MassDOT jurisdiction will be coordinated in advance with Westwood, Dedham and/or the City of Boston. Maintaining two-way traffic flow also shall be closely coordinated with maintaining pedestrian accessibility, as well as providing access for businesses and residents.  Finally, in its entirety the Project is expected to be constructed over two construction seasons. The traffic management plan developed and analyzed for this Project addresses the major aspects of construction. The following provides more details on the traffic management plan for the corridor. For the purpose of this assessment, the Project was considered in the following five general representative segments:  1. East Street (Westwood) northerly to Providence Highway/Elm Street (Dedham) 2. Providence Highway at Elm Street northerly to Eastern Avenue 3. Eastern Avenue to Washington Street 4. Washington Street to Grove Street (West Roxbury) 5. Grove Street and Centre Street to Spring Street   General traffic conditions within each of these general areas are discussed in the following sections based on VHB’s observations and updated traffic data collection. 3.3 East Street (Westwood) northerly to Providence Highway at Elm Street (Dedham) The majority of the construction work in Westwood extending into the southerly portion of Dedham will occur on private property and not within public roadways. Notable exceptions to this are at the East Street crossing, which will involve open trench construction, and the crossing of the pipeline underneath Route I95, which will be done by directional drilling that will not affect roadway traffic.  The southerly limits involve work on private property south and adjacent to the East Street rotary above Route I-95 in Westwood. As noted above, the Project will cross East Street, which is two-lane 30-foot wide roadway, just south of Traffic Management Plan 5 AIM PROJECT the section under MassDOT jurisdiction. Based on 2012 traffic counts3 and VHB’s projections for growth in this area, this road should carry approximately 16,500 and 9,500 vehicles per day (“vpd”) on a typical weekday and Saturday, during the 2015/2016 construction seasons.  Detailed traffic management plans depicting the phased lane closures which will be required on East Street at this location have been provided with this submittal. After crossing East Street, the proposed line will run south of and adjacent to Route I-95 before crossing underneath the highway roughly 900 feet to the north of East Street.  Based on counts by MassDOT,4 Route I-95 carried approximately 139,439 vpd in 2012.  As the pipe installation will occur underneath the highway via directional drilling work in the vicinity of Route I-95, traffic management measures are not required for this crossing. After passing underneath the highway, the line will continue to Rustcraft Road in Dedham, which is a local two-lane road ranging from 28- to 32-feet in width.  As the roadway alignment curves to the northeast the road is named Elm Street.  Elm Street has a general 36- to 38-foot width before flaring to a roughly 70-foot width at its intersection with Providence Highway (formerly known as Route 1).  The Legacy Place shopping center is located north of and adjacent to Elm Street and Fox 25 is located at the southeast corner of the Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection. Residential homes and apartment buildings also are located along Rustcraft Street and Elm Street.  The segment of Elm Street adjacent to the shopping center to the west of its signalized intersection with Providence Highway generally has a single eastbound lane and two westbound lanes.  Site-specific traffic management plans for the two-lane Rustcraft Road/Elm Street sections, and the multi-lane road section near the Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection have been included with this submittal.  These reference drawings have been substantially enhanced and refined since their original versions.  These changes were primarily the result of a shift in the pipeline alignment within Rustcraft Road and Elm Street and the ongoing coordination with the Town of Dedham, MassDOT and representatives of the Legacy Place shopping center.  Based on automatic traffic recorder counts conducted by VHB in May 2014, Elm Street currently carries approximately 14,945 and 18,504 vpd on a typical weekday and Saturday, respectively. These counts were conducted to the west of the Legacy Place driveway on Elm Street and, as such, include volumes generated by that retail center as well as other nearby uses. Due to changes in the proposed pipeline alignment, a crossing of the Legacy Place driveway on Elm Street is no longer required. The observed hourly volumes summarized above also were compared to the roadway capacities which will be available in conjunction with the traffic management plans.  This comparison is discussed in detail later in the “Traffic Management Plans” section of this report.  3.4 Providence Highway at Elm Street northerly to Eastern Avenue (Dedham) Within the Project study area, Providence Highway is a median-divided roadway carrying up to three travel lanes in each direction, with additional turning lanes provided at select locations.  The roadway is under MassDOT jurisdiction.  The segment of this roadway in the vicinity of Legacy Place was reconstructed as part of the construction of that shopping center in 2009.  As part of the current evaluation, VHB conducted ATR counts on Providence Highway to the north of Legacy Boulevard for a continuous 72-hour period including a typical weekday and Saturday.  The counts indicate that this roadway currently carries approximately 46,720 vehicles on a typical weekday.  However, possibly due to the concentration of retail and restaurant uses along this corridor, Friday volumes were observed to be higher, with approximately 3 University Station – Traffic Impact Study; TetraTech / VAI (November 2012). 4 MassDOT “Transportation Data Management System”; http://mhd.ms2soft.com/tcds/tsearch.asp?loc=Mhd&mod=; Accessed February 2014. Traffic Management Plan 6 AIM PROJECT 49,050 vehicles traveling on this segment.  Likewise, Saturday volumes were slightly higher with 49,336 vehicles observed on Providence Highway.  The pipeline installation along this road segment is planned to occur entirely on the northbound side of the median-divided roadway.  While the pipeline originally was planned to be installed along the right-shoulder of the northbound side of this roadway, there have been changes to this alignment.  Specifically, based on input from MassDOT and in order to minimize impacts to abutting businesses and conflicts with existing utilities, the pipeline installation now instead will occur on the westerly side of the northbound segment adjacent to the median.  As discussed later in this report, this will simplify the traffic management needs along this segment of the Project.  The hourly volumes along this northbound segment of Providence Highway were reviewed as summarized in Figure 1.  As shown in Figure 1, northbound volumes on this roadway begin to increase significantly starting at 6:00 AM on a typical weekday.  The volumes decline slightly from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM before steadily climbing through the evening commuter peak period.  These observed volumes also were compared to the Providence Highway capacity that would be available with the traffic management plans in place during typical daytime working hours.  This discussion is provided later in the “Traffic Management Plans” section of this report.  This information is provided for reference and documentation only, as daytime construction is not feasible in this area based on the volumes shown in Figure 1.  Instead, following coordination with MassDOT it was determined that nighttime construction would be required for the Providence Highway corridor.  As shown above, the volumes along the northbound side of Providence Highway steadily decrease to manageable levels following the weekday evening commuter peak period.  Furthermore, from 11:00 PM to 5:00 AM there is a negligible volume of traffic on this segment as compared to that experienced during typical daytime hours.  This will allow for construction to occur with only minimal impacts to traffic operations in this area during the planned evening working hours. Traffic Management Plan 7 AIM PROJECT 3.5 East Street to Washington Street (Dedham) Just north of Providence Highway’s intersection with Eastern Avenue, the proposed pipeline will shift off of the road and onto recreational fields owned by the Town of Dedham to the east of the roadway.  This will occur immediately north of the driveway to the Staples retail center.  From that point, work will extend across the town-owned land until the pipeline crosses High Street and continues to the north along East Street.  The work is then planned to continue along East Street to its intersection with Washington Street.   The High Street/Harris Street/East Street intersection along this route was recently reconstructed and signalized.  While two-way traffic is allowed for almost the entire length of the roadway, East Street is one-way heading northbound at its intersection with Washington Street.  As such, the observed southbound traffic on this roadway is associated solely with the residents along this roadway.  This is due to entering traffic from Washington Street not being allowed. By comparison, the northbound segment of this road carries both traffic associated with residents of this road as well as traffic heading from High Street to Washington Street.  Based on May 2014 ATR counts conducted for this evaluation, East Street currently carries 1,981 vehicles on a typical weekday, which is consistent with prior counts in this area.  Saturday volumes on this roadway were observed to be slightly higher, with 2,298 vehicles observed over the course of the Saturday counted.  ATRs counts also were conducted on High Street immediately east of High Street as part of this evaluation. The counts indicate that High Street currently carries approximately 16,181 and 14,522 vehicles on a typical weekday and Saturday, respectively.   While the volume along this two-lane locally owned roadway is lower than other portions of the Project, additional considerations will be required to appropriately minimize impacts to abutters.  The traffic management plans include a variety of typical details that will be utilized for the lane shifts, closures and minor intersection crossings that will be encountered along this roadway.  Due to the complexity of the Highway/East Street intersection, phase traffic management plans for that crossing have been prepared as discussed in more detail in the “Traffic Management Plans” section of this report.  3.6 Washington Street to Grove Street (West Roxbury)   At the northerly end of the East Street work, the construction will shift across a grassed area to the east of Washington Street.  This proposed route will help to minimize impacts to the Washington Street/East Street/Dedham Mall signalized intersection.  At that point, the route continues along the northbound side of the median-divided Washington Street.  This revised configuration will require less-intensive traffic management compared to the initial proposal that involved crossing Washington Street onto Lower East Street, crossing Mother Brook, and then returning to Washington Street.  For the segment between East Street and Rockland Street (almost one-half mile in length), the alignment will run along the northbound side of Washington Street.  From that point, the line will cross to the southbound side of Washington Street and continue approximately 1,100 feet to the signalized Washington Street/Grove Street intersection.  The traffic management plans include standard details for lane shifts and closures and typical treatments for minor intersection crossings.  Due to the location of the proposed road opening opposite Curve Street and Lower East Street, a two-phase site specific traffic management plan has been developed for that location.  Starting in 2009, Washington Street was reconstructed from Providence Highway to the Boston City line. Following the completion of the right-of-way process, jurisdiction of this road will be transferred from MassDOT to the Town of Dedham.  The portion of this roadway in Boston will continue to remain under City control unaffected by this change.  Updated traffic counts conducted as part of this current Project assessment indicate that Washington Street currently carries 21,185 and 22,674 vehicles on a typical weekday and Saturday, respectively.  Peak hour volumes ranged from 1,600- to 2,200 vehicles per hour (“vph”) during the respective weekday morning and evening peak hours.  Additional discussion regarding Traffic Management Plan 8 AIM PROJECT the observed traffic volumes relative to the planned traffic management plans is provided later in this assessment.      3.7 Grove Street and Centre Street to Spring Street (West Roxbury)   The pipeline installation will continue from Washington Street onto Grove Street continuing to the north. This two-lane local roadway is under City of Boston jurisdiction and is characterized by its residential nature.  As part of this study, VHB conducted ATR counts on Grove Street to the south of Centre Street. The counts indicate that this roadway currently carries approximately 8,569 and 7,266 vehicles on a typical weekday and Saturday, respectively.  ATR counts also were conducted on the northerly segment of this roadway after it transitions from Grove Street into Centre Street.  The counts on this segment are slightly lower, with 7,282 and 6,219 vehicles observed on a typical weekday and Saturday, respectively.  Site-specific traffic management plans depicting the expected temporary lane shifts are provided attached to this submittal.  The traffic management plans developed will allow for two-way traffic flow on this segment throughout construction.  As discussed later in this document, the complex nature of the pipeline alignment through the Washington Street/Grove Street intersection required that a two-phase, site-specific traffic management plan be developed for that location.  For the remainder of Grove Street and Spring Street, traffic will be managed during construction through a variety of typical details for lane closures, lane shifts, and intersection treatments as shown on the plans accompanying this submittal.  Additional considerations also were given to traffic management near the West Roxbury Crushed Stone quarry (discussed in the following section) and for the Centre Street/Spring Street intersection.  To properly manage traffic at the signalized Centre Street/Spring Street intersection, a four-phase site-specific traffic management plan was developed for that location as shown in the attached plans.    3.7.1 West Roxbury Crushed Stone Quarry The West Roxbury Crushed Stone quarry is located east and adjacent to Grove Street opposite Centre Street. Algonquin is not aware of any planned changes to this active facility which is expected to continue its regular quarry activity and on-site blasting.  Based on discussions between Algonquin and quarry representatives, between 100 and 150 trucks currently visit the quarry on a typical day.  This translates into roughly 200 to 300 truck trips on a typical weekday.  The single unit trucks are generally 18- to 20-feet in length, though there are a limited number of trailers leaving the site which are up to 32-feet long.  This trucking activity is generally confined to March through December, with that volume dropping by 50- to 60- daily trucks during the winter months.  The first four or five trucks generally begin to exit the facility starting at 7:30 AM, with relatively constant departures occurring until about 1:30 PM after which exiting traffic decreases notably. In addition to this truck traffic, there are also approximately 17 to 25 workers traveling to and from this site on a typical workday. These workers area generally on-site from 6:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays, and 6:00 AM to noon on Saturdays.  The facility is not in operation on Sundays.  VHB also conducted manual turning movement counts at the intersection of Grove Street/Centre Street with the quarry driveway. The counts were conducted on Thursday, May 8, 2014 during from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM.  The peak one-hour period for the quarry during the time period observed occurred between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM.  During this time, 24 vehicles entered the site while 25 exited.  Approximately 80-percent of these trips were made by trucks with the remainder being employees or visitors to the site.  As noted above, activity decreased throughout the day with 20 vehicles entering and 17 exiting between 11:00 AM and 12 noon, with over 80-percent of that traffic being trucks.  By the late afternoon, only 9 employee vehicles were observed exiting the site between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM. Traffic at the intersection of Grove Street/Centre Street with the quarry driveway will be managed during construction with the typical intersection crossing plans shown in the accompanying plans.  With these Traffic Management Plan 9 AIM PROJECT measures in place, quarry trucks still will be able to access and egress that site with minimal delay while minimizing impacts both to that site and the surrounding neighborhood. Traffic Management Plan 10 AIM PROJECT 4.0 COORDINATION WITH AGENCIES / MUNICIPALITIES / PROJECT STAKEHOLDERS As part of the ongoing coordination efforts for the Project, Algonquin has consulted with multiple public agencies and other stakeholders in the area.  A list of the various public and landowner outreach meetings is provided below.  Construction, traffic, safety and other project related topics were discussed at each of the meetings.  At the local municipal level, Algonquin is coordinating directly with officials from the Towns of Westwood and Dedham, and the City of Boston on an ongoing basis.  Algonquin also has met with representatives of MassDOT on several occasions.   x Landowner Informational Meeting  West Roxbury, MA  July 23, 2013 x Landowner Informational Meeting  Dedham, MA  July 25, 2013 x Algonquin Public Open House Dedham, MA  August 14, 2013 x Algonquin Public Open House West Roxbury, MA  September 3, 2014 x FERC Scoping Meeting Dedham, MA  October 3, 2013 x Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Board Hearing  Dedham, MA  December 3, 2013 x West Roxbury Civic Association West Roxbury, MA  December 11, 2013&#3; The following sections provide a general summary of these initials discussions regarding the traffic management aspects of the Project.  4.1 Town of Westwood As noted earlier, the majority of the construction work in the Town of Westwood will occur on private property and not on Town roads.  However, in addition to discussions concerning general construction activity within the Town, Algonquin also has discussed the work proposed to cross East Street near the Route I-95 rotary.  While the planned work within the Route I-95 state highway layout is under MassDOT jurisdiction, the nature of this work also was discussed.  To date, an introductory meeting was held with the Westwood Department of Public Works (DPW) and the Police and Fire Chiefs on July 18, 2013.  At a Traffic Management Plan 11 AIM PROJECT subsequent meeting on December 9, 2013, local permitting requirements through the Conservation Commission were discussed along with general outreach plans for abutters and other interested parties. Additional meetings with the various town departments involved also have been held on February 14, 2014 and as recently as August 25, 2014 and will continue to occur as the Project advances through the federal, local and state permitting processes.  4.2 Town of Dedham Algonquin has met with representatives of the Town of Dedham to discuss construction plans within Dedham.  An initial meeting was held with the Dedham Engineering Department and Fire Department on July 18, 2013 to discuss general construction activity, potential working days/hours, and traffic management.  Particular attention was given to measures to minimize potential impacts to residents and commercial entities in the area.  The Town’s road repair/restoration requirements relative to the Project also were reviewed as part of these discussions.  Following that initial consultation, Algonquin met with the Town of Dedham DPW Director and Director of Engineering on December 9, 2013. At this meeting the Town requested that a traffic study be provided, and the need for both Dedham and MassDOT approval of appropriate working hours within portions of Providence Highway was discussed.  The expected local permitting required through the Conservation Commission and Board of Selectmen (for potential off-peak works hours) also was reviewed.  Most recently, the Project team met with multiple Town of Dedham department heads on April 14, 2014, July 28, 2014 and August 25, 2014 to update the Town on the status of the Project, and to seek input on various aspects of the proposed alignment and the planned traffic management during construction.  The Project team also made a presentation concerning the Project to the Dedham Board of Selectmen on September 4, 2014 which was carried by local cable television. Algonquin will continue to coordinate with the Town of Dedham throughout the remainder of the planning and construction processes.   4.3 City of Boston The Algonquin team had an introductory meeting with City representatives on July 10, 2013 to provide a general Project overview.  The Project was discussed in greater detail at a subsequent July 25, 2013 meeting attended by representatives of the Boston DPW and Boston Transportation Department (BTD), as well as the Boston Mayor’s Office West Roxbury Coordinator.  The general plans for construction activity and traffic management along the Washington Street and Grove Street corridors were discussed.  The City placed a particular emphasis on the need to address potential concerns of local residents, schools and businesses along these roadways.  Further meetings will be held with BTD and the Boston Department of Public Works as the construction plans are further refined.  This Project also has been entered into the City of Boston Utility Coordination “COBUCS” database so that long-term planning for the timing of this Project relative to other planned projects in the area can begin. 4.4 MassDOT As Route I-95 and portions of Providence Highway are state highways under MassDOT jurisdiction, Algonquin has met with the MassDOT District 6 office in Boston on multiple occasions.  To date, Algonquin has met with MassDOT staff on July 22, 2013 to discuss general traffic management protocol, potential permitting needs associated with the construction, and other transportation-related matters.  An additional meeting was held on December 2, 2013 to discuss these matters in greater detail.  Since that time, the Project team met again at the District 6 office on April 16, 2014 and July 16, 2014 to provide an update on the Project, and additional discussions have occurred since that time.  Algonquin will continue this coordination with MassDOT to refine the traffic management plans as the Project advances. Traffic Management Plan 12 AIM PROJECT 4.5 Project Stakeholders In addition to the agency/municipality coordination outlined above, Algonquin also has engaged various other commercial stakeholders along the affected corridor.  The following section provides a summary of this coordination, which will continue throughout the FERC review process and subsequent construction. 4.5.1 Legacy Place Shopping Center – Dedham   Following the December 3, 2013 public hearing on the Project, Algonquin and representatives from Legacy Place arranged to meet to discuss the planned construction in detail.  This meeting with the management of the Legacy Place shopping center and National Amusements, the operators of the theatre complex at Legacy Place, was held at the National Amusement’s offices in Norwood, Massachusetts on January 27, 2014. Algonquin’s proposal for construction activity in this area at that time was presented, with input, thoughts and concerns of Legacy Place and National Amusements being discussed at length.  A follow-up meeting to continue these discussions was held on March 11, 2014. Most recently, the Project team met with representatives from Legacy Place and National Amusements on July 8, 2014 and August 18, 2014.  The purpose of these meetings was to provide a general update concerning the Project status, particularly with regard to the revised alignment within Rustcraft Road, Elm Street and Providence Highway and the traffic management plans which were being developed to support that alignment.  Both Legacy Place and National Amusements acknowledged that the shift in alignment served to address significantly their concerns when compared to the alignment as initially proposed. Algonquin is committed to continued coordination with Legacy Place, National Amusements and other abutters in this area, throughout the remainder of the permitting and construction process. 4.5.2 West Roxbury Civic and Improvement Association   Algonquin attended the December 11, 2013 meeting of the West Roxbury Civic and Improvement Association.  Approximately thirty local residents were in attendance, along with the City of Boston Ward Councilor Matt O’Malley.  The meeting included a summary of the Project with local residents providing their input and concerns.  In addition to traffic, construction constraints associated with the nearby West Roxbury Crushed Stone quarry were discussed along with the general safety and integrity of the proposed pipeline.  4.5.3 FERC – Public Meeting Algonquin attended the September 8, 2014 public meeting held for the Project at the Dedham Holiday Inn’s conference facilities.  The public meeting was held as part of the FERC process to provide the public with the opportunity to comment, on the record, regarding any general concerns or other matters relating to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.  At the meeting comments were made by roughly thirty attendees concerning a variety of topics including safety, traffic management, schedule and related matters.   Traffic Management Plan 13 AIM PROJECT 5.0 TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS General traffic management plans have been developed and included as part of this submittal. The plans were developed following standards contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD)5. While not all of the affected roadways are under MassDOT jurisdiction, MassDOT’s “Standard Details and Drawings for the Development of Traffic Management Plans” also were reviewed. These resulting plans are expected to be implemented for the majority of the work areas. However, additional site-specific traffic management plans are required for certain key areas where unique conditions or constraints exist. The following section provides a summary of the attached traffic management plans. 5.1 Pedestrian Accommodations Currently there are varying degrees of pedestrian activity within the Project area, with the busier sections being located in the residential areas of Dedham and West Roxbury. For those areas where sidewalks will need to be closed on a temporary basis a proposed pedestrian bypass is provided within the standard details of the traffic management plans. Pedestrians will be maintained on the same side of the roadway and temporary wheelchair ramps will be provided to ramp the pedestrians from the existing sidewalk to the roadway. The pedestrians will be separated from the travel lanes by drums. If the width is not sufficient to accommodate traffic and pedestrian activity, then pedestrians will be directed to cross to the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street or at the closest adjacent intersection. The traffic management plans accompanying this submittal includes details for pedestrian bypasses, sidewalk detours or diversions, and crosswalk closures. These treatments will be implemented within the Project limits as required to help maintain safe and efficient pedestrian accommodations during all phases of construction.  In addition, the work being performed is in an area where there are concentrated sections of predominately retail and commercial business uses. Accordingly, the intent of the traffic management plan for this Project is that access to all properties must be maintained at all times. Safe and ready means of ingress and egress to all stores and shops, public and private and professional offices and any other businesses or residences in the project area, both day and night, shall be provided for the project duration.  If the access needs to be restricted for a short period of time, the contractor shall coordinate with the owner to determine an acceptable time to perform the work. 5.2 Bicycle Accommodations Currently there is limited bicycle activity within the project area. Based on field observations conducted as part of this assessment, most of this activity is oriented towards residential uses at the southerly limits of the project along Elm Street, and further to the north in West Roxbury. Bicyclists currently share the road within the Project study area as shoulder width is minimal and there are not any separate bicycle facilities currently in place.  Therefore, bicycles will be accommodated within normal vehicular traffic. 5.3 Roadway Segment Lane Shifts and Closures The following describes the traffic management details that may be used during construction.  These plans are depicted in the detailed traffic management plans accompanying this submittal. As all roadways that are expected to be impacted by construction provide a variety of general configurations (i.e., multi-lane, 5 U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2009 Edition; Washington DC, December 2009. Traffic Management Plan 14 AIM PROJECT median-divided, etc.), construction activity will be accomplished through one, or a combination, of the described lane closure/shift details. One-lane closure details shall be used in instances where there is a cross-section of two-lanes or more in a single direction and work needs to be performed within or along the edge of the roadway. It is expected that construction for the majority of the study area will be accomplished using this traffic set-up. As this detail will reduce the overall cross section and number of lanes, the roadway capacity would be impacted on a temporary basis as shown in Table 2. Table 2 Arterial Work Zone Capacities HourlyTraffic Range1  Traffic Management Plan Capacity2  Location  Low High Average  Ideal  AverageMeets Lanes3 Capacity4 MassDOT5  Dedham: Elm Street (westbound) Providence Highway (northbound) Providence Highway (northbound) Providence Highway (northbound) East Street West Roxbury (Boston): Washington Street (northbound) Washington Street (southbound)  240 698 545 1,294 1,735 1,545 1,294 1,735 1,545 1,294 1,735 1,545 67 161 124 513 802 692 431 766 628  2 to 1 (WB) 1,340 Yes 3 to 2 (NB) 2,980 Yes 3 to 1 (NB) 1,170 No 2 to 1 (NB) 1,340 No 2 to 1 1,340 Yes  2 to 1 (NB) 1,340 Yes 2 to 1 (SB) 1,340 Yes  Source:  Automatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) Counts conducted in May 2014.  1  Volumes expressed in vehicles per hour and report low, high and average hourly traffic volumes (by direction) between the hours of 7:00 AM  and 7:00 PM.  2  Traffic management plans provided accompanying this evaluation.  3  Indicates the cross sectional change for the corridor; i.e. 2 to 1 indicates that 2 travel lanes will be reduced to 1 travel lane during construction  4  Ideal Average Lane Capacity values obtained from Figure Gen-1, General Guidelines, Standard Details and Drawings for the Development of  Traffic Management Plans, prepared by MassDOT.  5  Indicates whether this section of the corridor will meet the MassDOT guidelines for Average Lane Capacity in a work zone.  As the required details will reduce the overall cross section and number of lanes, the roadway capacity in certain areas will be impacted on a temporary basis. The streets where this condition is applicable all have adequate capacity to accommodate the required lane closures during the planned working hours. As noted earlier, for the entire length of the Providence Highway, corridor work will be restricted to evening hours instead of during the normal daytime working hours that will be utilized for other portions of the Project. Also, the segment of Rustcraft Road (which is generally the continuation of Elm Street to the east of the Robinwood Road/Legacy Place intersection) may require a single lane closure. A site-specific traffic management plan for the boring pit work at the easterly end of Rustcraft Road where the line first will enter the roadway has been prepared.  This will require the closure of the northbound travel lane. Therefore, traffic flow in each direction will need to alternate under the control of police details at this location. The Traffic Management Plan 15 AIM PROJECT next quarter-mile of pipeline installation leading to the Robinwood Road/Legacy Place intersection will occur along the easterly/southerly side of the roadway. While it may be possible for the existing single lanes of traffic to be maintained in both directions, the same single-lane closure treatment described above will be utilized for this area as needed. This segment is not summarized in Table 2 as the Elm Street traffic counts were taken to the west of the Legacy Place driveway, where volumes are considerably higher than on this easterly segment. This conclusion is based on ongoing traffic observations at this location, and the existing restriction of exiting let-turns onto Elm Street from the Legacy Place driveway. Regardless, while the capacity of the easterly segment clearly will be reduced in the event of a single-lane closure, this condition should be manageable on a temporary basis based on the lower volumes for this segment.  The police officer required in conjunction with the traffic management detail will have the ability to manage traffic flow alternating in either direction to avoid any undue impacts on either approach to the work area.        5.3.1 Elm Street (Dedham) – one lane closure   For the majority of its length adjacent to the Legacy Place shopping center in Dedham, Elm Street has a single eastbound lane and two westbound lanes. The gas line installation is now proposed to occur in the curbside area on the eastbound side of the roadway. Therefore, this will require a typical single-lane closure treatment as shown in the accompanying plans. As noted above, these plans are intended to show Algonquin’s general approach to traffic management for a variety of representative conditions. The Elm Street single-lane closure plan is primarily focused on the area extending from the Legacy Place driveway to just east of the Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection. The eastbound Elm Street approach to the Legacy Place driveway currently features an exclusive left-turn lane into that site. Likewise, the westerly segment of the roadway flares to a greater width near the Providence Highway intersection due to the multiple travel lanes on that approach. The extra width available within the roadway cross-section as a result of these existing configurations will allow for two-way traffic flow to be maintained within this segment during construction. As there is no on-street parking on Elm Street and fewer private driveways than on those roadways, there should be additional flexibility in how traffic is managed in this area.   The accompanying plans also include a three-phase treatment showing the traffic management for the crossing from the south side of Elm Street to the north side of the roadway leading to its signalized intersection with Providence Highway. This crossing will occur to the west of the Fox 25 driveway, and was shifted slightly to the west from an earlier alignment proposal. Due to its proximity to the Providence Highway signal, this work will occur during evening hours.  By shifting the crossing further to the west away from nearby residents, evening construction-related impacts to homes to the east will be minimized further compared to the initial proposal. While the capacity of a single lane can generally range from 1,400 to 1,600 vph, the capacity in work zones is further reduced. However, as these volumes are well below the standard capacity level, work-hour limitations should not be necessary strictly from a volume standpoint. Regardless, the Project team will continue to work with the Town of Dedham and the abutting businesses and residents to determine the appropriate work hours and schedule. It is expected that work in the immediate vicinity of the Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection will occur during evening hours to minimize disruptions to traffic flow. The specific traffic management measures that will be required at the signalized Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection are described in detail later in this section.  5.3.2 Providence Highway (Dedham) – northbound lane closures  The pipe installation adjacent to the Legacy Place shopping center now will occur on the left-side of the northbound portion of the roadway adjacent to the center median. Originally, the pipeline was planned to be installed along the right-shoulder/curbside area on the northbound side of the roadway. By shifting the alignment as currently proposed, impacts to the multiple commercial abutters along the easterly side of the Traffic Management Plan 16 AIM PROJECT roadway will be significantly reduced, along with the complexity of the required traffic management plans. With this alignment the travel lane adjacent to the median will need to be closed, leaving two remaining travel lanes in the northbound direction. This condition will continue for 4,400 feet to the north to the point where the northbound approach tapers down from three lanes to two lanes. Additional standard details depicting the three northbound lanes temporarily being shifted into a single lane also have been provided in the accompanying plans in case that treatment should become necessary in the field during construction. Likewise, one phase of construction at the Providence Highway/Elm Street intersection to the south will require the closure of two northbound lanes.  Site-specific traffic management plans have been prepared for this condition as described in detail later in this section.  Historically, MassDOT’s general practice in this area has been to limit weekday construction to between the hours of 9 AM and 3 PM. However, with the required time for construction set up and other factors, it will be more productive and less disruptive for traffic flow to limit work hours to times outside of the peak periods discussed earlier. As shown earlier in Table 2, the average hourly volume on the northbound side of Providence Highway on a typical weekday between 7 AM to 7 PM is approximately 1,545 vehicles per hour (vph). Volumes during the weekday morning and evening peak hours are higher, with 1,634 and 1,735 vph observed, respectively. When two lanes are closed the available capacity would be approximately 1,170 vph. Accordingly, to minimize the impact to traffic and to maximize the length of available working hours for a given day, work will occur exclusively during overnight hours. Given the primarily commercial nature of the Project area along Providence Highway, nighttime construction should have minimal impact on adjacent properties.  5.3.3 East Street (Dedham) – single lane closure  East Street in Dedham is a two-lane residential roadway between High Street and Washington Street.  With the exception of the northerly 150-foot one-way segment approaching its signalized intersection with Washington Street two-way traffic is currently allowed on East Street.  Due to the narrow width of the roadway, it will not be possible to maintain simultaneous two-way travel during most construction. Instead, traffic flow will alternate in both directions separately under police officer detail/flagger control using the traffic management plan shown. The traffic management plans for this roadway include a variety of typical details that will be utilized for the lane shifts, closures and minor intersection crossings that will be encountered along this roadway. 5.3.4 Washington Street (Dedham/West Roxbury) – single lane closure  Similar to Providence Highway, Washington Street is a median-divided multi-lane roadway. Starting at its intersection with East Street, work in this area will occur along the northbound side of Washington Street. During construction, traffic along this roughly one-half mile segment will be managed appropriately using a typical single-/left-lane closure treatment. At Washington Street’s intersection with Rockland Street, the alignment will shift to the southbound side of Washington Street. From that point, the line will cross to the southbound side of Washington Street and continue approximately 1,100 feet to the signalized Washington Street/Grove Street intersection. That work will generally occur adjacent to the center median with traffic being managed through a typical single-lane closure treatment. As this corridor is near capacity during peak periods construction working hours may need to be limited to end prior to the weekday evening peak period, or with other limitations. The exact work schedule and hours for construction will be discussed with the Town of Dedham and City of Boston as part of the ongoing Project coordination. The accompanying traffic management plans include standard details for lane closures and typical treatments for minor intersection crossings. Due to the location of the proposed road opening opposite Curve Street and Lower East Street a two-phase site specific traffic management plan has been developed for that location. The site-specific traffic management plans for the Washington Street/Grove Street intersection also are discussed later in this section.  Traffic Management Plan 17 AIM PROJECT 5.3.5 Grove Street (West Roxbury)    The majority of the approximately 0.5+ miles of work within Grove Street will be on the northbound side of the roadway. The attached plans depict the required lane shifts for this work with accompanying police detail/flagger control.  While the majority of this work should be able to occur with only lane shifts, standard details for single lane closures with accompanying police-control to manage alternating traffic flow in each direction also have been provided. Some on-street parking spaces in certain areas will need to be temporarily removed for portions of construction as shown. These plans may be refined further both during the permitting process and during construction as needed to help ensure that impacts to abutting residents are minimized. Understanding the limited available on-street parking in this area Algonquin will implement measures to minimize the number of construction workers needing to drive to this area and park their own vehicle. 5.3.6 Centre Street (West Roxbury) The remaining 0.70+ miles of work from Centre Street’s intersection with Grove Street to Spring Street will be similar to that along Grove Street. Accordingly, the traffic management will be similar for both segments. As with Grove Street the traffic management plans will continue to be refined to meet the needs of residents along this roadway. Similar to Grove Street, Algonquin will implements measures to minimize construction worker traffic and parking impacts to this area. 5.4 Traffic at Intersections The majority of the intersection work within the study area will be constructed by maintaining at least one lane on all approaches where work is proposed. If a lane needs to be closed, this work shall be conducted during off-peak conditions so that traffic flows are not constrained at the study area intersections.  Details illustrating the traffic management plan for intersections are included in the traffic management plans accompanying this submittal. Traffic operations at some of the more complicated locations within the Project limits are discussed in the following section. 5.4.1 Providence Highway at Elm Street  As noted earlier, a multi-phase traffic management plan will be utilized for work at this location. Due to the heavy traffic volumes documented earlier in this assessment, work at this location will need to occur during evening hours. Work at this location is expected to occur using the following two-phase traffic management approach: Phase 1: With the planned pipeline installation along the northerly side of Elm Street, the existing westbound right-turn lane will be closed on a temporary basis.  During this construction phase, the adjacent exclusive through-lane will temporarily function as a shared through-/right-turn lane.  On the northbound Providence Highway approach, the easternmost through-lane will be blocked off with barrels, but access into the exclusive right-turn lane onto Elm Street will be maintained. Access to the right-turn entrance to Legacy Place to the north of the signal will be maintained during each phase of this traffic management plan.   Phase 2: This phase of traffic management will be implemented for the work involving pipeline installation on the northbound side of Providence Highway adjacent to the median. For this work two of the three Providence Highway northbound through-lanes will need to be closed on both the arriving and departing sides of the intersection. Access to both the northbound left- and right-turn lanes will be maintained during all phases on construction. Due to the location of the proposed Traffic Management Plan 18 AIM PROJECT work, one of the existing two eastbound through-lanes will temporarily be converted to an exclusive left-turn lane as that existing lane’s alignment cannot be maintained during construction.   5.4.2 Providence Highway at Signalized Commercial Parking Lot Driveway  The following traffic management treatments were primarily developed for Providence Highway’s intersection with the Dedham Plaza (Shaw’s Supermarket) and TGI Friday’s/Best Buy driveways. However, certain elements of these plans, along with the typical roadway crossing plans, also may be used for other locations along the corridor, including the Providence Highway/Legacy Boulevard intersection. As noted earlier in this report, work in this area will be limited to evening hours following consultation with MassDOT  Phase 1:  The first segment of work would involve pipeline installation within the southerly potion of the intersection. During this timeframe, the northbound left-turn lane would be closed, and the adjacent northbound through-lane would temporarily be converted to a through-/left-turn lane under police detail control. Both the eastbound and westbound intersection approaches would need to be consolidated into a single lane to avoid the construction within the southerly end of the intersection.      Phase 2: The next phase of traffic management would be required for work within the center of the signalized intersection. The same general approach treatment for Providence Highway northbound would be required, but with a slightly different alignment of traffic approaching from the private driveways to the east and west.  Phase 3: For work within the northerly potion of the intersection traffic management for the northbound Providence Highway and westbound approaches generally would remain unchanged from the prior two phases. However, the eastbound approach generally would be able to function as it does under existing conditions, though under the direction of police officer control during evening construction. As a four-way signalized intersection, the configuration outlined above generally should represent the most complicated condition encountered along the Providence Highway corridor. Accordingly, these traffic management principles, along with those depicted in the general minor roadway crossing treatments, should be appropriate for other locations along Providence Highway. While other locations, such as Providence Highway’s intersection with Legacy Boulevard, have different lane configurations, conditions at those locations are less complicated than those outlined under this four-way signalized intersection configuration. 5.4.3 Providence Highway at Eastern Avenue    Work within this signalized intersection will need to be managed with the following three phases, which will occur during evening hours as noted earlier: Phase 1:  The first segment of work would involve pipeline installation within the southerly portion of the intersection. Currently there are two through-lanes and an exclusive left-turn lane on the Providence Highway northbound approach. During this phase this would be reduced to a single shared through-/right-turn lane and an exclusive left-turn lane. The westbound two-lane approach also would need to be reduced to a single lane to maintain proper traffic alignment between the two intersecting Eastern Avenue approaches. Phase 2:  The second phase of work involves pipeline installation within the center of the intersection. During this phase of construction the general lane configurations outlined above would Traffic Management Plan 19 AIM PROJECT remain unchanged, but with slightly different alignments of the side streets to avoid the center intersection construction.   Phase 3:  The final phase of work at the northerly end of the intersection requires the same general lane configurations outlined above but with slightly different alignments.  The police officer details shown on the accompanying plans will help to avoid conflicts between the Eastern Avenue approaches.  Limiting this work to evening hours will help to minimize impacts at this location.  5.4.4 High Street/Harris Street/East Street intersection    Work within this signalized intersection will need to be managed with a three-phase traffic management plan.  Capacity analysis summarizing operating conditions at this location during construction are provided later in this document.    Phase 1:  The first phase of work involve pipeline installation at the southerly portion of the intersection. During this phase the existing northbound High Street approach will need to be converted to a single lane instead of the current left-/through and right-turn lane combination. Phase 2:  The next phase of construction will involve work within the center of the signalized intersection.  This will require that both the eastbound Harris Street and westbound High Street approaches temporarily being reduced to single lanes without the current exclusive turn lane treatments.  Both the northbound High Street and southbound East Street approaches also will need to have their alignments temporarily shifted to avoid the center intersection construction.  Phase 3: Under this final phase of construction intersection lane use along the northbound High Street and eastbound Harris Street approaches should be returned to their current configurations. However, traffic on the westbound High Street approach will need to be shifted into a single lane to avoid construction on the northerly side of the intersection. Two-way traffic also should be maintained on East Street under police-officer control.  5.4.5 Washington Street at Grove Street    Work within this signalized intersection is planned to occur in the following stages: Phase 1:  The first phase of work involves pipeline installation within the southerly potion of the intersection on the westerly side of the median. Currently the southbound Washington Street approach features an exclusive left-turn lane, a through-lane, and a shared through-/right-turn lane. During this phase of construction the exclusive left-turn lane will be maintained but with only a single shared through-/right-turn lane. The two-lane eastbound Grove Street approach will be reduced to a single shared-lane during this time period. Phase 2:  During the second phase of construction only a single shard-lane will be provided on the Washington Street southbound approach. A single lane also will be provided on the eastbound Grove Street approach. Police officer control will continue to be required to help manage traffic flow during this phase on construction. 5.4.6 Spring Street at Centre Street    Work within this signalized intersection is planned to occur within the following stages to appropriately manage traffic conditions during construction. Capacity analysis summarizing operating conditions for each phase of construction at this location are provided later in this document. Traffic Management Plan 20 AIM PROJECT Phase 1:  The first phase of pipeline installation will occur within the Centre Street northbound channelized right-turn lane.  During this timeframe the adjacent shared left-/through-lane will need to be converted to a single lane accommodating all movements with police details being utilized to help manage traffic flow during this timeframe.   Phase 2:  The second phase of work at this location will involve pipeline installation on the eastbound side of Spring Street. During this period, the two Spring Street eastbound lanes will be reduced to a single shared-lane. Traffic on the Centre Street northbound approach will return to the existing shared left-/through-lane and right-turn lane configuration but with a slightly different alignment approaching the intersection. Phase 3:  The next phase of work at this location will involve construction within the median area and eastbound travel lanes. During this phase the eastbound Spring Street approach will be reduced to a single shared lane. The westbound Spring Street approach also will be converted to two general purpose lanes as a result of the westbound exclusive left-turn lane being eliminated on a temporary basis. Phase 4: During the final phase of construction the pipeline will be installed to meet the exiting line in this area within Spring Street. Under this condition impacts primarily will be limited to the westbound intersection approach. Specifically, the westbound approach will be reduced to a single travel lane accommodating all movements under police-officer control.     5.4.7 Level of Service and Delay Criteria The evaluation criteria used to analyze area intersections in this traffic study are based on the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)6.  The term ‘Level of Service’ (“LOS”) is used to denote the different operating conditions that occur on a given roadway segment under various traffic volume loads.  It is a qualitative measure that considers a number of factors including roadway geometry, speed, travel delay and freedom to maneuver.  LOS provides an index to the operational qualities of a roadway segment or an intersection. LOS designations range from A to F, with LOS A representing the best operating conditions and LOS F representing the worst operating conditions. In addition to LOS, two other measures of effectiveness (MOEs) are typically used to quantify the traffic operations at intersections; volume-to-capacity ratio (v/c) and delay (expressed in seconds per vehicle).  For example, an existing v/c ratio of 0.9 for an intersection indicates that the intersection is operating at 90 percent of its available capacity.  A delay of 15 seconds for a particular vehicular movement or approach indicates that vehicles on the movement or approach will experience an average additional travel time of 15 seconds.  For a given LOS letter designation, there may be a wide range of values for both v/c ratios and delay. Comparison of intersection capacity results therefore requires that, in addition to the LOS, the other MOEs should also be considered. For signalized intersections, the capacity analysis considers the operation of all traffic entering the intersection and the LOS designation is for overall conditions at the intersection. Table 3 shows the LOS criteria for signalized intersections. Transportation Research Board, Highway Capacity Manual, Washington, D.C., 2000. Traffic Management Plan 21 AIM PROJECT Table 3 Level of Service Criteria Level of Service  Delay – Signalized Intersection  A  0 to 10 seconds  B  10 to 20 seconds  C  20 to 35 seconds  D  35 to 55 seconds  E  55 to 80 seconds  F  Greater than 80 seconds  Source: 2000 Highway Capacity Manual Exhibits 16-2 and 17-2. 5.4.8 Signalized Intersection Capacity Analysis Capacity analyses were conducted for key signalized study area intersections where capacity will be reduced on a temporary basis during potential daytime construction hours. For comparison purposes, this analysis was conducted for both current conditions and the temporary conditions involving lane closures at intersections that will occur on a phased basis during construction. A summary of the analysis for the High Street/Harris Street/East Street intersection is presented in Table 4.  The phased construction analysis results for the Spring Street/Centre Street/Temple Street intersection in Table 5.   Traffic Management Plan 22 AIM PROJECT Table 4 Signalized Intersection Capacity Analysis High Street/Harris Street/East Street intersection Traffic Management Plan 23 AIM PROJECT Table 4 (Continued) Signalized Intersection Capacity Analysis High Street/Harris Street/East Street intersection Construction – Phase 2 Construction – Phase 3 95th % 95th % V/Cc Delayb LOSa Queued V/C Delay LOS Queue Weekday AM Harris Street EB LTR 0.07 9.4 A 25 High Street WB LTR 1.20 >120 F #747 High Street NB L N/A N/A N/A N/A High Street NB TR N/A N/A N/A N/A High Street NB LT 0.07 16.2 B 35 High Street NB R 0.21 17.8 B 50 East Street SB LTR 0.04 16.0 B 25 Overall 0.79 80.9 F Weekday Midday  Harris Street EB LTR 0.18 11.8 B 52 High Street WB LTR 1.05 71.3 E #414 High Street NB L N/A N/A N/A N/A High Street NB TR N/A N/A N/A N/A High Street NB LT 0.07 11.4 B 30 High Street NB R 0.22 12.8 B 34 East Street SB LTR 0.02 11.0 B 9 Overall 0.63 39.0 D Weekday Evening Harris Street EB LTR 0.25 12.3 B 66 High Street WB LTR >1.2 >120 F #581 High Street NB L N/A N/A N/A N/A High Street NB TR N/A N/A N/A N/A High Street NB LT 0.07 11.4 B 33 High Street NB R 0.38 14.6 B 53 East Street SB LTR 0.06 11.3 B 21 Overall 0.96 104.9 F 0.89 88.5 F a Volume-to-capacity ratio. b Average delay per vehicle in seconds.

EB = Eastbound; WB = Westbound; NB = Northbound; SB = Southbound;  L = Left; T = Through; R = Right As shown in Table 4, High Street’s intersection with East Street and Harris Street currently operates acceptably under peak-hour conditions and during a typical weekday midday period. However, the required lane closures at this intersection will temporarily impact traffic operations. The analysis indicates that construction during the typical weekday commuter periods could be complicated, but that off-peak daytime construction is feasible through the implementation of the accompanying traffic management plans. However, as the westbound queues approaching the intersection may extend into the adjacent signalized Traffic Management Plan 26 AIM PROJECT intersection to the east, evening construction hours are desirable to minimize any impacts further if permitted by the Town of Dedham. Likewise, traffic generally operates acceptably at the Spring Street/Centre Street intersection in West Roxbury throughout the day under existing conditions. With the planned pipeline construction route, the northbound Centre Street right-turn lane will need to be blocked off temporarily. This treatment will be limited to only one phase of the four traffic management phases planned for this location. The analysis indicates that the intersection can still operate efficiently throughout the day, though lengthy delays are expected on the northbound Centre Street approach to this intersection. However, these impacts will be temporary and the police officer details in place will have the ability to monitor traffic conditions and make adjustments as required. The analysis also indicates that with some of the temporary lane closures, there will be longer than normal delays that occur as a result of the lost capacity. These delays generally should be limited to a single intersection approach during a given phase of the traffic management plan. To avoid excessive delays at this location, work in the vicinity of these intersections should end prior to the late afternoon commuter peak period whenever possible. 5.5 Crosswalks, sidewalks, intersections – various locations   Various portions of the Project will involve temporary closures of sidewalks or crosswalks across streets or intersections. To make sure that safe and appropriate accommodations are available for pedestrians plans have been developed for conditions typically encountered. Additional plans will be developed to address unique conditions, such as areas near schools or densely populated areas. Plans depicting traffic management during the temporary closure of lanes at the center or sides of various intersections also have been developed. Additional site-specific plans will be prepared at locations with more complicated configurations, such as some of the signalized intersections along the Providence Highway corridor.  Traffic Management Plan 27 AIM PROJECT 6.0 CONCLUSION Algonquin has undertaken an extensive process of evaluating the traffic management measures which will be required during construction of the Project.  To date, this effort has involved compiling available traffic count data in the vicinity of the Project and reaching out to the local communities, MassDOT and other stakeholders in order to obtain their input.  The intent of this effort was to quantify existing traffic conditions, review notable traffic patterns, and to use this information to help identify appropriate working hours.  Beyond the standard traffic data analysis, Algonquin also has taken the context of the surrounding area into consideration to help minimize any disruptions or impacts to nearby residences, businesses or schools.  In doing so, there has been an extensive and ongoing community outreach and continued coordination efforts with the various municipalities, agencies and stakeholders involved with the Project.   In response to the thoughts and concerns of these various stakeholders, Algonquin has developed site-specific traffic management plans that will be implemented along the Project corridor.  While the plans provided as part of this current submittal are expected to be utilized for the majority of the work areas, the Project contractor and accompanying police details will be able to implement additional temporary measures as needed.  The general traffic management principles depicted on the attached plans are expected to be carried through for each portion of the Project to help minimize any disruptions to traffic operations in the area.  As a result of the ongoing Project development and coordination with MassDOT, the towns of Dedham and Westwood, and the City of Boston, there have been multiple changes to the proposed pipeline alignment.  With these changes, construction in certain areas, such as Providence Highway, now will require far less intensive traffic management measures than would have been necessary with the initially proposed alignment.  The associated impacts to abutters in certain key areas also should be reduced as a result of the new alignment.    Traffic Management Plan 28 AIM PROJECT ATTACHMENT A SITE SPECIFIC TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS Traffic Management Plan AIM PROJECT TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLANS SHEET INDEX SHEET NO.

It is typically used when the pipeline is to be installed in very close proximity to anexisting stricture or when an open ditch would adversely impact a residential or commercial structure.The technique involves installing pipe one joint at a time whereby the welding, x-ray and coatingactivities are all performed in the open trench. At the end of each day the newly installed pipe isbackfilled or the open trench is covered with steel plates or timber mats. x Drag Section Technique -This technique is also a less efficient alternative to the mainline method. It is normally preferred over the sewer line alternative. This technique involves the trenching,installation and backfill of a prefabricated length of pipe containing several segments all in one day.At the end of each day the newly installed pipe is backfilled or the open trench is covered with steelplates or timber mats. x In the take up and relay segments, the soil cover over the existing pipeline will be excavated toremove the existing pipe. The removed pipe will then be transported away from the constructionwork area and properly disposed. The trench will be backfilled until such time as the constructioncrews are prepared to install the new pipeline. The replacement pipe will be installed in approximatelythe same location as the existing pipe using one of the above construction methods. x Where the pipeline facilities cross residential properties, topsoil will be stripped and stockpiledseparately from the subsoil during grading within the construction workspace as shown on the corresponding Typical ROW Configuration figure ES-0001 x Reseed all disturbed lawns with a seed mixture acceptable to landowner or comparable to the adjoining lawn. x Landowners shall be compensated for damages to ornamental shrubs and other landscape plantingsbased on the appraised value. Landowners shall be compensated for damages in a fair andreasonable manner, and as specified in the damage provision within the controlling easement oneach property. Workspace Restrictions x Existing structures including but not limited to; fences, sheds, swing-sets, trampolines, shrubbery,trees, gardens, flowerbeds, pools will be removed from the CWA. Landowners will be made aware ofwhat will be relocated during negotiations for temporary workspace and damages. x Structures within the existing permanent easement area will be allowed to be returned to the existingpermanent easement provided they are not in violation of Algonquin's existing permanent easementrights that will be made available to landowners. x Structures outside the existing permanent easement, however within the construction work space, willbe replaced as close as practicable to their previous locations. x Removal and replacement responsibility will be an issue that is negotiated with each landowner. Anticipated Construction Schedule x Pipeline construction work is typically scheduled to take advantage of daylight hours, generallystarting at 7:00 a.m. and completing at 6:00 p.m. (6 days a week). x Pipeline installation progress should range from 40' to 200' each day. Public Safety Considerations x Traffic control will consist of devices outlined in state and local codes accompanied by local lawenforcement details and qualified flagmen to safely coordinate transport of pipeline constructionpersonnel, equipment, and material. x Site Security will be evaluated on a case by case basis, employing daily and/or 24 hour qualifiedsecurity services as required. x Algonquin will staff a Landowner Hotline to receive landowner construction concerns. The toll-freeLandowner Hotline is 1-866-873-2579. The Landowner Hotline will be staffed Monday through Fridayfrom 7 AM to 5 PM and on Saturday from 7 AM to 12 PM by Algonquin personnel from the Cheshire,Connecticut field office. After these hours, a call forwarding system will be available to receive callsand page the Complaint Resolution Coordinator. Other Considerations x Fugitive dust will result from land clearing, grading, excavation, concrete work, and vehicle traffic onpaved and unpaved roads. The amount of dust generated will be a function of construction activity,soil type, soil moisture content, wind speed, precipitation, vehicle traffic, vehicle types, and roadwaycharacteristics. Algonquin will employ proven construction-related practices to control fugitive dustsuch as application of water or other commercially-available dust control agents on unpaved areassubject to frequent vehicle traffic. In addition, construction equipment will be operated only on an as-needed basis. x Noise mitigation measures to be employed during construction include ensuring that sound mufflingdevices that are provided as standard equipment by the construction equipment manufacturer arekept in good working order. TOWN OF STONY POINTROCKLAND COUNTY, NEW YORK STRUCTURE SF SF SF EXISTING ROW 50.0'

properties: x Notify local residents in advance of construction activities; x Install safety fence, a minimum 100' on either side of residences as required, along the edge of theproposed Construction Work Area (CWA), to maintain equipment, material, and spoil within the CWA. x Preserve all mature trees and landscaping where practical, consistent with construction safety; x Complete installation of welded pipeline sections as quickly as reasonably possible, consistent withprudent pipeline construction practices, to minimize construction time affecting a neighborhood; x Backfill the trench as soon as the pipe is laid or place temporary steel plates or timber mats over thetrench. x Complete final cleanup (including final grading) and installation of permanent erosion controlmeasures within 10 days after the trench is backfilled, weather conditions permitting. x Configure use of CWA to provide access for emergency vehicles and residential driveways, includingmaterials available on site to provide temporary bridging across the pipeline trench if necessary. x Road surfaces would be restored to drivable condition as soon as practicable so that normal accesscould resume. Construction Techniques One of the following techniques shall be utilized for a longitudinal distance of 100 feet either side of theresidence: x The Sewer Line Technique -this technique is a less efficient alternative to the mainline method of construction. It is typically used when the pipeline is to be installed in very close proximity to anexisting stricture or when an open ditch would adversely impact a residential or commercial structure.The technique involves installing pipe one joint at a time whereby the welding, x-ray and coatingactivities are all performed in the open trench. At the end of each day the newly installed pipe isbackfilled or the open trench is covered with steel plates or timber mats. x Drag Section Technique -This technique is also a less efficient alternative to the mainline method. It is normally preferred over the sewer line alternative. This technique involves the trenching,installation and backfill of a prefabricated length of pipe containing several segments all in one day.At the end of each day the newly installed pipe is backfilled or the open trench is covered with steelplates or timber mats. x In the take up and relay segments, the soil cover over the existing pipeline will be excavated toremove the existing pipe. The removed pipe will then be transported away from the constructionwork area and properly disposed. The trench will be backfilled until such time as the constructioncrews are prepared to install the new pipeline. The replacement pipe will be installed in approximatelythe same location as the existing pipe using one of the above construction methods. x Where the pipeline facilities cross residential properties, topsoil will be stripped and stockpiledseparately from the subsoil during grading within the construction workspace as shown on the corresponding Typical ROW Configuration figure ES-0001 x Reseed all disturbed lawns with a seed mixture acceptable to landowner or comparable to the adjoining lawn. x Landowners shall be compensated for damages to ornamental shrubs and other landscape plantingsbased on the appraised value. Landowners shall be compensated for damages in a fair andreasonable manner, and as specified in the damage provision within the controlling easement oneach property. Workspace Restrictions x Existing structures including but not limited to; fences, sheds, swing-sets, trampolines, shrubbery,trees, gardens, flowerbeds, pools will be removed from the CWA. Landowners will be made aware ofwhat will be relocated during negotiations for temporary workspace and damages. x Structures within the existing permanent easement area will be allowed to be returned to the existingpermanent easement provided they are not in violation of Algonquin's existing permanent easementrights that will be made available to landowners. x Structures outside the existing permanent easement, however within the construction work space, willbe replaced as close as practicable to their previous locations. x Removal and replacement responsibility will be an issue that is negotiated with each landowner. Anticipated Construction Schedule x Pipeline construction work is typically scheduled to take advantage of daylight hours, generallystarting at 7:00 a.m. and completing at 6:00 p.m. (6 days a week). x Pipeline installation progress should range from 40' to 200' each day. Public Safety Considerations x Traffic control will consist of devices outlined in state and local codes accompanied by local lawenforcement details and qualified flagmen to safely coordinate transport of pipeline constructionpersonnel, equipment, and material. x Site Security will be evaluated on a case by case basis, employing daily and/or 24 hour qualifiedsecurity services as required. x Algonquin will staff a Landowner Hotline to receive landowner construction concerns. The toll-freeLandowner Hotline is 1-866-873-2579. The Landowner Hotline will be staffed Monday through Fridayfrom 7 AM to 5 PM and on Saturday from 7 AM to 12 PM by Algonquin personnel from the Cheshire,Connecticut field office. After these hours, a call forwarding system will be available to receive callsand page the Complaint Resolution Coordinator. Other Considerations x Fugitive dust will result from land clearing, grading, excavation, concrete work, and vehicle traffic onpaved and unpaved roads. The amount of dust generated will be a function of construction activity,soil type, soil moisture content, wind speed, precipitation, vehicle traffic, vehicle types, and roadwaycharacteristics. Algonquin will employ proven construction-related practices to control fugitive dustsuch as application of water or other commercially-available dust control agents on unpaved areassubject to frequent vehicle traffic. In addition, construction equipment will be operated only on an as-needed basis. x Noise mitigation measures to be employed during construction include ensuring that sound mufflingdevices that are provided as standard equipment by the construction equipment manufacturer arekept in good working order. TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT x E x x x x XX x SF x PL OH TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT XX SF PL OH x x x x x x x x x TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT F F x  F  x  x  x  x  x  x  XX  SF  x  PL  x  OH  TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT F  F  F  F  F F  F  x x x x x x  XX SF PL OH  F  x x x  F  F  F  F  F  F  F  x x x x x x  XX SF PL OH  F  x x x  F F  F  x  x  x  x  x  x  F  x  XX  SF  x  PL  x  OH  TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT F F x F x x F x x x F x XX F x SF x PL OH TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT E x x x x x x XX x SF x PL OH TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT F x  F  x  x  F  x x  x  x  XX  SF PL  F  x x  OH  TOWN OF DANBURYFAIRFIELD COUNTY, CONNECTICUT F F  x x  x  x  x  x  XX SF PL OH  F  x x x  AIM PROJECTRESIDENTIAL SITE SPECIFIC CROSSING PLANS - DETAIL SHEET General In general, the following measures will be taken in residential properties: x Notify local residents in advance of construction activities; x Install safety fence, a minimum 100' on either side of residences as required, along the edge of theproposed Construction Work Area (CWA), to maintain equipment, material, and spoil within the CWA. x Preserve all mature trees and landscaping where practical, consistent with construction safety; x Complete installation of welded pipeline sections as quickly as reasonably possible, consistent withprudent pipeline construction practices, to minimize construction time affecting a neighborhood; x Backfill the trench as soon as the pipe is laid or place temporary steel plates or timber mats over thetrench. x Complete final cleanup (including final grading) and installation of permanent erosion controlmeasures within 10 days after the trench is backfilled, weather conditions permitting. x Configure use of CWA to provide access for emergency vehicles and residential driveways, includingmaterials available on site to provide temporary bridging across the pipeline trench if necessary. x Road surfaces would be restored to drivable condition as soon as practicable so that normal accesscould resume. Construction Techniques One of the following techniques shall be utilized for a longitudinal distance of 100 feet either side of theresidence: x The Sewer Line Technique -this technique is a less efficient alternative to the mainline method of construction.

This BDP Plan will be kept on-site at all drill locations and will be available and implemented by all proposed personnel described in the following sections of this BDP Plan.  All HDD activities will be managed in accordance with this BDP Plan.  2.0 BEST AVAILABLE DRILLING PRACTICES 2.1 Description of the Work Algonquin will use the HDD method at designated locations to construct the Project.  Two HDDs are proposed. They include:  42-inch Hudson River  HDD – Beginning at approximately MP 3.19 in Stony Point, New York, on the west side of the Hudson River and terminating at approximately MP 3.91 in the Hamlet of Verplank in the Town of Cortlandt, New York on the east side of the Hudson River  42-inch I-84/Still River HDD – Beginning at approximately MP 1.4 in Danbury, Connecticut in the paved portion of the Connecticut Department of Transportation I-84 Rest Area and terminating at approximately MP 2.1 on the east side of Mill Plain Road (U.S. 202/U.S. 6) in the Town of Danbury, Connecticut.  The HDD method always involves establishing staging areas along both sides of the proposed crossing typically at the entry and exit points. The process commences with the boring of a pilot hole into the ground beneath the obstruction, wetland or water body, and then enlarging the hole with one or more passes of a reamer until the hole is the necessary diameter to facilitate the pull-back (installation) of the pipeline.  Once the reaming passes are completed, prefabricated pipe segments are then pulled through the hole to complete the crossing; additional welding between segments will be required.  While the HDD method is a proven technology, there are certain impacts that could occur as a result of the drilling such as the inadvertent release of drilling fluid, which is a slurry of bentonite clay and water which is classified as non-toxic to the aquatic environment and is a non-hazardous substance.  Drilling fluids that are released typically contain a lower concentration of bentonite when they surface because the bentonite is filtered out as its passes through existing sediments of varying types. The proposed drilling program for both HDDs is expected to be initiated and completed in 2015.  The following sections provide the process of HDD and procedures to be implemented in the case of HDD failure or the inadvertent release of drilling fluid. 1 15 U.S.C. §§ 717f(b) and 717f(c) (2006). Best Drilling Practices Plan 1 ALGONQUIN AIM PROJECT 2.2 Background The HDD process uses bentonite-based drilling fluids. The drilling fluids are tested for specific engineering properties to ensure a successful HDD installation. The environmental impact associated with HDD is the inadvertent release of drilling fluids to the surface along the drill alignment during drilling operations.  The drilling fluids are typically a mixture of fresh water and bentonite (sodium montmorillonite). Bentonite is natural clay usually mined in Wyoming.  Bentonite is extremely hydrophilic and can absorb up to ten times its weight in water.  Typically, the drilling fluid contains no more than 5 percent bentonite (95 percent fresh water). The HDD Contractor maintains fluid performance through sampling, testing and recording of the fluid properties during drilling operations; analyzing and then adjusting and maintaining to afford the most efficient drilling fluid rheology to adapt to various geological conditions. The slurry is designed to:  Stabilize the bore hole against collapse; stabilizes formations and prevents fluid loss;  Lubricate, cool, and clean the tooling cutters; cool guidance electronics;  Transport cuttings by suspension to enable flow to the surface at entry/exit points for recycling;  Produce lubrication for drill string and downhole assembly while drilling which reduces friction forces from the formation and pull loads;  Produce hydrostatic fluid pressure in the bore hole to offset ground formation/ground water pressure; and  Drive downhole drill motor for rock drilling. 2.2.1 HDD Working Procedures Prior to drilling operations, site-specific HDD Procedures will be prepared by the HDD contractor and submitted to Algonquin for review and approval.  As a minimum, the HDD Procedures will address the following: Annular Pressure or Release Mitigation – Once it is indicated to the driller that annular pressures are abnormally high or fluid loss is apparent and that a release has occurred, the driller has the following options (or any combination of these options):  Dispatch experienced company personnel observers to monitor the area in the vicinity of the drilled path;  Decrease pump pressure;  Decrease penetration rate;  Temporarily cease drilling operations and shut down mud pump;  Re-start pump and stroke bore hole in 30 ft. +/- lengths to restore circulation (“swab” the hole) as many as 6 times but no fewer than 2 times;  Introduce additional flow along the borehole starting at the entry/exit using “weeper” subs; and  Modify the drilling mud with a change in viscosity and/or lost circulation additives. If inadvertent returns are observed surfacing on the ground surface at a location that is inaccessible; the         following procedures will be followed: Best Drilling Practices Plan 2 ALGONQUIN AIM PROJECT  Contractor will ensure all reasonable measures within the limitations of current technology have been taken to re-establish circulation; and  Continue drilling utilizing a minimal amount of drilling fluid as required to penetrate the formation or to maintain a successful product pull back. 3.0 MONITORING OF INADVERTENT RETURNS 3.1 Personnel and Responsibilities The actions in this BDP Plan are to be implemented by the following personnel: Chief Inspector – Algonquin will designate an HDD Chief  Inspector for the Project. The CI will have overall authority for construction activities that occur on the Project.  Environmental Inspector – At least one Environmental Inspector (“EI”) will be designated by Algonquin to monitor the HDD activities.  The EI will have peer status with all other activity inspectors and will report directly to the HDD CI who has overall authority.  The EI will have the authority to stop activities that violate the environmental conditions of the FERC certificate (if applicable), other federal and state permits, or landowner requirements, and to order corrective action.   HDD Superintendent – is the senior on-site representative of the HDD contractor.  The HDD Superintendent has overall responsibility for implementing this BDP Plan on behalf of the HDD Contractor - The HDD Superintendent will be familiar with all aspects of the drilling activities, the contents of the BDP Plan and the conditions of approval under which the activity is permitted to take place. The HDD Superintendent will make available a copy of this BDP Plan on all drill sites and distribute to the appropriate construction personnel.  The HDD Superintendent will ensure that workers are properly trained and familiar with the necessary procedures for response to an inadvertent release.   HDD Operator – is HDD contractor’s driller operating the drilling rig and mud pumps.  The HDD Operator is responsible for monitoring circulation back to the entry and exit locations and for monitoring annular pressures during pilot-hole drilling.  In the event of loss of circulation or higher than expected annular pressures, the HDD Operator must communicate the event to the HDD Superintendent and HDD contractor field crews as well as the on-site Algonquin inspection staff.  The HDD Operator is responsible for stoppage or changes to the drilling program in the event of observed or anticipated inadvertent returns. HDD Contractor Personnel – during HDD installation, field crews will be responsible to monitor the HDD alignment along with the Applicant’s field representatives’.  Field crews in coordination with the EI are responsible for timely notifications and responses to observed releases in accordance with this BDP Plan.  The EI ultimately must sign off on the action plan for mitigating the release. 3.2 Training Prior to drilling, the HDD Superintendent, CI and the Applicant’s EI will verify that the HDD Operator and field crew receive the following site-specific training but not limited to:  Project specific safety training;  Review provisions of this BDP Plan and site-specific permit requirements;  Review location of sensitive environmental resources at the site;  Review drilling procedures for release prevention;  Review the site-specific monitoring requirements; Best Drilling Practices Plan 3 ALGONQUIN AIM PROJECT  Review the location and operation of release control equipment and materials; and  Review protocols for reporting observed inadvertent returns. 3.3 Monitoring & Reporting Appropriate Monitoring & Reporting actions will be:  If the HDD Operator observes an increase in annular fluid pressure or loss of circulation, the Operator will notify the HDD Superintendent and field crews of the event and approximate position of the tooling;  Where practical, a member of the field crew will visually inspect the ground surface near the position of the cutting head;  If an inadvertent release is observed: o Field crew will notify (via hand-held radio or cell phone) the HDD Operator; o The HDD Operator will temporarily cease pumping of the drilling fluid and notify the HDD Superintendent and CI; o The CI will notify and coordinate a response with the EI; o The EI will notify appropriate permit authorities as necessary of the event and proposed response and provide required documentation within 24 hours; and  The CI will prepare a report that summarizes the incident. 4.0 RESPONSE TO INADVERTENT RETURNS Typically, inadvertent releases are most often detected in an area near the entry or exit points of the drill alignment when the pilot bore is at shallow depths, above bedrock, and in permeable/porous soils.  In these occurrences the release will be assessed by the HDD Superintendent, EI and CI to determine an estimated volume and foot-print of the release.  They will also assess the potential of the release to reach adjacent waterbodies, wetlands, or other types of infrastructure.  The HDD Superintendent will assess the drilling parameters (depth, annular pressures, fluid flow rate and drill fluid characteristics) and incorporate appropriate changes.  The HDD Superintendent, EI, and CI will implement installation of appropriate containment structures and additional response measures.  Access for personnel and equipment to the release site is a major factor in determining the methods used for containment and disposal.  Typically, containment is achieved by excavating a small sump pit (5 cubic yards) at the site of the release and to surround the release with hay bales, silt fence and/or sand bags.  Once contained, the drilling fluid is either collected by vacuum trucks or pumped back to the mud recycle unit, or to a location where vacuum trucks can be accessed. The fluids are then transported either back to the HDD Drilling Rig or to a disposal site. If the release is mitigated and controlled, forward progress of the drilling will be approved by the EI in coordination with the HDD Superintendent and CI. The site-specific response will follow these guidelines: 4.1 Upland Location  Evaluate the amount of release to determine if containment structures are warranted and if they will effectively contain the release. Best Drilling Practices Plan 4 ALGONQUIN AIM PROJECT  Promptly implement appropriate containment measures as needed to contain and recover the slurry.   If the release is within 50-foot of a wetland or waterbody, silt fence and/or hay bales will be installed between the release site and the wetland or waterbody.  If the release cannot be contained, then the operator must suspend drilling operations until appropriate containment is in place.  Remove the fluids using either a vacuum truck or by pumping to a location where a vacuum truck is accessible.  After the HDD installation is complete, perform final clean-up (see Section 5). 4.2 Wetland Location Algonquin’s proposed HDD’s are being designed to minimize the potential for inadvertent releases to the HDD crossing locations.  Although final design is still in progress, Algonquin expects that the I-84/Still River HDD will be a rock drill thereby limiting the potential for inadvertent returns to occur.  To further minimize the potential for inadvertent returns, casing will be installed through overburden soils to the bedrock interface (as feasible) at both ends of the HDD. Even with these controls in place, if a release of drilling fluids does occur the following steps will be taken:  Evaluate the amount of release to determine if containment structures are warranted and if they will effectively contain the release.   Promptly implement appropriate containment measures to contain and recover the slurry; o Efforts to contain and recover slurry in wetlands may result in further disturbance by equipment and personnel, and possibly offset the benefit gained in removing the slurry. o If the amount of the slurry is too small to allow the practical collection from the affected area, the fluid will be diluted with fresh water or allowed to dry and dissipate naturally.  If the release cannot be controlled or contained, immediately suspend drilling operations until appropriate containment is in place.  Remove the fluids using either a vacuum truck or by pumping to a location where a vacuum truck is accessible.  After the HDD installation is complete, perform final clean-up (see Section 5). 4.3 Hudson River Crossing Due to geotechnical limitations and the extreme depth of the bedrock profile, the Hudson River HDD has been designed to be a soft soil HDD.  This crossing method is consistent with the successful HDD crossing of the Hudson River that was completed by Spectra Energy in 2013 as part of the NJ-NY Expansion Project.  Because the crossing of the Hudson River will occur in soft soils, casing will be driven deep into the substrata at both ends of the HDD and will remain in place for the duration of the crossing. This will allow flow of drilling fluids from the drill path below the river bed back to the surface. Because this crossing is categorized as a “soft” crossing by passing through organics, silt and sands, the drilling process will occur quite quickly as opposed to a hard rock crossing.  While it is possible for some drilling fluid to inadvertently release to the river bed, the volume would be minimal and would not accumulate due to the rapid drilling rates.  Additionally, Algonquin’s  contractor will drill the pilot holes from both sides of this crossing and perform an intersect, thereby decreasing the distance, and subsequently decreasing the resistance/pressure required for the drilling fluid to travel back to the entry points via the conductor casing. Because of the design, the river current, marine traffic, existing turbidity and other pollutants that contribute to the discoloration of the major water body locations it is extremely unlikely any inadvertent Best Drilling Practices Plan 5 ALGONQUIN AIM PROJECT returns could be identifiable and any amount of accumulation will not occur other than that described above.  Algonquin will remove the drilling fluid as described above in the near shore areas of the Hudson River if required. Algonquin does not believe it is feasible to identify, safe or technically possible to effectively perform any reclamation of inadvertent returns that in all probability will never accumulate in the navigation channels of the major waterbody crossings. 5.0 CLEAN-UP After completion of the HDD installation, site-specific clean-up measures will be developed by the CI, HDD Superintendent, for approval by the EI.  Potential for secondary impact from the clean-up process is to be evaluated and benefits of clean-up activities. The following measures are considered appropriate:  Drilling mud will be cleaned up by hand using hand shovels, buckets and soft bristled brooms minimizing damage to existing vegetation;  Fresh water washes may be employed if deemed beneficial and feasible;  Containment structures will be pumped out and the ground surface scraped to bare topsoil minimizing loss of topsoil or damage to adjacent vegetation;   The recovered drilling fluid will be recycled or disposed of at an approved upland location or disposal facility. No recovered drilling fluid will be disposed of in streams or storm drains  All containment structures will be removed; and  Recovered materials will be collected in containers for temporary storage prior to removal from the site.  Best Drilling Practices Plan 6 ALGONQUIN AIM PROJECT Site-Specific Horizontal Directional Drill Crossing Plans NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION J-1420140929-5299 FERC PDF (Unofficial) 9/29/2014 4:04:30 PM APPENDIX K WETLAND CROSSINGS TABLE K-1 Wetlands Crossed by the AIM Project  Facility, State, Wetland ID  NWI Classification a  Enter Milepost b  Exit Milepost b  Town  County  Crossing Length (feet) c  Total Wetland Acreage Impacted d  Total Forested Wetland Acreage Impacted d  Total Wetland Acreage Impacted by Maintene ance  Total Forested Wetland Acreage Impacted by Maintene ance  Within Existing ROW  Outside of Existing ROW  PIPELINE FACILITIES  New York  Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay  B13-RLR-W1  PEM/PFO  0.24  0.24  Haverstraw  Rockland  9.77  0.15  0.00  0.01  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W2  PEM/PFO  0.54  0.56  Haverstraw  Rockland  102.08  0.78  0.05  0.07  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W2  PEM/PFO  0.57  0.58  Haverstraw  Rockland  57.38  B13-RLR-W2  PEM/PFO  0.58  0.63  Haverstraw  Rockland  226.03  B13-RLR-W2  PEM/PFO  0.66  0.68  Haverstraw  Rockland  68.51  B13-RLR-W3f  PEM/PFO  0.77  1.01  Haverstraw  Rockland  1,299.46  1.97  0.81  0.50  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W3f  PEM/PFO  1.04  1.08  Haverstraw  Rockland  212.67  B13-RLR-W4  PEM/PSS  1.62  1.65  Stony Point  Rockland  184.56  0.22  0.06  0.05  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W5  PEM/PFO  2.13  2.14  Stony Point  Rockland  77.73  0.24  0.03  0.06  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W6  PSS/PEM/PFO  2.14  2.16  Stony Point  Rockland  87.10  0.08  0.22  0.21  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W6  PSS/PEM/PFO  2.24  2.25  Stony Point  Rockland  20.67  B13-RLR-W7  PSS  2.42  2.44  Stony Point  Rockland  0.00  0.02  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W8  PSS/PEM  2.66  2.75  Stony Point  Rockland  0.00  0.39  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W9  PSS/PEM  2.96  2.96  Stony Point  Rockland  27.63  0.03  0.05  0.05  0.00  0.00  B13-RLR-W10  PEM/PFO  3.03  3.05  Stony Point  Rockland  0.00  0.01  0.01  0.01  0.00  0.00  Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up and Relay  B13-SPLR-W40  PFO/PEM  1.27  1.28  Stony Point  Rockland  43.97  0.04  0.01  0.00  0.00  0.00  B13-SPLR-W37g  PFO  1.90  1.91  Stony Point  Rockland  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  A14-SPLR-W101  PEM  2.98  2.99  Stony Point  Rockland  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  B13-SPLR-W50  PFO/PSS/PEM  4.44  4.45  Cortlandt  Westchester  0.00  0.00  0.17  0.17  0.05  0.05  B13-SPLR-W203  PEM  4.56  4.56  Cortlandt  Westchester  0.00  0.00  0.02  0.02  0.00  0.00  B13-SPLR-W205  PFO  4.74  4.74  Cortlandt  Westchester  0.00  0.00  0.04  0.04  0.01  0.01  APPENDIX L BEDROCK GEOLOGY TABLES APPENDIX L TABLE L-1 Bedrock Geology of the Pipeline Facilities for the AIM Project  Length Facility/Geologic Unit (miles) Description  Take-up and Relay Haverstraw to Stony Point Hornblende granite and granite 3.3 Middle Proterozoic age hornblende granite and granite gneiss with gneiss subordinate leucogranite.

This Plan includes a brief description of the Project, a listing of the types and area of temporary and permanent impacts to wetlands and waterbodies, and a description of the mitigation provided for the Project.  Several versions have been filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC” or “Commission”) and other agencies to satisfy their respective regulatory requirements.  This Plan consolidates the mitigation approach on a Project-wide basis and provides updated wetland and water body impact numbers based on recent Project modifications made to minimize wetland impacts. The Project will result in impacts, both temporary and permanent, to freshwater wetland functions and values in Connecticut and New York; however, there is no permanent wetland fill proposed and no wetland area will be lost due to the Project. As part of their review under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) are requiring the preparation of mitigation plans for Connecticut and New York.  Compensatory mitigation is being required for permanent conversion of forested wetlands to non-forested conditions for maintenance of new project right-of-ways. The USACE New England District and The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (“CTDEEP”) have agreed to accept payment to the State of Connecticut’s in-lieu-fee (“ILF”) program in lieu of a permitteesupplied mitigation project. The details of this arrangement are further described in Section 3.2.2. The State of New York does not have an ILF program established for the project area, thus, Algonquin will implement on- and off-site mitigation measures to offset forested conversion impacts. These mitigation measures are described in detail in Algonquin’s Proposed Mitigation Plan for the AIM Project Facilities in New York in Appendix A. 2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION Algonquin, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Spectra Energy Partners, LP, is seeking authorization from the FERC pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act2 (“NGA”) to construct, install, own, operate, and maintain the AIM Project which will involve expansion of its existing pipeline system located in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  Algonquin is also seeking authorization pursuant to Section 7(b) of the NGA3 to abandon certain segments of existing mainline pipeline as a related component of the AIM Project.  The AIM Project will create 342,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity to deliver natural gas to the Northeast markets to meet immediate and future supply and load growth requirements of the Project Shippers.  Specifically, the Project will create additional pipeline capacity from the Ramapo, New York receipt point on the Algonquin system to various Algonquin city gate delivery points in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.  The target in-service date for the AIM Project is November 1, 2016. The AIM Project includes the construction of approximately 37.4 miles of take-up and relay, loop and lateral pipeline facilities, modifications to six existing compressor stations resulting in the addition of 81,620 horsepower (“hp”) of compression, modifications to 24 existing metering and regulating (“M&R”) stations, the construction of three new M&R stations and the removal of one existing M&R station.  These proposed Project facilities are located in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  A complete discussion of the proposed Project facilities follows. 1 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387 2 15 U.S.C. §§ 717f(b) and 717f(c) (2006). 3 15 U.S.C. § 717P(b) (2006). Final Mitigation Plan 1 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Proposed Pipeline Facilities The proposed AIM Project includes approximately 37.4 miles of pipeline composed of the following facilities: • Construction of approximately 20.1 miles of mainline pipeline, comprised of the following: o Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up & Relay - Take-up and relay 3.3 miles of 26-inch diameter pipeline with 42-inch diameter pipeline in Rockland County, New York upstream of Algonquin’s existing Stony Point Compressor Station; o Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay - Take-up and relay 9.4 miles of 26-inch diameter pipeline with 42-inch diameter pipeline and the installation of an approximately 2.9-mile section of new pipeline right-of-way (“ROW”) that includes a 0.7-mile horizontal directional drill (“HDD”) crossing of the Hudson River.  This 12.3-mile segment is located in Rockland County, New York and Westchester County, New York downstream of Algonquin’s existing Stony Point Compressor Station; and o Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up & Relay - Take-up and relay 4.5 miles of 26-inch diameter mainline pipeline with 42-inch diameter pipeline (including a new 0.7-mile long, 42-inch diameter HDD pipeline crossing of Interstate 84 and the Still River) located in Putnam County, New York and Fairfield County, Connecticut downstream of and between Algonquin’s existing Southeast Compressor Station and mainline valve (“MLV”) 19; • Line-36A Loop Extension- Installation of 2.0 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline loop extension in Middlesex County, Connecticut and Hartford County, Connecticut downstream of Algonquin’s existing Cromwell Compressor Station; • E-1 System Lateral Take-up & Relay - Take-up and relay 9.1 miles of 6-inch diameter pipeline with 16-inch diameter pipeline on Algonquin’s existing E-1 System in New London County, Connecticut; • E-1 System Lateral Loop - Installation of 1.3 miles of 12-inch diameter pipeline loop on Algonquin’s existing E-1 System in New London County, Connecticut; and • West Roxbury Lateral - Installation of 4.09 miles of new 16-inch diameter pipeline and 0.81 miles of new 24-inch diameter pipeline off of Algonquin’s existing I-4 System in Norfolk and Suffolk Counties, Massachusetts. Modifications to Existing Algonquin Compressor Stations Algonquin will modify six existing Algonquin compressor stations to add an additional 81,620 hp to its pipeline system as part of the AIM Project.  This increase in horsepower will be achieved with the installation of six new compressor units.  The proposed compressor modifications include the following: Stony Point Compressor Station - Rockland County, New York  Install two (2) Solar Mars 100 (15,900 hp each) natural gas-fired compressor units;  Restage one (1) existing compressor driven by a Solar Taurus 60 natural gas-fired turbine;  Install gas cooling for the new units; and  Station piping modifications. Southeast Compressor Station - Putnam County, New York  Install one (1) Solar Taurus 70 (10,320 hp) natural gas-fired turbine compressor unit; Final Mitigation Plan 2 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT  Restage one (1) existing compressor driven by a Solar Taurus 70 natural gas-fired turbine;  Replace the compressor body driven by an existing Solar Mars 90 natural gas fired turbine;  Install gas cooling for the new unit; and  Station piping modifications. Oxford Compressor Station – New Haven County, Connecticut  Restage one (1) existing compressor driven by a Solar Taurus 60 natural gas-fired turbine; Cromwell Compressor Station - Middlesex County, Connecticut  Install one (1) Solar Mars 100 (15,900 hp) natural gas-fired turbine compressor unit;  Install gas cooling for the new unit and two (2) existing turbine compressor units; and  Station piping modifications. Chaplin Compressor Station - Windham County, Connecticut  Install one (1) Solar Taurus 60 (7,700 hp) natural gas-fired turbine compressor unit;  Restage two (2) existing compressors driven by Solar Taurus 60 natural gas-fired turbines;  Install gas cooling for the new unit and two (2) existing turbine compressor units; and  Station piping modifications. Burrillville Compressor Station - Providence County, Rhode Island  Install one (1) Solar Mars 100 (15,900 hp) natural gas-fired turbine compressor unit;  Restage two (2) existing compressors driven by Solar Taurus 60 natural gas-fired turbines;  Install gas cooling for the new unit; and  Station piping modifications. Modifications to Existing Algonquin M&R Stations The AIM Project will include modifications to 24 existing Algonquin M&R stations in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, to accept the new gas flows associated with the AIM Project.  Three M&R stations are located in New York, 13 are located in Connecticut and eight are located in Massachusetts.  The types of modifications will include the replacement of existing heaters and metering facilities, piping modifications, and facility uprates.  In addition, one existing M&R station (Greenville) will be removed in Connecticut. Modifications at 21 of these existing stations are minor in nature and will take place within the existing fenced facilities.  Three of the remaining M&R stations will require complete reconstruction and one will be decommissioned and removed (Greenville M&R).  The stations requiring reconstruction are all in Connecticut and include the Willimantic M&R Station, Guilford M&R Station and Glastonbury M&R Station.  The Glastonbury and Guilford M&R stations will be rebuilt within the same station footprint while the Willimantic M&R Station will be rebuilt on a new parcel of land being acquired by Algonquin adjacent to the existing station property. Construction of New Algonquin M&R Stations Algonquin will construct three new M&R stations: two are located in Bristol and Suffolk counties in Massachusetts and one is located in New London County, Connecticut.  • Construct one (1) new M&R station in Connecticut: o Oakland Heights M&R Station – construct a new M&R station, including regulation, in the City of Norwich, New London County. • Construct two (2) new M&R stations in Massachusetts: Final Mitigation Plan 3 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT o Assonet M&R Station – construct a new M&R station, including regulation, in the Town of Freetown, Bristol County; and West Roxbury M&R Station – construct a new M&R station, including regulation, in the City of Boston, Suffolk County. 3.0 WETLANDS Wetlands are defined by the USACE as areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions, including swamps, marshes, bogs, and bottomlands.  Algonquin delineated wetland boundaries using the methodology described in the USACE’s Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental Laboratory, 1987) and Regional Supplement to the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual: Northcentral and Northeast Region (Version 2).  The 1987 Manual and more recent supplements identify three environmental factors to consider when making wetland determinations: indicators of hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soil, and wetland hydrology. 3.1 Wetlands within the Project Area Field surveys were conducted within a 300-foot wide study area across the Project area to identify and map wetlands, except for the West Roxbury Lateral where the study corridor was variable due to the developed nature of that route.  Based on this survey, a total of 160 wetland crossings were identified in the AIM Project construction workspace; 76 in New York and 84 in Connecticut. The AIM Project facilities proposed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts will not cross any wetlands.     3.1.1 Pipeline Facilities New York The AIM Project facilities in New York will cross 76 wetland areas.  These wetlands are primarily characterized as palustrine emergent (“PEM”) wetlands that are generally dominated by Phragmites australis in the ROW and as palustrine forested (“PFO”) wetlands off the maintained ROW.  Wetlands along the Haverstraw to Stony Point Take-up and Relay segment were located in areas of topographic relief given that this survey area is extremely hilly.  Sloping stream drainages were often associated with bordering wetlands.  A particularly large wetland system in the Town of Haverstraw is associated with tributaries to Minisceongo Creek.  In the Town of Cortland, there is a large wetland system encountered in the drainage area of Dickey Brook and its tributaries, and within the Blue Mountain Reservation there are also a few large wetland systems crossed by the Project.  Wetlands within the maintained pipeline ROW along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay segment are also often dominated by Phragmites australis while the off-ROW sections are primarily wooded.  New York State has mapped wetland areas that are regulated under its Freshwater Wetlands Act.  There are five New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”) mapped wetlands that are crossed or are in close proximity to the pipeline ROW along the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay pipeline.  Algonquin discussed and confirmed these crossings in a meeting with NYSDEC on December 5, 2013.  These NYSDEC wetlands are as follows: • Town of Cortlandt o NYSDEC Wetland P-3 – This is a Class 1 wetland that is crossed by the Stony Point to Yorktown Take-up & Relay pipeline between milepost (“MP”) 7.70 and MP 7.85.  This NYSDEC mapped wetland has been field delineated as B13-SPLR-W13 for the AIM Project. o NYSDEC Wetland P-1 – This is a Class 2 wetland that is crossed between MP 8.50 and MP 8.75.  This NYSDEC mapped wetland has been field delineated as A13-SPLR-W2 for the AIM Project. o NYSDEC Wetland A-35 – This is a Class 2 wetland that is crossed in two areas north of Crompond Road.  The first wetland crossing occurs between MP 10.63 and MP 10.68 and the second is crossed between MP 10.79 and MP 10.81.  These wetlands have been assigned the following identification numbers for the AIM Project: B13-SPLR-W23 and B13-SPLR-W25. • Town of Yorktown o NYSDEC Wetland A-10 – This is a Class 2 wetland that is crossed between MP 11.04 and MP 11.12 on the east side of Lexington Avenue.  This wetland has been field delineated as B13-SPLR-W26 for the AIM Project. • Town of Southeast Final Mitigation Plan 4 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT o NYSDEC Wetland BR-36 – This is a Class 2 wetland that is located along the western edge of the existing Southeast Compressor Station in Putnam County.  The proposed work at the compressor station will not impact this wetland but construction workspace is located within the 100-foot Adjacent Area.  This wetland has been field delineated as A13-SECSW1 for the AIM Project. Connecticut The AIM Project facilities in Connecticut will cross a total of 84 wetland areas.  These wetlands vary greatly between segments but generally consist of PEM/Palustrine Scrub-Shrub (“PSS”) wetlands within the existing ROW and PFO wetlands outside the existing ROW.  The Southeast to MLV 19 Take-up & Relay pipeline segment crosses 23 wetland areas.  Notable are three large wetland systems, one associated with the Sawmill River, one located at MP 0.17 in Danbury, and a third associated with the Still River at MP 1.74.  The wetland system associated with the Still River will be crossed by utilizing the HDD method.  The majority of the remaining small wetlands are located within heavy residential areas, most often represented in the ROW as PEM wetlands, with many of the wetlands dominated by the aggressive invasive grass species, Phragmites australis. The Line-36A Loop Extension pipeline segment crosses 11 wetland areas, all associated with streams.  This segment of the pipeline is located in an area of relatively flat topography. There is a PEM/PFO wetland system associated with Coles Brook between MP 0.03 and MP 0.14.  A tributary to Dividend Brook is associated with a large wetland system dominated by Phragmites australis that contains several small intermittent streams and an open water area.  The remaining wetlands are generally associated with Dividend Brook and often dominated by Phragmites australis and an assortment of other invasive and native shrubs and forbs in the ROW. The E-1 System Lateral Take-up & Relay pipeline segment runs northwest to southeast in a generally parallel orientation with Susquetonscut Brook from MP 0.0 to MP 6.0.  As a result of this alignment, there are numerous wetland crossings along this stretch that are associated with minor tributaries of Susquetonscut Brook.  Outside the maintained ROW, the wetland cover type is primarily PFO with pockets of PSS, and the floodplain of the Susquentonscut Brook in this area is generally PEM. On ROW wetlands are primarily classified as PEM/PSS.  South of MP 6.0, the wetlands crossed by the pipeline are associated with small intermittent and ephemeral streams and drainages, the largest wetlands being located at MP 7.3 Final Mitigation Plan 5 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT and between MP 8.7 and 8.9.  These wetlands were classified as PEM wetlands within the ROW and most often classified as PFO wetlands outside the ROW. The E-1 System Lateral Loop pipeline segment crosses six wetland areas consisting of one large wetland system and three smaller wetland systems along the maintained pipeline ROW.  The largest wetland system is crossed between MP 0.31 and MP 0.49 and is predominantly a PFO wetland with a minor stream.  Rhode Island There are no wetland impacts in Rhode Island. Massachusetts There are no wetland impacts in Massachusetts. 3.1.2 Aboveground Facilities As proposed, the aboveground facilities will not impact wetlands.   3.2 Waterbodies within the Project Area A total of 102 surface waterbody crossings will occur during construction of AIM Project pipeline facilities. These include 36 perennial stream crossings, 62 intermittent stream crossings, three ephemeral stream crossings and one ponded waterbody crossing.  Of these 102 waterbody crossings, 85 are minor crossings (less than 10 feet wide), 16 are intermediate crossings (10 to 100 feet wide), and one is a major crossing, the Hudson River (greater than 100 feet wide).  Two of the 102 waterbodies are classified as estuarine waterbodies at the pipeline crossing while the remaining 100 are freshwater waterbodies. In accordance with the FERC’s Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures (“FERC Procedures”), all waterbody crossings will be completed within 24 to 48 hours. Stream bed and bank contours will be restored in accordance with the FERC Procedures and waterbody banks will be stabilized as soon as possible after construction activities have been completed to prevent sloughing. Stream functions should be quickly restored following restoration activities. 3.3 Wetland Impacts and Mitigation Construction of the AIM Project will result in temporary impacts to 52.5 acres of wetlands.  Of this amount, 23.9 acres will be impacted by the New York pipeline facilities and 28.6 acres will be impacted by the Connecticut pipeline facilities.  Impacts to wetlands associated with the Hudson River in New York and the Still River in Connecticut will be avoided as Algonquin intends to cross these areas utilizing the HDD method.  Algonquin is also evaluating the feasibility of performing an HDD crossing of the Susquetonscut Brook in Franklin, CT (the technical feasibility is yet to be determined. As a result, the impacts discussed in this Plan assume an HDD will not be used).  No wetlands will be affected in Rhode Island or Massachusetts and based on current design no wetlands will be affected during construction at existing and proposed aboveground facilities.   In Connecticut and New York, construction of the proposed pipeline segments will result in temporary impacts to 35.5 acres of emergent and scrub-shrub wetlands and 17.0 acres of forested wetlands. Approximately 2.4 acres of forested wetland will be permanently converted to non-forested cover types and maintained by means of mechanical cutting and mowing as part of pipeline operation and maintenance. Final Mitigation Plan 6 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT The remaining 14.6 acres of forested wetland will be restored or otherwise allowed to revert to a forested state following construction and restoration of the ROW as further discussed below.  3.3.1 Onsite Mitigation and Restoration Measures Construction and mitigation activities in wetlands will be conducted in accordance with the procedures and best management practices (“BMPs”) in the AIM Project Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (“E&SCP”) and the conditions of related permits.  The AIM Project E&SCP was developed using the FERC’s Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan and Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures.  Also reflected in the AIM Project E&SCP is Algonquin’s significant experience and practical knowledge of pipeline construction and effective environmental protection measures.  Lessons and insights gained from past construction projects have been incorporated into the AIM Project E&SCP. Recommended practices include, wherever practical:  A reduction of construction corridor widths where possible;  A 50-foot setback for additional temporary workspace for wetlands;  Minimization of riparian clearing to the extent practicable while ensuring safe construction conditions;  Expedited construction in and around wetlands;  Confinement of stump removal to the trench-line to minimize soil disturbance (unless safety or access considerations require stump removal elsewhere);   Return of wetland bottoms and drainage patterns to their original configurations and contours to the extent practicable;  Permanent stabilization of upland areas near wetlands as soon as practicable after trench backfilling to reduce sediment run-off;  Segregation of topsoil in unsaturated wetlands to preserve the native seed source (which will facilitate re-growth of herbaceous vegetation once pipeline installation is complete);  Utilization of recommended seed mixes as specified by relevant land management agencies;  Periodic inspection of the construction corridor during and after construction;  Post-construction wetland monitoring to evaluate the progress of wetland revegetation; and  Documentation of invasive species prior to construction and post-construction monitoring to compare pre- and post-construction occurrences. In accordance with the AIM Project E&SCP, Algonquin will conduct post-construction maintenance and monitoring of the ROW in affected wetlands to assess the success of restoration and revegetation. Monitoring efforts will include documenting occurrences of exotic invasive species to compare to preconstruction conditions. To assist with these periodic monitoring and surveillance efforts, and to comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 192), a 30-foot corridor centered on the pipeline will routinely be cleared of woody growth greater than 15 feet in height, with a 10-foot strip centered over the pipeline being maintained in an herbaceous state.  Because of this vegetation maintenance restriction within wetlands, 40 feet of Algonquin’s 50-foot wide permanent ROW easement within wetlands will be allowed to revert to PSS and up to 20 feet will be allowed to periodically return to a PSS/PFO state.   Final Mitigation Plan 7 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 3.3.2 Compensatory Mitigation Federal The USACE will usually require compensatory mitigation (e.g., purchase of mitigation credits, payment of in-lieu fee, development of a site-specific mitigation plan) for loss of “waters of the U.S.” greater than 0.10 acre.  As previously noted, no permanent loss of “waters of the U.S.” will occur as a result of the AIM Project.  During pipeline trenching operations, fill placement (side-cast material) will be placed back in the pipeline trench. The USACE considers this permanent fill placement even though wetland side-cast material is being replaced in the same trench where it was excavated. The wetland impacts resulting from the fill placement are temporary since the wetland will continue to function as a wetland.  PEM wetlands impacted during construction will be restored in accordance with the FERC Procedures. These areas should quickly recover following construction. Compensatory mitigation for temporary effects to PEM wetlands is not proposed.  PSS wetlands impacted during construction will be restored in accordance with the FERC Procedures. Although the herbaceous understory within these areas should quickly recover following construction, there may be a temporal lag before the sub-canopy reaches maturity.  Compensatory mitigation for temporary effects to PSS wetlands is not proposed. PFO wetland areas not within the maintained permanent ROW impacted during construction will also be restored in accordance with the FERC Procedures.  Although these areas will remain in a wetland state, there is a temporal time lag associated with these areas regaining their wetland canopy function.  Similarly, forested wetland areas that are located within the proposed new permanent ROW areas will remain in a wetland state but will permanently lose their forested canopy. Algonquin proposes to provide mitigation for the PFO wetland areas that will be temporarily and permanently affected (through conversion to PEM) as a result of the Project. The USACE New England District will accept payment to an in-lieu fee program4 for PFO wetland impacts in Connecticut. A permit applicant may make a payment to an in-lieu fee program that will conduct wetland, stream or other aquatic resource restoration, creation, enhancement, or preservation activities. In-lieu fee programs are generally administered by government agencies or non-profit organizations that have established an agreement with the regulatory agencies to use in-lieu fee payments collected from permit applicants. On August 21, 2013, the USACE established the final executed instrument for the CT ILF Program.  The National Audubon Society is the sponsor. The USACE New York District has agreed to on-site mitigation for temporary PFO wetland impacts (e.g. onsite restoration to include replanting workspace, controlling invasive species and monitoring).  However, the USACE New York District will require off-site mitigation for permanent impacts to forested wetlands from the establishment of new maintained ROW.  The state-specific mitigation plans, where applicable, are described below. Connecticut The CTDEEP has agreed to accept the In-Lieu payment proposed under the USACE requirements. Algonquin continues to coordinate with the USACE and CTDEEP to finalize the payment requirements to Details on the use of the in-lieu fee program are available at http://www.usace.army.mil/Portals/2/docs/civilworks/regulatory/final_mitig_rule.pdf. Final Mitigation Plan 8 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT the In-Lieu Fee Program. Algonquin has provided the agencies with all the requested Project-related information to establish an appropriate In-Lieu fee amount.  New York The mitigation plan for New York Facilities of the Project is included as Appendix A.  Massachusetts There are no wetland impacts associated with proposed Massachusetts Project facilities and, therefore, no compensatory mitigation is proposed in Massachusetts. Rhode Island There are no wetland impacts associated with proposed Rhode Island Project facilities and, therefore, no compensatory mitigation is proposed in Rhode Island. 4.0 REFERENCES Environmental Laboratory.

Plan for AIM New York Facilities iii ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT INTRODUCTION This Appendix A to the AIM Project Final Mitigation Plan, focuses on mitigation for those portions of work located in the State of New York.  Algonquin submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) New York District an addendum to the Conceptual Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities in July, 2014. The July Draft Plan included discussion of three potential alternative mitigation projects in New York. Following the release of public notice and review, the USACE New York District requested that Algonquin prepare a final mitigation plan with detailed information on one of the proposed mitigation options.  To meet that request, Algonquin has prepared this Proposed Mitigation Plan for AIM Project Facilities in New York (“New York Plan”), describing the onsite wetland restoration and mitigation efforts and the offsite Junior Lake Enhancement Project in Yorktown, New York (“Junior Lake Project”). The Junior Lake Project is an offsite wetland, riparian and upland buffer enhancement project designed to create forested habitat in a wetland in a former manmade pond and reduce competition for native tree and shrub species through invasive plant species removal efforts. This New York Plan is organized based on the Planning and Documentation requirements described in 33 CFR, Part 332.4(c). MITIGATION PLAN OBJECTIVES The objective of this Plan is to offset impacts to wetlands affected by the AIM Project facilities located in New York. No permanent loss of wetland area will result from installation of the AIM Project pipeline facilities; however, approximately 23.9 acres of wetland will be temporarily impacted during project construction and 0.83 acre of wetland will be permanently cleared of trees. All wetland areas impacted by the Project will be permanently restored to wetland conditions.  As further detailed in Table 1, there are three basic types of wetland impact from construction of the AIM Project. There will be temporary impacts to scrub/shrub and emergent wetlands within the existing and new right-of-way (“ROW”) during construction (including mowing, temporary excavation, equipment matting, etc.). There will also be temporary impacts to forested wetlands outside of the permanent ROW from clearing and construction activities in temporary work spaces (“TWS”).  Finally, there will be permanent conversion of a small area of forested wetland to other wetland types within new ROW. These areas will be restored as wetlands, but due to safety considerations and the requirement to maintain a primarily treeless corridor over the pipeline, portions of the wetlands will be maintained in a non-forested state.  TABLE 1 Summary of Wetland Impacts for AIM Project Facilities in New York  Impact Type  Acres of Impact  Proposed Mitigation  Permanent Wetland Fill  0  None  Temporary Impacts to PEM and PSS (from construction and TWS)  16.78  Onsite Restoration to pre-construction conditions  Temporary Impacts to PFO Wetlands  (from clearing and construction for TWS)  7.12*  Onsite Restoration to pre-construction conditions (including tree planting, as necessary)  Permanent Conversion Impacts to PFO (from permanent for new ROW)  0.83  Offsite Mitigation: Junior Lake Enhancement Project  *this acreage includes the 0.83 acres of permanently converted PFO  Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 4 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 2.1 Compensatory Mitigation Sequencing Mitigation sequencing includes the design steps taken during project planning and implementation that are meant to find the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative to achieve a project need. In planning for the AIM Project, Algonquin sought to avoid wetland impacts, however due to the area of work required to achieve the project needs, total avoidance of impacts was deemed unfeasible. Next, Algonquin employed efforts to minimize wetland impacts to the greatest extent, including collocating with existing facilities, minimizing workspace in wetlands and implementing best management practices for construction. Following efforts to avoid and minimize impacts, Algonquin developed this New York Plan to offset unavoidable wetland impacts. This sequencing is further described in the following sections. 2.1.1 Avoidance  Most of the AIM Project has been designed to fit within Algonquin’s existing ROW, with a majority of the project consisting of removal of an existing pipe and replacement with a new pipe in the same location (known as “take-up and relay” or “T&R”).  On the east and west sides of the AIM Project crossing of the Hudson River, collocation and L&R within existing corridors was not feasible and a new section of ROW is required. An analysis of alternatives for this route was performed based on achieving the project need while avoiding and minimizing impacts to wetlands and streams. Several alternatives were reviewed prior to selecting the proposed route. Due to residential, commercial and industrial development, feasible alternative corridors are limited in this area. The proposed section of new ROW avoids wetlands to the greatest extent practicable, however, some wetland impact and new PFO clearing was required to achieve connection to the existing ROW.  The Project in this area (west of the Hudson River) will result in 0.83 acres of permanent, forested wetland conversion; of that, 0.75 acres are relegated to one large wetland (B13-SPLR-W16), with the remaining 0.08 acres in sections of four other forested wetlands along the new ROW (further described in Section 4.1).  2.1.2 Minimization  To minimize impacts at wetland and waterbody crossings during construction, operation and maintenance, Algonquin will construct the Project in accordance with the best management practices outlined in its AIM Project Erosion and Sediment Control Plan (“E&SCP”) and with all federal and state regulations and permit requirements.  The AIM Project E&SCP was developed using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) Upland Erosion Control, Revegetation, and Maintenance Plan and Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures and the Wetland and Waterbody Construction and Mitigation Procedures (“FERC Procedures”).  Also reflected in the AIM Project E&SCP is Algonquin’s significant experience and practical knowledge of pipeline construction and effective environmental protection measures.  Lessons and insights gained from past construction projects have been incorporated into the AIM Project E&SCP.  Algonquin also sought to minimize workspace in and near wetlands to the extent practicable. Due to the environmental and safety measures standard in current pipeline installation methodologies (e.g., adequate space to allow for topsoil segregation and storage, and to maintain safe working and travel distances from pipeline installation equipment,) additional TWS is needed along the existing and permanent ROW during construction.  For both in-ROW work space and TWS, implemented best management practices include, wherever practical: Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 5 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT  A reduction of construction corridor widths (e.g., the typical construction ROW width is 100 feet but in wetlands it is generally reduced to 85 feet when practicable);  A 50-foot setback for additional TWS for wetlands;  Minimization of riparian clearing to the extent practicable while ensuring safe construction conditions;  Expedited construction in and around wetlands;  Confinement of stump removal to the trench-line to minimize soil disturbance (unless safety or access considerations require stump removal elsewhere);   Return of wetland bottoms and drainage patterns to their original configurations and contours to the extent practicable;  Permanent stabilization of upland areas near wetlands as soon as practicable after trench backfilling to reduce sediment run-off;  Segregation of topsoil in unsaturated wetlands to preserve the native seed source (which will facilitate re-growth of herbaceous vegetation once pipeline installation is complete);  Utilization of recommended seed mixes as specified by relevant land management agencies;  Periodic inspection of the construction corridor during and after construction;  Post-construction wetland monitoring to evaluate the progress of wetland revegetation; and  Documentation of invasive species prior to construction and post-construction monitoring to compare pre- and post-construction occurrences. 2.1.2.1 Design Modifications – Fall 2014 A fall 2014 redesign of the entry/exit point for the horizontal direction drill (“HDD”) under the Hudson River allowed Algonquin to reduce temporary wetland impacts by 0.10 acre by avoiding a small PEM wetland on the west side of the river. 2.1.3 Compensatory Mitigation There will be no permanent loss of wetland as a result of construction of the AIM Project Facilities in New York; however, there will be approximately 23.9 acres of wetland impact, the majority of which will be temporary in nature. The goal of the mitigation plan is to mitigate and off-set temporary and permanent impacts and alterations to wetland functions and values affected by the AIM Project.  Compensatory mitigation will be accomplished through onsite mitigation and restoration and an offsite mitigation project, further described in Section 3.0. MITIGATION SELECTION 3.1 Onsite Mitigation 3.1.1 Restoration within existing and permanent ROW Within the permanent ROW, final restoration (including final grading) of PEM and PSS wetlands will be completed within 20 days after the trench is backfilled, weather and soil conditions permitting.  In conjunction with backfilling and restoration of segregated topsoil, all construction debris will be removed from the ROW.  The ROW will be seeded within six working days following final grading, weather and soil conditions permitting.  Wetlands will be treated in one of two ways, they may be seeded with a quick-growing and inert cover crop (e.g., winter rye [Secale cereale],) or they may be left uncovered to allow native seed stock in the restored topsoil to grow and proliferate. Any soil disturbance that occurs outside the permanent seeding season or any bare soil left unstabilized will be mulched in accordance with the AIM Project E&SCP. Additionally, Algonquin will conduct post-construction maintenance and monitoring of Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 6 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT the ROW in affected wetlands to assess the success of restoration and revegetation and to provide data for suggesting additional remediation efforts. 3.1.2 Restoration of PFO in Construction-affected TWS Onsite restoration for temporarily converted PFO wetlands will include restoration within small areas of forested wetland located in TWS outside the permanent pipeline ROW.  Restoration will include select replanting efforts, as necessary, combined with invasive species control and post construction monitoring. The details of the replanting plan will be finalized following final restoration of these TWS areas in PFO wetlands. Plant species that readily resprout from stumpage (e.g., red maple) will be allowed to grow in place. Where construction has removed stumps or where resprouting does not appear feasible or likely, a plan will be initiated to re-establish the PFO to a similar species composition and density as existed prior to construction, or, if difficult to ascertain, to a composition and density similar to adjacent, reference PFO wetlands. When planting, Algonquin will seek to install 1.5 times the pre-construction number of trees cleared from each wetland (rounded up to the nearest whole number).  3.2 Offsite Compensatory Mitigation 3.2.1 Mitigation Opportunities Search The Department of Defense and Environmental Protection Agency Joint Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources; Final Rule (Fed. Reg. Vol. 73, No. 70, April 10, 2008) established this hierarchy of preferred wetland mitigation options for impacts to USACE-regulated wetlands:  1. Mitigation Banks 2. In-lieu-fee Programs 3. Permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation (developed using a watershed approach) a. On-site and/or in-kind permittee-responsible mitigation b. Off-site and/or out-of-kind permittee-responsible mitigation. For smaller scale, secondary impacts such as this, mitigation banks or in-lieu-fee programs often provide the most logical choice for mitigation. These types of compensatory mitigation accept fees from applicants with smaller impacts and pool those assets to fund larger projects with higher ecological value. However, there are no established mitigation banks or in-lieu-fee programs currently in effect in southern New York State. Therefore, Algonquin began evaluating options for compensatory mitigation. In 2013 and 2014, Algonquin met with the USACE New York District and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (“NYSDEC”).  The USACE requested compensation for certain impacts, agreeing to on-site mitigation for temporary impacts but requesting off-site mitigation for permanent conversion of forested wetlands. The USACE suggested that off-site mitigation be “in-kind” (i.e., of the same wetland type) and should be located in the same watershed as the impacts (Algonquin and USACE New York District meeting minutes, January 13, 2014).  Thus, Algonquin is proposing on-site mitigation for temporary impacts and off-site compensation for permanent PFO conversion impacts. During early Project discussions, the USACE suggested reaching out to New York municipalities along the Project route for assistance in finding suitable, nearby off-site compensation opportunities. The Town of Yorktown responded to Algonquin’s outreach request by suggesting that Algonquin meet with the Yorktown Wetland Planner (“Wetland Planner”). Algonquin talked with the Wetland Planner and requested a listing of potential mitigation opportunities that met some of the following criteria: contains forested wetlands; contains degraded or impacted wetlands; offers opportunity for wetland restoration or enhancement; town-owned; and/or has been noted by the Wetland Planner as having important natural Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 7 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT resources or providing important wetland values. The Wetland Planner presented Algonquin with approximately seven possible properties in Yorktown. In July 2014, representatives from Algonquin met with the Wetland Planner and the Yorktown Town Supervisor and toured several sites. In August 2014, Algonquin prepared and submitted to the USACE the “Addendum to the Conceptual Mitigation Plan: Compensatory Mitigation Plan for New York Facilities”.  This plan contained preliminary details on three conceptual offsite mitigation options in the Town of Yorktown, New York (the potential projects were named Mill Pond, Sparkle Lake and Junior Lake1).  In August, and pursuant to the outline in the Addendum, Algonquin performed detailed site investigations of the three offsite mitigation options. Mill Pond is an approximately 7.9-acre parcel of land on a former manmade pond that drained several years ago when a dam failed during a storm event. The site offers opportunity for wetland, stream and upland buffer enhancements, but there is a significant population of invasive plants on the site (e.g. mile-a-minute vine [Persicaria perfoliatum), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Phragmites australis, etc.] and the property has a complicated ownership history and status. Sparkle Lake is an approximately 3.3-acre, town-owned property below the dam of Sparkle Lake. The Sparkle Lake site offer an opportunity for forested wetland restoration/enhancement that would primarily be achieved through an intensive herbicide-driven Phragmites and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) control program, followed by planting and monitoring. The extent of the invasive species control necessary for this wetland (which sits within a residential setting) may be difficult to permit given the proximity to streams and homes, and the many vectors present for continued invasive species colonization. Junior Lake is an approximately 3.4-acre site with a manmade pond and wetlands, and a fringe of riparian trees and shrubs. The site is located within Memorial Park, a recreation park of the Town of Yorktown. Enhancement opportunities at the park include forested wetland enhancement in a wetland peninsula of the pond that is currently dominated by purple loosestrife. There are also opportunities for mixed forest and shrub wetland enhancement in some seasonally flooded, sediment-formed terrestrial wetland areas within the pond, and opportunity for enhancements of the riparian wetlands and upland buffers around the pond. While seeking alternative off-site mitigation options in the region (primarily Westchester County, in the lower Hudson River watershed), Algonquin also reached out to representatives of agency and nongovernmental organizations in the region. Algonquin’s outreach included contacts with the Natural Resource Conservation Service (“NRCS”); Soil and Water Conservation Districts in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, and Dutchess Counties; Ducks Unlimited; the Westchester Land Trust (“WLT”); the Rockland County Division of Environmental Resources; the Watershed Agricultural Council (“WAC”); and the Dutchess Land Conservancy to request assistance and suggestions for any known or potential forested wetland mitigation opportunities in or adjacent to Westchester County or the lower Hudson River watershed. Of these contacts, only the WLT and WAC could suggest a potentially suitable mitigation opportunities within their service area.  WLT provided Algonquin representatives a tour of the Hunter Brook Preserve, an approximately 46-acre, primarily forested parcel of land in Yorktown, New York located west of and along Hunter Brook. WLT is working to restore trees to a stretch of the riparian floodplain and wetlands on the western bank of Hunter Brook, and are planning future projects designed to curb erosion concerns and invasive species control elsewhere on the property. While this option appears potentially suitable, the extent of the mitigation credit potential is currently unknown and WLT’s immediate priorities for the site include work outside of forested wetland and riparian habitat restoration. WAC has been involved with a small replanting effort on the southwest corner of the riparian area of Junior Lake and is also as supporter of WLT’s efforts at Hunter Brook Preserve. WAC works with landowners, municipalities and farmers on environmental education and water quality improvement projects within the watershed of the New York City drinking water supply watershed (including Westchester County). WAC is privy to some privately-owned riparian areas for which WAC would potentially welcome financial 1 Known as “Junior Pond” in the addendum, Algonquin has since learned that the town refers to this as “Junior Lake”. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 8 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT support for riparian plantings and protection, but they are not aware of strictly forested wetland restoration or enhancement opportunities that could be used by outside entities for mitigation.  In recognition of its inherent ecological value, its proximity to the Project area, its location within the watershed of the Croton Lake Reservoir, its high likelihood of success, and its potential for forested wetland habitat enhancement and wetland buffer restoration, Algonquin proposes the Junior Lake site as the preferred site for off-site compensatory mitigation for the AIM Project facilities in New York. Details and an environmental baseline for the site are provided in Section 4.3. BASELINE INFORMATION 4.1 Baseline Information: AIM New York Facilities Within the existing confines of Algonquin’s existing maintained permanent ROW easement in the AIM Project area in New York, the wetlands are primarily characterized as palustrine emergent (“PEM”) wetlands generally dominated by the invasive grass Phragmites australis.  There are also several pockets of palustrine scrub/shrub (“PSS”) wetlands within and along the edges of the existing ROW, mostly dominated by speckled alder (Alnus incana), highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), spice bush (Lindera benzoin), northern arrowwood (Viburnum recognitum), southern arrowwood (Viburnum dentatum), and silky dogwood (Cornus amomum) and the invasive species discussed below. Outside of the maintained ROW, wetlands are generally characterized as palustrine forested (“PFO”) wetlands, with common trees including red maple (Acer rubrum)¸ yellow birch (Betula allegheniensis), black birch (Betula nigra), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), and American elm (Ulmus americana).  All wetland and many upland areas along the Project routes through New York show signs of invasive species infestation both on and off the ROW. Within the wetlands needed to be permanently converted from forested cover types, notable invasive plants include common reed, Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum), Asiatic bittersweet (Celastrus orbiculatus), and multiflora rose. Additional information on the baseline environmental condition of the AIM New York facilities is available in the attachments for the USACE/NY Joint Application for a Section 404/10 Permit, submitted to USACE in March, 2014. 4.1.1 AIM New York Facilities Wetland Impacts 4.1.1.1 Temporary Impacts to PEM and PSS Wetlands from Construction Approximately 16.78 acres of temporary impact will occur in PEM and PSS wetlands from Project construction. These impacts include temporary disturbance to soil, hydrology, and vegetation. These impacts may result in temporary changes in current wetland functions and values of the impacted area; however, the physical and hydrologic composition of the impacted wetland areas will be restored following the completion of construction. 4.1.1.2 Temporary Impacts to PFO Wetlands from Construction and Clearing in TWS Clearing of approximately 6.29 acres of PFO wetlands will be required for the establishment of TWS adjacent to the existing permanent ROW to facilitate construction of the new pipeline.  TWS generally consists of areas disturbed parallel to and within the pipeline ROW that are not planned to be permanently maintained.  TWS also includes small “bump-out areas” along the project ROW that are used for equipment staging on either side of difficult or dangerous construction areas where additional staging room is required (e.g., steep slopes, roads, streams, wetlands, etc.). These bump out TWS will not be permanently maintained, they are also commonly referred to as additional temporary work space (“ATWS”). For the Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 9 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT most part, Algonquin has sited the TWS to avoid wetlands, however in some circumstances and locations, placement of the TWS in wetlands is unavoidable. In general, the impacts to wetlands from creation of TWS are minimal and temporary in nature. In many instances, conversion in wetlands due to TWS will include removal of one or a few trees from any individual PFO wetland. These minor, and discrete conversion impacts generally take place in a very small portion of the remaining PFO wetland outside of the ROW. During construction, unless grading is required for safety reasons, wetland vegetation will be cut off at ground level, leaving existing root systems and stumps intact. This methodology will promote stump sprouting and improve short- and long-term soil stabilization.  4.1.1.3 Permanent PFO Wetland Conversion for Creation of New ROW No loss of wetland area will result from the AIM Project. The primary long-term impact to wetlands from the Project will be permanent conversion of 0.83 acre of PFO wetland to PSS and PEM wetland for new ROW. All of the permanent conversion wetland impacts occur in the Town of Cortlandt, Westchester County, New York, where new ROW is being acquired for the project. Of the 0.83 acres of PFO wetland conversion, 0.75 acres will occur within a single wetland: Wetland B13-SPLR-W16.  The remaining 0.08 acres of forested wetland conversion will occur within Wetlands B13-SPLR-W50, B13-SPLR-W202, and B13-SPLR-W205. Three of these wetlands are located within the fenced portion of the Indian Point power production facility; the fourth wetland is located adjacent to electric transmission ROWs associated with a large electrical substation. These wetlands and their functions and values are further detailed in Table 2. 4.2 Baseline Information: Junior Lake Wetland Enhancement Site 4.2.1 Location The Junior Lake Wetland Enhancement Site (“Junior Lake site”) is located northwest of the corner of Halyan Road and Edgewater Street in the Town of Yorktown, Westchester County, New York. Maps of the site are included as Figures 1 and 2. 4.2.2 Watershed The Junior Lake site is fed by a small stream channel that flows through the property and into Hallocks Mill Brook, north of Junior Lake. The watershed of Hallocks Mill Brook is approximately 7,200 acres, Hallocks Mill Brook drains into Muscoot River and then to the Croton Reservoir (EDC, 2007). The Croton Reservoir is a component of the public drinking water supply system for New York City (EDC 2007). 4.2.3 General Site Description Junior Lake (actually a small pond) is located within Memorial Park, a town-owned parcel. East of the pond, the park includes a playground and a public swimming pool owned and operated by the town. The eastern and southern edges of the pond are buffered with shrubs and herbaceous wetland plants, with mature trees at the southern end. There is a narrow strip of trees on the west side of the pond, with a maintained, mowed lawn beyond the trees. There is an approximately 0.34-acre of area southwest of the pond where the Croton Trees-for-Tribs program sponsored a planting effort designed to restore some woody species to the riparian zone of the wetland. Many of the smaller planted shrubs and trees installed during that 2012 effort have succumbed to deer browse. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 10 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 11 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT TABLE 2 AIM Summary of Permanent Forest Conversion Impacts  Wetland Name  Area Converted (Acres)  Wetland and Crossing Description  Principal Functions/Values*; those underlined may be lost or altered  Discussion of Functions/Values Lost or Altered by Conversion  B13-SPLRW16  0.75  This is a large wetland that transitions from forested to scrub/shrub and emergent and occurs partially within existing, maintained electric transmission and pipeline ROWs.  The new Project ROW crosses through forested portions of this wetland in three areas, generally, adjacent to an existing cleared electric transmission corridor. There are large pockets of common reed throughout this wetland.  Groundwater recharge/discharge; floodflow alteration; sediment/toxicant retention; nutrient removal; wildlife habitat; uniqueness/heritage  The wetland will continue to provide the functionality of wildlife habitat; however the composition of species that utilize the wetland for habitat (i.e., shelter and food) may change with the removal of overstory vegetation in the areas required to be permanently maintained. All trees, including red maple and chestnut oak, must be removed from the wetland within the new permanent corridor footprint over the pipeline. This function will not be significantly impacted because of the size of the overall wetland. There are several acres of forested wetland that extend beyond the proposed construction ROW and that will remain undisturbed.  B13-SPLRW50  0.05  This partially forested and partially ponded wetland is located partially within a former sand/gravel extraction area, and hydrology is backed up and by an earthen berm at the southern end. There is a large infestation of common reed dominating parts of this wetland. The Project ROW will cross through the outer edge of a small portion of this larger wetland. This wetland resides within the fenced-in property of the Indian Point power production facility.  Groundwater recharge/discharge nutrient removal; sediment/shoreline stabilization  The ability of the wetland to provide these functions will not be impeded or reduced by the proposed conversion to scrub/shrub or emergent.  B13-SPLRW202  0.03  This wetland contains poorly drained soils, a diffuse intermittent stream and a primarily forested canopy with little understory.

Secondarily may provide: sediment/toxicant retention and nutrient removal.   The ability of the wetland to provide or potentially provide these functions will not be impeded or reduced by the proposed conversion to scrub/shrub or emergent.  *Functional Assessment performed pursuant to The Highway Methodology Workbook Supplement: Wetland Functions and Values: A Descriptive Approach (USACE, 1999)  New and Take-Up & Relay Pipeline Segments Junior Lake Project Existing Algonquin Natural Gas Pipelines FigurLocate 1ion HUC-10 Watersheds Created: Sources: ESRI Projection: NAD83, UTM Zone 18N US Survey Feet, Grid North. 12/16/2014 0.26 Acres 0.05 Acres Phragmites Removal Area Junior Lake was constructed in 1927 by a private resident who dammed the stream (Postcripts 2010). Pond hydrology comes from an unnamed, perennial stream channel (NYDEC Class B stream – 6 NYCRR part 935)that runs south to north and enters the park under the Halyan Road bridge. The stream originates in a forested wetland approximately 0.75 mile south of the Junior Lake site. After crossing under Halyan Road, the stream runs approximately 100 feet through a narrow, mixed forested and shrubby wetland before draining into the pond.  The enhancement area is east of where the stream enters the pond. The dam is located on the north end of the pond. The land northwest of the pond is vegetated with a mix of trees and shrubs, and there is a patch of the invasive grass, common reed, to the west of the dam. The extents of the pond were historically larger than they are today. The enhancement area has been slowly filling in by sediment released during housing and road construction over the last few decades and presumably through erosion of the stream channel itself due to increased stormwater runoff. Development and sedimentation has slowed in recent years (B. Barber, personal communication). The islands formed by the sediments have stabilized, but have become overrun with purple loosestrife. The purple loosestrife is forming a monoculture to the detriment of native species, wherein the shading the loosestrife provides is preventing the establishment of woody plants.  4.2.4 Dominant Vegetation Dominant trees around the pond include red maple and willow species (Salix sp.). Within the proposed PFO and PSS enhancement area, some native sedges and forbs (e.g. Carex stricta, C. cyperinus, Alisma triviale, Solidago spp., and Polygonum spp.) comingle with the dominant, invasive purple loosestrife. Along the frequently ponded portions of the enhancement site, black, pussy and goat willow (S. nigra, S. bicolor and S. caprea) grow in patches as well. Between the enhancement area and the playground, a hedgerow of shrubs provides a buffer. A line of cattails (Typha latifolia) creates a vegetated buffer along the eastern shore of the pond, between the pond and the public pool. 4.2.5 Invasive Plant Species As noted, the enhancement area is dominated by purple loosestrife. There are also several large multi-flowered rose bushes mixed in with native shrubs and broadleaved cattails along portions of the pond edge. Northwest of the pond is vegetated with a mix of trees and shrubs, and there is a patch of the invasive grass Phragmites, west of the dam. There are also some examples of Asiatic bittersweet growing on the western side of the pond and intermingled sporadically throughout the riparian fringe habitat. 4.2.6 Current Functions and Values Functions and values were assessed pursuant to USACE (1999); a copy of the functional assessment checklist and descriptors of the indicators is included in Attachment 1. The principal functions of the enhancement area and adjacent pond at Junior Lake are fish and shellfish habitat, wildlife habitat and uniqueness/heritage (due to proximity to public park and schools).  Wildlife habitat is limited within the wetland due to lack of structural diversity and food sources, thus adding berry and nut-producing tree and shrubs in this enhancement area will increase the wetlands ability to provide wildlife habitat. The fish and shellfish functionality of the site will be improved as well, due to increased shading and thermal regulation from the trees, and due to the additional filtering capabilities provided by the planted species. The uniqueness/heritage value of the park will remain unchanged, however the introduction of visually pleasing shrubs such as red osier dogwood may enhance the aesthetic appeal of the enhancement area. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 14 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 4.2.7 Photographs  (all photographs taken between July and October, 2014) Facing south across PFO planting area into hummocks of purple Facing southeast across PSS/PFO enhancement area past the southern loosestrife. end of the pond. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 15 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Facing southeast toward purple loosestrife-dominated area of Facing northeast across the pond from western shore. PSS/PFO enahncement site. Facing northwest across PSS enhancement area near edge of pond.

Onsite restoration provides 1:1 compensatory mitigation for temporary impacts associated with the project. There will be approximately 0.83 acres of unavoidable, permanent change in wetland functions and values due to permanent conversion of PFO wetlands to PSS and PEM wetland types. The primary functionality altered will be wildlife habitat, due to removal of overstory vegetation along certain portions of the new ROW. The proposed compensatory mitigation for these alterations is via wetland and buffer enhancements at Junior Lake, which includes planting effort to establish trees and shrubs in currently herbaceous invasive species-dominated wetland area. Planting and invasive species control at the park will enhance the wildlife habitat of the park by providing stratigraphic, nesting and food source diversity. TABLE 3 Wetland Mitigation Credits  Offsite Mitigation Activity Type  Acres  Mitigation Ratio  Mitigation Acre-Credits Provided  Mitigation Acre-Credits Required for PFO Conversion Impacts  PFO Enhancement a  1.08  1.5:1  0.72  -  PFO Riparian Supplemental Planting  0.34  3:1  0.11  -  Riparian PFO/PSS Buffer Enhancement b  0.97  5:1  0.19  -  Total  1.02  0.83  a removal of invasive plants and installation of trees and shrubs b  invasive species control  MITIGATION WORK PLAN 6.1 Onsite Restoration: Temporary Impacts to PEM and PSS Following construction, segregated topsoil, subsoil, site contours, and surface hydrologic patterns will be replaced to pre-construction conditions, thereby promoting the re-establishment of hydrophytic vegetation. Construction may result in some temporary short-term changes in current wetland functions and values of the impacted area; however, PEM and PSS wetlands impacted during construction will be restored quickly after initial impacts (i.e. within 20 days after the trench is backfilled where weather permits) and allowed to recover following construction. These restoration measures, in combination with the mitigation measures described elsewhere in the mitigation plan and in permit application documents previously submitted, will provide full, in situ replacement of any temporary impacts to wetland functions and values.  6.2 Onsite Restoration: Temporary Impacts to PFO Onsite restoration for temporarily impacted PFO wetlands will include restoration of approximately 6.29 acres distributed amongst several wetlands where they are located in TWS outside the permanent pipeline ROW.  Algonquin is proposing to restore these impacted PFO wetlands to pre-construction, forested conditions of similar species composition. Thus, the functions and values of the cleared PFO wetlands will be fully restored in place following construction.  Assessing the overall impact from these minor clearing Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 19 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT impacts will require assessing as-built conditions, in order to fully ascertain the area and number of mature trees removed from each wetland area. The site replanting plan will be finalized following final restoration of these TWS areas in PFO wetlands. Plant species that readily resprout from stumpage (e.g., red maple) will be allowed to grow in place. Where construction has removed stumps or where resprouting does not appear feasible or likely, a plan will be initiated to re-establish the PFO wetland to a similar species composition and density as existed prior to construction, or, if difficult to ascertain, to a composition and density similar to adjacent, reference PFO wetlands.  6.2.1 As-Built Planning The quantity of plants restored in the temporarily cleared PFO wetlands will be determined based upon comparison of pre- and post-construction conditions. Prior to clearing, trees within permitted TWS of each PFO wetland will be tallied. Information to be collected in the study will include percent aerial coverage by trees in the TWS; tree species present; number of each species present; and presence, type and extents of invasive species [e.g. sparse (1-10% aerial cover), moderate (10-50%) or dominant (>50%)]. For this study, the term “trees” will include all living woody, non-vine vegetation over six inches in diameter-atbreast height (approximately 4.5 feet above ground level). Invasive tree species (e.g. Acer platanoides, Ailanthus altissima) will be noted but not counted for replacement. Following clearing, the pre-construction data will be compared with post-construction conditions to determine how many trees were actually cleared from each wetland. Only trees that are cut off at the stump will be counted and restored (i.e. limbed or trimmed trees will not be included). The difference between pre- and post-construction tree data will provide the basis for post-construction restoration work, including planting specifications (i.e., species, number of plants, etc.) and invasive species control. 6.2.2 Planting Guidelines When replanting is deemed necessary based on the pre- and post-construction assessment, the following guidelines will be followed by the landscaping contractor:  Native, locally-sourced plant materials will be used.  All trees will be potted nursery stock, at least 24-inches tall.  Each planted tree will be surrounded with a clean, organic mulch layer (at least four inches thick) or commercially available, slowly biodegradable weed suppression material with a radius of at least four-feet centered on the plant.   Rodent and deer guards will be placed around each tree, to a height of at least 12 inches above the ground. 6.2.3 Invasive Species Control and Management The mitigation area invasive species plan will follow the guidance of the AIM Project Invasive Control Plan (Appendix G of the USACE/NY Joint Application Form 09/10 for a Section 404/10 Permit, submitted to USACE in March, 2014).  For the purposes of onsite restoration of temporarily cleared forested wetlands, the goal of invasive species control will be to prevent target invasive species from climbing, choking, girdling, crowding, or otherwise negatively affecting the success of planted and resprouting trees in the restoration areas. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 20 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 6.3 Offsite Mitigation Workplan 6.3.1 Invasive Species Management Purple loosestrife in the enhancement area: The Junior Lake enhancement area currently has a robust population of purple loosestrife that is dominant throughout most of the area to be planted. Mature clumps of loosestrife plants are growing on hummocks of presumed tussock sedge (Carex stricta) and loosestrife seedlings are present throughout the flooded pond fridge area. Due to the proximity of the pond and frequent flooding, application of herbicide is not being proposed at this time. The soil is soft enough and the site is small enough for hand removal to be an effective initial control solution for purple loosestrife. Initial control of the purple loosestrife will allow the planted woody species growth time to shade out and control the spread of the invasive plants. Prior to planting trees and shrubs, purple loosestrife will be hand-cut or pulled, bagged and removed from the site. Care will be taken to remove the entire root mass of the plants in order to discourage resprouting. During site monitoring, to take place in late summer prior to the loosestrife going to seed, flower heads will be removed from any remaining purple loosestrife plant on the site.   Woody invasive plant species around the pond: Mixed in with the thick bordering vegetation around the pond is pockets and individual examples of woody invasive species. Most notably present are multi-flowered rose and Asiatic bittersweet. During the initial planting effort then during the once per year annual monitoring period these species will be hand cut at ground level and removed from the site. Patch of common reed in the wetland on the northwest corner of pond:  This stand will be cut and mulched in place in spring and again in fall; the few native shrubs that are growing within the patch will be avoided and left in place. Native tree species will be planted within the former patch. Trees will be surrounded with burlap covered by mulch and the understory will be thickly planted with quick growing grasses. The common reed will be cut back from the trees at least two times per year. Broadleaved cattails between the pool and the pond: The cattails are relegated to small stand along eastern edge of the pond. They are not a dominant feature and provide habitat for red-winged blackbirds and refugia for other species of birds, aquatic insects, mammals, and amphibians. No control or eradication plans are being proposed for this small stand. 6.3.2 Planting Specifications Native plants have been chosen that tolerate a range of hydrologic conditions and exposure that provide wildlife food sources, that are not preferred deer browse, and that tend to grow quickly. Table 4 provides additional detail on species, quantities, approximate location, and stocktype. For stocking and planting the woody species, the following specifications will be adhered to:  Native plant species will be use;  All trees will be potted nursery stock, at least 48-inches tall;  Shrubs will consist of a mix of potted nursery stock and live stakes; and  Plants will be installed as directed by Algonquin’s wetland specialist who will flag out planting locations and be on hand during installation to oversee installation and make recommendations for placement and adjustments. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 21 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT TABLE 4 Targeta Wetland Plant Specifications for PFO and PFO/PSS Enhancement Area  Common Name  Scientific Name  Plant type  Minimum Height at Planting (inches)  Number  Trees:  red maple  Acer rubrum  Potted/burlap  48  75  black willow  Salix nigra  Potted/burlap  48  75  yellow birch  Betula allegheniensis  Potted/burlap  48  50  silver maple  Acer saccharinum  Potted/burlap  48  50  black gum  Nyssa sylvatica  Potted/burlap  48  50  balsam fir  Abies balsamea  Potted/burlap  48  25  sycamore  Platanus occidentalis  Potted/burlap  48  25  Total  350  Shrubs:  buttonbush  Cephalanthus occidentalis  Potted/burlap  24  25  pussy willow  Salix discolor  Live stake or Bare Root   24  100  red osier dogwood  Cornus sericea  Live stake or Bare Root   24  100  willow wattles  Salix sp.

However, rack lines indicate that the stream provides fairly consistent source of branches and organic debris, and this material is anticipated to be regularly deposited. Additionally, 25 bundled willow wattles will be staked into place around the site in the more flood prone areas of the enhancement site to help provide additional structural heterogeneity, provide some immediate sediment retention and provide opportunities for additional woody plant growth. 6.3.4 Buffers The Yorktown Parks Commission maintains an approximately 10 foot, uncleared/unmowed buffer between the pond and the mowed areas of the park on the east side of the wetland and pond. Algonquin will continue to work with the Parks Commission to establish long-term protocols for setbacks and maintenance. A Croton-Trees-for-Tribs sponsored riparian planting area in a section of the upland on the southwest side of the pond is currently protected and unmowed, and the vegetated strip around the remainder of the pond will remain in place. The shrub layer maintained around the pond and enhancement area will provide both wildlife habitat and a visual buffer for the habitat. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 22 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 6.3.5 Schedule Dependent up on AIM Project initiation and seasonal timing (for planting), this New York Plan will be implemented during or immediately following Project construction. Monitoring will be begin during the first growing season after implementation. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS 7.1 Onsite Mitigation Success of the onsite mitigation efforts will be determined based on achieving a trend toward restoration of forested conditions in the temporarily cleared TWS areas in wetlands. This trend will be assessed based on survivorship of planted and stump-sprouted tree species in these areas and achievement of pre-construction tree stem density and/or percent aerial cover by trees. In calculating this assessment, all trees over three feet tall located within the cleared TWS in the wetland will be counted. Reporting requirements are discussed in Section 8. 7.2 Offsite Mitigation Site Success of the offsite mitigation site will be calculated based on survivorship of the planted woody species, control of the invasive species and a trend toward a forested overstory in the PFO enhancement areas with an understory of shrubs in the PFO/PSS planting zones. These criteria will be assessed by completing stem counts and charting the percent aerial coverage of native woody species in the enhancement areas.  The project success goal for the enhancement areas will be 75% aerial cover during the growing season by native woody species; with at least 50% survivorship of planted tree species.  MONITORING REQUIREMENTS 8.1 Monitoring Reports Onsite and offsite mitigation will be described in a single, annual monitoring report. The monitoring procedures and reports will be completed by a field scientist experienced in wetlands, wildlife biology, invasive species control, horticulture, and/or wetland restoration. Mitigation monitoring reports will be submitted to the district engineer on or by December 31st of the year of the inspection. Monitoring reports will include the following elements:   A restatement of the goals, objectives and performance standards for the compensation site plan.  A narrative summary of the results and conclusions of the monitoring.  Identification of any structural failures or external disturbances on the site.  A description of management activities and corrective actions implemented during the past year.  A summary of and full presentation of the data collected during the past year.  An assessment of the presence and level of occurrence of invasive species.  A vegetative cover map sketch (actual, not proposed) of the mitigation site.  Photographs showing all representative areas of the mitigation site.   An assessment of the degree to which performance standards are being met.  Proposed corrective actions to attain performance standards.  The first year monitoring report will also include: o As-built plans; o Description of problems encountered during site establishment and corrective actions; and o Follow-up corrective actions and schedule for implementation. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 23 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT 8.2 Monitoring Schedule 8.2.1 Onsite Mitigation Monitoring Onsite restored PFO wetlands will be monitored for the first four years following pipeline construction and ROW restoration, or until the success criteria are achieved (whichever comes first). 8.2.2 Offsite Mitigation Monitoring The Junior Lake Enhancement area will be monitored for five years, starting during the first growing season after planting. The site will be monitored twice during the first year (early and late in the growing season) then once during subsequent years.  LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT PLAN Algonquin will monitor the Junior Lake mitigation site for the first five years following implementation. The Yorktown Parks and Recreation department provides onsite and regular routine review of the project site during their normal park maintenance activities. They will be provided contact information for Algonquin’s wetland mitigation management team and advised to contact the team to report any concerns with the enhancement area. MAINTENANCE AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT Potential maintenance activities include plant replacement, pruning dead or broken branches, invasive species control, and herbivory control. Follow-up and corrective actions will be discussed and documented in each year’s monitoring report. For example, if invasive species are not effectively being controlled through mechanical means, Algonquin will seek to permit alternate methods, including natural and/or chemical herbicide application. Additionally, if certain planted woody species are not performing as well as others, the poorly performing species may be replaced by a different species. For both onsite and offsite mitigation, replanting (as necessary) will begin in the third growing season after initial planting. The replanting effort will seek to achieve the project goals through installation of species determined to be successful through the initial seasons. All planted species adaptations and remediation (including number of plants installed) will be reported in the annual monitoring report of the year during which the work takes place.  OFFSITE MITIGATION SITE PROTECTION  The Junior Lake site is a designated parkland in the Town of Yorktown, see Figure 1.  In New York State, the Public Trust Doctrine requires state legislative approval “when there is a substantial intrusion on parkland for non-park purposes…..” Parkland in New York is inalienable under this public trust doctrine.  Thus, the Junior Lake parcel already is inalienable parkland in perpetuity and cannot be converted to a non-park use without the consent of both the New York State Senate and Assembly.  Algonquin would obtain an access agreement with the Yorktown Department of Parks & Recreation in order to plant the trees and carry out the other mitigation work described above. Algonquin will monitor the compensatory mitigation project for five years after completion of the work. Mitigation Plan for AIM New York Facilities 24 ALGONQUIN INCREMENTAL MARKET PROJECT Figure 1. Junior Lake Park. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES The estimated cost for performing the compensatory mitigation activities described herein ranges from $200,000 to $250,000. Spectra’s current market capitalization is currently estimated at over $22 billion.  These figures demonstrate that Spectra is more than financially capable of undertaking the mitigation activities, and thus provide a  high level of confidence that the compensatory mitigation project will be successfully completed in accordance with applicable performance standards. REFERENCES EDC (Environmental Design Consulting). 2007.
